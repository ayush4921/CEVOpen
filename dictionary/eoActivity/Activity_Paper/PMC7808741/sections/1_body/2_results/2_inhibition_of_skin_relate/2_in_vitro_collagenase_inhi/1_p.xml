<p>Evaluation of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-collagenase activity of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. extracts and isolated compounds was performed using FALGPA as substrate and measuring the collagenase (ChC) activity by the decrease in absorbance at 405 nm due to FALGPA hydrolysis as described in Materials and Methods – 
 <italic>Anti-collagenase Activity Assay</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref> represents the results obtained for the organic extracts, expressed as percentage inhibition, revealing a mild to high ChC inhibitory activity, ranging from 28% to 76%, compared with EGCG used as positive control.
