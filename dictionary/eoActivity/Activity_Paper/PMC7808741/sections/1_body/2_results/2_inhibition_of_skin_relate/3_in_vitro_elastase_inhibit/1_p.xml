<p>The anti-elastase activity of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. extracts and isolated compounds was evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using SANA as substrate and detecting the formation of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline at 405 nm resulting from SANA hydrolysis, as described in the Materials and Methods - 
 <italic>Anti-elastase Activity Assay</italic>, using ursolic acid as positive control. Results of the enzymatic assay concerning the organic extracts from 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. plants are expressed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>, revealing in general very weak elastase inhibitory activity.
