<p>To better understand the observed results, an additional assay was performed to evaluate which natural products present in the organic and aqueous extracts could be responsible for the exhibited anti-tyrosinase activity. Thus, previously isolated compounds from both organic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. were tested for their ability to inhibit tyrosinase 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>, and the results obtained are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>.
