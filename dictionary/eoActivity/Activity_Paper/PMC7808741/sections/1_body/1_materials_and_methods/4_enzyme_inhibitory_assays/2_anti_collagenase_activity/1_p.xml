 <italic>N</italic>-[3-furyl-acryloyl]-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala (FALGPA) 0.1 mM was dissolved in tricine buffer 50 mM (pH 7.5) supplemented with 400 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) and 10 mM calcium chloride (CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) (assay buffer). Collagenase was prepared in the assay buffer at 1 U, knowing that 1 U hydrolyses 1 mol of FALGPA per minute, at 25 °C, in the presence of calcium ions. EGCG at 40 M was used as positive control with reported IC

 </xref>, and the sample solvent (DMSO 0.3% v/v in tricine buffer) as the negative control. The assay mixture containing 80 L of tested samples (100 g/mL) and 100 L of collagenase was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before starting the reaction by adding 20 L of FALGPA. The assay was performed in triplicate. Absorbance of FALGPA was read at 405 nm for 10 min, continuously, in a microplate reader (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Results were expressed as percentage inhibition (%), according to
