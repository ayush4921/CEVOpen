<p>The aqueous extracts were obtained from 10 0.010 g of the aerial parts of dried and powdered plants in 150 ml of bi-distilled water (Milli-Q) after microwave-assisted extraction for 3 min at a continuous irradiation of 2.45 GHz. The aqueous extracts (7 samples) were filtered and separated into 1 ml aliquots (in triplicate) for freeze-drying and frozen at −20 °C. After freeze-drying, the extracts were weighted and stored at 10 mg/mL in bi-distilled water (Milli-Q) at −20 °C. The amount (dry weight) of each plant extract and yields according to solvent and extraction methodology are shown in
