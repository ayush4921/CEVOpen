<p>This study represents a primary evaluation of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. extracts and isolated compounds as potential antioxidant agents capable of inhibiting the skin-related enzymes tyrosinase, collagenase and elastase, for the synergistic treatment of skin disorders, namely ageing, sagging and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Organic and aqueous extracts of several 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. plants, as well as their isolated compounds (
