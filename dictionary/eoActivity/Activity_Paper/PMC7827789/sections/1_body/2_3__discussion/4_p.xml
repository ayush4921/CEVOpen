<p>The most prominent differences in the presence and content of the six secondary metabolites were recorded between distinct plant parts, which is in accordance with the rich literature data on the distribution of main chemical compounds in gentians [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Secoiridoids are predominantly present in the belowground plant parts but can also be found in aboveground parts at a prominent level [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Isoorientin and isovitexin are the most frequently found 
 <italic>C</italic>-glucoflavones in 
 <italic>Gentiana</italic> sp., confirmed in all representatives of a genus [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Flavonoids are a large group of phenolic compounds with pronounced antioxidant and chelating effects, and their ultraviolet-absorbing properties are an important adaptive feature at higher altitudes [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The accumulation of flavonoids occurs in the preflowering period and then reaches the maximum value during flowering [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Iridoids and secoiridoid glycosides have a primarily defensive function against herbivores and pathogens and can be detected in different plant organs [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The high amount of these compounds in belowground organs, which is found in all ontogenetic stages for gentians [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], may imply a response to specific biotic pressures. However, more information regarding species autecology (i.e., photosynthesis, morphology, biotic interactions) would provide a better understanding of plantâ€“environment relations among gentians [
