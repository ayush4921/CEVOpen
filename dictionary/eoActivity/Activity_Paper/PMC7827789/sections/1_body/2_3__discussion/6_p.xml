<p>Roots are recognized to be able to synthesize and accumulate a diversity of secondary metabolites in response to environmental stressors [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and significant variability between the root and shoot defensive chemicals may be caused by habitat conditions [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In reviewing the root/shoot differences regarding the secondary metabolites, Rasmann and Agrawal [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] pointed that (1) compounds present in aboveground parts are most often present in roots; (2) considering their surface area and exposition to belowground herbivores, roots are pronouncedly chemically defended; and (3) even though differential allocation to aboveground and belowground parts is not completely clarified, it depends on the plant family, species, genotype, and ontogenetic stage of tissues.
