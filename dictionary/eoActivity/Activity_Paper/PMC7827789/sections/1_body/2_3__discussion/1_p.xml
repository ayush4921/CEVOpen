<p>Information on the chemical composition of essential oils and extracts obtained from 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> has been provided in numerous publications, mostly aimed at evaluation of their biological activities [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The volatile profile of flowers and leaves was reported for the natural population of willow gentian [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and Kozuharova et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] suggested that specific secondary metabolites may have an important role against seed predators. However, information about locality-dependent differences and inter- and intrapopulation variability based on speciesâ€™ phytochemistry has not been reported to date.
