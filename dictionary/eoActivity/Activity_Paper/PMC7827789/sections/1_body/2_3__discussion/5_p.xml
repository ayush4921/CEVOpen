<p>For a large number of phytochemically investigated plants, specific secondary metabolites have been determined exclusively or predominantly in a particular organ, and most of the differences in the quantitative and/or qualitative composition of secondary metabolites are reported between the below- and aboveground plant parts [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Different chemical compositions of below- and aboveground plant parts arise from the different environmental pressures to which they are exposed. The secondary metabolites predominantly present in aboveground plant organs have multiple functions, as pollinator attractants (volatile attractants in flower petals) [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], for seed dispersal (esters in fruits) [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], toxic and repellent functions against herbivores and pathogens (phenolic glucosides, furanocoumarins, tannins in aerial parts, alkaloids in nectar) [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and in protection against abiotic factors (flavonoids in epidermal tissues for UV protection) [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In belowground parts of the plant, the most important function of secondary metabolites (e.g., emodin) is a defense against herbivores that can seriously damage or destroy the root and consequently the whole plant [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but their allelopathic and self-regulating functions are achieved as well (phenolic acids, flavanols, flavones, flavanones, anthocyanins) [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Regarding the pharmacological activities of a plant species, the “medicinal part” of a plant is usually indicated either in pharmacognostic literature or ethnopharmacobotanical sources [
