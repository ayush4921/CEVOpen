<p>The phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> based on six representative secondary metabolites showed differences in chemical profiles among populations from different mountainous sites. Due to its absence in Vlasina populations, SWZ was the most prominently indicative of the chemical fingerprint of the plants related to the geolocation. Further research is warranted to clarify the occurrence of this compound in earlier developmental stages of Vlasina populations. The contents of other studied compounds (SWM, GP, MF, ISOOR, and ISOV) significantly differed concerning the study site. Different accumulations of analyzed secondary metabolites between above- and belowground plant parts mostly contributed to the separation of groups by PCA. This study confirms the organ-specific distribution of specific secondary metabolites, which is probably directed by different environmental pressures to above- and belowground plant parts. Moreover, it points to the indicative value of the studied compounds for the phytochemical profiling of populations from specific locations.
