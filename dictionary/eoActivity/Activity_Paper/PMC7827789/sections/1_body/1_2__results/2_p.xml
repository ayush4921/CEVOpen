<p>The impacts of three factors (location, population, and plant part) on dependent variables (contents of secondary metabolites) are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00140-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The applied model for nested ANOVA is highly significant for each analyzed property (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; not shown). It is noticeable that for each property, there are statistically significant differences only between plant parts (above- and belowground). For half of the examined properties, there are differences between localities (Golija and Vlasina), while none of the properties show statistically significant differences between populations.
