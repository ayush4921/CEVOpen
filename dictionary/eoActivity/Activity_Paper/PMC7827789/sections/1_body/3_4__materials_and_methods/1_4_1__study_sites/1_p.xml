<p>The Vlasina Plateau is located in southeastern Serbia (42°43′55″ N, 22°19′18″ E) at an altitude of over 1200 m, surrounded by the mountains of Rhodope massif: Bukova glava, Čemernik, Plana, and Vardenik. Mountains around the plateau are very rich in springs that form streams and smaller rivers, and along with watercourses from the plateau, they flow into the Vlasina Lake located in the center of the plateau. Edaphic factors are determined by topography (plateau and surrounding mountains) and soils (peat and district brown forest soils). The climate is humid and submountainous, with cool summers and very cold winters. Lake Vlasina and the surrounding area are classified in the first protection category—Outstanding Natural Landscape “Vlasina”—due to the exceptional richness of flora and fauna, both freshwater and terrestrial (under state protection since 2006). The vegetation of the area is a unique mosaic of meadows, pastures, and high-altitude forests (birch, beech, pine, and juniper).</p>
