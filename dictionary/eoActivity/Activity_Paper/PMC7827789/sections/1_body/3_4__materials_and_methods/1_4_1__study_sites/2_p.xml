<p>Golija Mountain is part of the Dinaric mountain range, situated in southwestern Serbia (43°20′16″ N, 20°16′36″ E), with the highest peak Jankov kamen at 1833 m. Climatic patterns in this area are moderate continental; in higher zones (over 1300 m), the climate is mountainous with severe winters with high snow cover and short summers. Overall edaphic, hydrological, and climatic conditions and the refugial character of many habitats lead to a great diversity of flora and fauna, which is the reason for a high degree of protection within the Golija–Studenica Biosphere Reserve, the first UNESCO-MAB registered biosphere reserve in Serbia (2001). Golija is the most forested Serbian mountain, with the largest, best-preserved, and highest-quality forest complexes, with primeval forest patches. Deciduous and deciduous–coniferous old-grown forests (beech, oak, beech–fir, and beech–spruce) predominate along the elevational gradient, and above 1700 m, only spruce is represented.</p>
