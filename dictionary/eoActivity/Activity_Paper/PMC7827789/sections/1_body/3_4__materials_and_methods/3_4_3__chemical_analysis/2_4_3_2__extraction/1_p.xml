<p>Each sample of 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> was divided into aboveground and belowground plant parts (A—stems, leaves, and reproductive parts, B—roots and rhizomes) and analyzed separately. Air-dried samples were ground to a fine powder (250 mg) and extracted with 5 mL of methanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. After sonication, extraction was continued by maceration for 48 h in the dark at room temperature. The extracts were filtered into 5 mL volumetric flasks, adjusted to the volume with methanol, and stored at 4 °C until use for HPLC analysis.
