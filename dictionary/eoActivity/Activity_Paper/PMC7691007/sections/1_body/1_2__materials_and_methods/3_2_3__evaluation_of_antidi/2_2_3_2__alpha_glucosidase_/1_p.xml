<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activities of extracts were determined according to the method described by Bljajić et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] adapted for 96-well microplates, using 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase from 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> type I (Sigma-Aldrich, US) and p-nitrophenylglucopyranoside (pNPG, Sigma-Aldrich, US) as the substrate. The solution of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase was prepared at 0.5 U/mL by dilution of a 9 U/mL stock solution. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mg of pNPG in 1 mL of phosphate buffer (0.07 M, pH 6.8). Aliquots of 62 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of phosphate buffer and 12 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase solution were added to 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of varying concentrations (3.25–800 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of the extract or acarbose (2 mg/mL in DMSO 1%). The microplate was preincubated at 37°C for 5 min. Then, 16 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of substrate (pNPG) solution was added to start the reaction. The microplate was homogenized and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. A negative control was prepared using the same procedure replacing the extract with DMSO solution (1%). The absorbances were read at 405 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. Percentage of enzyme inhibition by the extract (or acarbose) was calculated using the following equation:
