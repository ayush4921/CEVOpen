<p>Five different solvents of increasing polarity were individually used for the preparation of extracts, including n-hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, and water. One hundred grams (100 g) of each powder was macerated in 500 mL in the corresponding solvent for 48 h under mechanical stirring. The resulting mixture was vacuum filtered through Whatman filter paper N 1. The obtained organic filtrates (except aqueous filtrate) were evaporated under low pressure using a Buchi R210 evaporator at 40°C. The resulting extracts were subjected to a 40°C drying in an oven for 24 hours to remove the residual solvent. The aqueous filtrates aliquots of 20 ml were dried in an oven at 40°C for 5 days in stainless plates (30 cm diameter).</p>
