 <italic>(1) Determination of Antioxidant Activities</italic>. Three methods were used to determine the antioxidant potential of various extracts: total antioxidant capacity (TAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity. For this purpose, a stock solution of each plant extract was prepared at a concentration of 2â€‰mg/mL in DMSO 1%. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
