<p>The total flavonols content (TfnC) was assayed using the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> method according to Awah et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] adapted for a 96-well microplate format. The calibration curve was established with rutin (0–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Briefly, 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the plant extract or rutin solution was mixed with 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (20 mg/mL in ethanol, HPLC grid). After 5 min, 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium acetate solution (50 mg/mL in ethanol, HPLC grade) was added to each well. The blank was prepared by replacing the extract or rutin with distilled water. The absorbance of each mixture was read at 440 nm after 2 h 30 min of incubation in the dark and at room temperature, using an ELx800 microplate reader. The amount of flavonols in plant extracts was derived from the calibration curve and expressed in mg equivalents of rutin per gram of dry extract (mg RUE/g).
