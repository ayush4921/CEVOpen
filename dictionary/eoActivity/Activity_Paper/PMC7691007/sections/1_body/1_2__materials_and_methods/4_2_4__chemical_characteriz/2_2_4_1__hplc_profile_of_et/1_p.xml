<p>HPLC analyses were performed on different ethyl acetate extracts. It was used to determine the gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and tannic acid proportions in the ethyl acetate plant extracts. The HPLC system used (Shimadzu 20 AD, Japan) consists of an ultraviolet detector, a binary pump, a 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L injection loop, and Shim-Pack GIST C18 (150 mm × 4, 6 mm i.d. × 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) column. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents, namely, acetonitrile, HPLC grade (solvent A), and formic acid (1% in deionized water), HPLC grade (solvent B). The elution gradient was established as follows: 0 min (5% A and 95% B), 0–21 min (5–20% A and 95–80% B), 21–30 min (20–25% A and 80–75% B), 30–32 min (25–100% A and 75–0% B), 32–39 min (100–100% A and 0% B), 39–40 min (100–5% A and 0–95% B), and 40–45 min (5–5% A and 95% B). The flow rate of this mobile phase was 0.7 mL/min.
