<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) of extracts was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method as described by Horszwald and Andlauer [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] adapted for 96-well microplates. A calibration curve was established with gallic acid (0–50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (90 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) (Sigma) diluted 10 times with distilled water was mixed to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract or gallic acid solution. A 7% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (90 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was then added followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for 60 min. The blank solution was prepared as above, replacing the extract or gallic acid with distilled water. The absorbance was read at 765 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. The amount of phenolic content was derived from the calibration curve and expressed as mg equivalent of gallic acid per gram of dry extract (mg GAE/g).
