 <italic>(3) Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power</italic>. The method of Vijayalakshmi and Ruckmani [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] using K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> adapted on 96-well microplates was used. The calibration curve was established with ascorbic acid (0–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Volumes of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide solution (1% w/w) were, respectively, added to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract or ascorbic acid. The mixtures were incubated in a waterbath at 50°C for 20 minutes. The microplate was removed from the waterbath, and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/w) was added into each well, and then left standing for 60 min. The supernatant (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was diluted with 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of freshly prepared ferric chloride (0.1% w/w) was added. The reducing power of each well was investigated through the transformation of Fe 
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe 
 <sup>2+</sup>, and its absorbance was measured at 700 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values of plant extracts were derived from the calibration curve of ascorbic acid and expressed as the equivalent of ascorbic acid.
