<p>The total flavonoids content (TFC) was assayed using the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> method as described by Laloo and Sahu [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] adapted for 96-well microplates. A calibration curve was established with rutin (0–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) (10% in distilled water) was added to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract or rutin solution. After 5 min, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of sodium acetate solution (1% in distilled water) was added to each well. The total volumes were adjusted to 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L with distilled water, followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for 15 min. The blank solution was prepared as above, replacing the extract or rutin by distilled water. The absorbance was read at 415 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. The amount of flavonoids in plant extracts was derived from the calibration curve. Flavonoid content was expressed in mg equivalents of rutin per g of dry extract (mg RUE/g).
