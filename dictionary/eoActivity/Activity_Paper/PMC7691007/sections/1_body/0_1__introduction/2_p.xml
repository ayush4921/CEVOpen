<p>Previous scientific reports demonstrated that extracts from this plant have many biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], hematopoietic potentiating [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], antibacterial, antifungal [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], antisecretory, gastroprotective, and antiulcer [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and that they also enhance steroidogenetic and spermatogenetic activities [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a previous research work in our laboratory, we demonstrated that the administration of 
 <italic>Phragmanthera capitata</italic> aqueous extract to diabetic rats significantly decreased hyperglycaemia at the dose used by the herbal medicine doctors. It showed hypolipidemic and immunomodulatory effects as well [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the water extract from 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> showed no toxic reactions, no change in behavior, and no mortality at a dose of 3000 mg/kg and 5000 mg/kg in mice and Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while acetone, methanol, ethanol, and water extracts showed not toxic (lethal concentration &gt; 1 mg/mL) in Brine shrimp hatchability assay. Hence, the solvent extracts from this plant can be further explored for the development of plant-based pharmaceuticals drugs [
