<p>This parasitic plant is a real problem for crops. Thus, several methods using synthetic herbicides have been developed to eradicate it without much success. Chemical control has side effects on the environmental pollution and food health [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given its multiple biological properties, this plant could be exploited as a phytomedicine and deprived of its host for this reason. In addition, one of the major problems faced by the phytomedicine is the unavailability of rigid quality control profiles for herbal materials and their formulations [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the solvent effect is an important parameter for phytomedicine standardization, allowing selection of a suitable solvent for herbal processing. The studies of Ohikhena et al. [

 <italic>P. capitata</italic> growing on rubber tree. The standardization of extracts is necessary to guarantee the desired properties at all times. Indeed, plant extract composition and biological activities may vary due to climatic differences, phenological stages, soil composition, and environmental stress. Additionally, for some plants, chemo varieties and chemo cultivars may exist [
