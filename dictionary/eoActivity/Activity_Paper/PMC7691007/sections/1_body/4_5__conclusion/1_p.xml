<p>In this study, the effect of the extraction solvent, host plant, and phenological stage on phytochemical compounds, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities of 
 <italic>Phragmanthera capitata</italic> were investigated. Our results show that the extraction solvent, host, and phenological stages significantly affect the phenolic content, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>. Out of the five solvents used for extraction of phytochemical compounds from the vegetable material, ethyl acetate was the most suitable solvent for optimum recovery of the phenolic, flavonoid, and flavonol compounds of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>; while ethanol and methanol were the most suitable for tannins. Among host plants, the total phenolic, flavonoid, flavonol, and tannin contents of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extract from 
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> and 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> were significantly higher than those of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extract from 
 <italic>Podocarpus mannii</italic>. Better total antioxidant and antidiabetic activities were found with 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> growing on 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>. Moreover, both phenolic compounds and antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> appeared higher during flowering and fruiting. The HPLC profile of the ethyl acetate extract showed that it contains gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and tannic acid, which could be related to the biological properties of the plant. The phytochemical composition and HPLC profile revealed the dynamic accumulation of phenolic compounds and established a basis for determining the best solvent and phenological stage for harvesting of the plant to improve the content of beneficial compounds in the phytomedicine from 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>.
