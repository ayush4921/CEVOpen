<p>As a mistletoe, 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> is capable of penetrating the living tissue of the host plant's stems and branches to extract the necessary resources for their survival. For this purpose, this parasitic plant uses haustorium induced by host-derived phenolic compounds to penetrate host tissues [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It depends on its host for water, nutrients, and some carbon compounds. It is also suggested that active compounds may pass from the host trees to the parasitic plants [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the parasitic plant is able to synthesize its own secondary metabolites to fight against the resistance of the host [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This bilateral relationship may justify the differences in composition of phenolic compounds, and therefore the difference in the inhibition of glycolytic enzymes observed about the three host plants, which have different physiological and photosynthetic behaviors, and they differently react to infestation by 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>. This is in accordance with the results of [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] who showed that 
 <italic>Viscum album</italic> (European mistletoe) exhibited different levels of total phenolic acids and antioxidant activity when parasitizing different host species. In addition, it is important to mention that Dibong et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Persea americana</italic>, with 9.38% abundance and 21.51% parasitism, is more susceptible to 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> than 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>guajava</italic> with 4.12% abundance and 35% parasitism in Cameroun. This shows that the two plants possess two different mechanisms of defense that can justify the qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic contents and activities of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> collected on these two host plants.
