<p>Solid-liquid (plant powder-solvent) extraction was used in this study, for which the constituents of the plant are transferred to the solvent with a speed and efficiency which depended on the polarity, viscosity, and corrosive properties of the extracting solvent [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this light, the extraction yield of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> was higher with polar solvents, namely, water, methanol, and ethanol, methanol being the best. Methanol, an amphiphilic solvent, with low viscosity and density, has the ability to weaken cellular structures, penetrate, and diffuse into the plant cell to solubilize a large range of molecules in the plant cells, mostly polar ones but also a large portion of nonpolar [
