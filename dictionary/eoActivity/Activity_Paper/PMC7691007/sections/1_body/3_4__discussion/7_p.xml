<p>The levels of secondary metabolites in plants can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of development of the plant [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Phenolic compounds, which are one of the main groups of secondary metabolites, are not an exception. In the present study, it became clear that the total phenol contents increased significantly from the vegetative stage to the flowering stage and from the flowering stage to the fruiting stage. These results concur with those of Berezina et al. [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] who showed that the rate of production of phenolic compounds is lower in 
 <italic>Vaccinium macrocarpon</italic> plants during budding compared to flowering and fruiting stages. The increase in the total phenolic content during flowering may be attributed to flavonoids, which are responsible for the coloring of pollen and petals of flowers and which in some cases represent up to 4% of the dry weight of these flowers [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], since, in the present study, the evolution of flavonoids levels followed that of total phenols with a few exceptions. This is in agreement with the results of Medini et al. [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] which revealed that the total phenol content of 
 <italic>Limonium densiflorum</italic> increased at the flowering stage as compared to the vegetative one. Flowering and fruiting of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> occur during the raining season. Thus, both the hosts and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> are under favorable photosynthetic conditions (sunshine, abundance of minerals, and water) [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], boosting the rate of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in these plants [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, in this study, the rate of production of total tannins decreased from the vegetative phase to the fruiting stage, certainly passing to flowers. The main function of tannins is not only to ensure the protection of the plant against microbial pathogens, harmful insects, and other herbivores but also allow the reinforcement of plant tissues [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Plants rich in phenolics can also negatively modify the growth of neighboring plants by limiting the nitrogen supply. It can therefore be estimated that during the flowering of the fruiting body, this defense system in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> works less intensely.
