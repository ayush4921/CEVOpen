<p>Plants contain a wide range of active principle described as having hypoglycemic effects, mainly glycosides, alkaloids, hypoglycans, galactomannan gum, polysaccharides, steroids, peptidoglycan, guanidine, glycol peptides, and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Some of these principles are 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitors, and many studies have focused their attention on phenolic compounds as amylase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and as antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase are a key enzyme in digestion of starch, and as such, their inhibitors such as acarbose are used to control postprandial glycemic in type-2 diabetic [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Recent studies show a renewed interest in plant phenolic compounds as inhibitors of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the present study, the inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase was negatively correlated to yield for hexane (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.452, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), ethanol (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.497, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and methanol (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.487, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) extracts, indicating that high yield is associated to low IC
 <sub>50</sub> and consequently high inhibition (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The inhibitory capacity of the hexane extract was not correlated to any phenolic content, a suggestion that the active principles in these extracts are not phenolic compounds. This was not the case with glucosidase that reveals a positive correlation between extraction yield and enzyme inhibition for methanol extracts (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.485, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, for this extract, a negative correlation was observed between IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.694, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and TfnC (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For the ethyl acetate extracts, the inhibitions of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase were negatively correlated with TPC (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.433, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and TfnC (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.496, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), suggesting that the active ingredients in these extracts could be flavonols. With ethanol extracts, the correlation between enzyme inhibition was negative for TFC (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.602, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and TfnC (−0,672, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), suggesting that the active principles could be distributed in these two groups of phenolic compounds. With the methanol extract, a negative correlation was highlighted between TPC (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.735, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and TfnC (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.746, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and the inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, whereas for 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, this correlation exists with TTC (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.616, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). For the aqueous extract, no correlation was highlighted.
