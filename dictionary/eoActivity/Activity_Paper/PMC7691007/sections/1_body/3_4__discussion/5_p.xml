<p>With ethanol and methanol extracts, inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase was positively correlated with FRAP (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.486 and 0.528, respectively, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), showing that the active compounds could also have ferric reducing ability. According to Asgar [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it is important to keep equilibrium between 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitors, which efficiently limits the gastrointestinal adverse effects related to undigested starch reaching the colon. 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extract that inhibited both 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase (except hexane extract) responding to this need. With lower IC
 <sub>50s</sub>, the activities of the extracts on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase were more pronounced, and this has varied with the extraction solvent. IC
 <sub>50</sub> of methanol and ethyl acetate extracts were negatively correlated to these properties for TPC and TfnC. This shows that the compounds which inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase are different from those which inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and are mainly effective in the flavonol group. 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> growing on rubber tree in Nigeria showed a weak 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition across all the solvent extracts and stronger 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition like our results [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The weak 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition by 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> grown on rubber in the previous study compared to our results may show the influence of the host plant and, to a lesser extent, the geographical conditions, and thus the importance of standardization.
