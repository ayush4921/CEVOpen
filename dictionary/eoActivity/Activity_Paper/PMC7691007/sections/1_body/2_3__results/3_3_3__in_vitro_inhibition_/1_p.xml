<p>The influence of the solvent, phenological stage, and host on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition by various extracts is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Extract from 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> collected on 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>guajava</italic> presented higher inhibitory activities (low IC
 <sub>50</sub> compared to acarbose whose dose-activity is showed in Supplementary material) at vegetative and fruiting stages. With 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>mannii</italic>, this inhibitory activity increased significantly during flowering and more at fruiting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). Ethyl acetate, methanol, and hexane extracts had the best inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase.
