<p>The solvent that best extracted the tannins from 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> was ethanol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(d)</xref>), which exhibited significantly higher extraction capacity than methanol and water. With these three solvents, the rate of tannins decreased significantly during fruiting in all extracts, regardless of the host of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>. With hexane and ethyl acetate, the tannin levels were low and decreased significantly during flowering except when the host was 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>, for which these levels remained constant during flowering and during fruiting.
