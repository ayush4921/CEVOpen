<p>HPLC profiles of ethyl acetate extracts showed a dynamic accumulation of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> according to the phenological stage and host plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The chemical composition of the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> grown on 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic> was relatively the same before and during flowering. Indeed, during the vegetative stage, quercetin appeared as the main constituent, while during flowering, rutin replaced quercetin as the main constituent. The main differences between these two plant hosts appear during fruiting. At this stage, while tannic acid was highly synthesized in replacement of rutin in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> growing on 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic>, rutin remained the most abundant constituent on 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>mannii</italic>. Ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> collected on 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> presented a relatively stable chemical composition at the three phenological stages, but very different from what was observed on 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>. The main constituent of this extract was not identified.
