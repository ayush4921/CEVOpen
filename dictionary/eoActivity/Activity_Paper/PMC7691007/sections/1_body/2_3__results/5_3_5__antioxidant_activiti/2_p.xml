<p>The solvents that gave extracts with better reducing power, in the ascending order were ethanol, methanol, and water regardless of the phenological stage or the host plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Hexane and ethyl acetate gave extracts with worst reducing power (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). For all solvents, the general trend was a decrease in the reducing power during flowering of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> regardless of the host plant. On the other hand, with ethanol and methanol, the reducing power was higher before and during fruiting of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> growing on 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> and on 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>.
