<p>Ethanol and methanol provided extracts with stronger DPPH scavenging activity, close to that of ascorbic acid regardless of the phenological stage and the host plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>). With hexane and ethyl acetate, the 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extract had worst DPPH scavenging activity, and this activity was significantly weaker at the flowering stage of the plant. With water, DPPH scavenging activity of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extracts was intermediate to that of the extracts with solvents ethanol/methanol and ethyl acetate before and during flowering and significantly weaker during fruiting for all host plants. On the other hand, for all extracting solvents, DPPH scavenging activity of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extracts was not influenced by the host plant.
