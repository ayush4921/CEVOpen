<p>The total antioxidant capacity, DPPH scavenging, and FRAP activities in various extracts of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> varied according to the extraction solvent, the phenological stage, and the host plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The total antioxidant capacity of the 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> extracts by various solvents decreased significantly in the following order: ethanol and methanol, ethyl acetate and hexane, and water at all stages of development of the plant and plant host (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The total antioxidant capacity decreased significantly during flowering regardless of the host plant and the extraction solvent, even though that of the aqueous extract increased during flowering. Furthermore, with ethanol and methanol, the total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher before and during fruiting of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> growing on 
 <italic>P. guajava,</italic> followed by that of 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>.
