  <p>Evolution of antioxidant capacities of 
   <italic>Phragmanthera capitata</italic> extracts according to the phenological stage, host, and solvent of extraction. a, b, c, d, e: for the same phenological stage and host plant, means carrying different letters are significantly different (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Waller–Duncan test); A, B, C: for the same solvent and host plant, means carrying different letters are significantly different (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Waller–Duncan test), 
   <italic>α</italic>, 
   <italic>β</italic>, 
   <italic>γ</italic>: for the same solvent and host phenological stage, means carrying different letters are significantly different (
