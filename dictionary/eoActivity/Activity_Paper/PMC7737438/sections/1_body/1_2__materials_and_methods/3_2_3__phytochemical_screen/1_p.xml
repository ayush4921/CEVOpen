<p>Phytochemical screening of the SA extract followed the method of Farnworth [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and afforded flavonoids, triterpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and saponins. Flavonoids and triterpenoids were detected using Shinoda's test and the Liebermann–Burchard test. Cardiac glycosides, including the steroid nucleus, unsaturated lactone ring, and 2-deoxy sugar, were detected using the Liebermann–Burchard test, Kedde's reagent, and Keller–Kiliani test, respectively. The forth test was used to detect saponins.
