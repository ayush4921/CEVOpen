<p>Animal experiments and studies of the anti-inflammatory effects of SA on xylene-induced ear edema in mice indicated that SA has anti-inflammatory activity by reducing ear edema in a dose-dependent manner; however, the onset of action of SA is slower compared to diclofenac sodium. This study represents the acute anti-inflammatory effect of the SA extract in which innate immune cells form the first line of immune defense and regulate activation of adaptive immune responses. Most of the features of acute inflammation continue as the inflammation becomes chronic, including the expansion of blood vessels (vasodilation), increase in blood flow, capillary permeability, and migration of neutrophils into the infected tissue through the capillary wall (diapedesis) [

 <italic>P</italic> or antagonize its action in the inflammatory process. During the initial phase, also called neurogenic phase, substance 
 <italic>P</italic> and bradykinin are released. Substance 
 <italic>P</italic>, a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, induced nitric oxide releasing be the cause of vasodilation and plasma exudation [
