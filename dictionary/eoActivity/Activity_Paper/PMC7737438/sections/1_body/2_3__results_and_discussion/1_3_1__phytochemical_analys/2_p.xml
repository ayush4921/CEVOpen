<p>Phytochemicals in SA comprise cardiac glycosides [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], flavonoids, triterpenoids, and saponins, which might be responsible for the distinct anti-inflammatory activities of the extract [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Flavonoids are useful in acute inflammation [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and act by inhibiting arachidonic acid release, which is central in prostaglandin synthesis [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Triterpenoids may exert their anti-inflammatory actions by decreasing iNOS expression [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A previous study reported that 
 <italic>Streblus asper</italic> (SA), as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, significantly dose-dependently inhibited paw edema and reduced the mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
