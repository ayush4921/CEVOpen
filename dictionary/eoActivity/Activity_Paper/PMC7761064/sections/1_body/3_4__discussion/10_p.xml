<p>The most interesting results obtained in our research include those that indicate the highest repellent effects of caraway essential oil and L-carvon on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> at both the highest and lower applied concentrations, i.e., 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. The explanation for the mechanism of this phenomenon in insects requires further physiological and biochemical studies. Similar results were obtained with respect to other arthropod species, e.g., mosquitoes, biting flies, fleas and ticks, when applying repellents based on DEET and permethrin. DEET is a repellent with a wide spectrum of action against arthropod bites. Although the protection against arthropod bites provided by DEET is proportional to the logarithm of the dose, the higher concentrations of DEET ensure that the protection lasts longer; however, in the range up to 50%, concentrations above 50% do not increase the efficacy of DEET [
