<p>This article showed a strong repellent effect of both caraway essential oil and the compound present in a large amount (approx. 60%)—L-carvone—on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO was also found to be highly insecticidal. At the present stage of research, it can be said that both of these compounds are good candidates for practical applications in preventing the occurrence of this pest in storage areas, as well as in eliminating 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> by scaring cereals and food products from stored grain. Deterring 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> from products will reduce not only quantitative but also qualitative losses caused by contamination of the stored cereal grain, for example through dead individuals or excrement. The fact that 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> is a spice plant and therefore not toxic to humans is also not insignificant. Cumin EO and L-carvone could be used as repellants and insecticides as one element in an integrated pest management program against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>.
