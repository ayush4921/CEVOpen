<p>Elgizawy et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] also evaluated the contact, fumigant toxicity and repellent activities of 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> essential oil and two of its main active ingredients against adult 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. Essential oil, citral and D-limonene showed a strong contact toxicity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> with LD50 7.51, 7.75 and 29.57 µg/L, while the fumigation toxicity against LD50 was 4.44, 4.89 and 16.68 µg/L, respectively. Essential oil, citral and D-limonene showed repellent properties at 81.83 and 53.30% at 2 and 4 h after the start of the study, respectively.
