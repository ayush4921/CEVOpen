<p>Using an olfactometer, Yoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] analysed the repellent effects of six essential oils extracted from caraway, grapefruit, clary sage, strawberry, ylangylang and thyme white on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. They found the highest repellent activities in (96.7%) carvone with limonene in caraway oil. Again, caraway oil displayed a high repellent efficacy (91.7%) against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> in a 10-µL dose after 24 h. In the study presented here, caraway essential oil at 0.1, 0.5 and 1% resulted after 24 h in a higher repellent efficacy (98–99%). However, L-carvon at a 0.1% concentration showed a 85% repellence against rice weevil as early as after 5 h, and it was 100% after 24 h.
