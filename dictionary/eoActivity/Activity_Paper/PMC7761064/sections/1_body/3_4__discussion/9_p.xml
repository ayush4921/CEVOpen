<p>López et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also studied the effects of active substances contained in the essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> (carvon and limonene), 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> (linalool) and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> (estragol) on the populations of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>, 
 <italic>R. dominica</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptolestes pusillus</italic>. The most effective monoterpenoid against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> was carvon (1364 ppm) in combination with camphor (131 ppm), where 100% of the beetles were dead after 24 h. Other mixtures of active substances, whose main component was caraway oil, caused a high mortality in both rice weevils and the remaining two species (approx. 90–100%). Against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>, the mortality index in the application of linalool (1723 ppm) combined with camphor (185 ppm) reached 63%. Against 
 <italic>R. dominica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. pusillus,</italic> the mortality indexes were 96% and 100%, respectively. Estragol affected the activities of rice weevil in a variable and ambiguous way. López et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] emphasised that the principal active substances contained in the plants that were used, applied both separately or together with other substances, worked both as insecticides and as repellents against the tested storage pests.
