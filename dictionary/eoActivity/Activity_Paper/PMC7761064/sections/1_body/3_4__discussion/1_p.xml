<p>A number of plant products and extracts were tested as repellents against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> with the use of various research techniques and with variable efficacy [

 <italic>Duabanga grandiflora</italic> at a 0.252 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> concentration, where 63% repellence was reached. After 4 h, the efficacy of repellence against the weevil was 100% [
