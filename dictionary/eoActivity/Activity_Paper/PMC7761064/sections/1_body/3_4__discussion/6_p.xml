 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. leaf essential oil was also tested on adult 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> for contact and fumigation toxicity and for its effect on offspring production. 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> adults were very susceptible to fumigation activity, which amounted to LC50 11.36 mg/litre air. At a concentration of 40.5 mg/g food, the production of 
 <italic>S. oryzaeâ€™s</italic> offspring was completely inhibited [
