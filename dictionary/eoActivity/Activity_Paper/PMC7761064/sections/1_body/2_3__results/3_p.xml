<p>The number of emigrants (the beetles repelled by the caraway essential oil used in the experiments at the three concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1%) in each of the studied time intervals was markedly higher than that found in the control culture. After 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h, the highest number of beetles emigrating (respectively 24, 34, 39, 39 and 39) was noted after the effect of 0.5% caraway essential oil, and then after the application of 1% (respectively 21, 30, 35, 37 and 39) and 0.1% (respectively 15, 26, 31, 34 and 36). After 24 and 48 h, as many as 39 out of 40 beetles emigrated as an effect of the application of caraway oil at all the used concentrations. During the same time, only 5â€“7 beetles emigrated from the control culture.</p>
