<p>Of the three concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1%) used in the tests, the caraway essential oil caused the highest mortality among the 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> individuals when applied at a 0.5% concentration. A statistical analysis of the 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> mortality results showed statistically significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the mortality in the control culture and the culture using caraway essential oil at a 0.5% concentration (from 2 to 24 h). At concentrations of 0.1 and 1%, the oil did not result in the mortality of the insects throughout the initial five hours of the experiments. It was only after 24 h that the mortality of the rice weevil population treated by caraway essential oil at 0.5 and 1% concentrations amounted to about 100%, and it was very low among the emigrants, i.e., the mortality indices fluctuated from 0.6 to 1.1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00836-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The highest mortality among 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> was obtained after applying the caraway essential oil at a concentration of 0.5%, and not after applying the highest concentration used in the tests.
