<p>The caraway essential oil applied in all the used concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1%) resulted in a major repellent effect towards 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. After 1, 2, 3 and 4 h of study, the strongest repellence was confirmed by the highest values of the migration index, fluctuating from 60 to 98%, and was caused by the essential oil at a 0.5% concentration. In the control culture, the simultaneous emigration index fluctuated between 2 to 9%. After 24 and 48 h, the caraway essential oil in all the used concentrations resulted in very high emigration (repellence) among rice weevils. At that time, in the control culture, it amounted to only 13–19%. It was interesting to see that the highest repellence to 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> in the initial four hours of studies was exerted for both the highest applied concentration and a lower one, i.e., 0.5% (

A similar relationship was noted during the use of L-carvone: a 0.1% concentration resulted in the highest emigration of beetles (from 16 to 100%) in each of the analysed time intervals. The subsequent lower repellence (9–38%) was shown by L-carvone at a 0.5% concentration and then at a 1% concentration (7–22%) only after 1, 2, 3 and 4 h (
