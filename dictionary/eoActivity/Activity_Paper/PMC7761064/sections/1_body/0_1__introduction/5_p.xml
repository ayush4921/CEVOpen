<p>Recently, there has been an intensification of laboratory research on essential oils (EOs) and their ingredients in order to use their properties to control many pests of agricultural crops and horticulture, as well as pests of storage products. In many studies it was found that EOs and compounds isolated from them reduced egg laying and adult-stored pestsâ€™ emergence, increased their mortality, deterred pests from products and had repellent properties [

For instance, EO is composed of many different compounds whose mechanism of action prevents the evolution of pest resistance. Additionally, EOs are rarely toxic to mammals. They have a short shelf life and are therefore considered environmentally safe [
