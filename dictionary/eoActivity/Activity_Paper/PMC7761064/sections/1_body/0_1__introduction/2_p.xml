<p>The losses in world food production are enormous. At each stage of production, from producers to consumers, there are losses that constitute enormous “chains of losses.” It is estimated that 30–50% (1.2–2 billion tonnes) of produced food is lost each year [

 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] report that biotic factors (insects, mites, rodents and fungi) and abiotic factors (temperature, humidity) cause losses in the total harvest even reaching up to 60%. A large number of publications indicate that the greatest losses are incurred during storage, particularly in developing countries [

In developed countries, the over-production of food is frequent, and storing the surpluses creates favourable conditions for the development of pests. The damage during storage can either be direct (loss in the mass of products) or indirect (reduction in terms of a lower quality and nutritive value), in addition to a reduced grain germination capacity. Every year, 5–10% of produced food is lost during storage only [
