<p>In conclusion, the greatest repellent effects on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> were caused by lower doses of caraway essential oil and L-carvone, which is a new discovery related to plant compounds used against stored pests. This differs from the results that were so far obtained in relation to stored pests, in which repellency increased with increasing concentrations. Similar results to our research were obtained with respect to other arthropod species, e.g., mosquitoes, biting flies, fleas and ticks, when applying repellents based on DEET and permethrin.
