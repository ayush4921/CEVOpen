<p>Crude endophyte extracts from 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> displayed 47% cell reduction at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against A549 lung carcinoma cells. 
 <italic>P. putida</italic> TJ151 is able to produce fluorouracil which is a bioactive aromatic compound and it is an anticancer drug [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. L-methioninase, an enzyme produced by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida,</italic> has shown anticancer activity against leukemia cell lines, liver HepG2, breast MCF-7, lung A549, prostate PC3, and colon HCT116 [

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Methioninase from 
 <italic>P. putida</italic> and 5-fluorouracil work synergistically to inhibit tumor growth and hence the activity observed [
