<p>Cos et al. [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] state that a concentration of &lt;0.1 mg/mL for a crude sample is the ideal concentration for anti-infective bioassays whereas [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] recommend that crude samples with a concentration of 1.00 mg/mL and ≤100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (0.100 mg/ml) and ≤625 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml are considered to be very significant and moderately significant and therefore noteworthy for minimal inhibitory concentration. Stringent endpoints for anti-infective bioassays ought to be set to prevent false results and confusion, taking into consideration the sensitivity of extracts and test microorganisms, extraction methods, and solvents used [
