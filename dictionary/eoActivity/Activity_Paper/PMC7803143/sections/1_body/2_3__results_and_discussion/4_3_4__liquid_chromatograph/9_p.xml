<p>From the results obtained, varying retention times were observed between the leaves and bacterial endophytes samples, even though the same chromatography conditions were used. Factors such as the affinity of the compounds to the extraction solvents used [

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], and the formation of secondary metabolites complexes with extraction solvents used to influence the different retention times observed, as they create a sample matrix [
