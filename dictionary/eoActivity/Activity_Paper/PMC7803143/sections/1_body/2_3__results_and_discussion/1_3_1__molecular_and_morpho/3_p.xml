<p>Bacterial genera including 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> have been isolated as endophytes from leaves of medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These bacteria genera predominate in medicinal plants, as they assist the host plant in mineral nutrient composition and protection against abiotic and biotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The BLAST search conducted of the results of the 16S rDNA gene sequence revealed that the isolated endophytes belong to bacterial genera, such as 
 <italic>Raoultella</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Enterobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic>Arthrobacter</italic>, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This supports our observed results.
