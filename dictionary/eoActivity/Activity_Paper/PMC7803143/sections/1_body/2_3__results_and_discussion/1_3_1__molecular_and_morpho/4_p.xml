 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> are common bacteria associated with plants and have been isolated from a number of plant species and tissues. They display a positive effect on host plant growth such as reducing drought stress and producing plant hormones such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and acting as biocontrol agents [
