<p>To determine the shape and Gram stain reaction, a method described by Sandle [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used. Pure colonies were subjected to Gram staining to establish morphological characteristics such as shape and Gram stain reaction. Gram stain slides were observed using a compound bright-field microscope (OLYMPUS CH20BIMF200) with 1000x magnification.
