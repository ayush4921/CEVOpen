 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (ATCC10031), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 33420), and 
 <italic>Proteus aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC10145) were used. The antibiotic Streptomycin was used as the positive control and was prepared by weighing 0.032 mg in 1 mL of sterile distilled water while 0.1% DMSO was used as a negative control.
