 <italic>Crinum macowanii</italic> Baker is a medicinal plant native to east, central, and southern Africa [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The bulbs, leaves, and roots of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> possess medicinal properties and have been used traditionally to treat or manage animal and human diseases [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The different plant parts are used for chest pains, diarrhea, tuberculosis, and stimulate milk production in cattle and, thus, are overexploited and overharvested for medicinal purposes [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Biological activities of secondary metabolites are attributed to the components working in a mixture of compounds (synergy) as compared to when in isolation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; therefore, metabolite fingerprinting of crude endophytes extracts is vital in drug discovery. Morare et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Sebola et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported on the isolation of bacterial endophytes from the bulbs and the antibacterial activities of their crude extracts, leaving bacterial endophytes isolated from the leaves unexplored. Mixtures of natural extracts are effective in the search for new drugs since they reduce drug-resistant phenotype and hence this study was conducted [
