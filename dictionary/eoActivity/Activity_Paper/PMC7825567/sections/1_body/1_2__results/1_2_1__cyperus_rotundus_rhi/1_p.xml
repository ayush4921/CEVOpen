<p>To identify potent antifungal compounds, we used our in-house collection of medicinal-plant-derived compounds [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to screen against Candida species and 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic>. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and used at different concentrations in 96-well microtiter plates. Using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 method [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium at 37 Â°C incubation statically for 24 h, we identified a fraction (#84) derived from 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> rhizome as a potential antifungal source. An image of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> and the rhizomes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. Since fraction #84 was derived from water distillation of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizome and is known to contain EO, we focused on one of its major components.
