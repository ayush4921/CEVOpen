 <italic>C. auris</italic> is an emerging drug-resistant fungal pathogen that causes both skin and invasive infections. Since α-Cyperone inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> (fluconazole-resistant), we wanted to determine if this EO could also affect 
 <italic>C. auris</italic>. The Bioscreen-C growth monitoring system was used for this purpose. The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f005">Figure 5</xref>a suggest indeed that α-Cyperone prevented the growth of 
 <italic>C. auris</italic> at the concentrations used. We next asked if α-Cyperone could affect the growth of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. We used paper discs containing α-Cyperone (60 µg/disc) on a lawn of fresh cells. We did not see the inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial growth around the discs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f005">Figure 5</xref>b).
