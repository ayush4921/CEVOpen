<p>The antioxidant potential of plant extracts was examined using DPPH free radical scavenging assay as this method is the most widely used, acceptable and simple method. The antioxidant molecule present in plant extract transforms DPPH radical into a stable molecule by transforming hydrogen atom and or electron from its atom. This steady conversion resulted in a decrease in absorbance, and it indicates the scavenging potential of analytes (Kedare and Singh

 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic> showed potent DPPH radical scavenging activity with half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) close to that of reference ascorbic acid. The lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of each plant extract indicates their higher antioxidant potential. Moreover, the reducing power of these plant extracts was increased when we increased the concentration of extract.
