<p>The 3 D response surface and the 2 D contour plots described by the regression model are drawn to illustrate the effect of the independent variables and interactive effects of each independent variable on the response variables. The shape of the respective contour plots shows whether or not there are essential mutual interactions between the independent variables. The elliptical character of the contour plots shows that interactions were important between the independent variables. The ideal values and the corresponding response variables could be predicted by the 3 D response surface plots and the corresponding contour plots and each variable pair could interact. The maximum predicted value is designated by the surface-confined in the smallest ellipse in the contour diagram. The disturbance plots show how the response changes as each factor move with all other factors at the reference value from the chosen reference point.</p>
