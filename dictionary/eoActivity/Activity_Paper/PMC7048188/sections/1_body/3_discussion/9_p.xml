<p>Oxidative stress is the primary parameter that plays a crucial role in the development of methotrexate nephrotoxicity and thus several parameters associated with oxidative stress parameters were assessed in our study. Our developed polyherbal combination does ameliorate oxidative markers. Previous reports of reduction in the oxidative markers with
