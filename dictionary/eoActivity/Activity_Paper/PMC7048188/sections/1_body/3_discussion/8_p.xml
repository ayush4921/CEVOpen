<p>Scientific progress has led to the improvements of Ayurvedic polyherbal formulaions (PHFs) by studying multiple phytoconstituents and discovering beneficial combinations of herbs that work synergistically to generate a desirable result. Today, because of comparable efficacy, fewer side effects and better acceptability than allopathic drugs, the ‘renaissance’ of Ayurvedic PHFs is witnessed worldwide. They generate adequate impact and safety most of the moment, making them one of the drugs of choice that are extremely chosen. However, the insufficient understanding and misconception of the public about the safety of polyherbal formulation can lead to adverse effects, toxicity and unwanted interaction. The irresponsibility of manufacturers and inadequate regulatory control around the globe has also impacted the quality of produced herbal formulations, which can be hazardous to the health of customers. In this context, to decrease the hazardous risks, implement a good practice of strict regulatory control and public education on the proper use of PHFs, preventive and corrective action is much more essential. In this context, quality control analysis of any extract or herbal combination is necessary. In our study, we performed a chromatographic analysis of all extract to authenticate and to maintain its quality. HPLC fingerprinting analysis of combination was carried out for quality control analysis for its safety and efficacy. Similar chromatographic profiles ensure similar pharmacological activities. Boeravionone b (R
 <sub>t</sub> 11.44), emodin (R
 <sub>t</sub> 6.415), quercetin (R
 <sub>t</sub> 8.407) and lupeol (R
 <sub>t</sub> 16.181) are some common and specific markers of selected plant material were identified in the developed combination. The identification of these markers can be used for the pharmacokinetic profiling of combination. We have performed 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening of some specific markers with XO. These markers showed a higher affinity towards the selected protein, and this study supports its nephroprotective activity. Further, molecular research is needed to confirm its mechanism.
