<p>Flavonoids act as scavengers of various oxidizing species, i.e., hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion and peroxy radicals. However, flavonoid quenches of singlet oxygen also (Ratty and Das

 <italic>R. emodi</italic> [(132.48 ± 14.40) mg rutin/g dry extract wt.]. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are abundant and commonly found in nature. Flavonoids are categorized according to their chemical structure as flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, flavanones, chalcones, catechins and anthocyanidins. The pharmacological activities of flavonoids are closely related to their functional groups present in their structures.
