<p>A chromatographically characterized polyherbal combination from 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic>, 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic> was developed. The developed polyherbal combination showed significant antioxidant and XO inhibition potential in 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays and strong nephroprotective activity in methotrexate intoxicated rats. The developed polyherbal combination can be explored further for the management of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and other chronic kidney diseases.
