<p>For the optimization of extraction parameters, response surface methodology (RSM) was deployed. It is a collection of statistical techniques for designing experiments, building models, evaluating the effects of factors and searching for the optimum conditions. The RSM method determines the Taylor expansion curve surface that defines the response in terms of yield and antioxidant potential of extract (Alam et al.

 <italic>v/v</italic>) and the alcohol-water ratio (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were selected as parameters for optimization experiments. The effect of each parameter was evaluated initially using one factorial design. The selected levels for extraction time were 5 (−1), 6 (0) and 7 h (+1), for drug-solvent ratio (% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were 5 (−1), 8.75 (0) and 12.5% (+1) and for alcohol-water ratio (% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were 55 (−1), 62.5 (0) and 70% (+1), respectively. Different drug solvent ratios and alcohol-water ratios were screened for their maximum yield by keeping extraction time at a constant level 8 h. A 17 run experimental design having three central points were made according to Box-Behnken’s response surface design with above-selected parameters using Design Expert 8.0.1.7 software (Statease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Responses were measured in terms of antioxidant activity and extractive value (% yield). The point prediction tool of the software determined an optimum value of the factors for the production of maximum extractive value having high antioxidant activity (Alam et al.
