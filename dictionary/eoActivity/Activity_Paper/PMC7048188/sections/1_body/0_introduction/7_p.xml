<p>In the traditional Indian system of medicine, herbs and herbal combinations have been used for many years because of their historical heritage and mythological belief. As per traditional knowledge, any complex disease can be treated only by a multidrug approach, unlike the Western medicine, which generally involves single-drug therapy. A single herb contains multiple numbers of metabolites and the herbal combination is composed of various herbs. The above-selected plant materials have been used in kidney disorders. No single polyherbal combination has been developed or evaluated for preventive activity in nephrotoxicity. A review of the scientific literature showed the absence of any experimental data to justify the protective role of polyherbal combination in nephrotoxicity.</p>
