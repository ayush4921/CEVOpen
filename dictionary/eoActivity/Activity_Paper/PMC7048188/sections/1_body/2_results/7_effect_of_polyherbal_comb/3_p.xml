<p>We have tested the ROS level in kidney homogenate. The level of ROS was remarkably increased (300%) in methotrexate-induced nephrotoxic rats as compared to normal rats. Upon treatment with polyherbal combinations and Neeri KFT, the ROS level was significantly lowered. In the case of rats treated with ABCD and ABD, the ROS level was 57.14 and 36.21%, respectively. Thus, the combinations could significantly (
