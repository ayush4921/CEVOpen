<p>The impact of selected combinations at two different doses on serum kidney function markers was assessed and shown in 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Methotrexate treatment caused elevation of kidney function markers, and these were significantly reversed by treatment with combinations. Among two different doses administered to nephrotoxic rats, the level of reversal was more in higher doses as compared to a lower dose. But the efficacy of combination with combining four plant extracts (ABCD) was better as compared to a combination with three extracts (ABD). Kidney function markers, especially urea, uric acid, creatinine and albumin, were significantly altered in combination-treated rats as compared to methotrexate-treated rats. The effect of polyherbal combinations on kidney function markers of normal rats (sham control group) was also assessed. But no significant changes were observed as compared to normal control, which indicates that extract can improve the biochemical parameters only in nephrotoxin challenged rats and not the normal rats.
