<p>The phenolic contents of the extracts was calculated from the calibration curve (coefficient of correlation (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) = 0.998), and it was expressed as gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of the crude extract. In the same way, total flavonoid content was measured from the calibration curve of rutin (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and it was expressed as rutin equivalents per 100 g of extract. Phenol and flavonoid contents of the extract are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> as a percentage of the total extract. The hydroxyl group present in phenolic compounds and flavonoids is responsible for the antioxidant activity through redox reaction (Soobrattee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Hydroxyl groups facilitate scavenging of free radicals and thus total phenolic content is used as a basis for rapid screening of antioxidant activity of plant extract. The antioxidant activity of flavonoids, including flavones, flavonols and condensed tannins, is attributed to the existence of free OH groups, particularly 3-OH groups. Plant flavonoids and phenolics have been reported to be responsible for both

 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity (Shimoi et al.
