<p>The dried plant materials viz; 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic> (roots), 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic> (roots), 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> (flowers) and 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic> (stem bark), were extracted separately with 70% ethanol at 60 °C for 8 h by reflux. It was followed by evaporation under reduced pressure to yield residues with 15.25, 24.64, 12.61 and 14.35% 
 <italic>w/w</italic> extractive value, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> shows the HPLC chromatogram of hydroalcoholic extract recorded at 254 nm. HPLC analysis resulted in the detection of 47, 53, 52 and 104 metabolites in 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic>, 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic>, respectively. Chromatograms indicated the presence of a total of 122 metabolites in four plant extracts out of which 17 metabolites were found in common. Major abundant metabolites recorded in 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic> were eluted at R
 <sub>t</sub> 5.153 (6.5%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 3.428 (5.56%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 9.94 (4.14%) and R
 <sub>t</sub> 9.543 (3.96%). Metabolites eluted at R
 <sub>t</sub> 5.153 (8.37%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 3.428 (7.3%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 1.942 (5.75%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 2.769 (4.98%) and R
 <sub>t</sub> 3.07 (4.91%) were the major metabolites found in 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic>. Major abundant metabolites recorded in 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> were eluted at R
 <sub>t</sub> 5.192 (8.22%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 3.428 (6.47%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 1.942 (5.21%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 2.746 (4.26%), R

 <sub>t</sub> 23.707 (3.24%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 5.192 (2.94%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 19.362 (2.31%), R
 <sub>t</sub> 15.42 (2.13%) and R
 <sub>t</sub> 15.993 (1.83%) were the major metabolites found in 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic>. All the metabolites of four plant extracts with their retention time is shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Four markers were identified in plant extracts by matching the chromatogram of standard compounds under the same chromatographic conditions. Metabolite eluting at R
 <sub>t</sub> 10.51 min was found in all extracts and identified as quercetin. Boeravinone B, a specific marker was eluted at R
 <sub>t</sub> 14.14 min and detected in the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic>. Similarly, emodin, an anthraquinone glycoside present in 
 <italic>R. emodi,</italic> was identified by matching peak eluting at R
 <sub>t</sub> 6.451 min. A pentacyclic triterpenoid, lupeol found to be eluting at R
 <sub>t</sub> 23.85 min, was present only in the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic>.
