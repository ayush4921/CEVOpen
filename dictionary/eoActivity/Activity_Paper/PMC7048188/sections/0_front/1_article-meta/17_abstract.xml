  <bold>Context:</bold> Nephrotoxicity is a renal dysfunction that arises from direct exposure to environmental chemicals or as a side effect of therapeutic drugs. 
  <italic>Boerhaavia diffusa</italic> Linn. (Nyctaginaceae), 
  <italic>Rheum emodi</italic> Wall. Ex. Meissn. (Polygonaceae), 
  <italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic> Gaertn. (Nelumbonaceae) and 
  <italic>Crataeva nurvala</italic> Buch-Ham. (Capparidaceae) are well-recognized medicinal plants of Indian traditional system of medicine used for kidney disorders.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Objectives:</bold> The present investigation was undertaken to develop a chromatographically characterized polyherbal combination and to evaluate its nephroprotective activity.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Roots of 
  <italic>B. diffusa</italic> and 
  <italic>R. emodi</italic>, flowers of 
  <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and stem bark of 
  <italic>C. nurvala</italic> were extracted by decoction using 70% ethanol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for the optimization of extraction parameters. Polyherbal combinations with different doses (150–300 mg/kg) were tested against methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> The optimized extract contained 27% phenols and 15% flavonoids, which showed 75% 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging potential. Based on the retention time of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, 17 out of 122 constituents were found common in all extracts and combinations. Two combinations showed significantly higher (
  <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) DPPH scavenging potential and xanthine oxidase inhibition. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) of the best combination for DPPH scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition were 80 and 74 µg/mL, respectively. Treatment of methotrexate-induced nephrotoxic rats with polyherbal combination significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) improved the kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers and histological parameters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Discussion and conclusion:</bold> The developed combination was found to be effective in nephrotoxicity; it can be explored further for the management of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and other chronic kidney diseases.
