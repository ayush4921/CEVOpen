<p id="Par17">High throughput screening found compound 
 <bold>16a</bold> as an inhibitor of CDK2. Due to the inactivation of this compound (
 <bold>16a</bold>) in cells and instability in plasma, kim et al. have converted it to compound 
 <bold>16b</bold> using replacing the ester and a 5-ethyl-substituted oxazole. Most of 100 derivatives with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 1-10â€‰nM were rapidly synthesized. Many of these derivatives exhibited in vitro potential activity and showed broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity against a set of tumor cells. In addition, CDK2 inhibitors of this class created rapid apoptosis in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. Compound 
 <bold>16b</bold> showed potential cytotoxicity against a diversity of cell lines and in the presence of this compound decreased the phosphorylation of CDK2 substrates that containing RB, histone H1, and DNA polymerase R in A2780 cells. Based on cell cycle analysis, compound 
 <bold>16c</bold> reduced cell population in S phase in A2780 cells and largely increased apoptotic fraction. Compound 
 <bold>16d</bold> proved a good pharmacokinetic profile and solubility in mice and illustrated high in vivo antitumor activity in many murine and human models (Fig.
