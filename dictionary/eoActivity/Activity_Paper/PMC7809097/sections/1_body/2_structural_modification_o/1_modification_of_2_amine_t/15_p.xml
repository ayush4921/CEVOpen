<p id="Par23">Misra et al. synthesized a novel class of 
 <italic>N</italic>-Acyl-2-aminothiazoles with non-aromatic acyl side chains and evaluated their biological activity. These series of compounds were identified as potent and selective CDK2/cycE inhibitors that showed antitumor activity in mice. Modification of reported analogue 
 <bold>22</bold> was performed with replacement of an aromatic acyl side chain with a nonaromatic amino acyl side chain and reduced protein binding, molecular weight, and in vitro metabolism in liver and improved aqueous solubility. The acyl side chain expanded into the hydrophilic extra protein space. Investigation of potency, pharmacokinetics properties, and assessment in both models of an 
 <italic>ip/ip</italic> P388 murine tumor model and an A2870 human ovarian cancer xenograft tumor mouse model identified the compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. SNS-032 (formerly BMS-387032) (
 <bold>2</bold>) was found as an ATP-competitive and CDK2- selective inhibitor that were selected as an antitumor agent to enter in Phase 1 human clinical trials. Analogue 
 <bold>2</bold> inhibited a CDK2/cycE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 48 nM. It also exhibited strong selectivity against over a panel of 12 unrelated kinases. In an A2780 cellular cytotoxicity assay, compound 
 <bold>2</bold> indicated antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 95 nM. Plasma half-life was obtained 5-7 h in three species for 
 <bold>2</bold> and exhibited relatively low protein binding in mouse and human serum (69 and 63%, respectively). Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> illustrated 100%, 31%, and 28% bioavailability in mouse, rat, and dog, respectively (Fig.
