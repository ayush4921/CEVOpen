<p id="Par25">In another work, a new series of benzothiazole and thiazole-based hydroxamic acids were reported by Tung et al. Some compounds exhibited strong anticancer cytotoxicity. These derivatives remarkably inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities that enhanced histone acetylation in Hela cells. All tested compounds indicated high cytotoxicity against a panel of human cancer cell lines. Compounds 
 <bold>25a</bold>, 
 <bold>25b</bold>, and 
 <bold>26</bold> significantly inhibited HDAC. Based on docking studies, compounds 
 <bold>25a</bold>, 
 <bold>25b</bold> indicated slightly higher affinities to HDAC8 in comparison to SAHA (has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma). Compound 
 <bold>25a</bold> showed equal cytotoxicity compared to SAHA on five cancer cell lines and illustrated equivalent efficacy compared to SAHA in PC-3 mouse xenograft model. Tumor growth inhibition rate of 
 <bold>25a</bold> was obtained 49.0% at 30â€‰mg/kg that was comparable to SAHA (48.3%) at the same dose (Fig.
