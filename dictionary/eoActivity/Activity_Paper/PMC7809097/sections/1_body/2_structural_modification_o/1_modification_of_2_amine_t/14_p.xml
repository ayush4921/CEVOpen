<p id="Par22">In an attempt to develop potent and selective anti-tumor drugs, a number of novel 2-amino-thiazole-5- carboxylic acid phenylamide derivatives based on the structure of dasatinib were designed and synthesized by Liu et al. According to biological evaluation results, compound 
 <bold>21</bold> indicated potent and selective antiproliferative activity against human K563 leukemia cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.3 µM) compared with dasatinib (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.08 µM). Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> was inactive against MDA-MB 231 and clearly less active against MCF-7 and HT-29 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.2 and 21.6 µM, respectively but dasatinib at each cell line indicated IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of &lt; 1 µM. Therefore, replacement of pyrimidin-4-ylamino core in dasatinib with an acetylamide drastically reduced the antitumor activity against solid tumors but compounds 
 <bold>21</bold> with acetylamide group indicated good selectivity against human K563 leukemia cells (Fig.
