<p id="Par21">2-aminothiazole sublibrary with lipophilic substituents (such as methyl, bromo, phenyl, or butylidene) at 4- or/and 5-position of scaffold were synthesized and tested for antitumor activities against two cancer cell line of human lung cancer (H1299) and human glioma (SHG-44). Some compounds exhibited moderate to good activities against two cancer cell lines. Among these compounds, the promising analogue 
 <bold>20</bold> illustrated the most potent antitumor activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.89 and 4.03 µM against H1299 and SHG-44 cell lines, respectively. The SARs analysis indicated that 2-aminothiazoles containing 4,5-butylidene and benzylic amines were benefit for improvement the cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds. The incorporation of methyl group at the C
 <sub>4</sub>- or C
 <sub>5</sub>-position of the thiazoles core decreased potency (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μmol/L). Introducing the phenyl group at C
 <sub>4</sub>-position of the thiazole had the similar substituent effect on the potency. The exchange of methyl unit with bromo group at the C5-position of the thiazoles led to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values range of 6.61 to 9.34 μM. Therefore, 4,5,6,7 tetrahydrobenzo[
 <italic>d</italic>]thiazoles core can be used as promising antitumor agent at level of micromolar (Fig.
