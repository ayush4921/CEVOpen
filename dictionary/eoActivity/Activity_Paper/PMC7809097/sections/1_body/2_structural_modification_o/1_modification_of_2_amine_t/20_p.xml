<p id="Par28">Lee and coworkers designed and prepared a number of 4-aryl-N-arylcarbonyl-2-aminothiazoles as Hec1/ Nek2 inhibitors. Compound 
 <bold>29</bold> indicated potent in vitro antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 16.3-42.7 nM, good pharmacokinetic profiles in SD rats, remarkable in vivo antitumor activity in mice with human MDA-MB-231 xenografts and while showed less activity against normal cells, kinases, and hERG. Based on cell responses resulting, compound 
 <bold>29</bold> inhibited Hec1/Nek2 in cells using a decreased level of Hec1 co-immunoprecipitated with Nek2, Nek2 degradation, mitotic abnormalities, and apoptosis induction. This compound exhibited good selectivity against cancer cells while was not active toward normal cells. In the Herg liability screening, compound 
 <bold>29</bold> did not show activity in a [
 <sup>3</sup>H]astemizole competitive binding assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM). The SAR studies indicated that exchange of the 4-pyridyl group with a 4-cyanophenyl group created about twofold decreased potency against three cell lines K562, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231. When the pyridyl group converted to pyridyl N-oxide, potency reduced more than fourfold (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 2.7 to &gt;10 μM). Insertion of an 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-chloro or 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-fluoro group at the 4-pyridyl group slightly decreased potency (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.42–0.77 μM). The introduction of an alkoxy group at the C-4′ position of 
 <bold>29</bold> increased antiproliferative activity. Insertion of methoxy, ethoxy, i-propoxy, i-butoxy, and c-pentoxy groups at the C-4′ position of 
 <bold>29</bold> enhanced antiproliferative activity than a C-4′ methyl group, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 42.1-392 nM. The alkoxy groups in scaffold 
 <bold>29</bold> were replaced with aryloxy groups. C-4′ phenoxy replacement with the c-pentoxy group exhibited a similar potency. The introduction of 3,5-dimethyls at the phenoxy group eliminated activity. A similar activity was seen in presence of a 4-fluorophenoxy, 4-metyl and 4-ethyl phenoxy group at C-4′ position. Introduction of C-4′ 4-methoxyphenoxy demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against the four cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.0-48.6 nM) and movement of the C-4 methoxy group to the C-3 position of phenyl ring decreased the antiproliferative activity. Bearing a 2′,6′-difluoro group at the 4-pyridyl group reduced in vitro activity compared to its 2′,6′-dimethyl derivatives. Introducing an 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-fluoro atom at the pyridyl group increased in vitro antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 16.3–42.7 nM (Fig.
