<p id="Par9">2-aminothiazole compounds containing amino group in amide form are a large group to be investigated. Recently, using progesterone as the starting material, Fan and coworkers prepared a new class of steroidal derivatives with a D-ring substituted benzamidothiazole. Characterization of these structures was performed by NMR and HRMS spectrometry. These derivatives were assessed for their antiproliferative activity on human prostate (PC-3) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cell lines. Based on preliminary results, compounds 
 <bold>7a</bold>, 
 <bold>7b</bold>, and 
 <bold>7c</bold> showed moderate antiproliferative activity. Other bioactivities of these derivatives and structure modification of them are under investigation (Fig.
