<p id="Par31">The research group of Ibrahim designed, prepared, and investigated a novel set of 2-aminobenzothiazole analogues with sulfonamide at position 6 as inhibitors of four isoforms of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydras including hCA I and II (antiglaucoma target) and hCA IX and XII (anti-tumor targets). Docking studies were performed to expose details regarding the desirable interactions between the cores of these new derivatives and the active sites of the CA isoforms. Most of the synthesized derivatives exhibited high inhibitory activity against the tumor-associated hCA IX and hCA XII with
