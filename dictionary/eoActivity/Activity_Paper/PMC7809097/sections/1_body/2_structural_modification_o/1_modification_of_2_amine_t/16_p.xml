<p id="Par24">In continuation of previous work to find the newly anticancer agents, in a study in 2014 Nofal et al. prepared some new series of thiazole derivatives and investigated their cytotoxic activity against two different cancerous cell lines HepG2 and PC12. Among these analogues, compounds 
 <bold>23</bold> and 
 <bold>24</bold> exhibited a dual antitumor efficacy against PC12 and HepG2 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.51 and 0.57 mM for HepG2 cell lines and 0.309 and 0.298 mM for PC12 cell lines. Introduction of a chlorine atom on 2-amino group of the thiazole ring or its addition to a dialkyl group exhibited a significant decrease in the activity and with enhancement in the molecular volumes reduced the activity (Fig.
