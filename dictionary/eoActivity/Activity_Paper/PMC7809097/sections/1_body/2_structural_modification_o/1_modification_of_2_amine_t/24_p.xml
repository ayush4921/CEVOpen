 <italic>N</italic>-(2-chloro-5-(2-acetylaminobenzo[
 <italic>d</italic>]thiazol-6-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-4-fluorophenylsulfonamide (
 <bold>33</bold>) displays toxicity as a PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor, when orally administrated. Xie et al. have replaced the acetamide group in the 
 <bold>33</bold> with alkylurea moiety and a series of 1-alkyl-3-(6-(2,3-disubstituted pyridin-5-yl)benzo[
 <italic>d</italic>]thiazol-2-yl)urea derivatives were synthesized. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of these derivatives were assessed against four human cancer cell lines HCT116, MCF-7, U87 MG, and A549 cell lines using MTT assay. The derivatives with high antiproliferative activity were examined for their acute oral toxicity and inhibition of PI3Ks and mTORC1.
