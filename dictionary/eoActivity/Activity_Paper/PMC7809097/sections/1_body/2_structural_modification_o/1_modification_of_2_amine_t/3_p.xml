<p id="Par11">In another work towards the development of effective VEGFR-2 inhibitors, Abou-Seri and coworkers synthesized new series of piperazinyl-thiazole acetamide scaffold. Among tested compounds, 
 <bold>9</bold> particularly inhibited VEGFR-2 at submicromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> (0.40 ± 0.04 µM) and proved to be the most potent anticancer between these agents. According to results, compound 
 <bold>9</bold> showed high selectivity against leukemia and prostate cancer exhibited subpanel MG-MID GI
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.51 and 5.15 µM, respectively. Molecular docking studies of this compound revealed its potential binding mode into VEGFR-2 active site. In compound 
 <bold>9</bold>, an essential hydrogen bond was made by the N-H of the acetamide and Glu885 in the active site. Also, arene interactions were formed between the phthalazine with Leu840, the piperazine ring with Phe1047, the thiazolyl rest with Ile1044 and Asp1046. The piperazinyl moiety interacted with Phe1047 within the active site. The 5- phenylcarboxamide in 
 <bold>9</bold> was placed within a lipophilic pocket that may show more biological activity than other synthesized derivatives. Substitution on the pendant aryl moiety with large lipophilic group appeared to be the most important factor affecting the activity of these series (Fig.
