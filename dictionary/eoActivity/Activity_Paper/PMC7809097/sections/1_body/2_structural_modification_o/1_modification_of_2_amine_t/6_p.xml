<p id="Par14">In purpose to find novel active scaffold against sensitive and resistant cancer cells, Millet and coworkers reported the synthesis and evaluation of a novel bioactive molecules belonging to the N-(4-(3-aminophenyl(thiazol-2-yl)acetamide family. The synthesized derivatives were evaluated against both sensitive and resistant cell lines of melanoma, leukemia, and pancreatic cancer cells. All tested compounds exhibited an activity in the range of medium to low micromolar. The lead compound 
 <bold>12</bold> exhibited high in vitro cellular activities against melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia and displayed a good selectivity against three cancer cells at its active concentration. Compound 
 <bold>12</bold> also showed no toxicity against normal cells and good pharmacokinetic profiles. Derivative 
 <bold>12</bold> delayed remarkably tumor growth on A375 xenograft model in mice (in vivo) and promoted cell death using apoptotic and autophagic deaths. According to SAR studies, aliphatic substituents in 
 <italic>para</italic>-position of this scaffold were better tolerated. In the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position of scaffold, there was a clear correlation between the size of the nonpolar substituent and the activity. The best compounds had a hydrophobic aliphatic chains or bulky iodine atom (Fig.
