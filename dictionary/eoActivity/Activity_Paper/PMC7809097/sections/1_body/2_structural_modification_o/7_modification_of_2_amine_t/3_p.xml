<p id="Par85">In the same direction and in continuing effort to find more potent and selective anticancer schiff bases, anticancer activity of the prepared 4-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-5-benzyl-2-benzyliminothiazoles derivatives from reacting the aromatic aldehydes with the corresponding 2-aminothiazoles by Jiao et al. was carried out against human cervix cancer (HeLa) cell line. Based on the antitumor bioassay, most of compounds with 
 <italic>p</italic>-Cl substituent on the 5-benzyl fragment of the thiazole ring showed moderate to strong cytotoxic activities against HeLa cells. Among them, compounds 
 <bold>96a</bold> and 
 <bold>96b</bold> showed high potency with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.001 and 0.007 mmol/L, respectively, even higher than Cisplatin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.009 mmol/L). According to structure-activity relationship studies, displacement of electron-withdrawing 
 <italic>p</italic>-chlorobenzyl with electron-donating 
 <italic>p</italic>-methoxybenzyl on the thiazole significantly decreased the cytotoxic activities. For the 
 <italic>para</italic>-chlorobenzyl series, substituent X and its position on the phenyl ring showed slight variations in their antitumor activities. Thiazoles with 
 <italic>para</italic>-electron-withdrawing (4-Cl, 4-NO
 <sub>2</sub>) on the phenyl ring are more active than a 4-electron-donating [4-N(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>] variant. Therefore, introducing electron-withdrawing substituent on the phenyl ring improves the potency of the compounds. Compound 
 <bold>96a</bold> was demonstrated a potential apoptosis inducer in HeLa cells, may be an efficient anticancer drug candidate (Fig.
