<p id="Par87">A novel series of multi-heterocyclic Schiff base of imidazolylphenylheterocyclic-2-ylmethylenethiazole-2-amines were prepared and assessed for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines including MCF7, HCT116, and DU145 and one normal skin fibroblast (SF). All derivatives exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &lt;100 µmol/L. Derivatives 
 <bold>98a-c</bold> indicated good activity against all cancerous cell lines. All synthesized compounds displayed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;50 µmol/L against non-cancer normal skin fibroblast (SF) cells. According to the SAR studies, different features of substituents connected to the schiff base resulted in the interesting changes within pharmacological effects of molecular systems. The highest anticancer activity on MCF-7 cells was shown using a molecule with a benzothiazole (
 <bold>98b</bold>) connected to the azomethine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 27.76 ± 2.14 µmol/L). The existence of two heteroatoms such as S and N can be benefit to get an activity on MCF-7. Data recorded indicated that molecules with S heteroatom such as thiazole and thiophene played an excellent role against DU-145. The nitrogen-based heterocycles demonstrated significantly active on HCT116 (human colon cancer) cell line such as compounds with imidazole, pyrrole, and pyridine rings. As a result, the existence of special heteroatom and also existence of an additional benzene ring, showed a remarkable effect against MCF-7 and DU-145, and S-heterocycles were more active against these cell lines, whereas, N-heterocycles played an important role against HCT116 (Fig.
