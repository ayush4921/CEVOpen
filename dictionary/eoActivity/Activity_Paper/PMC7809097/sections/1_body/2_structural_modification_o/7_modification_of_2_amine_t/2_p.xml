<p id="Par84">Following all these observations and as a part of Abd-Elzaher et al. continuing research on the coordination chemistry of multidentate ligands, compound (
 <bold>95</bold>) (E)-2-(((5-methyl-4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)imino)methyl)phenol was prepared and formed novel complexes with cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc. These synthesized compounds were determined by different spectroscopic techniques; elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance, infrared spectra, 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, mass, electronic absorption, and ESR spectroscopy. The new compounds were measured for their in vitro antiproliferative activity using the Sulfo-Rhodamine-B stain (SRB) assay against four human tumor cell lines; breast cancer MCF-7, liver cancer HepG2, lung carcinoma A549, and colorectal cancer HCT116. The reference drug in this study was doxorubicin. Among these compounds, Zn (II) complex indicated the most potent inhibitory against human TRK in HepG2, MCF7, A549, and HCT116 with inhibition percent of 80, 70, 61, and 64%, respectively. The highest activity of the Zn (II) complex than the others may be attributed to the function of the Zn (II) complex as a competitive inhibitor of hemeoxygenase (HMOX1), which is produced in large amounts in solid tumors. The molecular modeling was performed for the investigation of the synthesized compounds as potential TRK inhibitors. The binding free energies of the prepared compounds into the target c-kit kinase receptor were calculated by MOE (molecular modeling environment). The best docking score obtained for Zn(II) and Ni(II), respectively (Fig.
