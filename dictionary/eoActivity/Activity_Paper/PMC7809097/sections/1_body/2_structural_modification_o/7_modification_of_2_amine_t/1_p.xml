<p id="Par83">Due to the presence of multifunctional groups in metal complexes of schiff bases with heterocyclic compounds, large numbers of schiff bases have also been shown to exhibit anticarcinogenic properties. The excessive attention of synthesizing determined broad range of N and S chelating ligands as thiazole molecule have enticed considerable interest. Besides these atoms play an important role in the coordination of metals at the active sites of diverse metal biomolecules that have a therapeutic activity or availing as study models for metallo-enzymes.</p>
