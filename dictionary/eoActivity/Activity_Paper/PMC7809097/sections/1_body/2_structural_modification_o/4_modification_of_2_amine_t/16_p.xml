<p id="Par74">A new series of aminothiazole attachment on coumarin core as strong anticancer lead were identified with potential activity as energy restriction mimetic agents (ERMA). The recognized chemotypes could be inhibited glucose uptake and enhanced ROS generation in cancer cells. Derivatives 
 <bold>84a</bold> and 
 <bold>84b</bold> exhibited strong activity against HCT116 and HT-29. According to the structure-activity relationship, compound 
 <bold>84a</bold> was the most potent analogue with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.38 µM and 0.53 µM against HT-29 and HCT116, and compound 
 <bold>84b</bold> was the safest analogue on normal cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.97 µM. Further biological assessment of analogues 
 <bold>84a</bold> and 
 <bold>84b</bold> indicated that mediated glucose uptake inhibition, simplified ROS generation and decreased NADPH/NADP levels and finally induced cancer cell death through energy restriction, at least in part. Additionally, the evaluation of synergistic activity for 
 <bold>84a</bold> and 
 <bold>84b</bold> with cisplatin displayed promising results (Fig.
