<p id="Par69">Sun and coworkers designed and synthesized a new series of N,4-diaryl-1,3-thiazole-2-amines that investigated as tubulin inhibitors. Evaluation of target compounds for their antiproliferative activity was performed against three human cancer cell lines namely, gastric adenocarcinoma (SGC-7901), lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080). Most of compounds exhibited moderate activity in the μM range. Among these compounds, compound 
 <bold>78</bold> was identified as the most potent compound. 
 <italic>N</italic>-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-amine (
 <bold>78</bold>) potently caused inhibition of tubulin polymerization with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 0.36 and 0.86 μM in the three cancer cell lines and disruption of tubulin microtubule dynamics in a manner similar to CA-4. Induction of SGC-7901 cell cycle arrest was occurred at the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase in both concentration and time-dependent manners using compound 
 <bold>78</bold>. The 2,4-dimethoxy substitutions of A ring in the amino-linked compounds displayed the most remarkable antiproliferative activity. Presence of a methyl or acetyl group at the N linker position of the 2-aminothiazole scaffold caused reduction of activity compared to compound 
 <bold>78</bold>. Hydrophobic interactions were formed between compound 
 <bold>78</bold> and some amino acids of β-tubulin. A hydrogen bonding was created between the thiol of Cys β241 and the nitrogen of the amino linker and other hydrogen bonding was formed between the oxygen of methoxy group in ring A of compound 
 <bold>78</bold> and the hydroxyl group of Thr α179. According to the docking results, this compound could bind to the binding site of colchicine in tubulin (Fig.
