<p id="Par67">The research group of Shi, synthesized a number of thiazolyl-chalcones (E)-1-(4-methyl-2-arylaminothiazol-5-yl)-3-arylprop-2-en-1-ones and assessed activity of these compounds against different cancer cell lines BGC-823, PC-3, NCI-H460, BEL-7402 by MTT assay. Some compounds indicated activity on cancer cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value below 10 µM. According to the in vivo test against S180 xenograft in mice, compounds 
 <bold>76a</bold> and 
 <bold>76b</bold> showed moderate activity that inhibited tumor weight 22-25%. Based on results, compound 
 <bold>76b</bold> indicated good anticancer activity, in vitro and in vivo. Presence of thiazole groups into chalcones can improve anticancer activity of them (Fig.
