<p id="Par71">In continuing of CDK2 inhibitors discovery, Vulpetti and coworkers were designed a new, selective, and potent CDK2 inhibitor compound 
 <bold>80</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20 nM) by identifying a promising template, namely N-(5-Bromo-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (original hit) through high throughput screening and combination of X-ray structure determination and structure-based drug design. The original hit inhibited CDK2/Cyclin A in an ATP-competitive manner with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 808 nM. In docking model of original hit, residues Val18, Ala31, Val64, Leu134, Ala144 formed two hydrophobic surfaces that interacted with thiazole ring. A hydrogen bond was formed between the nitrogen of the thiazole ring and the amide nitrogen of Leu83 and other hydrogen bond created between the amide-NH of compound 46 and carbonyl oxygen of Leu83. Presence of a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe80, Val18, Val64 and Ala144 interacted with the bromine atom. In compound 
 <bold>80</bold>, the aniline group located closely towards the hydrophobic residues Ile10. There were the key interactions between the sulfonamide moiety and Asp86 (the main and the side-chain atoms). A weak hydrogen-bond was formed with Lys89 that was solvent exposed. The presence of the isopropyl in position 5 and the 
 <italic>para</italic>-sulfonamide aniline in position 2 have increased activity of compound 
 <bold>80</bold> by two orders of magnitude with respect to the original hit. Moreover, the 
 <italic>para</italic> sulfonamide aniline substituent brings about an improvement of both potency and selectivity (Fig.
