<p id="Par65">A number of thiazole derivatives were synthesized and their cytotoxicity was assessed on 66 human tumor cell lines from different neoplastic diseases. The preliminary anticancer test was performed for selected compounds on BC, NSCLC, and CNSC cells and the test results gained as growth percent value. According to the results of preliminary anticancer test, six compounds selected for second step of evaluation. The test results obtained as log
 <sub>10</sub> GI
 <sub>50</sub> (growth inhibition of 50%). Compounds with log
 <sub>10</sub> GI
 <sub>50</sub> more than −4 were posed inactive. All of tested compounds exhibited log
 <sub>10</sub> GI
 <sub>50</sub> greater than −4, therefore they have a significant activity against cancer cells. The mean graph midpoint (MG-MID) values for standard compounds of melphalan and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-diaminodichloroplatinum obtained −5.09 and −6.20. In comparison of the mean graph midpoint (MG-MID) value for melphalan (−5.09) and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-diaminodichloroplatinum (−6.20) as standards and tested compounds, it can be concluded that tested compounds created high potency. Compound 
 <bold>74a</bold> with MG-MID = −6.02 was almost equal to the standard compound of 
 <italic>cis-</italic>diaminodichloroplatinum. Also, the activity values of 
 <bold>74a</bold> and 
 <bold>74b</bold> are higher than that of the other control compound melphalan. Derivative 
 <bold>74b</bold> was the most active compound against colon cancer (log
 <sub>10</sub> GI
 <sub>50</sub> = −6.64), that was more than c
 <italic>is-</italic>diaminodichloroplatinum (Fig.
