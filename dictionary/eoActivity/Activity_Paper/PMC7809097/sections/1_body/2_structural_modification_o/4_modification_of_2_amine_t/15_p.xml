<p id="Par73">Continuous efforts to identify allosteric modulators of the CK2 and following on previous work of Bestgen team, structure optimizations supported by a binding model led to the identification of the lead compound 2-hydroxy-4-((4-(naphthalen-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)amino)benzoic acid (
 <bold>83</bold>) from the 2-aminothiazolyl benzoic acid derivatives that showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.6 µM against purified CK2α. The preliminary Structure-Activity Relationships had suggested that the three aryl ring system as well as the carboxylic acid function were needed for CK2α inhibition and the 
 <italic>p</italic>-position appeared most suitable for the placement of the essential acidic function. Although, the electron density of the phenyl ring in the thiazole 4-position was not relevant to the binding affinity. Compound 
 <bold>83</bold> showed apoptosis induction and cell death in 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5 µM and suppressed activation of STAT3 more potently than CX-4945 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.6 µM and 5.3 µM). The high activity of analogue 
 <bold>83</bold> in cells can be ascribed to the lack of binding competition with the high levels of intracellular ATP. The kinase selectivity profile exhibited that compound 
 <bold>83</bold> was also about 40 times higher than that of CX-4945 (5-(3-chlorophenylamino)-benzo[
 <italic>c</italic>][2,6]naphthyridine-8-carboxylic acid, silmitasertib). The pharmacological profile of the 2-aminothiazolyl benzoic acid derivatives will be different from any ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor, which was valuable for further investigation in in vivo models. As a hypothesis, phosphorylation of a typical regulatory element on the catalytic subunit does not modulate CK2 and it exists in a dynamic equilibrium between different conformations. Stimulating the phosphorylation was needed an additional interaction between FGF-2 and CK2β in the CK2-nucleolin complex. However, these novel ligands might be beneficial to research the conformational state of different CK2s in complexes with individual substrates, to illustrate the relevance of CK2 conformational stabilization for the modulation of its activity (Fig.
