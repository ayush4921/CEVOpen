<p id="Par68">Founding the ability of certain 2-aminothiazole derivatives to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases, has intrigued Stieber and coworkers to employ a new and effective method for the solid-phase synthesis of 2-aminothiazole derivatives and also evaluated the biological activity of the library. Biological activity of these compounds was investigated against the cyclin-dependent kinases and receptor tyrosine kinase. None of the compounds showed appreciable inhibitory activity against CDK-2 and CDK-4. However, Compound 
 <bold>77a</bold> displayed activity against VEGFR-2, Tie-2, and FGFR-1 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> below 10 µM. Compound 
 <bold>77b</bold> exhibited antitumor activity against Tie-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.8 µM) and VEGFR-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31 µM). Based on this finding, there are possibilities for receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition with dual selectivity for Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 and the development of novel antitumor agents (Fig.
