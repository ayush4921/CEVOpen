 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)thiazol-2-amine) was synthesized and performed X-ray structure via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In X-ray analysis, the typical V-type intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amino and triazole groups played a valuable role in stabilizing the compound crystal structure. The phenyl, thiazole, and trazolyl rings organized the three planes of the compound
