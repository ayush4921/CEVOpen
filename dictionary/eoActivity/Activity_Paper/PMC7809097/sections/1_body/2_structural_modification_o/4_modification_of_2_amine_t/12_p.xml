<p id="Par70">In regard enriching biologically relevant chemical space (BRCS) around the 2-aminothiazole core, Titus et al. designed the next higher homolog of 2,4-diamino-5-ketothiazoles by providing an azomethine linkage at C4 which resulted in 2-amino-4-alkylidene/arylidenehydrazino-5-benzoyl-1,3-thiazoles (HAT). The HATs were synthesized by [4 + 1] ring closure between a C–N–C–S fragment aminoamidinothiourea (AATU) and α-halo ketone. Incorporation of azomethine on C4 hydrazine was performed by isobutyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl groups that resulted IBHATs (
 <bold>79a</bold>), CyHATs (
 <bold>79b</bold>), and BzHATs (
 <bold>79c</bold>), respectively. In molecular docking, the virtual screening in three classes of anticancer target proteins containing estrogen receptor (3ERT), cyclin dependent kinase (3FDN), and Aurora kinase (3LAU) recognized selective binding of the designed compounds as ATP competitive inhibitors of Aurora kinase (3LAU). The in vitro cytotoxicity investigation of the compounds on six human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HL-60, SK-MEL-2, A549, OVCAR-3, and SW620) indicated that analogues 
 <bold>79a</bold> and 
 <bold>79c</bold> to be active on MCF-7 with GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.32 and 8.16 µg/mL respectively, whereas, 
 <bold>79b</bold> was active against lung cancer cell line A549 with GI
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.61 µg/mL. Moreover, all the three active molecules were found to have potent anticancer activity against all the tested cell lines. Noteworthy, most of tested compounds showed selective dose-response towards the breast, leukemia, and/or lung cancer cell lines. In SAR studies, the phenyl ring (R
 <sub>4</sub>) was completely embedded in the hydrophobic domain. When the chain length in the azomethine part was increased by introducing isobutyl or cyclohexyl units, the hydrazono part moved more towards the activation loop having the Ala-Asp-Phe. It was found that in all three classes, R
 <sub>3</sub> substitution was desirable for better interaction with hinge region and thereby increased binding energy than corresponding unsubstituted analogs. The docking studies on HAT derivatives with substituted phenyl rings at R
 <sub>4</sub> revealed that in all classes –OMe substitutions increase binding affinity by reducing exposure penality affected through an orientation change in the active site. However, halogen substitutions were not much influential in modulating the binding affinity of the molecules in the 3LAU active site. Furthermore, modification of R
 <sub>4</sub> with biologically relevant heterocyclic ring systems such as coumarin and indole led to enhanced binding energies wherein a more pronounced effect was found for indolyl derivatives. The in silico ADME prediction determined the drug-likeness of different molecules that follow up the rule of five (RO5). Based on ADME prediction results, the designed molecules theoretically exhibited good passive oral absorption (Fig.
