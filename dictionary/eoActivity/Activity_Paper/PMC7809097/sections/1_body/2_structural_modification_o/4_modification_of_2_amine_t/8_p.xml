<p id="Par66">Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are family of serine/threonine kinases those are play a key role in progression and transcription of cell cycle. Schonbrunn et al., designed and developed new and highly potent diaminothiazole inhibitors of CDK2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0009–0.0015 μM) from a single HTS hit compound with weak inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15 μM). Structure-based design using 35 high-resolution cocrystal structures of CDK2 was performed for different analogues of the hit compound. Investigation of compound 
 <bold>75</bold> against 339 kinases indicated great selectivity for CDKs. This compound remarkably suppressed proliferation of cancer cell lines which there was a correlation between the inhibition of Rb-phosphorylation and apoptosis onset. According to the results, the potential of this new synthesized inhibitors exhibited better development into CDK-particular chemical probes or therapeutics. In the SAR studies, R
 <sub>2</sub> substitution with 
 <italic>meta</italic>-pyridine showed the more potent than the based compound and in 
 <italic>ortho</italic>- or 
 <italic>para</italic>- pyridine showed the less potency than the based compound. Replacing of phenyl and cyclohexyl at R
 <sub>1</sub> resulted increasing of activity over the parent compound. Insertion of sulfonamide group at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position of the phenyl ring (R
 <sub>1</sub>) resulted remarkable activity over the parent compound that was attributed formation of hydrogen bonding interaction between the sulfonamide unit and amino acids His84, Gln85, Asp86, and Lys89. Insertion of sulfonamide group at the 
 <italic>meta</italic>-position of the phenyl ring (R
 <sub>1</sub>) led to loss of activity. Compound 
 <bold>75</bold> inhibited CDK2-cyclin A2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.5 nM) using the P33-radiolabeled assay. In compound 
 <bold>75</bold>, the nitro group at 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-position of phenyl ring was nested in a hydrophobic pocket with Val18, Ala31, Lys33, and Phe80 (Fig.
