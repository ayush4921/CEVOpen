<p id="Par81">Inspired by the pioneering work, Liu group developed a number of new 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine derivatives incorporating a substituted 2-aminothiazole component as the C-2 substituent of the center pyrimidine core. They decided to conduct structural modifications based on original hit (
 <bold>91</bold>), which was maintained good potency against both ALK and c-Met with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 61.8 and 20 nM, by replacing the N-methylamide moiety on the C4-arylamino fragment of the central pyrimidine core with the isopropylsulfonyl group. Also, 1-methyl-N3-benzazepine and isopropylsulfonyl moieties were able to occupy the hydrophobic pocket of ALK kinase. These synthesized compounds showed different potencies on ALK kinase that compound 
 <bold>92</bold> displayed the highest potency against ALK (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.4 nM) and ALK gatekeeper mutation L1196M (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.1 nM), whereas this selected compound exhibited moderate cellular potency against the SUP-M2 cells harboring NPM-ALK. Phosphorylation of ALK kinase and its down-stream signaling pathways were dose-dependently suppressed by compound 
 <bold>92</bold>. As a result, the 2-aminothiazole scaffold as a heteroarylamino bioisosteric was suitable for replacement of the C2-phenylamino group in the pyrimidine core (Fig.
