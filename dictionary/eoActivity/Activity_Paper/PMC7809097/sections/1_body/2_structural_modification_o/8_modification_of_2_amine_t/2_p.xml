<p id="Par89">In another work, Altintop et al. was investigated some novel nitro-substituted thiazolyl hydrazone derivatives. In addition, in vitro evaluation of these compounds was performed on the MCF-7 and NIH/3T3 cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>100</bold> was indicated inhibitory activity on MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 125 µg/mL and comparatively low toxicity on NIH/3T3 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value &gt; 500 µg/mL). As a result, the presence of functional groups at the 5th position of the furan ring and the 4th position of the thiazole ring probably was valuable on cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and NIH/3T3 cell lines. Among these derivatives, compound 
 <bold>100</bold>can be recognized as promising anticancer agent (Fig.
