<p id="Par91">Motivated by the potential anticancer activity of both coumarin and 2-aminothiazole nucleus, a novel series of thiazol-2-yl hydrazono-chromen-2-one derivatives were synthesized by Abd El-Karim and coworkers. Potency of all the synthesized derivatives was investigated by MTT assay against HeLa cells. Among tested derivatives, most of them indicated more or equipotent cytotoxicity to doxorubicin, especially derivative 
 <bold>102a</bold> and derivatives 
 <bold>102b-d</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 0.0091–0.0654 µM compared to doxorubicin with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.107 µM. According to cell cycle analysis, the compound 
 <bold>102b</bold> made cell cycle accumulation at G0/G1 phase by 62.19% compared with 37.23% by doxorubicin that showing CDK2/E1 complex could be considered the possible biological target for these novel derivatives. CDK2/E1 evaluation for the most promising derivatives (
 <bold>102a-d</bold>) exhibited remarkable inhibitory against the target enzyme with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging of 0.022-1.629 nM. RT-PCR gene expression assay was proved that the levels of P21 and P27 as the nuclear CDK2 regulators increased using analogue 
 <bold>102b</bold> with 2.30 and 5.7 folds, respectively. Furthermore using, 
 <bold>102b</bold> significant activation of caspases-3 and -9 induced cell apoptosis. Molecular docking analysis for 
 <bold>102a-d</bold> exhibited hydrogen bonding interactions with the main amino acids Leu83, Lys89, and Asp145 in the ATP binding site and hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic amino acids Ile10, Val18, Ala31, Val64, Phe80 and Gln85 that confirmed their significant CDK2 inhibitory activity. Pharmacokinetic properties prediction of the most potent compounds showed that the newly synthesized compounds are not only with promising antitumor activity but also possess promising pharmacokinetic properties (Fig.
