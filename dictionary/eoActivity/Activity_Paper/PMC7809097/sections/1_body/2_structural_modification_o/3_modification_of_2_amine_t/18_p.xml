<p id="Par57">Due to importance of chalcone type compounds in the last study by Ayati et al. and according to above findings and in continuation of their studies on the synthesis of chromene-based anticancer agents, this research group has described coumarin-containing hybrid compounds namely 3-(4-amino-2-(cyclic amino-1-yl)thiazole-5carbonyl)-2H-chromen-2-ones and 3-(4-amino-2-(arylamino)thiazole-5-carbonyl)-2H-chromen-2-ones as new anticancer agents. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for antiproliferative activity of synthesized compounds were investigated against breast carcinoma (MCF-7), human colon adenocarcinoma (SW480), and human liver cancer (HepG2) cell lines using MTT assay. Also, the effect of arylamino and different cyclic amino groups at C-2 of thiazole core was investigated. Particularly, thiomorpholine derivative (
 <bold>63</bold>) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.5 and 13.0â€‰mg/ml found to be the most potent compound against MCF-7 and SW480 cells, respectively. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship studies revealed that 2-(cyclic amino) derivatives exhibited better cytotoxic effects rather than 2-arylamino analogs. Between the cyclic amine derivatives, six-membered analogs were more potent than five-membered cyclic amine congener against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells. Replacement of oxygen in morpholine derivative by sulfur resulted in compound 
 <bold>63</bold> with greater potency against all tested cell lines. Further investigation by flow cytometric analysis confirmed that compound 
 <bold>63</bold> induces apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells and cause G1-phase arrest in the cell cycle (Fig.
