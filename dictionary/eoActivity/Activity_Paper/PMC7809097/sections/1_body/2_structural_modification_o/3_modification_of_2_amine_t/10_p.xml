<p id="Par49">Taking in consideration the advantage of microwave assisted synthesis in compared with conventional method like stores energy and time, minimizing thermal decomposition, and induces the yield of the synthesized compounds, Kumar et al. carried out the synthesis of a new series of 2- aminothiazole and 2- amino oxazole derivatives under microwave irradiation and evaluated for their anticancer activity. Docking study was performed for synthesized compounds to evaluate binding site of HPV 16 E2 TAD. The docking result indicated a reasonable score that showed a good activity and interaction. There were Ser 98, Glu 100, Leu 99, residues in the HPV 16 E2 TAD active site. Among these synthesized compounds, derivatives 
 <bold>52a</bold> and 
 <bold>52b</bold> exhibited a good binding score and showed significant anticancer activity on HeLa cell lines by MTT assay with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 19.5 and 31.20 µM. Compound 
 <bold>52a</bold> exhibited the highest score (-9.66254 Kcal/mol) that it was probably the existence of a phenothiazine moiety in this compound (Fig.
