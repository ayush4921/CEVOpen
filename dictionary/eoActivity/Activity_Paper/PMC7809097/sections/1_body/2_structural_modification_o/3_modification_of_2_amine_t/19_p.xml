<p id="Par58">The research group of Ding synthesized a new series of nitrogen-enriched oridonin analogues with thiazole-fused A-Ring. Oridonin (
 <bold>64</bold>) is a natural compound that extracted from 
 <italic>Isodon rubescens</italic> and exhibited a moderate anticancer activity. This natural compound has poor oral bioavailability and determinate aqueous solubility. To fix these defects, designed and synthesized derivatives with thiazole ring fused A-ring. In SAR studies, insertion of 2-aminothiazole at C1-C2 position of oridonin A-ring led to improvement of defects. N-alkylation of 2-amino thiazole increased potency on breast cancer cells. Compound 
 <bold>65</bold> with N-allyl substituent was more potent than other derivatives. In biological evaluation, some of derivatives showed potential antiproliferative activity on breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, whereas their aqueous solubility increased. Among these compounds, compound 
 <bold>65</bold> displayed the highest antiproliferative effect on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and remarkably induced apoptosis at MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7/ADR cells. The function of compound 
 <bold>65</bold> (0.25-1.0 μM) on MDA-MB-231 cells indicated the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein, the upregulation of Bax protein and also decreasing expression of NF-κB (p65) protein. According to the in vivo assay, compound 
 <bold>65</bold> (5 mg/kg) remarkably inhibited MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth and showed better aqueous solubility than oridonin. Compound 
 <bold>65</bold> (CYD0618) with excellent aqueous solubility was an antitumor drug candidate (Fig.
