<p id="Par52">Hamed et al. described synthesis and antitumor activity of 2-Amino-4-phenylthiazole analogs which were used for a series of heterocyclization reaction to produce pyran, pyridine and thiazole derivatives. Antitumor activity of these derivatives was measured on six cancer cell lines namely NUGC, HR, DLD1, HA22T, HEPG2, MCF, HONE1 and WI38 (normal fibroblast cells). The multicomponent reactions of 2-Cyano-N-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)acetamide with any of the aromatic aldehydes and malononitrile gave the pyran derivatives. According to the cytotoxicity studied, compound 
 <bold>56a</bold> showed the excellent activity in these derivatives. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for NUGC, DLD1, HA22T, HEPG2, MCF, HONE1 obtained 22, 39, 160, 82, 122, 49 nM, respectively. However compound 
 <bold>56b</bold> showed high potency against NUGC, DLDI, HA22T, HEPG2and HONE1 cell lines and low potency against MCF cell lines. Between the other pyran derivatives which were synthesized from 2-cyano-N-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)acetamide with any of benzaldehydes and ethyl cyanoacetate, compound 
 <bold>57b</bold> showed high potency against DLDI, HEPG2 and MCF cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub>’s 368, 224 and 310 nM and 
 <bold>57a</bold> showed high potency against HONE1 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 666 nM. Also, they prepared N-phenylthiourea, N-cyanoacetyl, arylidene, aryl hydrazone, and pyrimidine derivatives, but were exhibited moderate activity (Fig.
