<p id="Par40">The farnesylation of the cysteine residue of the C-terminal CAAX tetrapeptidic sequence of Ras protein by the zinc metalloenzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) allows Ras to be localized. FTase inhibitors (FTis) are considered as antiproliferative and actively antineoplastics agents. The use of CAAX as a template is one of the classical approaches to the design of FTis. Valoti et al. have developed the SS stereoisomers of 2-o-tolyl substituted 4-hydroxybenzamide of methionine methyl ester, etherified at the phenolic function with pyridodioxan-2-ylmethyl, which exert a significant antiproliferative effect interfering with Ras farnesylation. Recently in a continuation of their strategy to identify new FTis and based on these preceding findings, they have considered the substitution of 3-pyridyl with other aromatic heterocycles. The 1,3-thiazole ring is a classical isostere of pyridine. 2-Aminothiazole, which is as basic as pyridine and has pronounced complexation properties towards metal ions, was selected as an interesting candidate to pyridine replacement.</p>
