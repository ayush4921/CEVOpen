<p id="Par43">DNA-intercalating agents are characterized by a planar chromophore, generally a tri- or tetracyclic ring system and one or two flexible basic side chains. The presence of an extra aromatic ring was proved to improve the affinity of the intercalator for the DNA molecule, consequently to a greater cytotoxic potency. Naphthalimides are the structural examples showing high antitumor activities upon a variety of murine and human tumor cells. Considering these strategies, Qian et al. designed novel naphthalimides with an extra aromatic ring fused to the naphthalimide skeletons. This aminothiazonaphthalimide family was evaluated for their in vitro antitumor activity on human lung cancer cell. Among these components, 
 <bold>47</bold> indicated greater cytotoxic effects on A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.8 nM) and P388 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5 nM). The probability of forming a hydrogen bond stabilized DNA-
 <bold>47</bold> complex that cause efficient antitumor activity of it. This result showed that the introduction of an aminothiazole moiety to the naphthalimide skeleton resulted in higher cytotoxic potency than a thiazole, 2-chlorothiazole and 2-hydroxythiazole moiety inserted. Also, side-chain length was important in their antitumor activity. Presence of two methylene in side chain of compounds 
 <bold>47</bold> caused more effective than other analogue that had one more methylene (Fig.
