<p id="Par45">Protein kinases were proved to have a significant role in anticancer drug development. One of the most essential kinases that play a fundamental role in signal transduction pathways is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Consequently, inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is of potential interest for the development of new anticancer agents.</p>
