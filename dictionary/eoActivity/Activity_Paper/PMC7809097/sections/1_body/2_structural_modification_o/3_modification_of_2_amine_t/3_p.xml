<p id="Par42">Ongoing efforts to develop new podophyllotoxin derivatives with potent biological activities led Sang et al. designed and synthesized a number of 4β-(thiazol-2-yl) amino-4ʹ-O-demethyl-4-deoxypodophyllotoxins and were further evaluated for their effect on topo-II enzymes, H2AX phosphorylation as well as cell cycle progression. The cytotoxic effects of these compounds determined on several human cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2, HeLa, and LOVO cells) and normal cell line (WI-38). Two compounds (
 <bold>46a</bold>, 
 <bold>46b</bold>) showed greater antitumor activity and less toxicity. Compound 
 <bold>46a</bold> exhibited better antitumor activity on A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.3 ± 0.9 µM) and 
 <bold>46b</bold> also showed on A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.16 ± 0.06 µM) and HepG2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.13 ± 0.05 µM). Compounds 
 <bold>46a</bold> and 
 <bold>46b</bold> were the potential topo-II inhibitors (breaks double-strand DNA) and induced G2/M via the cyclin B1 and cdc2 (p34) (Fig.
