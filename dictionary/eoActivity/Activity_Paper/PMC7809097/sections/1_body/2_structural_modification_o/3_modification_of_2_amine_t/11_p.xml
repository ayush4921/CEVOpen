<p id="Par50">Gorczynski et al., synthesized a series of 4-aryloxy- and 4-arylsulfanyl-phenyl-2-aminothiazoles derivatives and evaluated their cytotoxic effects on estrogen-positive (T-47D, MCF7), estrogen-negative (HS-578T, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231/ATCC, BT-549) and adriamycin-resistant (NCI/ADR-RES) human breast cancer cell lines. The GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of these compounds defined and compared with together. The result exhibited estrogen-positive selectivity obtained by using an oxygen linkage between the two phenyl rings and estrogen-negative selectivity achieved by a sulfur linkage. Compounds with sulfur linkage showed significantly more active on different types of breast cancer cells. The most GI
 <sub>50</sub> on human breast tumor cells achieved for compounds 
 <bold>53</bold> and 
 <bold>54</bold>. These compounds with 3,4-dichloro substitutions exhibited selectivity for the adriamycin-resistant cell line. The presence of 
 <italic>para</italic>-chloro on phenyl ring was more active than the 
 <italic>para</italic>-methyl. Compounds 
 <bold>53</bold> and 
 <bold>54</bold> recognized as promising compounds for future mechanistic studies (Fig.
