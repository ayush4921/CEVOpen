<p id="Par35">Considering PI3Kα as a key driver in a number of cancers through amplification, overexpression, and mutation one and the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer, Fairhurst and coworkers synthesized a new series of 4,5-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:3,4-d]bisthiazole and 4,5-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-h]quinazoline tricyclic derivatives based on (S)-prolineamide aminothiazole-urea derivative alpelisib, which is currently one of the most advanced with Phase I/II clinical studies currently ongoing. Bisthiazole core analogues suggested an opportunity to increase the interaction within the ATP pocket of PI3Kα. A cyclization from the 4-methyl of the aminothiazole moiety, was anticipated to introduce additional favorable hydrophobic contacts within the affinity pocket with the side chain of tyrosine 836 and also locks the inhibitor in the conformation required for optimally interacting within the PI3K ATP-pocket. Synthesized derivatives were evaluated against an internal panel of 35 kinase assays, containing the lipid kinases phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase beta (PI4Kβ), Vps34 and mTor. All the derivatives did not show remarkable inhibition at concentrations &gt; 10 µM in used biochemical assays, with the exception of PI4Kβ and Vps34. These data demonstrated a great PI3Kα selectivity for this series and exhibited the PI4Kβ selectivity at a similar to the class 1 PI3K family. Among tested derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>37</bold>, 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <bold>39</bold>, and 
 <bold>40</bold> were found as in vivo potent and selective PI3Kα inhibitor. A way to enhance the affinity for the PI3K ATP-pocket was strengthen the interaction with Y836 that this annulation could create it. Low dose rat pharmacokinetic studies exhibited good oral exposures for this series in compared to their parent. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies for analogues in the mouse displayed that they were capable of inhibiting signaling via the PI3K pathway for higher than 8 h, showing their potential in vivo PI3Kα inhibitory activity (Fig.
