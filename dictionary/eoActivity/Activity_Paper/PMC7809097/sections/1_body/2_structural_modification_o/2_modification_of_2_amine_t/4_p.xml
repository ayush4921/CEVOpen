<p id="Par38">Some of 2,4-disubstituted thiazole derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activity by the NCI in vitro disease-oriented antitumor screen. The tested compounds showed antineoplastic activity. All of the active compounds in the present study (
 <bold>43a</bold>, 
 <bold>43b</bold>, 
 <bold>44a</bold> and 
 <bold>44b</bold>) exhibited activity with GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.8, 8.5, 9.5, and 7.4 µM, respectively and proved to be nonselective with broad-spectrum antitumor activity against the nine tumor subpanels used with ratios of 0.2-1.7 for GI
 <sub>50</sub> and 0.4-1.7 for TGI.
