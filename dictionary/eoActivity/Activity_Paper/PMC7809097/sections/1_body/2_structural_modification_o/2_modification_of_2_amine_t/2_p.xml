<p id="Par36">Overexpression of VEGFRs serves as a potential target for anticancer agents. In addition, frequent occurrences of aberrant signaling mediated by PI3Ks in human cancers have made them attractive targets for the design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, VEGFRs and PI3Ks are from different kinases families so it is a challenge to effectively design dual inhibitors of VEGFRs and PI3Ks. Based on this evidence, a series of compounds possessing 2-(3-phenyl) ureidothiazol-4-formamide derivatives with a 2-ureidothiazole scaffold were designed and synthesized by Li et al. (2016). Several compounds inhibited cell proliferation of both MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cell lines than Sorafenib. Compound 
 <bold>41</bold> exhibited good PI3Kα inhibitory activity and moderate VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities with inhibitory rate of 36.58% and 58.44%. According to SAR studies, presence of benzene and thiazole ring and removal of the methane function were important for the antitumor activity. Based on VEGFR-2 docking study, ligand 
 <bold>41</bold> created one 
 <italic>π−π</italic> interaction and one cation 
 <italic>−π</italic> interaction and three hydrogen bonds. One hydrogen bond was formed between phenolic hydroxyl and CYS919 and other hydrogen bond was created by the urea hydrogen atom and GLU885. PHE918 and LYS868 formed the 
 <italic>π−π</italic> interaction and cation –
 <italic>π</italic> interaction, respectively. According to the docking analysis of the PI3K-binding domain, three hydrogen bonds were formed by compound 
 <bold>41</bold> and the protein that was containing phenolic hydroxyl oxygen and carbonyl oxygen with LYS833 and other hydrogen bond was observed between the urea group and VAL882. Compound 
 <bold>41</bold> can be considered as a promising and potent VEGFR and PI3K inhibitor (Fig.
