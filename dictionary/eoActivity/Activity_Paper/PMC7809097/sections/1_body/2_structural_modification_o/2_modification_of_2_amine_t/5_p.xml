<p id="Par39">Structure-activity correlations of the obtained antitumor screening data revealed that the 2-cyclohexyl-thioureido derivatives 
 <bold>44a</bold> and 
 <bold>44b</bold> are more active than their corresponding 2-n-butylthioureido compounds. It is worth mentioning that even though the n-butyl and cyclohexyl groups have the same spacial distance (four carbons length), the 2-cyclohexylthioureido series are more active than the 2-n-butylthioureido derivatives possibly due to the increased cell membrane permeability. Further interpretation of the obtained data showed that, within the cyclohexyl series, aliphatic substitution at the 4-thiosemicarbazone moiety, such as in 
 <bold>44a</bold> and 
 <bold>44b</bold> (Gl
 <sub>50</sub>, (MG-MID) = 9.5 and 7.4 µM, respectively) increased the antitumor activity to more than threefold what was found for the aromatic substitution. our investigation revealed that the –NHCOC
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>11</sub>– and –NHCSNHC
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>11</sub>– moieties could replace each other without loss of antitumor activity, as shown from the obtained antitumor data of compounds 
 <bold>43b</bold> and 
 <bold>44b</bold> (Fig.
