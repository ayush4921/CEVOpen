<p id="Par37">Considering the importance of 2-aminothiazole scaffold, Rostom and coworkers reported the synthesis of bifunctional thiazole compounds with amidic linker and evaluated for their anticancer activities. These analogues were subjected for their preliminary in vitro anticancer screening according to the current one-dose protocol of the NCI. Analogue 
 <bold>42</bold> displayed a broad spectrum of anticancer effects. Besides, remarkable enhancement in activity against a wide range of subpanel tumor cell lines especially leukemia and melanoma subpanels was seen in due to derivatization of the 2-amino group into substituted ureido functionality as in 
 <bold>42</bold>. Furthermore, a noticeable reduction in the overall anticancer spectrum as a result of further derivatization of compound 
 <bold>42</bold> into their corresponding acid hydrazides was shown. However, bioisosteric replacement of the ureido group with a thioureido led to an obvious reduction in the anticancer potency. Finally, an overall remarkable reduction in activity was reported because of changing the ester function into a substituted carboxamido group. Concertedly, analogue 
 <bold>42</bold> could be used as promising dual anticancer antibiotics (Fig.
