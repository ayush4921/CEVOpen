<p id="Par92">The research group of Tsai in 2016, synthesized a new aminothiazole-paeonol derivatives and characterized by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, IR, mass spectroscopy, and HPLC. The substituents F, Cl, Br, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, Me, and OMe were placed on the phenylsulfonyl. All derivatives were tested for their anticancer activity on fibroblast cells (BALB/3T3) and seven cancer cell lines (AGS, HeLa, PaTu8988t, HT-29, U87-MG, A549, and CT26.WT). According to the experimental results, these compounds demonstrated strong anticancer activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS cells) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29 cells). Among these tested compounds, compound 
 <bold>103a</bold> exhibited the most inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.0 µM, 4.4 µM and 5.8 µM for AGS, HT-29 cells, and HeLa cells, respectively. The second potent compound was compound 
 <bold>103b</bold> that indicated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.2, 11.2 and 13.8 µM to AGS, HT-29 and HeLa cells, respectively. These compounds were better than 5-FU with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 43.8 and 7.2 µM against AGS and HT-29 and less cytotoxic against fibroblast cells (BALB/3T3) than 5-FU. Compound 
 <bold>103a</bold> had more water solubility than compound 
 <bold>103b</bold>. The replacement of flourine with methoxy group at the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the phenylsulfonyl moiety increased water solubility of the compound. The electron-donating OCH
 <sub>3</sub> group in compound 
 <bold>103a</bold> increased hydrophilicity of structure and so increasing the water solubility. Introducing the NO
 <sub>2</sub> group at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-positions of the phenylsulfonyl terminal led to the most inactive compound (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>].
