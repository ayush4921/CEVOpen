<p id="Par8">In the last decades, a large amount of efforts inflected to design and discovery of compounds with improved anticancer activity derived from 2-aminothiazole scaffold. In this paper, we have reviewed and highlighted the progresses of 2-aminothiazole core to pursuit potent anticancer agents. Accordingly, we have classified the reported compounds based on the type of the attached group to the 2-amino of 2-aminothiazole framework includes amide, urea and thiourea, alkylamino, arylamino, amino-pyridine, amino-pyrimidine schiff base, and hydrazone moieties. The information will useful for future innovation.</p>
