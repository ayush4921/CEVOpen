<p id="Par93">Due to the importance of drug design and discovery in the field of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents, there is increasing attempts for finding new leads. Through the course of this project, several strategies are recognized for the structural refinement of 2-aminothiazole as well as modification of the attached group to 2-amino in 2-aminothiazole framework; modification to amide, urea, alkylamine, arylamine, aminopyridine, aminopyrimidine, Schiff base, hydrazone, sulfonamide. Structure-activity studies of various substitutions of 2-aminothiazole are offered by the easy synthesis of this versatile pharmacophore. The expedition on 2-aminothiazole scaffold is highlighted with the recent entry of Dasatinib and Alpelisib to the clinic. This review accredit a new foundation for further lead optimization in the field of anticancer drug discovery and development.</p>
