<p id="Par5">Recently, extensive efforts have been made to enhance the antitumor activities of the 2-AT (2-AminoThiazole) core in anticancer therapeutic areas, as exemplified by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Alpelisib (
 <bold>1</bold>), which is an oral Î±-specific PI3K inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of metastatic or otherwise advanced breast cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SNS-032 (
 <bold>2</bold>) is a potent, selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. KY-05009 (
 <bold>3</bold>) showed low nanomolar antitumor activity and selectivity toward human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which were identified as Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase inhibitor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. CYC116, Cyclacel (
 <bold>4</bold>) was an effective Aurora A/B inhibitor and a slightly weaker inhibitor of VEGFR2 and was currently in Phase I clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dasatinib (
 <bold>5</bold>), a novel, highly potent, and multitargeted inhibitor of Abl, Src, and c-Kit kinase, which was potent against unmutated BCR-ABL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], was recently approved for the oral treatment of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
