<p>The crystal structure of CDK2 in complex with roniciclib was collected from the protein data bank PDB ID (5iev) 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>51</sup>
 </xref>. The molecular docking procedures reliability was ensured through re-docking of the co-crystalized roniciclib in the vicinity of the CDK2 binding site, as mentioned above in the discussion section. Molecular docking of the target pyridazines into CDK2 active site was conducted by Vina Autodock, a more accurate and twice speed higher than Autodock 4 software
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>52</sup>
 </xref>. Vina Autodock requires both ligands and receptors in pdbqt format, thus, MGL tools 1.5.7 were used to prepare all the necessary files to carry out the docking
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>53</sup>
 </xref>. Also the MGL tools were used to generate a grid box around the binding site of Roniciclib. The docking results were visualised by Biovia discovery studio 2020 free visualiser
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>54</sup>
 </xref>, and then the best scoring candidates were selected for further investigation.
