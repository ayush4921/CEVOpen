<p>Pyridazinone 
 <bold>3</bold> (0.1 g, 0.561 mmol) was dissolved in conc. H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (5 ml) and stirred at 0 °C, then K
 <sub>2</sub>Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> (0.24 g, 0.846 mmol) was added portionwise. The reaction mixture was left to be stir at r.t. overnight, then added to ice-water and extracted to be extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were dried with NaSO
 <sub>4</sub> and concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by flash chromatography (DCM/MeOH: 90/10) to obtain pyridazine-3-carboxylic acid derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> as white crystals (0.06 g, 54%); m.p. 239–240 °C.
