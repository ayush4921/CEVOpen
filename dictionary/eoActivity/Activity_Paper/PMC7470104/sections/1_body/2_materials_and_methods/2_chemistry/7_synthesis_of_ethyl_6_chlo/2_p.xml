<p>Ethyl 6-oxo dihydropyridazine-3-carboxylate derivative 
 <bold>5</bold> (2 g, 8.47 mmol) was added portionwise to a cooled stirred phosphorus oxychloride (POCl
 <sub>3</sub>) (10 ml) which subsequently heated at 100 °C for 5 h. The reaction mixture, after cooling, was poured into iced-water, neutralised by aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, extracted with ethyl acetate and purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/EtOAc 85:15) to yield ester 
 <bold>6</bold> as yellow oil (1.1 g, 51%).
