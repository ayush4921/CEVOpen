<p>The appropriate aliphatic amine 
 <bold>8a</bold>, 
 <bold>8e</bold> and 
 <bold>10a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> (5 mmol) and Hünig’s base (1.3 g, 10 mmol) were added to a solution of intermediates 
 <bold>9a–e</bold> (1 mmol) in dioxane (5 ml), and then the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. After the reaction completed, the excess dioxane was evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with water and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO4, and evaporated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic>. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate 70:30) to yield target pyridazine 
 <bold>11a–r</bold>.
