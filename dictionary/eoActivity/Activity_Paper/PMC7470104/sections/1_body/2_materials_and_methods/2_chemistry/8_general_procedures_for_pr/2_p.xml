<p>Ethyl 6-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxylate 
 <bold>6</bold> (0.04 g, 0.16 mmol) was added to a mixture of THF/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (4:1) and LiOH hydrate (0.80 mmol) at 0 °C, then the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, neutralised carefully with a 1 N HCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic layers were collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield the corresponding carboxylic acid. The later acid derivative was dissolved in dry 1,2-dichloroethane (5 ml), then thionyl chloride (0.9 mmol) and DMF (2–3 drops) were added to the solution. The mixture was refluxed for 3 h then evaporated to dryness to produce the crude product of acyl chloride 
 <bold>7</bold>. This compound was used immediately for the next step to prepare key amide intermediates 
 <bold>9a–e</bold>
 <italic>via</italic> stirring with primary amines 
 <bold>8a–e</bold> (0.32 mmol) in methylene chloride (4 ml) and in the presence of TEA (0.80 mmol) for 4 h at room temperature. The obtained precipitate was filtered off and washed with petroleum ether, then used in the next step without further purification.
