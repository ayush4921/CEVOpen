 <bold>12</bold> (0.1 g, 1.12 mmol) and Hünig’s base (0.29 g, 2.24 mmol) were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (10 ml), and the reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The organic layer was then dried, evaporated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> and purified with flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/EtOAc 70/30) to obtain compound
