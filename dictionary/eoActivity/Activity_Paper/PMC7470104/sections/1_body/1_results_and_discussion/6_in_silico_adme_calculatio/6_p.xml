<p>The metabolism for the four pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> are predicted to take place partially in the liver by one or more of the five major Cytochrome P (CYP) isoforms (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4), and thus target pyridazines are suggested to be administered alone to minimise the possible drug-drug interactions. In details, pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold> and 
 <bold>11l</bold> are predicted to exert inhibition for two of CYP isoforms. Compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> was predicted to inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, compound 
 <bold>11h</bold> was predicted to inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and compound 
 <bold>11l</bold> was predicted to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>11m</bold> was predicted to inhibit CYP1A2 only (
