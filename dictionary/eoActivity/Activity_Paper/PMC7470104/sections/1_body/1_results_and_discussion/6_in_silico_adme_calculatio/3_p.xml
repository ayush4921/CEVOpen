<p>The SwissADME online tool has been adopted to calculate the ADME profiles for target pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>. Target pyridazines 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> were predicted to have high gastrointestinal tract (GIT) absorption, as they were present within the region of human intestinal absorption (HIA) in the BOILED-Egg chart
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>39</sup>
 </xref>, whereas compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> was located outside the region of HIA in the BOILED-Egg chart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>) and thus predicted to possess low GIT absorption that may hinder its oral bioavailability. The low GIT absorption predicted for compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> could be attributed to the pronounced lipophilicity of the rigid polycyclic cage hydrocarbon adamantine, as well as incorporation of 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety. At the same time, the BOILED-Egg graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>) pointed out that target pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold> and 
 <bold>11h</bold> have no BBB permeability and thus could be used as antitumor agents with no predicted CNS concerns, whereas, compounds 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> have the ability to penetrate through the BBB and so they could be of great value for brain malignancies (
