<p>Chlorination of 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridazine derivative (
 <bold>5</bold>) was performed 
 <italic>via</italic> its reflux with excess phosphorous oxychloride to furnish ethyl 6-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxylate (
 <bold>6</bold>), which subsequently hydrolysed 
 <italic>via</italic> treatment with the alkali lithium hydroxide in presence of THF/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (4/1) then chlorinated with thionyl chloride to afford the crude acid chloride derivative (
 <bold>7</bold>). Stirring of acid chloride (
 <bold>7</bold>) with the different primary amines 
 <bold>8a–e</bold> in dichloromethane at r.t. and in the existence of Et
 <sub>3</sub>N led to formation of the key amide intermediates
