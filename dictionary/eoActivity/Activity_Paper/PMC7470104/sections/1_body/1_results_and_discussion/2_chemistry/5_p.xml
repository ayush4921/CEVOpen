<p>It is worth emphasising that pyridazines 
 <bold>11d</bold>, 
 <bold>11g</bold>, 
 <bold>11i</bold>, 
 <bold>11m</bold> and 
 <bold>11r</bold> were also prepared utilising the first route, from the key amide intermediates 
 <bold>9a–e</bold>, with higher yields (50–73%) than those afforded from the second route (29–54%), suggesting first route as more advantageous to synthesise final target pyridazines.
