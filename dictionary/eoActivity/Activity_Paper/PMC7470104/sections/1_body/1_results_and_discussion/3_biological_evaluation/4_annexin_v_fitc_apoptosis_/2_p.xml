<p>In this study, the apoptotic potential for pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>, the most potent anti-proliferative agents herein reported, has been assessed in both breast cancer T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines using Annexin V FITC/PI dual staining assay. Both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> at their IC
 <sub>50</sub>s for 48 h. The obtained results have been depicted in
