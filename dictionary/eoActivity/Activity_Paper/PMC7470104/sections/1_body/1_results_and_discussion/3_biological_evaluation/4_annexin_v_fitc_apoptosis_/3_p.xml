 <bold>11m</bold> exhibited a significant rise in the percent of Anx V-FITC positive (Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup>) apoptotic cells within both early (from 0.81% to 6.39% and 11.36%, respectively) and late (from 0.19% to 27.2% and 10.34%, respectively) apoptotic phases (UR + LR), which involves about 33- and 21-fold increase with respect to untreated control cells (
