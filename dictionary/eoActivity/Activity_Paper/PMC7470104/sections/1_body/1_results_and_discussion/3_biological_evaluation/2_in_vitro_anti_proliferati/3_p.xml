<p>The obtained results disclosed that all the screened pyridazines possessed excellent to moderate anticancer action against the two tested breast cancer (T-47D and MDA-MB-231) cell lines, whereas they displayed weak to non-significant cytotoxic impact against the tested ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) cell line, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Nonetheless, it was noted that the screened pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> exhibited differential activities against the two tested human breast cancer cell lines; 8 out of 18 compounds were more active against T-47D than MDA-MB-231, whereas 10 out of 18 compounds were more active against MDA-MB-231 than T-47D as indicated in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In details, T-47D cells were more sensitive (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range 0.44 ± 0.01 − 11.44 ± 0.37 µM) to the influence of all 2-adamantyl-bearing pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–e</bold> (except 
 <bold>11d</bold>), 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-bearing pyridazines 
 <bold>11f–h</bold> (except 
 <bold>11 g</bold>) and butyl-bearing pyridazine (
 <bold>11i</bold>) than MDA-MB-231 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range 2.18 ± 0.07 − 34.59 ± 1.13 µM), 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. On the contrary, the methyltetrahydropyran-bearing pyridazines 
 <bold>11j–l</bold> and 2-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl-bearing pyridazines 
 <bold>11n–r</bold> displayed better cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB-231 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range 1.30 ± 0.04 − 19.71 ± 0.64 µM) than T-47D cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range 1.57 ± 0.05 − 35.9 ± 1.18 µM).
