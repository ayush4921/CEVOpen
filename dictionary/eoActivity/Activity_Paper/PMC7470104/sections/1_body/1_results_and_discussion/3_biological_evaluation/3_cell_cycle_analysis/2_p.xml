<p>In this study, the efficient anti-proliferative activities of target pyridazines 
 <bold>11</bold>a-r towards breast cancer cell lines promoted us to explore and get insights into the plausible cellular mechanisms for these small molecules. To this end, we decided to determine if the target pyridazines exerted their cytotoxic activity through alteration in cell cycle progression and/or induction of apoptosis in both breast cancer T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells. As a reliable tool, the flow cytometric analysis was utilised to inspect the cell cycle distribution after treatment of T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>; the most potent cytotoxic agents towards both examined breast cancer cell lines (
