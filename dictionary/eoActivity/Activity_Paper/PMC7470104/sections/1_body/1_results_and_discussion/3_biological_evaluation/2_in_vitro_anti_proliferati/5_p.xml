<p>With respect to the anticancer activity against MDA-MB-231 cells, the obtained growth inhibitory data (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) ascribed to most newly synthesised pyridazines 
 <bold>11</bold> good efficacy in inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s ranging between 0.99 ± 0.03 and 19.71 ± 0.64 µM. Uniquely, compound 
 <bold>11a</bold> induced weak growth inhibition towards MDA-MB-231 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> equals 34.59 ± 1.13 µM (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is worth stressing that methyltetrahydropyran-bearing pyridazine (
 <bold>11m</bold>) superiorly displayed submicromolar potency towards MDA-MB-231 cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.99 ± 0.03 µM), and thus 
 <bold>11m</bold> emerged as the unique submicromolar growth inhibitor herein reported towards both breast cancer T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. In addition, pyridazines 
 <bold>11d</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11n</bold> elicited excellent growth inhibitory action towards MDA-MB-231 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.18 ± 0.07, 2.44 ± 0.08, 1.30 ± 0.04 and 2.94 ± 0.09 µM, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
