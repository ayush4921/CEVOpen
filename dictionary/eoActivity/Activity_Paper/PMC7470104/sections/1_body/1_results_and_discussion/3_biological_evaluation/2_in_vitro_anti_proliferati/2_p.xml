<p>The newly herein reported pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> were assessed for their anti-proliferative potential towards three human cancer cell lines, namely, T-47D (breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer) cell lines by using the protocol of the SRB assay

 </xref>. MDA-MB-231 cell line is classified as a triple-negative/basal-like cell line, which is hormone (estrogen and progesterone)-receptor negative and HER2 negative, whereas T-47D is considered as hormone-receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer cell line. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for target pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> were determined, and were represented in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
