<p>Molecular docking is among the most utilised drug design techniques that provide insights on how ligands could bind to their targets and the efficiency of theses ligands by scoring them on basis of energy and interactions. Based on suggestion of SwissTargetPrediction tool that CDK2 kinase could be a potential target for the synthesised pyridazines, docking was used to validate this assumption and also to select the most promising analogues for a further biological screening.</p>
