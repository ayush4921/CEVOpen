<p>Generally, all the target pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> achieved acceptable binding interactions and energy scores. In particular, compounds 
 <bold>11m</bold>, 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold> and 
 <bold>11l</bold> achieved the highest scores (−10.2, −10.1, −9.5 and −9.0 Kcal\mole, respectively, 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The four compounds (
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold>, and 
 <bold>11m</bold>) have successfully bound strongly to the CDK2 active site; forming different types of interaction including hydrophobic interactions with non-polar residues (such as Ala31, Val18, Val64, Phe80, Ala144, Phe82 and Leu134), as well as hydrogen bonding with other residues (such as Asp86, Leu83 and Lys89), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007 F0008 F0009 F0010">Figures 7–10</xref>. All the bonding interactions within CDK2 active site for pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold>, and 
 <bold>11m</bold> were outlined in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The obtained results from the docking study supported the assumption generated from the SwissTargetPrediction server and directed us to conduct a biological evaluation for the best energy scoring pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold>, and 
 <bold>11m</bold> against CDK2 enzyme.
