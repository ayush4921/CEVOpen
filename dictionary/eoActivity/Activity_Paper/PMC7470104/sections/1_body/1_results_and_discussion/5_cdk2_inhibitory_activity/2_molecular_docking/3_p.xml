<p>Initially, the protocol of the molecular docking has been validated 
 <italic>via</italic> redocking of the co-crystalized ligand Roniciclib within the vicinity of CDK2 binding site. The performed redocking procedure re-produced the original binding manner for the co-crystallized Roniciclib quite adequately implying the convenience of the utilised steps for the desired docking analysis. This was evidenced by the small RMSD of 0.53 Å between the co-crystallized Roniciclib and the docked pose (energy score (
 <italic>S</italic>) = −9.2 kcal/mol), as well as by the reproducing of all interactions accomplished by the co-crystallized Roniciclib within the CDK2 active site.
