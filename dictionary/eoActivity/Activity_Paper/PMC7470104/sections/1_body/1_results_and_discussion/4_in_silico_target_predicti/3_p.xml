<p>The generated prediction results, for two representative compounds

 <bold>11j</bold>, suggested the protein kinases as the most probable targets (Supporting materials). In particular, CDK2 is listed as one of the top suggested kinases. It is interesting to note that the suggestion of CDK2 as a potential target is perfectly tuned with its known expression in breast cancer
