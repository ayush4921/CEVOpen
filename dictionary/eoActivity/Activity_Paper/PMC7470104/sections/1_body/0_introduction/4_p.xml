<p>It is well established that excessive production of CDKs, such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, or cyclins may result in a disruption of the normal regulation controls and eventually leads to cancer. For this reason, therapeutic approach based on inhibition of CDKs represents an auspicious opportunity and promising strategy for drug discovery and development of novel efficient and targeted chemical entities that can fight different types of human malignancies
