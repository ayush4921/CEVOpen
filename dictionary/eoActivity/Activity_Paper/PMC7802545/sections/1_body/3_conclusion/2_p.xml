 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE found in pollen could inhibit tyrosinase. Kinetic studies elucidated that 
 <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acid ethyl ester noncompetitively inhibited the tyrosinase. The 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE changed the secondary conformation of tyrosinase significantly. The 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE had a quenching effect on the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosinase. The 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE did not chelate the copper ions of the enzyme and induced a conformational change in the catalytic region and changed the binding forces of L‐tyrosine. This study demonstrated that the tyrosinase inhibition of Camellia pollen is related to 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE, providing a theoretical reference to utilize pollen in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and fruit preservation.
