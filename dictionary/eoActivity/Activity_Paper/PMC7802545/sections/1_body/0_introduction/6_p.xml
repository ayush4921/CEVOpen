<p>In the present study, a new tyrosinase inhibitor has been separated and characterized from camellia pollen. The specific contents included the following: (a) separate and purify the tyrosinase inhibitors by macroporous adsorption resin chromatography and HSCCC; (b) identify the structure of the tyrosinase inhibitor; (c) characterize the inhibition by kinetic, CD, fluorescence, and UV‚ÄêVisible spectral analyses; and (d) elucidate the interaction between the inhibitor and the enzyme using computational simulation. This study could help people to understand the tyrosinase inhibition activity of pollens and provide a reference for developing effective tyrosinase inhibitors for whitening agents and other beneficial products.</p>
