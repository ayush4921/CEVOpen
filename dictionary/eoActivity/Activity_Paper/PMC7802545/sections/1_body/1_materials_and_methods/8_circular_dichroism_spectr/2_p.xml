<p>The CD spectroscopy (Jasco‐810 spectrophotometer, JASCO) analysis was done according to a previously reported method (Biswas et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Briefly, 285 μL of 1.86 mg/ml tyrosinase solution was mixed with 20 μL different concentrations of peak IV solution to reach a final molar ratio of 0:1, 1:1, or 4:1. Then, each tyrosinase inhibitor mixture was injected into a 1‐cm‐path length quartz cuvette and the CD spectrum. The detection conditions were as follows: The scanning wavelength was from 190 to 250 nm, the scanning rate was 100 nm/min, the resolution time was 0.5 s, the response time was 1 s, and the bandwidth was 2 nm. After subtracting the blank (0.5% methanol solution) signal, structure parameters (α‐helices, β‐turns, β‐sheets, random Coils) were analyzed by the CDNN program v.2.1 from Applied Photophysics, Ltd.
