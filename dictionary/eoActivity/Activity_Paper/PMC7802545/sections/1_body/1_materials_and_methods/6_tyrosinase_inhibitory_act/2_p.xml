<p>The inhibition of tyrosinase in vitro was measured by a previously reported method with minor modifications (Rezaei et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Different concentrations of collected samples (40 µl) were transferred to a 96‐well plate and then mixed with 80 µl 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 40 µl 250 U/ml tyrosinase solution. After incubation at 25°C for 10 min in the darkness, 40 µl 0.85 mM substrate L‐tyrosine was added to the mixture. The absorbance of each well was measured using a microplate reader (FLUO star OPTIMA) at wavelength 492 nm. Arbutin was severed as a positive control. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the tyrosinase inhibitory activity (%) was calculated as flow:
