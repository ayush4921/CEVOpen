<p>The crystal structure of tyrosinase (PDB code: 2Y9X) (Chai et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) was applied as model of molecular docking. ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 was used to prepare the three‐dimensional (3D) structures of the ligands, such as 
 <italic>p‐</italic>coumaric acid ethyl ester and L‐tyrosine. The molecular dynamic simulation procedure was performed by Discovery Studio software (Accelrys Inc.). Molecular docking analysis was performed using AutoDock 4.2 software (The Scripps Research Institute). The final conformation and pdbqt topology file were extracted for docking. Protein–ligand complexes and their residue changes were visualized using PyMOL software (DeLano Scientific LLC) and Discovery Studio software.
