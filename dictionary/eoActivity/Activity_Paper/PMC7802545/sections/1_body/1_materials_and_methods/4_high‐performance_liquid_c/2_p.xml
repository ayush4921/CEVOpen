<p>Agilent 1260 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies Co.) and reverse‐phase Symmetry C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 3.5 µm, Waters) were used for HPLC analysis. The mobile phase was composed of ultrapure water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient elution program was set in the following procedure: 0–5 min, 5% acetonitrile; 5–10 min, 5%–25% acetonitrile; 10–35 min, 25%–45% acetonitrile; and 35–40 min, 45%–5% acetonitrile. The column temperature was set at 35°C, the detector wavelength was set at 280 nm, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min.</p>
