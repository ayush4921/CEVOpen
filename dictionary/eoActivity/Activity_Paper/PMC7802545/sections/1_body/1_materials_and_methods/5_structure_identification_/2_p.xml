<p>The nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Bruker AVANCE III 400, Bruker BioSpin Corporation) and deuterated methanol solution (CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD) were used for analysis. Mass spectrometry data were obtained in positive ionization mode from an Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Co.) with an ESI interface. The gas temperature was 325°C, gas flow was 12 L/min, nebulizer was 45 psi, sheath gas temperature was 300°C, sheath gas flow was 12 L/min, capillary voltage was 4,000 V, and nozzle voltage was 450 V.
