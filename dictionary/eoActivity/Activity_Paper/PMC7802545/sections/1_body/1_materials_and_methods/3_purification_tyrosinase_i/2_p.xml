<p>Dry camellia pollen (500 g) was powdered by a kitchen blender (JP‐500C, Jiu Pin Dian Qi Co., Ltd). Then, the pollen powder was extracted with 5 L 95% (v/v) ethanol for three times (each for 8 hr) at 50°C. The extracts were pooled and vacuum concentrated to yield a slurry (200 g) that was then further extracted by 1 L 99.5% (v/v) ethyl acetate for four times. The ethyl acetate extract was vacuum concentrated at 50°C. The concentrate (10 g) was dissolved in 1 L water and separated by HP‐20 macroporous adsorptive resin using batch elution by 30% (v/v) ethanol. The eluents were vacuum concentrated at 50°C using a rotary evaporator. Fraction 3 of the eluent was hydrolyzed using a previously reported method with minor modifications (Nuutila et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 g fraction 3 eluent was dissolved in 50 ml 95% (v/v) ethanol and then mixed with 50 ml 4 M hydrochloric acid, sealed, and incubated in a water bath at 90°C for 90 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the hydrolyzate was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 50°C under vacuum. The dried hydrolyzate was submitted to high‐speed countercurrent chromatography separation (TBE‐300C, Shanghai Tauto Biotech Co., Ltd.) using the solvent mixture of n‐hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water at the ratio of 4:6:4:6 (v/v/v/v). The flow rate was 3 ml/min, and the column temperature was kept at 25°C. The effluent from the outlet of the column was monitored with a UV detector at 280 nm. Fractions were collected according to the chromatograms.
