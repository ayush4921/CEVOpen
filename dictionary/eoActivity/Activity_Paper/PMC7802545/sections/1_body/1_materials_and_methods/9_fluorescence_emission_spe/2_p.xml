<p>A mixture of 50 μL tyrosinase (250 U/ml) and 925 μL 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was incubated with 25 μL peak IV at different concentrations of 0, 100, 300, and 500 μg/ml. The emission spectra were recorded at 20°C by using a 1‐cm‐path length quartz cuvette in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Varian, Inc.). The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 480 nm. The excitation and emission slits were 5 nm, the scanning rate was 1,000 nm/min, and the resolution was 1.0 nm.</p>
