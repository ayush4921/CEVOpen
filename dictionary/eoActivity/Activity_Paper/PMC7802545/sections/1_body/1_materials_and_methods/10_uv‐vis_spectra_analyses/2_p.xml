<p>Five samples were prepared, sample 1 contained 1 mg/ml of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acid ethyl ester only; sample 2 contained 0.125 mM of copper (II) sulfate solution only; sample 3 contained 500 U/ml of tyrosinase only; sample 4 was composed of 1 mg/ml of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acid ethyl ester and 0.125 mM of copper (II) sulfate solution; and sample 5 was composed of 1 mg/ml of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acid ethyl ester and 500 U/ml of tyrosinase. The change in the absorbance and wavelength on the interaction was recorded using UV‐Vis spectrophotometer with a wave scan range from 200 to 600 nm.
