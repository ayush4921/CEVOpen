<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows that the spectral datum of tyrosinase exhibits 2 negative bands at 208 and 220 nm. This character is the typical feature of α‐helix resulting from the transition of amide groups in tyrosinase (VanGelder et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Furthermore, the secondary conformation of tyrosinase was modified between 190 and 260 nm. The inserted table of Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows that the content of α‐helix, β‐turn, and random coil decreased from 20.9, 26.1, and 35.1% to 20.5, 24.7, and 33.3% and the content of β‐sheet increased from 22.0% to 24.3% after the addition of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE. This result suggests that 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE changed the conformation of tyrosinase.
