 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> shows the active site located at the bottom of the cavity on the surface. The catalytic center was constituted by two sets of three histidine residues (His 61, His 85 and His 94 of the set A, and His 259, His 263, and His 294 of the set B). Early study reports that each set is oriented by coordinately binding with copper ion (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). These copper ions are directly involved in enzymatic oxidation (Rolff et al.,
