 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7d,e</xref> shows the interaction between substrate L‐tyrosine and tyrosinase inhibitor 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE complex system. L‐Tyrosine bonded with His 60, Leu 62, Val 282, and His 84 via Van der Waals forces, bonded with Tyr 64 via unfavorable acceptor‐acceptor interaction, and bound Pro 283 through hydrophobic interactions. Although the binding site of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE and tyrosinase was far away from the active site, it still caused a great transformation of tyrosinase. 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE can make six histidines that play important roles in the catalytic activity of tyrosinase lose the chelation with copper ion, and greatly changed the binding mode of enzyme and substrate, thus produced stronger inhibition on tyrosinase than arbutin.
