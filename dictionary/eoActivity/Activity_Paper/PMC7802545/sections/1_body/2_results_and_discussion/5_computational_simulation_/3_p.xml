<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> shows that 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE is bound with tyrosinase at a site outside the active center and far away from the copper ions. 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE did not directly act on the copper ions or compete with the ligand. But 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE changed the location of the copper ions and the conformation of a loop adjacent to the active center.
