<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that Peak I, Peak II, Peak III, and Peak IV were separated from hydrochloric fraction 3. In addition, Peak IV presents a much stronger tyrosinase inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.89 μg/ml) than Peak III (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.63 μg/ml), Peak II (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 54.57 μg/ml), Peak I (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 319.72 μg/ml), and the positive control arbutin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 51.54 μg/ml).
