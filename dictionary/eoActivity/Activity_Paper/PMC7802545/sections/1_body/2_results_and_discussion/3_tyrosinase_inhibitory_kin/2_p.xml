<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the relationship between tyrosinase concentration and the reaction velocity. All of the resultant plots passed through the origin point, whereas the slope decreased with the increase in 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE concentration. The trend is consistent with the characteristics of reversible inhibitors (Kubo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). These results indicate that the inhibition of the 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE on tyrosinase was reversible by noncovalent bonds. The enzyme can be reactivated by physical removal of the bonds or inhibitors (Chen &amp; Kubo, 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>).
