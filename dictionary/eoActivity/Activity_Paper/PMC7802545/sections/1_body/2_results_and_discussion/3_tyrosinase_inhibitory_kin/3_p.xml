<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the x‐intercept (−1/
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>) remained the same value but the y‐intercept (1/
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) increased with increasing concentrations of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE. 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> remained constant about 0.52 mM, but 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> decreased after the addition of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE. Furthermore, the parameter 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> was determined to be 1.83 μg/ml. The fixed 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> value indicates that no competition existed between the substrate and 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE. Early study reveals that the inhibitor binds reversibly to the free enzyme or enzyme‐substrate complex equally in case of the noncompetitive mechanism (Lopes et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Noncompetitive inhibition means that the inhibition by inhibitors cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentrations (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE inhibited tyrosinase in a noncompetitive mechanism.
