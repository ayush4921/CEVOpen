<p>There is no consensus on the best system to classify plant secondary metabolites. Categories based on the biosynthetic origin are most widely used and classify them into three main groups: (1) nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds, (2) terpenoids, (3) polyphenols and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B95-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. A fast review indicates that all three groups include substances exhibiting antioxidant activity. The most prominent plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity show a common moiety. This consists of an aromatic ring linked to an atom with at least one unbound electron pair, being oxygen (most common and important), sulfur or nitrogen. Nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds are the group less reported as antioxidant. Considering the bibliometric analysis developed using the Scopus online database and the keywords “antioxidant” and “antioxidant plus nitrogen and or sulfur compound”, these metabolites barely reach 5.41% of the hits (See 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Non-protein plant nitrogen compounds (alkaloids) represent the group of metabolites mostly explored as phytochemicals, but only 4.33% as antioxidant. Two main reasons could explain this fact: the huge amount of other pharmacological activities inherent to this kind of metabolites and the relative infrequent presence of an active phenol group. Nevertheless, in the absence of a hydroxyl group, the redox reaction occurring during ROS neutralization generates benzylic radicals (less reactive than their phenoxy analogous) that are stabilized with the help of an electron pair from a neighboring nitrogen atom. As such, electron delocalization across the rest of the conjugated system is extended [

Terpenoids and especially essential oils received particular attention for their antioxidant activity (5.20% in the bibliometric study). Nevertheless, most of them rank as medium/low antioxidants, but once again, the most active compounds contain a phenol moiety. That is why eugenol, thymol and carvacrol often appear in different studies [

 <xref rid="B99-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Other terpenoids with relative high antioxidant activity are the tetraterpenoids, carotenoids and xanthophylls. In the bibliometric study, they reach an 8.49% hit score within antioxidants. These compounds are lipophilic and have no aromatic ring, but their antioxidant activity is supported by a large number of conjugated double bonds that can stabilize the electrons donated.
