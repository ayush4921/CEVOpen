<p>As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01048-f002">Figure 2</xref>, complex polyphenols can reach high molecular weight by polymerization of their structure. Like this, tannins and lignins can easily accommodate dozens of phenol substituents in their structure, but at the same time such amounts of phenol groups hamper their activity modifying other chemical properties such as solubility. Tannins also show high reactivity when facing proteins, forming insoluble salts that inactivate these molecules. Considering the essential role proteins play in life, this property is in most cases more harmful than beneficial. Overall, simple phenols demonstrate low to medium antioxidant activity while on the other hand large molecules containing high numbers of phenols are useless due to undesirable properties for biological systems. Therefore, medium-sized polyphenol molecules with a number of phenol groups between three and seven are favored for their antioxidant activities. Thatâ€™s why stilbenes [

 <xref rid="B104-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] received a lot of attention from the scientific community. In fact, flavonoids are the largest subgroup of polyphenols in number of isolated molecules, but also receiving the most attention over the rest of the antioxidant secondary metabolites. By themselves, they are mentioned almost a quarter of the works published and indexed in the Scopus database independent of the nature or biosynthetic origin of the metabolite (see
