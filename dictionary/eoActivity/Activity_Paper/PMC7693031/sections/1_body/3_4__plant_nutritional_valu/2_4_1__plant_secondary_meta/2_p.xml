<p>As expected, polyphenols are the group of metabolites that received the most attention from the international community having by definition at least a phenol group in their basic structure and representing almost three quarters of the papers published on antioxidant potential in the bibliometric study (73.58%). Using a simple chemical classification system, they are divided in subgroups: phenolic acids (benzoic and hydroxycinnamic derivatives with C6-C1 and C6-C3 carbon backbone), hydrolysable tannins [(C6-C1)n], chromones and coumarins (C6-C3), quinones (naphthoquinones with C6-C4 and anthraquinones/phenanthraquinones, C6-C2-C6), stilbenes (C6-C2-C6), flavonoids (flavones, isoflavones, catechins, anthocyanins and others with C6-C3-C6), xantones (C6-C3-C6), proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins [(C6-C3-C6)n], lignans (C6-C3-C3-C6), and lignins [(C6-C3)n] (see
