<p>The time required to absorb and distribute the flavonoid intake varies from 0.5 to 7 h depending on the chemical nature of the compound. Additionally, a low proportion (under 15%) is absorbed in the small intestine and then metabolized into different derivatives [
 <xref rid="B110-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The kind of sugar moiety is the first characteristic that affects the time and extent of absorption. The linkage with sugars increases their water solubility and limits passive diffusion. Therefore, some authors affirm that glycosylated flavonoids initially undergo hydrolysis [

Lactase phloridzin hydrolase (LPH) present on the brush-border of small intestine epithelial cells is one of the suggested enzymes involved in this process. Alternatively, cytosolic β-glucosidase (CBG) that demonstrates a broad specificity towards polyphenols can perform this reaction, but in order to do this, polyphenols should be transported into epithelial cells, possibly by the active sodium-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1. The relative contributions of ‘LPH/diffusion’ and ‘transport/CBG’ depend on the position and nature of the sugar. While glucoside and xyloside glycosides are hydrolyzed faster by both systems, rhamnoglucosides must be deglycosylated by microfloral rhamnosidases and β-glucosidases present in the colon, extending the time of absorption [
