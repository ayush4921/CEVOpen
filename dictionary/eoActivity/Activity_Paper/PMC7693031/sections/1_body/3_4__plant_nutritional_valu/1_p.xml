<p>Similar to their functions in plant protection, balanced levels of ROS and also reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play essential roles in the human body for normal development and physiological functioning on one hand, but also for protection against pathogens on the other hand. The in vivo antioxidant system can control the concentrations of ROS and RNS, thus maintaining the cellular redox equilibrium to allow oxidative signaling during lifespan. Nevertheless, excessive production of ROS and RNS as a result of pathophysiological cell metabolic processes, but also of many environmental abiotic stress factors such as radiation and environmental toxins, may trigger DNA damage and lead to protein and lipid oxidation. This may result in oxidative stress that underlies non-communicable chronic diseases [

Antioxidants can be classified according to their source, i.e., endogenous synthesis of enzymes and some small molecules, such as GSH and coenzyme Q, as well as exogenous intake through our diet of mainly plant-derived phenolics, flavonoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, vitamins and minerals.
