 <italic>Adelia ricinella</italic> is a tropical tree member of the Euphorbiaceae family with a restricted distribution in Cuba and the Caribbean region, but with an abundant growth in the Siboney-Jutic√≠ reserve. Its folkloric use as a palliative for inflammation, fever and pain calls for scientific attention. Recently, a preliminary report showed the in vitro antioxidant potential of ethanolic and aqueous crude extracts from aerial parts of this species [

An analytical phytochemical screening revealed the presence of a blend of twelve flavonoids derived from luteonin and apigenin (Berenguer et al., personal communication), compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [

Nevertheless, despite the empiric therapeutic knowledge accumulated, the high consumption of its biopreparations (decoctions, infusions, etc.) and the preliminary experimental results obtained, more scientific evidence is required to corroborate the antioxidant profile of this plant and it specific influence on the reported pathologies.
