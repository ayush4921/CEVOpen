 <italic>Excoecaria lucida</italic> (basionym, 
 <italic>Gymnanthes lucida</italic>) is a bush distributed on the Caribbean islands, south of the United States and Central America and used in the Cuban culture because of its beneficial properties to combat asthma, infections and to alleviate toothaches [
 <xref rid="B146-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. For the first time, a bioassay-guided fractionation was reported for this plant species and showed ellagic acid, a natural dietary polyphenol, 3,3′,4′-tri-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl ellagic 4-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside acid and corilagin, as main compounds. Other polyphenol-like substances isolated from this plant were five coumarins with scopoletin and ayapin as the main components for this group [

 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Ellagic acid has been validated to contain good properties to scavenge in vitro radicals as well as exerting medicinal benefits. This was demonstrated through experimental studies involved in actions to reduce oxidation, inflammation, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis [
