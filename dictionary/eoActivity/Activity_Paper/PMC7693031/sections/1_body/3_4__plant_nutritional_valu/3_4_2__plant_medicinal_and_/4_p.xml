<p>The antioxidant activities of polyphenols absorbed in mammals are exerted by different mechanisms. They can directly function as an antioxidant metabolite, i.e., as electron donor, as described before, but phenolic compounds may also participate in the regulation of enzyme functions (signal transduction) to maintain the oxidative balance. In this way, polyphenols exert their effect through the modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor of the cellular antioxidant stress system. They can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes like SOD, glutathione peroxidase and CAT to prevent oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, polyphenols can also reduce or inhibit enzymes involved in free radical production such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, lipoxygenase, monoamine oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in order to prevent excess ROS production leading to oxidative damage, but at the same time ensuring oxidative signaling [
