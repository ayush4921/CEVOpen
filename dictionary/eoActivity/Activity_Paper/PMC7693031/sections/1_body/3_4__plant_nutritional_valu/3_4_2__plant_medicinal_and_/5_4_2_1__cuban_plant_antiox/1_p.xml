<p>The Caribbean region is recognized worldwide for its vast plant biodiversity including food and medicinal plants species [

Nevertheless, the Caribbean region still contains a large number of plants unexplored and untapped from a therapeutic point of view. Cuba, as it was mentioned before, is considered one of the countries with the highest biodiversity worldwide, where more than half of the vascular plant species are native [
 <xref rid="B136-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. An extensive list of Cuban plants, endemic or not, has been incorporated in the National Guideline of Phyto-Medicines and Bee-Medicines (Formulario Nacional Fitofármacos y Apifármacos, 2010). This demonstrates the importance that the Cuban Health System confers to natural medicine. However, the enormous therapeutic potential of the flora associated with several plant-derived traditional formulations still lacks scientific evidence. Therefore, an increase in scientific studies to achieve this goal is justified. Accordingly, more Cuban plants and their bioactive extracts and compounds are being characterized and evaluated in order to explore and validate their pharmacological potential.
