<p>The Cuban endemic tree, 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum pistaciifolium</italic>, better known as “palo vencedor”, naturally grows in the high and dry southern coasts located in the eastern region of the island and there is a high incidence in Siboney-Juticí Ecological Reserve. The traditional knowledge supports its use to treat lung infections and cold [
 <xref rid="B150-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. However, only a few experimental studies explored the medicinal spectrum of this plant until today. Aqueous, ethanol and n-hexane extracts obtained from the dried leaves were evaluated to determine the main secondary metabolite composition as well as its antimicrobial potential. Alkaloids, tannins and flavonoids were mainly identified in the ethanolic extract. Further partitioning by successive extractions with different polar and non-polar solvents and spectroscopic analysis of the phytochemicals highlighted the presence of especially the skimmianine alkaloid (main compound), associated with in vitro trypanocidal activity [

 <xref rid="B152-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], but relative low antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B153-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], probably because its hydroxyl substituents are blocked forming methoxyl-derivatives. Nevertheless, the high concentration of polyphenols in this plant suggests a high antioxidant potential, but further research is needed.
