<p>Since plants in Cuba are frequently subjected to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature, drought, high light, salinity, nutrient-poor soil conditionâ€¦), they are probably an underexploited source of antioxidants. Indeed, a few endemic Cuban plant species are already known for their antioxidant and bioactive properties, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01048-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As such, conservation of these endemic species and further exploration of the antioxidant potential of other Cuban endemic plant species is of major interest.
