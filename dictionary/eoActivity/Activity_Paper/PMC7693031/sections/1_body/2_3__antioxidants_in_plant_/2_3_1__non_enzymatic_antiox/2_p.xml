<p>As photosynthesis lies at the heart of plant functioning, protection of this process from the negative consequences of stress-induced ROS production is of utmost importance. Key players in safeguarding photosynthesis are carotenoids. The photoprotective role of these metabolites derives from their ability to quench excited chlorophyll states, scavenge ROS and dissipate excess energy as heat. As such, they are crucial for plant protection from high light stress [

In general, their structure consists of a polyene chain with nine conjugated double bonds and an end group at both ends. Carotenoids can be subdivided into two main groups: carotenes and xantophylls. Examples of carotenes are α-carotene, β-carotene, γ-carotene and lycopene. The group of xantophylls consists of more than 800 molecules, including zeaxanthin, lutein and peridinin [

Besides their role in photosynthesis and photoprotection, carotenoids also fulfill other functions in plants. For example, they provide precursors for the biosynthesis of certain phytohormones and play a role as signaling molecules mediating plant development and responses to environmental cues [
