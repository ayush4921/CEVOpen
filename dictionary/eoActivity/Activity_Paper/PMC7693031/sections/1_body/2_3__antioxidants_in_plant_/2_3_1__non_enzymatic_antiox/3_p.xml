<p>Another important class of plant antioxidants are polyphenols, which are composed of aromatic rings with one or more hydroxyl groups. This class of secondary metabolites consists of more than 8000 compounds, which all derive from either phenylalanine or its precursor shikimic acid through the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. Polyphenols are subdivided into several groups based on their number of phenol groups or the structural elements connecting the phenol groups. The most important polyphenol subclasses are phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and lignans. Phenolic acids are derivatives of either benzoic acid or cinnamic acid. The flavonoids class of polyphenols consists of over 4000 compounds and is subdivided into six groups: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, isoflavones and anthocyanins [

In general, polyphenols play an important role in plant growth and development, through their involvement in seed germination, cell division, signal transduction, hormonal regulation, regulation of photosynthetic activity and reproduction [

Flavonoids, for example, contribute to plant protection from UV light, whereas anthocyanins are involved in resistance to visible light [
