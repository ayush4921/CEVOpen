<p>To prevent oxidative damage as a consequence of increased ROS production, the activity and biosynthesis of plant antioxidants are generally increased in response to stress conditions. Interestingly, the ability to combat oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and biosynthesis of antioxidant metabolites plays a key role in defining plant stress tolerance and differs between sensitive and tolerant cultivars of the same species. The following paragraphs describe the impact of abiotic stress factors on several crops frequently cultivated in Cuba.</p>
