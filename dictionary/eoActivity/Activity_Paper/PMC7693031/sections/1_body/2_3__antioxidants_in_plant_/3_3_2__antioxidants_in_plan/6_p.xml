<p>The importance of the antioxidant defense system in plant protection against a broad range of stress factors is further evidenced by the fact that exogenous application of antioxidants such as AsA and GSH increases plant tolerance to several stress conditions [

As reviewed by Broad et al., (2020), engineering of crops with an enhanced AsA concentration is used as an approach to increase crop tolerance to a variety of abiotic stresses. This can be achieved by (1) increasing the expression of genes involved in AsA biosynthesis, (2) increasing the expression of genes responsible for AsA recycling and (3) manipulating factors that influence AsA levels, such as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes in the AsA biosynthetic pathway [
