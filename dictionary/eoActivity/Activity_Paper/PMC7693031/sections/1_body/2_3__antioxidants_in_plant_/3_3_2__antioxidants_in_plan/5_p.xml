<p>Upon drought stress, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations in tobacco (
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) significantly decreased, whereas ROS levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation were strongly enhanced. This again points towards stress-induced damage to the photosynthetic machinery. Activities of SOD, POD, APX, CAT and GR and AsA, GSH and total phenol concentrations significantly increased to counteract drought-induced ROS production. This activation of the antioxidant machinery upon water deficit was even more pronounced when plants were inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or when they were supplemented with phosphorus, emphasizing the importance of associations with micro-organisms as well as soil characteristics in plant responses to stress conditions [

 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> cv. ‘Wisconsin’ generally displayed higher phenolics, AsA and GSH concentrations in comparison to the As-sensitive genotype 
 <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris</italic>. Antioxidant enzyme activities showed opposite responses between roots and leaves of both genotypes. Whereas APX, GST, and POD activity decreased in leaves of the tolerant genotype, they increased in leaves of the sensitive genotype. The opposite was observed for CAT. These data strongly indicate the organ specificity of antioxidant responses in plants, underlining the importance of studying responses in both organs [
