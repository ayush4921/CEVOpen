<p>Dharshini et al., (2020) demonstrated that low-temperature stress increases the activity of SOD, CAT and POD in roots of sugarcane (
 <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic>). Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed that cold stress enhanced the expression levels of several genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and the phenylpropanoid pathway, suggesting an increased production of carotenoids and phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, p-hydroxyphenyl lignin and coniferin in sugarcane roots [

 <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>, another sugarcane species. This response coincided with alterations in the activities of enzymes involved in the AsA-GSH cycle. Besides, chilling stress strongly enhanced anthocyanin levels in 
 <italic>S. officinarum</italic> leaves [

 <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> leaves subjected to drought stress [

In comparing two sugarcane cultivars with different salt stress tolerance, a proteomic analysis revealed that the tolerant cultivar had a higher abundance of proteins involved in non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms as compared to the sensitive one [
