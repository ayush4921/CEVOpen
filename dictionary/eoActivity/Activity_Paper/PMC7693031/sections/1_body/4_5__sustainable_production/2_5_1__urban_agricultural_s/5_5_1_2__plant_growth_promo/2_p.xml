<p>In the field of PGPB and their application as bio-fertilizers, commercial inoculants are formulated with 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic>, 
 <italic>Azotobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Gluconacetobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. Application of bacterial inoculants has been employed to improve plant growth and development, as well as crop productivity. Major PGPB-favored crops are sorghum, corn, rice, papaya, tomato and 
 <italic>Canavalia</italic> and constitute a source of proteins and carbohydrates with direct contribution to improve protein-energetic nutrition to humans and livestock [
