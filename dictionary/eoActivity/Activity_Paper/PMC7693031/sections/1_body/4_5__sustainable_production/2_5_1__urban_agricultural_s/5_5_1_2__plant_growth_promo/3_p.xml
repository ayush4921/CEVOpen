<p>In recent years, research studies on autochthonous PGPB developed in Cuba, revealed that several crops identified as functional foods because of their nutritious quality and antioxidant potential, respond very well to PGPB application, organic amendments and other eco-friendly agronomic strategies used in the urban agricultural system (

 <xref rid="B227-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>], revealed that these autochthonous PGPB positively impacted plant growth and development as well as crop yield through improving nutrient availability and consequently, nutrient uptake by the plants. On the other hand, the effects of PGPB on stimulation of plant antioxidant production have mainly been studied in fruit trees, herbs and vegetables.

 <xref rid="B188-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. This suggests that bioprospection studies of PGPB constitute an interesting area that could render new knowledge contributing to the elucidation of new metabolic routes for plant antioxidants production and the discovery of new antioxidants. Autochthonous PGPB applied as inoculants could also be valorized with innovative applications in the field of nutraceuticals and medicinal foods. Whereas the application of PGPB as inoculants is a promising “green technology” for increasing crop yield and quality, more research is needed on the impact of PGPB on plant secondary metabolism and bioactive compounds [
