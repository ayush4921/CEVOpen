<p>Besides improving seed germination and seedling performance of general crops, application of the MF technology to plants that are difficult to propagate, might be very useful. 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> (rosemary) is a model plant as nutraceutical due to the numerous antioxidants and secondary metabolites it produces under natural conditions. However, its seeds have a low viability, and under normal natural conditions their germination rate is very low. Furthermore, germination of rosemary seeds can take more than 35 days under certain conditions. By using an MF treatment (100â€“160 mT), a strong reduction in the germination time of the rosemary seeds was achieved [
