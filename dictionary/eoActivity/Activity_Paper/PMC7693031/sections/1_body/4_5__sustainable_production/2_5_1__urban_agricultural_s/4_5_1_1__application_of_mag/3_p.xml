<p>The use of MF technology is not only limited to seed germination and seedling performance, but can also be exploited for in vitro production of plant tissues to obtain bioactive compounds. Indeed, it was shown that MF technology in combination with other plant growth regulators, such as plant hormones, stimulated the production of secondary volatile metabolites with antioxidant activity in
