<p>Also for other plant species, similar improvements in plant developmental as well as nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical characteristics were observed when they were cultivated using MF-treated irrigation water. In 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> cultivated in these conditions, an increased stem length, a larger foliar area with an increased number of stomata, elevated concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, and increased secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity, such as phenols and flavonoids were noticed [
 <xref rid="B212-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Green beet (
 <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> var. cicla) and red beetroot (
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> var. rubra) are crops with a high potential as nutraceutical food, since they contain phytochemicals with considerable antioxidant activities that have beneficial effects on human health [

 <xref rid="B214-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. Higher biomass and fresh weight production were also observed for pepper and chickpea when plants were irrigated with MF-treated water [
 <xref rid="B215-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. These results clearly show the potential of MF technology in conventional irrigation systems to enhance the production of nutraceutical foods, as well as plant-derived pharmaceutical products with high antioxidant activity.
