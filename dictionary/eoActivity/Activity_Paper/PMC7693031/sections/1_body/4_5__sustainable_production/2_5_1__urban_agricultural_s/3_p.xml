<p>Urban and periurban agricultural systems developed in Cuba are a suitable platform to design and introduce innovative, sustainable agronomic practices for economically valuable crops. Innumerable positive outcomes of scientific studies have been transferred to agricultural practice and extended to different productive models implemented into the program, such as organoponics, hydroponics, family gardens, cooperatives, small-scale farmhouses and big-scale governmental farms [

In order to optimize the growth conditions for sustainable crop production, several technologies, such as application of magnetic field and plant growth-promoting bacteria have been adopted in Cuban plant growth factories as well as implemented in in situ crop production.
