<p>Plant growth performance can also be improved by plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and numerous recent studies reported their beneficial effects on economically valuable crops by increasing their nutritional quality [

 <xref rid="B216-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. The use of PGPB that enhance mobilization of macro- and micronutrients from soils and consequently, their uptake by plants, increasing nutrient content in plant tissues, gave birth to the term ‘plant probiotic bacteria’ [

 <xref rid="B218-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. Biofortification of crops using PGPB relies on the microbial abilities to increase the bioavailability of nutrients, their influence on pH, organic matter and their role in nitrogen fixation as well as mineralization of nitrogen and phosphorous from organic and inorganic complex substrates present in the soil [

 <xref rid="B220-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Consequently, a high content of these macronutrients in plant tissues improves the water status of these PGPB-colonized plants and facilitates solubilization of mineral elements like potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, boron and manganese [
