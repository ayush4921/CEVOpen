<p>Environmental changes and anthropogenic activities have deeply impacted ecosystems worldwide and also in Cuba, with repercussions on agriculture. In addition, agricultural practices have been directed towards mass production for a selection of crops leading to the loss of soil quality and mineral impoverishment as well as a loss of genetic diversity [

Facing the extreme events due to climate change and the vulnerability of agriculture to these alterations, diversity in genetic resources will promote resilience of the agricultural systems, and buffer social and economic shocks that might arise from concentrating on fewer crops [

In addition, plant biodiversity harbors a reservoir of secondary plant metabolites and based on their relevance for human health and plant protection, they have been already studied and exploited to improve crops and food products [

Therefore, on one hand more research is needed to develop new strategies for sustainable agriculture to improve crop yield and quality, without exhaustion of natural resources. On the other hand, improving our knowledge on Cuban plant biodiversity and their antioxidant potential can offer new strategies for (1) diversification of agricultural systems via the cultivation of local nutraceutical crops and herbs and (2) nature conservation policies (
