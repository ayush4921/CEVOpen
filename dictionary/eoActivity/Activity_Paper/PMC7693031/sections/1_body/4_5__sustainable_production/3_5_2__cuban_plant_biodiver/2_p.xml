<p>To investigate whether non-model and non-crop plants, such as many Cuban endemic species that are highly promising in the search for bioactive compounds, can be valorized [

In vitro plant (tissue) production to generate large amounts of natural raw material can be optimized, but it is pivotal to take the cost-benefit ratio into account. To further extend crop production in an agricultural setting, the use of platforms enabling translational research is highly recommended [

Using this approach, the experimental setups range from strictly controlled in vitro experiments to environmentally realistic in situ experimental plots. The application of agroecological processes, such as the use of MF or PGPB, in controlled experimental settings can give positive outcomes, and is an interesting approach to investigate the mode of action at different biological organization levels. Nevertheless, the positive outcome needs to be confirmed when different environmental factors come into play, when plants are grown in open-field conditions. As current scientific studies mainly focus on the impact of applying one agroecological practice on a specific developmental stage of the plant, future research should also explore the benefits of combining different practices to address the specific needs to optimally grow these plants in the environment.
