<p>In addition to the diverse agroecological cultivation methods to improve crop yield and quality, introducing native non-crop species into agricultural systems as a way to provide bioactive compounds and antioxidants has recently gained attention [

Integrating native plant species with potential nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical compounds into agriculture can be facilitated using biotechnological and agroecological approaches.
