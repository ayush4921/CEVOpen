<p>Many Cuban species, endemic or not, have evolutionary adaptations because they had to tackle different harsh environmental conditions for a long time and therefore harbor unique genetic characteristics/features [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As such, they are more resilient to abiotic stresses as compared to their mainland sister species. It is known that the increase in various environmental stresses unbalances the production of ROS and limits the activity of antioxidants, causing oxidative damage. Therefore, a greater production of antioxidants helps the plant to resist environmental stress [
