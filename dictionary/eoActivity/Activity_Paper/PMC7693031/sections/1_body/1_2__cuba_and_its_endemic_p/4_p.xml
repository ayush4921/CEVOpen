<p>To document the overall impact of the antioxidant research in Cuba, specifically in plants and related fields, a bibliometric analysis was performed in July 2020. A brief literature search was performed using the Scopus online database (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.scopus.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.scopus.com/</uri>) to identify Cuban papers indexed in Scopus with the following keywords: ‘antioxidant’ (=antioxida∗; anti-oxida∗) and ‘plant’. This strategy searched for papers containing the aforementioned words and its derivatives in their title, abstract, or keywords. Thereafter, these manuscripts were imported into VOSviewer for a bibliometric analysis based on keywords [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This bibliometric analysis focused on 2 groups of topic-related manuscripts, i.e., (1) plant-related manuscripts and (2) antioxidant-related manuscripts (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01048">Appendix A</xref>). These analyses demonstrate that the majority of scientific work on Cuban plants (group 1) is related to medicinal plants, the chemical composition of plant extracts and that antioxidant properties are the main analyzed biological activity. Of the total number of publications (3056), 94 were specific to endemic species, of which 
 <italic>Phyllantus</italic> and 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> are the two most studied genera. Concerning the antioxidant-related investigations in Cuba (group 2), the topics are centered around oxidative stress, and the main investigated compounds are flavonoids, highlighting the presence of the phenolic compound mangiferin (mainly present in plants of the 
 <italic>Mangifera</italic> genus). Of the total number of publications (699) in this second group, nine were specific to endemic species, showing that this type of plant is not well studied. Cuban flora is pharmacologically and chemically under-investigated, most probably because there are insufficient technological and human resources to isolate and evaluate metabolites of pharmacological and nutraceutical interest. Another problem is the collection of endemic plants from the wild, especially endangered species. Here, plant biotechnological techniques could offer a viable alternative.
