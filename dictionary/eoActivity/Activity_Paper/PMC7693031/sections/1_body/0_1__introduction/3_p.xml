<p>A plethora of evidence validates that antioxidants present in plant-derived products and foods encompass many biomedical applications. These antioxidants play a role in the prevention as well as in the complementary treatment of non-infectious chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome and cancer [

Antioxidants are classified in different categories, but low-molecular weight compounds like terpenoids, alkaloids and mainly polyphenols gained a lot of interest. Polyphenols represent a variety of pharmacologically active phytochemicals that are investigated mainly because of their ability to delay or inhibit oxidation processes as a consequence of some cellular pathological conditions [
