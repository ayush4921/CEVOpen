<p>In order to eradicate the preformed biofilm at the maturation stage (48 h biofilms), the plates were incubated for 48 h, the medium was changed after 24 h, and EOs were added at the same concentrations and at the last 24 h. Biofilms formed by bacteria that did not undergo any treatment were used as controls. Experimentally, the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C to allow for biofilm attachment and growth. The following day, the non-adhered cells were removed from each well, and the adhered biofilm was rinsed two times with PBS. Then, 200 µL of TSB (2% glucose) with final concentrations of the EOs equivalent to MIC was added, and the plates were incubated for 24 h [
