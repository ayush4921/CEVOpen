<p>The ability of MRSA to develop resistance to every antibiotic to which it is exposed makes it a problem to human health [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thereby the development of novel compounds is of great importance. Medicinal plant EOs have been largely used as a natural medicine to combat bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other pathogens [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Until now, about 3000 EOs are known, among them 300 are important for industries such as pharmaceutical, food, agronomic, cosmetics, and fragrance. In this work, we investigated the potential antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> medicinal plant EOs against MRSA clinical isolates by disc diffusion, MIC, and MBC techniques. The highest antibacterial activity was observed with 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EOs. This result is in agreement with the study of Lagha et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], who showed that 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> possessed the strongest antimicrobial effect against uropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in contrast to 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EOs. According to biochemical composition, the greater effect of 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> is owing to linalool (39.7%), which has a strong effect against bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Regarding 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> EO, the antibacterial activity can be attributed to the monoterpene alcohol, terpinen-4-ol, as a major compound (25.9%) [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which was found to be effective against MRSA [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. According to Cordeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], terpinen-4-ol has a powerful antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This compound functions as a bactericidal by obstructing the synthesis of the cell wall. Moreover, other main components such as terpinen-4-ol (11.7%), β-myrcene (8.6%) and γ-terpinene (7.6%) are present in 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> in addition to linalool (10.9%), γ-terpinene (16.9%) and α-terpinene (7.7%) present in 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> may enhance the antibacterial effect of these oils. Concerning 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EO, which showed the lowest activity against MRSA isolates, its antibacterial activity may be related to α-pinene (37.7%) as a major constituent. The study of Leite et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed antibacterial activity of α-pinene against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Other reports [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] revealed the antibacterial activity of some EOs against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria when α-Pinene is the major constituent. However, Utegenova et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] demonstrated that α-pinene had low activity against MRSA, indicating that other components were probably responsible. Among them, in this study, 1,8-cineole (4.7%) altered the structure of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> could be attributed to the synergistic effect of camphor (5.2%), verbenone (5.4%), and borneol (5.5%) in addition to α-pinene and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In general, whole essential oils have an important antimicrobial effect compared to the major compounds individually or collectively. This suggests that minor constituents are essential and may have a synergistic antibacterial effect [
