<p>MRSA were tested for their capacities to produce biofilm on polystyrene microplates and results indicated that 40% of the strains were highly positive biofilm and 56.66% were low-grade positive. Out of the 30 isolates, only one strain was biofilm negative, which indicates the high potentiality of the isolates to form biofilm. Biofilm, as a virulence factor that favors the chronicity of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> infections, is accountable for more 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of microbial infections [

 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The high ability of the investigated isolates to form biofilm confirms the fact that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the leading species in biofilm-associated infection.
