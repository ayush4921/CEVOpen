<p>Biofilm has been associated with medical devices and its treatment is becoming increasingly difficult due to the resistance to antibiotics and the immune system in addition to the spread of infection [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thereby, the development of new therapeutic strategies, such as EOs, to inhibit or eradicate biofilm is great of interest. In this work, biofilm inhibitory activity of EOs showed that 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> had the highest antibiofilm activity (antibiofilm effect on 89.66% of the isolates) against MRSA isolates followed by 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> that demonstrated activity on 79.31 and 62.06% of the isolates, respectively. EOs also showed a strong potential to inhibit biofilm, with percentage of inhibition ranging from 10.29 to 95.91%, from 10.20 to 95.65%, and from 11.67 to 91.48%, respectively for 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>. Based on our results, the oil with the highest growth inhibition activity was different from the oil with the highest biofilm inhibition effect, which indicates that the components involved in growth inhibition were different from those associated with biofilm inhibition. According to biochemical specificity, terpinen-4-ol present in 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> as major compound, has more inhibition of the biofilm formation process by MRSA isolates compared to Î±-pinene and linalool present, as the main components, in 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> EOs, respectively.
