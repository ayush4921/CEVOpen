<p>MRSA strains were tested for their potentialities to form biofilm on a polystyrene surface. 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00369-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicated that 96.66% of the isolates were able to form biofilm and were distributed as follow: 40% were highly positive biofilm producers with OD570 values ranged from 1.175 to 3.635, and 56.66% were low-grade positive with OD570 values extended from 0.113 to 0.87. However, out of the 30 isolates only one strain was isolated from the nasal sample was biofilm negative. Reference 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 was considered as a highly positive biofilm producer. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there is no significant effect of the specimen on biofilm formation (
