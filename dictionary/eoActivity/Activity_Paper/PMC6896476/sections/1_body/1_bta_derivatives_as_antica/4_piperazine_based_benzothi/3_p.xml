<p>Gurdal et al. synthesised BTA derivatives which incorporate piperazine moieties and evaluated their cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines such as HUH-7 (Heptacellular), MCF-7 (Breast) and HCT-116 (Colorectal). GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of these derivatives indicated that all compounds exhibited good potential against the aforementioned cell lines but the pyridine containing derivative 
 <bold>18</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>) had a remarkable cytotoxic activity with GI
 <sub>50</sub> value 7.9 µM, 9.2 µM and 3.1 µM for HCT-116, MCF-7 and HUH-7 respectively. Apoptosis caused by this derivative during cell cycle arrest at subG1 phase was confirmed by Hoechst staining and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis
