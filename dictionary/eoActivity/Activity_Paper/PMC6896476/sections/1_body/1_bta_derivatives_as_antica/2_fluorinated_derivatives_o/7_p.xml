<p>Gabr et al. obtained hydrazine derivatives by treating 2-amino-6-fluorobenzothiazole with hydrazine hydrate which was further treated with the suitable aldehydes to afford 27 different BTA Schiff base derivatives. These derivatives were screened for anti-tumour potential against Hela (cervical cancer) and COS-7 (kidney fibroblast cancer) cell lines. The hydrazine based benzothiazole

 <sub>50</sub> of 2.41 µM and 4.31 µM against Hela and COS-7 cell lines as compared to reference doxorubicin having IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.05 µM and 3.04 µM respectively. The SAR studies explained the effect of various substitutions on activities of all the synthesised derivatives. The scaffold present in 
 <bold>11</bold> has the 2–(4-hydroxy-methoxy benzylidene)-hydrazino moiety at the C-2 position which remarkably enhances the anti-tumour potential, whereas replacing the 4-hydroxy moiety with 4-methoxy decreased the activities against both cell lines
