<p>Bolelli etÂ al. synthesised 2-substituted benzothiazoles by the reaction of carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride which afforded acyl chlorides, further treated with substituted benzothiazole to give 2-substituted benzothiazoles, which were studied for their inhibitory activities against human glutathione transferases (hGSTP1-1). The benzamide benzothiazole derivative 
 <bold>43</bold> and benzamide methylbenzothiazole 
 <bold>44</bold> (
