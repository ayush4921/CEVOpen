<p>Wang et al. synthesised and evaluated 24 benzothiazole-2-thiol derivatives for antiproliferative activities against different human cancer cell lines such as A549, HCT-116, SW620, SW480, MDA-MB-468, SKRB-3, HeLa, SKOV-3, PC-3, BxPC-3, A431 and A375. Some derivatives exhibited better anticancer activities as compared to the standard drug cisplatin. The substituted methoxybenzamide benzothiazole 
 <bold>41</bold> and the substituted chloromethylbenzamide benzothiazole 
 <bold>42</bold> (
