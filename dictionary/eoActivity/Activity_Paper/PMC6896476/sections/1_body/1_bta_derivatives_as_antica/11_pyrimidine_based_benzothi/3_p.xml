 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0021">Figure 21</xref>) by refluxing BTAs with bis-methylthio methylene malononitrile, and tested their anticancer activity against 18 different cell lines. The scaffold 
 <bold>35</bold> possessed excellent anticancer activity with a good percentage of growth inhibition against lung cancer, breast cancer and renal cancer cell lines. The good anticancer activity of derivative 
 <bold>35</bold> is due to the presence of two methyl and one SCH
 <sub>3</sub> groups in its structure
