<p>Osmaniye et al. synthesised benzothiazole-thiazolidine derivatives and studied their anticancer activities against C6 and healthy NIH3T3 cell lines. Among the synthesised derivatives, substituted phenylthizolidene based benzothiazole 
 <bold>70</bold> and substituted nitrophenylthizolidene benzothiazole 
 <bold>71</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0042">Figure 42</xref>) exhibited some cytotoxic activities against C6 cell line showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 0.03 mM. The SAR studies showed that the presence of a phenyl group on the thiazolidine part of the structure increased the selectivity while substitution with an electron withdrawing or donating groups decreased the selectivity
