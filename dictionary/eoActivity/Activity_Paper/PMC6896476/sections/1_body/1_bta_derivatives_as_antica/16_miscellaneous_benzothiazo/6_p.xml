<p>Abdelgawad et al. synthesised thiazolidinone containing benzoxazole derivatives by the treatment of aminobenzoic acid with substituted aniline that further reacted in different steps under specific conditions to afford final product and studied their anticancer activities against breast cancer (MCF7) and liver cancer (HEPG2) cell lines. Among all these derivatives, nitrobenzylidene containing thiazolidine derivative
