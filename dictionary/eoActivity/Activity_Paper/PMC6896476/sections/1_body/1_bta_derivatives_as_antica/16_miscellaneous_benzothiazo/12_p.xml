<p>Yurttas et al. obtained benzothiazole derivatives by acetylation of substituted benzothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride that was further treated in series of reactions to obtain specific derivatives which were tested for their anticancer activities against lung carcinoma (A549) cell line. Derivatives
