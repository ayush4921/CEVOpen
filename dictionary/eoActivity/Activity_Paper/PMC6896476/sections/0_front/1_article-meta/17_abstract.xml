 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>Benzothiazole (BTA) belongs to the heterocyclic class of bicyclic compounds. BTA derivatives possesses broad spectrum biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-proliferative, anti-diabetic, anti-convulsant, analgesic, anti-tubercular, antimalarial, anti-leishmanial, anti-histaminic and anti-fungal among others. The BTA scaffolds showed a crucial role in the inhibition of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). In this review an extensive literature survey over the last decade discloses the role of BTA derivatives mainly as anticancer agents. Such compounds are effective against various types of cancer cell lines through a multitude of mechanisms, some of which are poorly studied or understood. The inhibition of tumour associated CAs by BTA derivatives is on the other hand better investigated and such compounds may serve as anticancer leads for the development of agents effective against hypoxic tumours.</p>
