<p id="p0150">Treatments applied in this investigation had a significant effect on the alkaloid concentrations of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum.</italic> The results obtained in this research agree with [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which state that 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> responds to biotic and abiotic stresses by controlling their influx of secondary metabolite concentrations. It was further noticed that root extracts of plants samples had more delta 7 mesembrenone and mesembrenone concentrations than shoots, while shoots had more mesembrine. Shoots had a higher content of total alkaloids than the roots.
