<p id="p0160">Compared with the mesembrine standard, shoots had an overall higher concentration of mesembrine than the roots. These results suggest that roots of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> should be harvested to extract delta 7 mesembrenone and mesembrenone molecules, while the shoots should be harvested for extracting mesembrine. These findings agree with [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which states that mesembrine is the major alkaloid in 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> along with minor alkaloids delta 7 mesembrenone and mesembrenone. Further studies would be needed to test how other methods of fertigation, various organic/soilless media and a combination of both would affect the concentration yields of mesembrine-type alkaloids when cultivating 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> in soil or hydroponics. More research is also required on how the fermentation of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> plant material affects alkaloid concentrations.
