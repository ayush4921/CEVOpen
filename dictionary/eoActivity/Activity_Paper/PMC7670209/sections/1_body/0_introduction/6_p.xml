 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> plant extracts vary, and higher concentrations of certain alkaloids can have different medical properties. Thus, this study aimed to determine an optimal protocol for cultivating 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> with an adequate concentration of total alkaloids, as well as the alkaloids delta 7 mesembrenone, mesembrenone, and mesembrine to produce consistent high-quality medicinal plants.
