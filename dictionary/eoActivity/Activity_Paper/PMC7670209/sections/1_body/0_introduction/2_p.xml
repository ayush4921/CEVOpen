<p id="p0010">In modern societies, plant-derived medicines are progressively becoming popular and generally embraced in traditional cultures globally as natural drugs and safe alternatives to synthetic chemicals. The biologically active ingredients locked up in plant tissues as secondary metabolites are the major drivers of plant-based treatments and are the target molecules by pharmaceutical, flavour, aroma, and agrochemical industries [

In addition, increased knowledge about bioactive compounds in medicinal plants coupled with sustained efforts on the analysis of micronutrients that are responsible for this bioactivity has led to the development of refined and purified dose-dependent chemical compounds as drugs [
