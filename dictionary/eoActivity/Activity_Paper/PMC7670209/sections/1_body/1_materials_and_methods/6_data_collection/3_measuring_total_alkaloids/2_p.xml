<p id="p0080">The total alkaloid content for roots and shoots were measured using the Bromo cresol green method based on an atropine standard [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For every treatment, 5 extractions were made. Extraction was done by placing 100 mg of plant material in 10 mL of methanol within a 15 mL lab-grade plastic tube for 24 h after which tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 min. One mL of methanol extract was transferred to a 50 mL lab-grade plastic tube with 5 ml of buffered solution (pH 4.7), 12 mL of Bromo cresol green and 12 mL of chloroform. The chloroform separates from the Bromo cresol green and buffering solution and if a yellow colour is observed it means alkaloids are present in the extract. The yellow chloroform liquid was then placed in a 96 cell well plate using a pipette, 3 cells per extraction at 300 μL and placed in a multi-scan spectrum reader. Extractions were observed at 417 nm, the wavelength for the colour yellow, and analysed with the software program SkanIt™ which measured the number of yellow pigments in a sample, that is, the total amount of alkaloids [
