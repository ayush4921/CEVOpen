<p id="p0065">Soilless medium treatments were prepared using four different soilless medium combinations, namely: 100% silica sand (SS); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and coco-peat (SC); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and vermiculite (SV) and a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and perlite (SP). For treatments SC, SV and SP equal parts of silica sand and coco-peat/vermiculite/perlite were mixed. All silica sand used was thoroughly rinsed with tap water until water poured through the sand ran clear.</p>
