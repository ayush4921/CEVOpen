<p id="p0070">Fertigation regimes were achieved by installing identical pumps to all hydroponic systems. The amount of aqueous nutrient solution delivered to each grow bed was controlled by adjusting all output valves until ±350 mL per minute was measured. Measurement was achieved by placing an empty bucket below each output for 1 min, the liquid captured in the bucket was decanted and measured using a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask until the amount of aqueous nutrient solution for each output was measured at ±350 mL for 1 min. Treatment SSFR3 was selected for the control, as it contained 100% silica sand, which was the base of all soilless mediums used in this experiment as well as a mid-frequent fertigation regime (see
