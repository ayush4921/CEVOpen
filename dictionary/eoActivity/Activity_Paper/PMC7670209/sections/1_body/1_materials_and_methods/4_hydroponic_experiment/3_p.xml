<p id="p0055">Each separate system was manually controlled to fertigate plants with the same amount of aqueous nutrient solution at different time intervals. The five systems were given aqueous nutrient solution amounts as follows: Fertigation regime 1 (FR1) was fertigated once a week at ± 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 2 (FR2) was fertigated every second week at ± 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 3 (FR3) was fertigated once every third week at ± 350 ml per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 4 (FR4) was fertigated once every fourth week at ± 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 5 (FR5) was fertigated once every fifth week at ± 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fifteen plants, one per pot were placed into each soilless substrate of each system, which totals to 60 plants per hydroponic system and 300 plants for the entire experiment. Therefore 15 replicates in a randomized blocked design were tested for each media and fertigation regime combination.</p>
