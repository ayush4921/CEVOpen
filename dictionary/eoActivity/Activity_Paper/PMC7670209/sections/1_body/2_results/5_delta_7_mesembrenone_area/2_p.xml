<p id="p0115">The effect of soilless media and fertigation regime on total alkaloid concentrations in the shoot of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. At p ≤ 0.001, soilless media SV yielded the highest concentration of delta 7 mesembrenone area (37.23%) under fertigation regime 4 (FR4) while the least value (10.85%) was recorded in SP medium under fertigation regime 3 (FR3). In general, roots had an overall higher concentration of delta 7 mesembrenone in terms of area % than shoots while shoots had an overall lower concentration of delta 7 mesembrenone in terms of area % than roots (Figures
