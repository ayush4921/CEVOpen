 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. The highest concentration of delta 7 mesembrenone in terms of area (52.37%) was recorded in the SV medium under fertigation regime 4 (FR4) while the least value (26.35%) was observed in SC medium under fertigation regime 2 (FR2).
