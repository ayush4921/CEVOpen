<p>Despite the potential therapeutic benefit, kratom has also severe side effects, that should be always considered when suggesting or only considering a treatment with kratom (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Among the most severe side effects have been described kratom associated hepatitis (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), seizures and coma (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), hypogonadism (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), hypothyroidism (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), fatalities (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and overdoses (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). It is important to underlie, however that most of these events were described mainly in the US and Europe (where Kratom was recently introduced), with a majority of the reported deaths involving the presence of other substances (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), such as benzodiazepine, opioids, antidepressant or antipsychotic agents, alcohol or other substances, e.g., Datura stramonium, cannabinoids, amphetamines (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and other contaminant such as O-desmethyltramadol (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).
