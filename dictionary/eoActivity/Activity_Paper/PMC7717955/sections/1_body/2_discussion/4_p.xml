<p>COVID-19 is a global emergency, and most of the clinical trials and research are dedicated to find effective treatments against the virus and the consequences of the infection. However, like many other viral and bacterial infections, COVID-19 infection is also associated with pain, aches and malaise and usually has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. The current treatment for these symptoms is based mainly on paracetamol and/or NSAIDs. These compounds, however, are not always effective or sometimes should be avoided. It is necessary therefore to consider alternative and more effective treatments that can provide immediate reprieve from COVID-19 infection.</p>
