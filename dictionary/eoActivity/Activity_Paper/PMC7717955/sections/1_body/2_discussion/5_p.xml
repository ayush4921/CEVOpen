<p>As far as we know, this is the first case report that aims to indicate the potential benefit of using kratom to mitigate COVID-19 related symptoms, as well as pain. Previous case reports mainly reported about the negative effects of kratom consumption that were linked to adverse events such as dependence/withdrawal syndrome, hepatic toxicity, seizures (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and fatalities (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A majority of the reported cases involve other substances that cast doubt on the causative contribution of kratom to the adverse outcome. However, the consumption of large amounts (more than 15 g per dose) and high frequencies (more than 3 times/day for extended periods of time) of kratom is ill advised, and can increase the risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects are rarely observed with the consumption of pure kratom products or brewed herbal decoction in different doses and frequencies among users in traditional settings. Though findings from numerous studies continue to support kratom's therapeutic potential chiefly for pain relieve, at this juncture, there is no solid scientific evidences to prove its utility. More controlled clinical studies are needed to identify the pharmacological properties, safety of kratom doses, and its efficacy with the current standard treatment for pain relieve.
