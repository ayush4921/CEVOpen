<p>The antinociceptive action depends on mitragynine pharmacology: the compound acts as a partial G-protein biased agonist of mu opioid receptors (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and also as an agonist at other receptors (serotonin, adenosine-2a, dopamine-2, postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The antinociceptive effects of mitragynine have been studied in animal models (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), and human data, derived mainly from surveys or retrospective studies in users, clearly shows that kratom is used for pain relief and to improve mood (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The exact dose-response relationship is still unknown, but an average daily consumption of 76.3â€“114.8 mg of mitragynine (equivalent to 3.5 glasses of kratom tea/ juice) seems to be well-tolerated among users in traditional settings (
