<p>The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.</p>
