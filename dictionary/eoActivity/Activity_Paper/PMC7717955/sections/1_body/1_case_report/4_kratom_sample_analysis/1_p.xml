<p>An established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample.
