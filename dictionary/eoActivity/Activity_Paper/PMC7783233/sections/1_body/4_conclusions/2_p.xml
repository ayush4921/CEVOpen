<p id="p0265">The data presented in this paper demonstrates that the ethanolic extracts of selected 
 <italic>Origanum</italic>, 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species are the ones with the highest polyphenolic contents, with 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> as the ones with the highest quantity of these compounds. Rosmarinic acid was found to be the most abundant in the investigated samples, followed by a flavone glucoside â€“ luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, both known to be excellent antioxidant agents, and their presence correlates with most of the displayed activities. Moreover, ethanolic extracts were the most active in DPPH assay, with special reference to 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> extract. Aqueous extracts, particularly the ones of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, were shown to be the most potential genoprotective agents. Methanolic extracts of both 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species showed the most promising antigenotoxic effects in prokaryotic model. Furthermore, all of the examined extracts significantly reduced the DNA damage caused by hydrogen-peroxide activating SSB rejoining pathways, with the emphasis on 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. chamaedrys</italic> aqueous extracts, which exhibited antigenotoxic potential even at the lowest tested concentration. However, the chemical complexity of the extracts, their synergistic and antagonistic relations, as well as the dilution of the active compounds in the presence of the less active or rather inactive ones, make the conclusions about their activities more complicated. The obtained results on the antigenotoxic effects on 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA1535/pSK1002 could be considered as the first report for the tested Lamiaceae species extracts. Finally, considering the growing demand for natural antioxidants on the global market nowadays, and also an academic interest in nutraceuticals with the potential to act against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress, the obtained results demonstrated promising properties of the investigated plants to improve human health. Consequently, this report provides experimental confirmation for the folk application of the tested plants, and also emphasizes the importance of preservation of traditional knowledge and biodiversity conservation.
