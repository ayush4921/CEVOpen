<p id="p0065">The phenolic compounds in the tested extracts were determined by comparing the retention times and absorption spectra (200–400 nm) of unknown peaks with the reference standards. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed on Agilent 1200 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with Lichrospher® 100 RP 18e column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm). The mobile phase A was formic acid in water (0.17%), while the mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The injection volume was 10 μL, and flow rate 0.8 mL/min with gradient program (0–53 min 0–100% B). Stopping time of the analysis was 55 min. Compounds were determined by comparing the retention times and absorption spectra (200–400 nm) of unknown peaks with the reference standards. The investigated samples were analyzed in triplicate.</p>
