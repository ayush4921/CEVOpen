 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL and left for 24 h at 37 °C to attach. The cultivation medium was replaced with FBS-free DMEM containing 50 µM hydrogen peroxide and different concentrations of extracts. The concentrations of extracts were selected based on the results of the MTT assay (0.025; 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL). To rule out the effect of solvents, methanol and ethanol were used in a final concentration of 0.35%. Treatments were performed, for at least 1 and no longer than 2 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm and eluted in 1 × PBS.
