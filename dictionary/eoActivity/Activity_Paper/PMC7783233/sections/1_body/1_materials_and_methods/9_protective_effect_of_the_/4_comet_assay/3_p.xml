<p id="p0105">Comet assay was performed in minigel format as described earlier (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Azqueta et al., 2013</xref>), with some modifications. Aliquots of cell suspensions obtained after treatment (30 µL) were mixed with 70 µL of 1% low melting point agarose. For each sample, 15 µL of the prepared mix was placed on slides pre-coated with 1% normal melting point agarose. Each microscope slide contained duplicates of negative controls and three concentrations of extract positive controls. Comet assay conditions were the same as previously described in details (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kolarević et al., 2019</xref>). For visualization, the gels were stained with 20 µL of acridine orange (2 µg/mL) per slide. A total of 100 nucleoids per sample were scored by fluorescent microscope (Leica, DMLS, Austria, under magnification 400×, excitation filter 450–490 nm, barrier filter 510 nm) using Comet IV Computer Software (Perceptive Instruments, UK) software in order to obtain values for Tail Intensity parameter (TI%).
