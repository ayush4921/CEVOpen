<p id="p0080">All experiments were performed in a volume of 15 µL of 1 × PBS containing 800 ng of plasmid pUC19 and plant extracts in the final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Solvent controls were included in experiments where the extracts were substituted with ethanol and methanol (final concentration in the mixture was 7%). Immediately prior to the irradiation of the samples with UV light, hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 3 mM. The reaction volumes were held in a cover of 96 well plate, placed directly under the UV lamp and irradiated for 3 min (540 J/m
 <sup>2</sup>) at 254 nm. After irradiation, 5 µL of 6 × loading dye (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue and 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol) was added to each reaction. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel prepared in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The positions of open circular form and closed circular form of plasmid were compared to the ladder λ/PstI (0.5 µg/lane, Thermo Fisher Scientific, SAD). Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 80 V, 300 mA for about 1 h, whereas bromphenol blue did not exceed 75% of the gel. Gels were observed on a UV transilluminator under ultraviolet light at 312 nm and photographed with a digital camera. The images were analyzed using software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Treatments were performed in three individual experiments.
