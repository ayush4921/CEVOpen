<p id="p0075">The effects of extracts on the protection of supercoiled DNA were studied against OH radical in a model system named plasmid relaxation assay (
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Russo et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, plasmid pUC19 was isolated from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> XL1-blue (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Birnboim, 1983</xref>) and was checked after 1 h electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel (0.5 × TBE, 80 V, 300 mA). About 80% of the isolated plasmid was present in the closed circular form, while about 20% was in the open circular (nicked) form.
