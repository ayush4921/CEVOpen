<p id="p0195">A vast majority of the extracts showed concentration dependent results, where the highest administered concentration showed stronger activity in comparison with the other concentrations. All of the tested extracts exhibited significant antigenotoxic activity at the highest applied concentration, with the exception of 
 <italic>Om</italic> aqueous extract, and also most of them had a significant antigenotoxic effect on 0.05 mg/mL. Additionally, 
 <italic>Ov</italic> and 
 <italic>Tc</italic> aqueous extracts showed statistically significant decrease of DNA damage in comparison with the treated control at all three concentrations (tail intensity values for 
 <italic>Ov</italic> aqueous extract at the concentration of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025 mg/mL were 16.96,19.09 and 20.37%, respectively, while for the untreated control it was 18.04% and for the control with hydrogen-peroxide it was 24.12%; whereas the tail intensity values for 
 <italic>Tc</italic> aqueous extract at the concentration of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025 mg/mL were 17.89, 21.21 and 22.11%, respectively, while for the untreated control it was 18.43% and for the control with hydrogen-peroxide it was 26.83%).
