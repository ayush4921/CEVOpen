<p id="p0190">Before testing the antigenotoxic potential of extracts against MRC-5 cells, MTT assay was performed in order to determine the effect of the plant extracts on their viability. The extracts were tested on three concentrations, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1Â mg/mL. In most cases, the viability of the cells was found to be about 100%, hence, the extracts did not show an impact on the viability of the cells. Additionally, the same concentrations of the extracts were used for the assessment of the antigenotoxic effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in MRC-5 cells by comet assay (
