<p id="p0130">The most excessive amount of phenolics was found in ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ov</italic>, followed by the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Om</italic> (129.25 and 82.60 mg GAE/g, respectively). The lowest TPC was observed in aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Tm</italic> (24.80 mg/mL). Only in the cases of 
 <italic>Ov</italic>, 
 <italic>Tc</italic> and 
 <italic>Tm</italic> ethanolic and methanolic extracts were significantly different from the aqueous ones (see
