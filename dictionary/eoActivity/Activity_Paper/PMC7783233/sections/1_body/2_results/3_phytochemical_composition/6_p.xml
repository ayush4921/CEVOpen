<p id="p0140">Alcoholic extracts at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/mL showed the highest TFC, while aqueous ones had the lowest TPC overall, but with no observed significant differences. Specifically, methanolic and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Ov</italic> had the highest TFC (22.49 and 19.36 mg QE/g). Once again, the lowest amount of TFC was detected in aqueous extracts of
