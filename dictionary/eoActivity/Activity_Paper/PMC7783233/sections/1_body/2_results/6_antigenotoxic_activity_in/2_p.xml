<p id="p0185">First of all, antigenotoxic effect of the extracts was tested on 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> TA1535/pSK1002. This bacterium is widely recognized as a sensitive system for the detection of genotoxic agents (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">KolareviÄ‡ et al., 2019</xref>). The results of a co-treatment of extracts with hydrogen peroxide are shown in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The methanolic extracts of both 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species significantly reduced the DNA damage at all tested concentrations (the induction rate for 
 <italic>Ts</italic> was 5.74, 5.49 and 5.28, while the induction rate for 
 <italic>Tv</italic> was 5.40, 5.26 and 4.81, while the induction rate for the negative control was 6.18). Moreover, regarding ethanolic extracts, 
 <italic>Tm</italic> significantly reduced the DNA damage at all three concentrations (the induction rate for 
 <italic>Tm</italic> was 5.14, 4.98 and 4.81) while 
 <italic>Ts</italic> and 
 <italic>Tv</italic> reduced the damage only at the highest and intermediate applied concentrations, respectively (the induction rate for 
 <italic>Ts</italic> was 4.65, while for 
 <italic>Tv</italic> it was 4.33, while for the negative control it was 5.96). Aqueous extracts did not reduce significantly the hydrogen peroxide induced DNA damage (the induction rate ranged from 5.53 to 8.77, while for the negative control it was 8.65). Methanol and ethanol used as negative controls did not have an impact on DNA (the induction rate for the methanol control at the concentration of 0.125, 0.250 and 0.500 was 5.26, 6.00, 5.75, respectively, while for the negative control it was 6.18; whereas the induction rate for the ethanol control was 4.59, 5.17 and 5.16, and for the negative control it was 5.96). In addition, in the next step of analyzing the potential of the extracts to reduce DNA damage, they were tested with the comet assay using eukaryotic cells.
