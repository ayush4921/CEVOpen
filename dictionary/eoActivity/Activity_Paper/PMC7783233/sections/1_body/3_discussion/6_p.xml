<p id="p0220">Apart from a report that acetone extract of 
 <italic>Om</italic> from Taiwan had higher FC than 
 <italic>Ts</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), which is inconsistent with our results, extensive literature survey showed that there is no available literature data on FC assay for the six investigated Lamiaceae species. However, giving that quercetin is one of the most common flavonol in plants, there are studies related to its presence in the Lamiaceae species. Namely, 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Skendi et al. (2017)</xref> reported that neither 
 <italic>Ov</italic> methanolic nor aqueous extracts contained quercetin, while 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> aqueous extract had a higher amount of quercetin compared to its methanolic extract (0.022 and 0.012 mg/g). Our analysis shows that 
 <italic>Tv</italic> methanolic extract has indeed more quercetin than 
 <italic>Ov</italic> methanolic extract, however it also shows that 
 <italic>Ov</italic> aqueous extract contains more quercetin than 
 <italic>Ov</italic> extract. Moreover, regarding the plants from Egypt, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Roby et al. (2013)</xref> reported 1.72% of quercetin in 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and none in 
 <italic>Om</italic> methanolic extract, which differs from our results only in the sense that 
 <italic>Om</italic> methanolic extract had only a slightly lower quantity of quercetin than 
 <italic>Tv</italic> extract. 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Proestos et al. (2005)</xref>, on the other hand, did not find any trace of quercetin in their methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Om</italic>, 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and 
 <italic>Tc</italic>. Regarding the plants from Croatia, 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Kulišić et al. (2006)</xref>, on the other hand, found that 
 <italic>Ts</italic> aqueous extract had higher quercetin quantity than 
 <italic>Tv</italic> (0.31 and 0.16 mg/g), while 
 <italic>Ov</italic> aqueous extract had even higher amount (0.70 mg/g), which is partially in accordance with our results, giving that 
 <italic>Ts was</italic> the most abundant in quercetin, followed by 
 <italic>Ov</italic> and 
 <italic>Tv</italic> aqueous extract. Once more, it might be hypothesized that different growing conditions (including insolation and other climate factors, as well as geographic region) play a major role in the chemical composition of these plants.
