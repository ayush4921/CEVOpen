 <italic>- Tv</italic>) were extensively analyzed for their antioxidant activity with the emphasis on understanding their deleterious effects of oxidative stress in acellular, prokaryotic and eukaryotic models. These plants were selected for research due to their frequent use in Serbian traditional medicine as teas and tinctures and in that form they can often be spotted on the shelves in supermarkets and pharmacies. 
 <italic>Om</italic> is previously reported by Serbian interviewees to be used fresh or as infusion against sore throat, pneumonia and as a sedative (
