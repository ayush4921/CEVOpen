<p id="p0010">Medicinal plants contain pharmacologically active secondary metabolites which exhibit beneficial health effects and are often used as therapeutic agents. Plant extracts containing metabolites such as polyphenols (phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and lignans) are proven as effective antioxidant agents. Since phenolic groups are able to accept an electron, relatively stable phenoxyl radicals can be formed, which consequently leads to the disruption of chain oxidation reactions in cellular components. Additionally, phenolic compounds may affect the activity of other endogenous antioxidants, or, on the other hand, absorb the pro-oxidative components of food (for example, iron). The consumption of plants rich in polyphenols may lead to the reduction of oxidative damage inflicted on DNA and also to protection of cell constituents against oxidative damage, which further reduces the risk of development of miscellaneous diseases related to oxidative stress (
