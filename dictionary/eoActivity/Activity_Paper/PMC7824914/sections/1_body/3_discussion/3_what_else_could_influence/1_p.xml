<p id="Par70">Considering that extrinsic factors were not able to explain free lists similarity, perhaps intrinsic characteristics of the free lists account for this behavior. Free listing has the reputation of being a simple data collection technique that allows information to be obtained quickly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], only requiring short answers, which would decrease the chance of the participant not concentrating on answering them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, the plant medicinal category is often a large domain. Kujawska et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], for example, studied rural communities in Misiones (Argentina) and found that the medicinal category presented the highest number of species and properties. Therefore, people trying to list all medicinal plants are essentially juggling several (sub)categories in their minds, which is much more taxing to the mindâ€™s executive functioning. For this reason, some researchers have argued that narrowing the domain could make the free lists more complete whereas general domains result in incomplete and scattered lists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The difficulties in successfully mentioning items within a large domain can be due to memory issues (as discussed before) and potentialized inatention in contexts of long-lasting interviews. For this reason, in situations when the elders are the most knowledgeable, their high number of known species can increase the odds for information omission during the free lists. This pattern may also have contributed to the lower free list similarities for the elders.
