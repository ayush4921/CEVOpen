<p id="Par62">Other studies suggest that the presence of third parties may interfere in the results. This may happen at the moment when responses are suggested to the interviewee, impairing the data collection, since the items must be said by the interviewee in the order that comes to their mind [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, the presence of a third person should be avoided [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], although sometimes it is not possible to prevent it. In this study, it was found that the interference of third parties did not influence on the collection of information.
