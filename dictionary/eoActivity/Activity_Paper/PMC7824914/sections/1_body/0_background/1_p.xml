<p id="Par5">The free list is an ethnographic method used to list elements of a given cultural domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], whereas cultural domain is understood as the set of cultural information belonging to the same category [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is widely used in ethnobiological research to list domain elements, in the order in which they come to the mind of the interviewee. Items are identified when the interviewee is asked to list everything they know that is in “X”, the “X” being the name of the domain to be questioned [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An appropriate question for using the free list to identify information in a category may be, for example: “which medicinal plants do you know for treating wounds?
