<p id="Par9">To understand what influences participantsâ€™ responses while collecting of ethnobiological data, it is essential to consider age because the literature has offered evidence of its influence on inventories. This is evidenced, for example, when capturing information about plant species, since memory lapses are more frequent in the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conversely, there are works that report elderly people as specialists and protectors of local knowledge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which shows they know a greater diversity of ethnospecies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and their applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, other studies have not found great differences in the knowledge of plants among the oldest and youngest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, it is often not possible to know if this lack of differences is concrete, as it could be related to a memory lapse effect that more affects the elderly during the interviews.
