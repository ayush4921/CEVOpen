<p id="Par12">The presence of third parties, during an interview, may be subject to biasing the data in some way, such as changes in participantâ€™s responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or by third parties interfering by offering suggestions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These changes in responses were confirmed in works developed by Boeji [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Aquilino [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], when researching marriage. However, although they were important to show the potential biases deriving from the presence of third parties, these studies were not ethnobiological. Thus, it is necessary to assess how much third party presence, simple or with interference, actually influences the content of free lists in ethnobiological research.
