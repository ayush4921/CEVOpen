<p>In another study on the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>A. africana</italic>, saline and ethanol extracts were found to be 85% and 90% effective, respectively, in stabilizing the membrane of bovine red blood cells against hypotonicity and heat lysis. This effect was comparable to that of a standard anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin at 1â€‰mg/ml [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Ukwueze et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of different extracts (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and butanol) and reported that for all the fractions, anti-inflammatory activities were not significantly different from those of indomethacin. However, significant positive differences (
