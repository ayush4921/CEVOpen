 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that weight and growth rate were significantly reduced in Wistar rats upon administration of leaf aqueous extract of the plant. Oyesola et al. [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] further noted reduced ovulation rate in a dose-dependent manner on administration of the aqueous extract of the plant, besides significantly causing fallopian tube inflammation, ovarian cortex degeneration, and uterine endometrial disruption.
