<p>Carene is a monoterpene that exhibits strong anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Carene demonstrated excellent dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced pedal edema [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ocete et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] further found that the anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>Bupleurum gibraltaricum</italic> was chiefly due to the presence of carene. The mechanism of action of carene could be interference or inhibition of processes involving prostaglandins or their synthesis [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Carene being one of the chemical compounds in

 <italic>africana</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) could be a contributing factor to its anti-inflammatory potential.
