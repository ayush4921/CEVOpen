<p>Another important chemical constituent in

 <italic>africana</italic> with significant anti-inflammatory potential is phytol, a diterpene alcohol [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Phytol significantly inhibited paw edema development in mice (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) induced by carrageenan dose dependently [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When 75 mg/kg of phytol was administered to the mice, 51.8% inhibition of paw edema development was recorded after four hours [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further, phytol caused a significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the leukocyte recruitment and neutrophil migration to peritoneal cavity in mice [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also observed that phytol significantly reduced interleukin-1
 <italic>β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) comparable to inhibitory effects produced by indomethacin. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect exhibited by phytol is partly because it inhibits proinflammatory mediators and reduces migration of neutrophil and oxidative stress [
