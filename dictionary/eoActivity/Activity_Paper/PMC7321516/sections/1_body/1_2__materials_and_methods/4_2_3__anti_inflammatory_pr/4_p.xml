<p>Tannins are a complex class of naturally occurring polyphenols, with most having the ability to precipitate gelatin and other proteins [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Tannins are classified primarily into three categories: condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), hydrolyzable tannins, and phlorotannins [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chemical analyses of different parts of 
 <italic>A. africana</italic> indicated that the plant, especially the stem, is rich in tannins (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of tannins include free radical scavenging and inhibition of the expression of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A number of studies have indicated that tannins possibly affect inflammatory response through their free radical scavenging activities [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hydrolyzable tannins obtained from 
 <italic>Myricaria bracteata</italic> had strong anti-inflammatory activity on ear edema induced by croton oil and arthritis in mice [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The study suggested that the anti-inflammatory action of tannins was linked to their potent antioxidant properties, and not their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) or on the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In other studies, phlorotannins demonstrated powerful anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of cytokine release and production of prostaglandin-E2 and NO [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Terra et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] observed that tannins reduced low-grade inflammatory diseases, including obesity, through the modulation of cytokine expression. Tannins are therapeutically important as anti-inflammatory agents and in the healing of wounds due to their astringent activities [
