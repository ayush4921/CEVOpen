 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene present in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic>, is known to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 
 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene significantly reduced paw volumes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and had low fluorescent signal intensity in mice [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further, Komakech et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] emphasized that the significant anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, along with its remarkable antimicrobial activity, possibly explain the effectiveness of the plant in wound healing. Another study on the effect of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene in human monocytic cells (THP-1), through COX-2 activity assay, demonstrated powerful anti-inflammatory activity by COX-2 inhibition [
