<p>The terpenoid, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, in the leaves of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory activity may be attributed to its potential to suppress mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) pathways, making it an important compound in the treatment of inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Pinene is also thought to contribute to wound healing by suppression of inflammatory reactions triggered by tissue injury [
