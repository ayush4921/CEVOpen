<p>Linolenic acid, one of the chemical compounds present in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), is also a potent anti-inflammatory agent [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It downregulates inflammatory iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> gene expression by blocking NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and the activation of MAPKs in murine macrophage cell lines stimulated by LPS [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Reifen et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] observed that 
 <italic>α</italic>-linolenic acid effectively inhibited IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>-induced inflammation through downregulation of the levels of proinflammatory genes mRNA, which included COX-2 and IL-8. Thus, the presence of linolenic acid in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> potentially improves the plant's anti-inflammatory property.
