 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Chemical analyses of the different plant parts indicate the presence of a wide group of therapeutically important classes of compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, sterols, phenolic compounds, and glycosides, most of which significantly contribute to the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant (
