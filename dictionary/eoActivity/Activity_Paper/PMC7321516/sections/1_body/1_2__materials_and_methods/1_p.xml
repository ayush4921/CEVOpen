<p>In this review, we modified the search process used in a previous study by Okello and Kang [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to obtain information on 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> from peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals. The focus of the literature search was on anti-inflammatory activities along with other aspects of the plant, including its botany and ethnopharmacological or traditional medicinal uses in different communities across Africa. Electronic databases, including but not limited to PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Science Direct, SciFinder, and Google Scholar, were carefully explored for relevant information. The key words used for the search were as follows: (“
 <italic>Aspilia africana</italic>” OR “Hemorrhage plant” OR “Wild sunflower plant”) AND (“Botany” OR “Plant part structures” OR “Plant part morphology” OR “Plant part descriptions” OR “Medicinal uses” OR “Traditional medicinal uses” OR “Ethno-pharmacological uses” OR “Ethno medicinal uses” OR “Diseases treated” OR “Ethno medicine” OR “Pharmacological reports” OR “Wound healing properties” OR “Anti-inflammatory activities” OR “Anti-inflammatory potential” OR “Phytochemicals” OR “Phytochemical contents” OR “Phytochemical compounds” OR “Medicinal plant part used” OR “Plant parts used for treatment” OR “Herbal medicinal use”). The obtained information was verified independently for reliability, and any inconsistencies were settled through discussions among the authors. The information was analyzed, compared, summarized, and appropriate conclusions were drawn.
