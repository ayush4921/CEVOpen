<p>Inflammation is a natural biological and complex reaction, typically of mammals, to a wide range of belligerent agents such as pathogens, parasites, harmful chemicals, and physical tissue injury [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Inflammatory response is a protective effort by the bodies of organisms to eliminate harmful stimuli and initiate the healing process in damaged tissues [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During inflammation, the body institutes a biochemical cascade that prompts responses geared toward healing the damaged tissue. Leucocytes become chemotactically activated, migrate toward the damaged tissue, and produce cytokines responsible for the induction of inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various cytokines and cells are involved in the early stages of defense, in an attempt to restrict tissue damage to the affected area [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Inflammation at the tissue level is characterized by certain events that include pain, swelling, redness, heat, and loss of function caused by local immune and vascular cell responses to injury or infection [

It is considered one of the main causes for the development of a number of diseases such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as central nervous system disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression [
