<p>Inflammatory diseases pose a global health challenge; thus, novel measures have to be considered to tackle the problem. Considering the challenges associated with the currently used anti-inflammatory drugs, it would be ideal to explore available natural remedies. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> is a plant that has been in use for centuries in the African continent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and other health conditions; therefore, it could be considered a potential candidate in the development of newer anti-inflammatory therapies. As previously explained, several studies have investigated the anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts. In this review, we did not come across studies conducted on anti-inflammatory compounds isolated from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> itself but reported the results of studies on other plants that contained the same compounds. Nonetheless, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> is rich in secondary metabolites with significant anti-inflammatory potential, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, sterols, and glycosides. Komakech et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] pointed out that the synergistic effects of these phytochemicals in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> could be responsible for its anti-inflammatory potential. We therefore recommend future studies on anti-inflammatory activity based on phytochemical compounds isolated directly from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> plant parts, such as flowers and leaves. Based on the variety of secondary metabolites coupled with evidence from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies regarding efficacy, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> could be more closely investigated for the potential development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics.
