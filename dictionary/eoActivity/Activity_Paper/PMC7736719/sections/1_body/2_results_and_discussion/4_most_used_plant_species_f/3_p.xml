 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> were with the second-highest RFC values among the 72 medicinal plant species traditionally used treating malaria in Papua Island, Indonesia. Based on this, these two species are the commonly used in the traditional treatment of malaria on the island. The tree of 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> is as high as 40 m with bark-like tessellated cork and grayish-brown color. It is a native plant from Australia, with wide distribution in Southeast Asia, China, India, Nepal, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and America [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The bark, flowers, leaves, and roots contain alkaloids as the most dominant compound, with approximately 180 types. Other typical compounds successfully isolated from the bark of 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> include several types of ditamine and echitamine alkaloids, chitenine, and echicaoutchin. The leaves contain anilinoacrylate alkaloids, scholaricine, dihydrocondylocarpine alkaloids, vallesamine, lagunamine, angustilobine B acid, losbanine, alstonamine, rhazimanine, akuammiginone, and other indole alkaloid compounds. These alkaloids contents and their derivatives determine the biological activity of these plants [

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Traditionally, 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> are commonly used to treat diseases such as fever, malaria, fever, diarrhea, dysentery, dyspepsia, abdominal disorders, skin diseases, pruritus, tumors, asthma, bronchitis, helminthiasis, as well as antidepressants, anticancer, antituberculosis, immunostimulating, hepatoprotective etc. Also, the plant is used in commercial herbs mixture Ayush, Ayurvedic, Siddha/Tamil, and Unani [

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Its antimalarial potential has been proven scientifically by testing it against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> K1 strain, with a very high activity category. The bisalole alkaloids, namely villalstonine and macrocarpamine, are the bioactive components of these plants responsible for these activities [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A research by Rezeki et. al (2012) showed the use of 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> in effectively reducing the levels of malaria parasites in some patients at the Local Hospital of Manokwari, West Papua. This treatment was also proven to reduce the clinical symptoms of malaria such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and diarrhea [
