<p id="p0160">The relative use of the medicinal plant species by traditional healers is shown through the Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) value. The assessment results showed RFC values within a range of 0.01â€“0.21. The highest RFC value was obtained from 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <italic>lstonia</italic>
 <italic>scholaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>arica</italic>
 <italic>papaya</italic>, each with a value of 0.21, followed by 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> at 0.12 and 
 <italic>Physalis mini</italic>
 <italic>ma</italic> at 0.10. The four medicinal plant species occupying the first four positions are the most widely used among the 72 plant species. Other medicinal plant species have RFC values below 0.10, ranging from 0.07 to 0.01. Generally, medicinal plant species with the highest RFC values are the ones abundantly used traditionally in the treatment of malaria in Papua. The abundant use of these medicinal plant species is an indication that the knowledge on the use of the plants is widely distributed.
