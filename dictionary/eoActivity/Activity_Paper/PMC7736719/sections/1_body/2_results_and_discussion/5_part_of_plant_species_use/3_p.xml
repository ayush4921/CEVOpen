 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Furthermore, each part of the plant has different effects depending on its chemical composition. Since the leaves are the center of photochemical reactions, they tend to store more organic resources which could be metabolized into secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoid, phenolic compounds, steroid and terpenoid [
