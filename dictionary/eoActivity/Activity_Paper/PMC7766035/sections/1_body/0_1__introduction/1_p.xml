<p>Certain edible mushrooms can be classified as medicinal, having many biologically active compounds for human health, due to their consistency [

It is important to point out that extraction is considered the first step in advancing the development of the main traditional mushroom-based remedies. Considerable efforts have been made by researchers to find the most effective extraction methods having better efficiency and providing extracts endowed with high bioactivity [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It should be noted that attempts are stilll being made to develop an extraction method that is suitable for mushrooms, applying different parameters for high efficiency [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many published studies have reported that ultrasonic extraction can improve the extraction rate of active biological heat-sensitive ingredients under low-temperature processing conditions, making it more effective than conventional extraction techniques [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The mechanical effect of ultrasonication causes the penetration of solvents into tissue cells, improved mass transfer, and tearing of the cell wall, which is favorable to the release of tissue cell content and can reduce the processing time and required amount of solvents compared to traditional extraction methods [
