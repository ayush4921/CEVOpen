<p>Mainly, the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> species is due to the presence of polysaccharides (Î²-glucans) and diterpenoids (hericenons, erinacines), but several authors have stated that there is a close link between the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> and the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has been noted that the biosynthesis of erinacine A in submerged culture can lower production costs because the chemical synthesis of diterpenoids is a long, multistage process and provides poor yield [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most scientific studies on the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> have described classical extraction techniques, although in the literature there are different modern methods of extraction. Therefore, an additional task of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extracts obtained by ultrasonic extraction. At the same time, given that study results have been contradictory concerning the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols with antioxidant activity in mushroom species [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], this issue has aroused our interest to investigate various physicochemical methods for the possible presence of these biocompounds. Besides this, the number of components with antioxidant effects was determined. It has been shown that the antioxidant effects of several mushrooms are also related to their total phenolic and flavonoid contents [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further, it is expected that the antioxidant activity is due to the high yield of extracted erinacine A as identified by HPLC. The extraction parameters (extraction time, ethanol concentration, and solvent/material ratio) were also investigated to maximize the extraction yield in terms of the number of metabolites and to establish optimal extraction conditions. The response surface method (RSM) is an innovative statistical method used to optimize processing parameters. Therefore, RSM is used to speed up and optimize operating processes to reduce the required time, energy, and raw materials. The response surface methodology was applied to optimize the ultrasonic extraction parameters to obtain high yield and content of antioxidant compounds of HE. The main advantage of RSM is that it can reduce the required number of experiments and highlight the relationship between response and variables. This is the first report on the determination of erinacine A, as well as on the optimization of the ultrasonic extraction conditions of metabolites with antioxidant activity. In this work, we aimed to enhance the phenolic, flavonoid, and erinacine A contents and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass under ultrasonic extraction.
