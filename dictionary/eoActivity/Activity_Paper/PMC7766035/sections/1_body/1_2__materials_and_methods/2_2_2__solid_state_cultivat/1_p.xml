<p>In this research, the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass was developed on a solid culture medium under controlled conditions to obtain the diterpenoid erinacine A, and the antioxidant activity was investigated. The biomass was developed in the laboratory University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest (USAMV, Bucharest) for 21 days following an adapted protocol [
