<p>The reducing power of the ultrasonic extract was determined according to an established method [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reducing power. Evaluation of the reduction potency was performed by mixing each extract in different solutions. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 10%, 2.5 mL) was added to a portion of this mixture (5 mL) and centrifuged at 3000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was separated and mixed with distilled water (2.5 mL) containing 1% ferric chloride (0.5 mL). The absorbance was measured at 700 nm (Ocean Optics HR2000+ Spectrometer, Ostfildern, Germany).
