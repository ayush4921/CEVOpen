<p>HPLC analysis of erinacine A was conducted according to a previous study [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The retention time of erinacine A was approximately ~17.8 min at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 380 nm. Erinacine A was used as a standard as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A stock solution (1 mg/mL) of erinacine A was prepared in 70% ethanol. Standard solutions of erinacine A within the final concentration range of 1–25 µg/mL were prepared (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01889">Figure S1</xref> for the calibration curve).
