<p>Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to investigate the impact of three independent variables on the total phenolics and yield of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extract. The factors that influence the extraction quality are solvent concentration (%, X1), extraction time (min, X2), and the solvent–material ratio (mL/g, X3). The temperature was not taken into account in this experimental model because the extraction time started once the desired temperature was reached. The experiments were performed using the Box–Behnken Design (BBD). Three variables were taken into consideration to optimize the best combination of extraction parameters for extract yield and total phenolic content. The complete design was performed in random order, involving 17 experiments, including 5 replicates at the central point (Table 1). The analyses were determined by the following formula:
