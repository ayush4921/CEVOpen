<p>The free radical scavenging rate was determined by measuring the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) with L-ascorbic acid as a reference standard. For the DPPH assay, we used a modified procedure described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The lyophilized powder extract from 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> was dissolved in methanol (2 mL extracts and 2 mL Tris-HCl buffer) and mixed with 260 μL of a 0.2 mM DPPH radical solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The percentage inhibition was calculated according to the formula [(A
 <sub>0</sub> − A
 <sub>1</sub>)/A
 <sub>0</sub>] × 100, where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the absorbance of the sample.
