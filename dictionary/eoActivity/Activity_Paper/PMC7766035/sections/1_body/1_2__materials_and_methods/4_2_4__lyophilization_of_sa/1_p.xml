<p>The last stage consisted of lyophilization of the samples (Christ Alpha 1–2 LDplus, Osterode, Germany) to obtain a powder (permanently prepared, shredded as particles) of the fungal material. The aim of the lyophilization was to obtain high-quality extracts to maintain extraction efficiency, with a higher content in active principles due to freeze-drying [

The working procedure was optimized and consisted of subjecting the liquid samples in the Petri dishes (7 mm) to freezing at the vaporization temperature of −70 °C for 2 h and freeze-off at −55 °C under vacuum for 48 h. Vacuum in the enclosure was achieved at a constant pressure of 400 μBar. Finally, the material was restored to room temperature, resulting in a powder extract. An important aspect of freeze-making is that it limits oxidative changes in metabolites since the oxygen concentration is very low under vacuum.
