<p>It should be specified that temperature and time were controlled in order not to degrade biological compounds in the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass, and the former was maintained constant by circulating external cold water and using a T-type thermocouple. However, the temperature of the ultrasonic bath during the entire sonication period was kept as constant as possible by the addition of ice sheets. In general, ultrasonication increases the rate of a chemical reaction; the reaction conditions are easier to meet, and the energy consumed can be reduced [

Preliminary experiments enabled the range of ethanol concentrations (40–80%), extraction time (20–45 min), and solvent-to-material ratio (10–30 mL/g) to be fixed. It can be seen in
