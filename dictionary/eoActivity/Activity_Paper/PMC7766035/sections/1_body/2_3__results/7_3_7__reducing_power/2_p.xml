<p>The investigated mushroom dry extract possessed reductive capabilities, although inferior to ascorbic acid, quercetin, and butylated hydroxyanisole, used as standard antioxidants at the same concentration (0.50 mg/mL). The reducing powers of the extracts produced by ultrasonication with ethanol solvent gave high levels of absorbance. Thus, discrete levels of antioxidant compounds were highlighted.</p>
