<p>The ethanol extracts exhibited high contents of phenolics and high radical scavenging activity (DPPH scavenged, as a percentage). The results strongly suggest that phenolics and flavonoids are important components of the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extracts, and this could explain their high radical scavenging activity. Extracts of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> are free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants. It has been reported that antioxidant effects of a compound may be concomitant with the development of reducing power. Reducing properties are generally associated with the presence of reductones, which have been shown to exert antioxidant action by breaking the free radical chain via the donation of a hydrogen atom [

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> can control oxidative damage and can act as an antioxidant. Ultrasonic extraction of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> with ethanol resulted in relatively good antioxidant activity concerning the extracts described in these previous reports. Accordingly, Gursoy et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] noted that the radical scavenging activity on DPPH of methanol extracts from 
 <italic>M. rotunda</italic> at 2 mg/mL was 33.94 Â± 0.96%. The variation of the antioxidant activity in many scientific articles can also be attributed to the solvent used [
