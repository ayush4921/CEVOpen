<p>The ANOVA outcome on our extraction conditions, shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01889-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, revealed that the first-order terms of independent variables (X
 <sub>1</sub>, X
 <sub>2</sub>, and X
 <sub>3</sub>), quadratic terms (X
 <sub>1</sub>
 <sup>2</sup>, X
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2</sup>, and X

 <sup>2</sup>), and interaction terms (X
 <sub>1</sub>X
 <sub>2</sub>, X
 <sub>1</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub>, and X
 <sub>2</sub>X
 <sub>3</sub>) mostly affected the content of total phenolics recovered for 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This aspect can be explained by the prolongation of the extraction time, which accelerates the chemical decomposition of the bioactive compounds in the extraction process, resulting in lower extraction efficiency. Multiple regression analysis was performed on the data of response variables, such as the DPPH, TPC, and TFC content, as affected by the extraction conditions. Other authors [

The results indicate that healthy ingredients can be maximally extracted using the optimal solvents and parameters for mushroom extractions, thus modulating the difference in pharmacological effects. Indeed, our results indicated that there was a correlation between DPPH inhibitory activity and total phenolics due to the application of ultrasonic extraction. Thus, from this experiment we concluded that 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> can control oxidative damage and can act as an antioxidant.
