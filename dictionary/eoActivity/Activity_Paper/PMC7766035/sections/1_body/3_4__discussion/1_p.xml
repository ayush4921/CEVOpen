<p>Past research has shown that the biological activity of fungi can be attributed to polysaccharides, high-molecular-weight glucans [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids, which are responsible for cytotoxic and antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In order to improve the production and the recovery of such bioactive compounds, as well as the content of erinacine A, we modified the development conditions of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> mycelia in a bioreactor. Then, we used ultrasonication to improve the efficiency of extraction. It is important to also note the fact that not all extracts could furnish a dry product in powder form [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some extracts, particularly non-polar extracts, might lead to an oily product, so consideration should be given to optimizing the extraction method. In our experiments, we can state that our procedure led to a powdered fungal material that maintained and preserved the analyzed biocompounds, as well as the valuable contents of micro- and macroelements. It is known that the lyophilization technique maintains the highest amount of antioxidant compounds compared to other methods of drying extracts. These results were confirmed by previously published studies that showed that the lyophilization process is the most effective way to maintain a high amount of flavonoids in fungi [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The differences from other authors [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were likely due to the different conditions of development in the bioreactor of the biological material and the extraction process with ultrasonication.
