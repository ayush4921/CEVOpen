<p>Dried SPs were purchased from a local market (Daejodong, Seoul, Korea). For ethanol extraction (SPE), 100 g of dried SPs was precipitated with 900 mL of 99.9% ethanol in a shaking incubator at room temperature for 15 h. For water extraction (SPW), 100 g of dried SPs was soaked in 900 mL of 100°C hot water for 1 h using a reflux condenser (Reflux-A, Reservoir; LK Lab Korea, Namyangju, Korea). These extracts were centrifuged at 1,889×g for 15 min; then, the supernatant was collected and passed through qualitative filter paper No. 1 (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.22 μm syringe filter (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). The aqueous extract was concentrated using a vacuum freeze-dryer at –80°C (Unifreez
 <sup>TM</sup> FD-8; Daihan Scientific, Wonju, Korea). The concentration of SPE and SPW was 50 mg/mL.
