<p>Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using the method of 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2011)</xref> with modifications. Briefly, each yogurt extract (100 μL) was mixed with 100 μL of 1 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (Sigma-Aldrich); this mixture was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (200 μL, 1 N) was added to the mixture, which was allowed to react at room temperature for 90 min. The developed color in the mixture was measured using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments) at 725 nm. The TPC is expressed as gallic acid equivalent (Sigma-Aldrich). The regression line of the gallic acid standard was used to determine the TPC in yogurt extract as micrograms of gallic acid equivalent per milliliter (μg GAE/mL).
