<p>Total flavonoid content (TFC) was measured using the method of 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe et al. (2007)</xref> with modifications. Briefly, each yogurt extract (100 μL) was mixed with diethylene glycol (500 μL) and NaOH (50 μL, 1 N). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The developed color in the mixture measured using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments) at 420 nm. The TFC is expressed as quercetin equivalent (Sigma-Aldrich). A standard curve was generated using the quercetin standard solution, and the results are expressed as quercetin equivalent per milliliter.
