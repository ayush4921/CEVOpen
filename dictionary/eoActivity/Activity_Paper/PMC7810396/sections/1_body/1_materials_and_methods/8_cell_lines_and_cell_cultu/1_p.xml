<p>The human colorectal cell line (HT-29) used in this study was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). HT-29 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C under 5% CO
