<p>2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity was determined using the method of 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. (2018)</xref>. The stock solution comprised 7.4 mM ABTS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 mM potassium persulfate solutions. The mixture was prepared by mixing the two stock solutions at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and allowed to react for 16 h in dark. The ABTS solution was diluted with tertiary dH
 <sub>2</sub>O to the appropriate absorbance (7.00±0.05), which was measured at 734 nm. The ABTS solution (180 μL) was mixed with 20 μL of yogurt extract, and the mixture was covered with aluminum foil and placed in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 734 nm using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and percent inhibition was calculated using the following equation:
