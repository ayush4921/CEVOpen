<p>Pancreatic lipase inhibition was determined using the modified method of 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2007)</xref> using 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (NPB). Briefly, the enzyme solution was prepared by adding 30 μL of lipase solution from porcine pancrease Type VI-S (Sigma-Aldrich). This solution was composed of 10 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (pH 6.8) in 850 μL of Tris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 7.0). Yogurt extract (100 μL) was mixed with an enzyme substrate solution (880 μL) containing 10 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPB and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The absorbance of the sample was measured at 400 nm using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments) and was compared with that of the control buffer solution, without the extract. The lipase activity inhibition is expressed as percent inhibition and was calculated using the following equation:
