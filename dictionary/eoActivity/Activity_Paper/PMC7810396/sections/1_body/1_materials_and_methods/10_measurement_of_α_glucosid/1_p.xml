<p>α-Glucosidase activity inhibitory effect was determined using a modified assay reported by 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al. (2006)</xref>. Briefly, 50 μL of yogurt extract was added to 100 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing α-glucosidase solution (1 U/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) in 96-well plates. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 10 min. After pre-incubation, 50 μL of 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) was added to each well. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 5 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 405 nm before and after incubation using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments). The absorbance of yogurt extract was compared with that of the control, which was 50 μL of buffer solution. The α-glucosidase activity inhibition is expressed as percent inhibition and was calculated using the following equation:
