<p>SPE and SPW were added to sterilized milk (Maeil Dairies, Seoul, Korea) at concentrations of 0%–1.0% and homogenized using Homogenizer T 25 (Ika, Staufen, Germany) at 25°C for 10 min, and then pasteurized at 85°C for 15 min. Thereafter, the samples were immediately cooled to 43°C and inoculated with a commercial yogurt starter culture (0.02%, v/v) of lactic acid bacteria (Lyofast YAB 450 AB; Sacco s.r.l., Codaragok, Italy) containing

 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bifibobacterium animalis</italic> spp. 
 <italic>lactis</italic>. Yogurt added with 0% safflower extract was used as control. These yogurt samples were fermented at 43°C for 6 h and stored at 4°C until further analysis.
