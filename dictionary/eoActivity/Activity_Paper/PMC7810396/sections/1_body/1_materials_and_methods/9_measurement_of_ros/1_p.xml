<p>ROS were measured using the stain 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the cells were seeded in six-well plates, incubated overnight, and then treated with diluted yogurt extract for 16 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich)-containing medium for 6 h. The cells were then incubated with DCFDA at a final concentration of 10 μM for 30 min and washed twice with cold PBS. The plates were subsequently measured using the fluorescence microscope (Model IX71, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Photographs were captured using the Olympus DP71 camera and DP controller software (Olympus Optical). Finally, ROS were quantified using Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA).</p>
