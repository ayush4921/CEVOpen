<p>The viable cell counts in SPE and SPW yogurt during fermentation are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>. They ranged from 7.49 to 9.77 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/g) and 7.43 to 9.99 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/g), respectively. The number of viable cells in SPE was not significantly different from that in SPW yogurt. However, the number of viable cells in SPE and SPW yogurt was slightly lower than that in plain yogurt at the end of fermentation. It has been reported that in yogurt supplemented with cinnamon ethanol extract, the viable cell counts were marginally decreased at the end of fermentation (
