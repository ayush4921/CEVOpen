<p>The viscosity of yogurt supplemented with SP extracts at different concentrations is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">H</xref>. The viscosity of yogurt with SPE and SPW tended to be slightly lower than that of plain yogurt. The viscosity of 1.0% SPW and 0.5% SPE yogurt was significantly decreased compared with plain yogurt (p&lt;0.05). It is known that viscosity is related to the aggregation of casein micelles (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al. (2015)</xref> reported that the viscosity of yogurt supplemented with 5% freeze-dried mulberry fruit juice was significantly lower than that of the control. 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tseng and Zhao (2013)</xref> reported that the viscosity of yogurt supplemented with wine grape pomace was decreased; they suggested that this was probably because the addition of a high concentration of wine grape pomace into yogurt resulted in the breakdown of the coagulated milk. Furthermore, it has been reported that carthamin yellow from safflower significantly decreased whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and erythrocyte aggregation index, in an animal study (
