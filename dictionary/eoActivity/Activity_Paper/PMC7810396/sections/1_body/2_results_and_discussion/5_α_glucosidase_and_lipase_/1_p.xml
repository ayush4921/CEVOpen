<p>It is well known that α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase are involved in the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and lipids, respectively (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Elbashir et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, the activities of these enzymes were measured to determine whether SP could regulate enzymes related to diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. As shown 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, SPW yogurt significantly inhibited the α-glucosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of SPW yogurt on pancreatic lipase activity was the highest at a concentration of 0.5% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, these enzyme inhibitory effects of SPE yogurt were significantly lower than those of plain yogurt, except the α-glucosidase activity inhibitory effect of 0.1% SPE yogurt (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>; p&lt;0.05). The α-glucosidase activity inhibitory effect of 0.1% SPE yogurt was significantly increased compared with yogurt samples with other concentrations of SPE (p&lt;0.05). Several studies have suggested that various plants inhibit the activities of α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase (

(2018)</xref> suggested that the strong α-glucosidase activity inhibitory effect of these plants is related to their antioxidant capacities due to the presence of bioactive compounds including polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins. In this study, SPW yogurt had more TPC and TFC, and showed higher free radical-scavenging activities than SPE yogurt. Therefore, SP extract-supplemented yogurt might alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by downregulating the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and lipids.
