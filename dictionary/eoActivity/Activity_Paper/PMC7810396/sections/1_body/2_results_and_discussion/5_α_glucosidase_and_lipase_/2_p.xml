<p>Taken together, the number of viable LAB in safflower yogurt was similar to that the plain yogurt, which was more than Korea Food Standard (1×10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL) and the pH was 4.26–4.31, which were similar to that of the plain yogurt (pH 4.3). These results indicated that SP extract-supplemented yogurt had no negative effects on yogurt characteristics compared with plain yogurt. The addition of SP extract resulted in an increase in the TPC and TFC, which increased the antioxidant activity of SP extract-supplemented yogurt. The inhibitory effect on enzymes that are involved in carbohydrate and lipid digestion and absorption resulted in a positive effect on the regulation of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In addition, although the changes in the storage characteristics of SP extract-supplemented yogurt were not evaluated in this study, they were considered stable because there were no significant negative changes in the quality of yogurt stored at 4°C for 21 d. In conclusion, SP extract has potential application in the production of high value-added products, as it can enhance health benefits of various foods including yogurt. Further animal studies are needed to confirm the action mechanisms and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects to validate the potential benefits of yogurt supplemented with SP extract in managing weight and blood glucose.
