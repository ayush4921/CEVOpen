<p>The effect of SPE yogurt on intracellular ROS levels was determined in order to elucidate its antioxidant activity, through which SPE can protect cells against LPS-induced damage. LPS, a major component of bacterial cell walls, induces the production of inflammatory mediators such as ROS (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. (2016)</xref>, based on their study in LPS-induced hepatocellular (HepG2) cells, reported that SP yellow B possesses a high ROS-scavenging activity. As mentioned above, edible safflower yellow pigments are water soluble, and therefore, the ROS-scavenging ability of SPW yogurt with a high TPA and TFC was higher than that of SPE yogurt. Thus, these results demonstrated the antioxidant effect of SP extract-supplemented yogurt
