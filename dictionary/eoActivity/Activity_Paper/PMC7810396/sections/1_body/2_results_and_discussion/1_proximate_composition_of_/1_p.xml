<p>The nutritional composition of yogurt supplemented with SPE and SPW is shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The moisture content of SPE yogurt increased with an increase in the concentration of SPE added. The moisture content of SPE yogurt was 81.67%–82.13%, which was significantly lower than that of plain yogurt (p&lt;0.05). In SPE yogurt, the concentration of proteins, fats, lactose, and total solids increased with an increase in the concentration of SPE. The lactose concentrations in 0.5% and 1.0% SPE yogurt were 13.02% and 13.11%, which were significantly higher than those in 0% and 0.1% SPE (p&lt;0.05). The concentration of nutrients in SPE yogurt tended to be higher than that in SPW yogurt. In particular, the protein concentrations in SPE yogurt were 4.33%–4.40%, which were significantly higher than those of SPW yogurt (p&lt;0.05). The supplementation of yogurt with red ginseng extract changed the composition of yogurt, that is, with an increase in red ginseng extract concentration, the moisture content and protein and lactose concentrations increased (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Pires et al. (2018)</xref>, the supplementation of various plant petal extracts to yogurt marginally increased the nutritional composition such as protein and lactose concentrations, except the moisture content. Overall, yogurt composition was affected by the addition of SP extract.
