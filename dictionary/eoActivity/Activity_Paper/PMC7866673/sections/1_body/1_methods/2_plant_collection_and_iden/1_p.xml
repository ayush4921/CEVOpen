<p id="Par14">We collected plants at the medicinal stands and at one artisanal stand known for its selection of dry fruits and seeds with medicinal applications. Popular plants that we could accurately identify on the spot, such as 
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> L. (onion) and 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> L. (arruda), were not collected. We obtained oral informed consent from the vendors before buying the plants in the units in which they were sold. We documented vernacular names, date, price, and vendor’s names in a notebook. We asked for the vernacular names to be repeated several times for the correct notation. Following Albuquerque et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we made photographs of the specimens and close-up pictures of every plant in several angles, and we pressed the plants in a standard plant press to make herbarium vouchers. We either dried the specimens at home with a hairdryer, blowing hot air into a plastic bag opened at the end, in which the plant press was placed; or in the drying stove of the MG (TE-394/4, at 70 °C circulation and air renewal turned on). To disinfect our collections, we stored the dried plants in a freezer provided by the MG. After identification, we deposited all vouchers and specimen labels at the MG to become part of their collection and coded each plant according to the abbreviation of the first author: IPG.
