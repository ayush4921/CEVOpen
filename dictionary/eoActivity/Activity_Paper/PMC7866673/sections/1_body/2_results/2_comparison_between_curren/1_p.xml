<p id="Par22">We compared our survey to Van den Bergâ€™s medicinal and religious plant survey in 1984 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] listed 39 (75%) native and 13 (25%) introduced species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In our survey, we found 30 species (57%) that were also documented in 1984 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For these overlapping species, we documented three vernacular names not mentioned by Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Likewise, she documented four vernacular names that did not come up in our survey (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Overlapping vernacular names were used for the same botanical species or genus.
