<p id="Par31">We found a few vernacular names that had sub-Saharan African origins. Two of these directly refer to Africa: 
 <italic>alecrim-de-Angola</italic> (
 <italic>Vitex agnus-castus</italic>), native to the Mediterranean region, and 
 <italic>manjerona-de-Angola</italic> (
 <italic>Lippia thymoides</italic>), native to Brazil. The term Angola comes originally from Kimbundu, a Bantu language spoken in Angola, and it etymologically refers to a country of people from the Bantu linguistic group [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Although it is unclear when 
 <italic>alecrim-de-Angola</italic> entered into Portuguese vocabulary, 
 <italic>V. agnus-castus</italic> is used in Afro-Brazilian ceremonies in baths, as in the 
 <italic>Banho de São João</italic> (bath of Saint John), an Afro-Brazilian ritual during the commemoration of St. John in Belém [
