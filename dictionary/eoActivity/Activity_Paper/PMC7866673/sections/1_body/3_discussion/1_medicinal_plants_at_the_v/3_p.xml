We attribute this variation to our different methodological approaches due to our differing aims: while her aim was to document the most frequently occurring species, our aim was to find out the overall medicinal species diversity of the market. Because of these different approaches, a direct comparison of the species composition between studies remains problematic. However, this is inherent to studying ethnobotanical inventories over time and space [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. When comparing such historical ethnobotanical data, the only manner to overcome disparities in historical survey quality across studies is to clearly acknowledge differences in methodology. Our study highlights the importance of repeating market surveys, the necessity of establishing standard methodologies, and the exact documentation of the applied methodologies to ensure comparable results in future studies [
