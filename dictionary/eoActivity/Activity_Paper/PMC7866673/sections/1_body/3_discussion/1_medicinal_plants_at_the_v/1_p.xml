<p id="Par23">Our results give an up-to-date botanical inventory of the VOP, one of the largest open markets in South America, which is often quoted in ethnobotanical review studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likewise, we were able to complement other medicinal plant market surveys in the area that differ in species composition and richness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], providing a more accurate idea of the present diversity of medicinal plants in the area. Although subject of a previous ethnobotanical study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], comparison with our intensive market inventory resulted in differing degrees of overlap in species assembly and nomenclature.
