<p>Ganodermanondiol has also been reported by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for its inhibitory effect on melanogenesis by assaying its inhibitor effects on tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. The researchers pointed out the inhibition of activity and the expression of cellular tyrosinase, as well as of the expression of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), TRP-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), leading to reduced melanin production. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathway were also affected. These results make reishi the perfect candidate for the preparation of skincare products. An antiaging action of

 <sub>2</sub>-induced stem cell senescent model using human amniotic mesenchymal cells (hAMSCs) with a high expression of β-galactosidase, a senescence-associated marker. Ganoderic acid D inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and senescence-associated markers, such as β-galactosidase, p21, and p16INK4a, and enhanced telomerase activity through the activation of the PERK/NRF2 signaling pathway.
