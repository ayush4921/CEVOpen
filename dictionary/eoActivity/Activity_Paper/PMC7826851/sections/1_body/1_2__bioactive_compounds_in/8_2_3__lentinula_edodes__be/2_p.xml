<p>Lentinan is also able to act on the activation of inflammasomes, components of the innate immune system responsible for triggering inflammatory responses. This action is inferred from the results of a study conducted by Ahn et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] on myeloid cells, involving mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages treated with lentinan with/without inflammasome triggers. Lentinan was found to selectively inhibit absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation, upregulate proinflammatory cytokines, and induce the expression of inflammasome-related genes through TLR4 signaling. Moreover, assessing the effect of lentinan on mice treated with 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or lipopolysaccharide as an AIM2 or non-canonical inflammasome-mediated model, the researchers found that the polysaccharide reduced IL-1β secretion due to activation of the 
 <italic>Listeria</italic>-mediated AIM2 inflammasome, and also reduced endotoxin lethality by inhibiting the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome. An inhibitory effect of lentinan on tumor angiogenesis mediated by increased IFN-γ production was demonstrated in a study on the lung carcinoma cell line LAP0927 and colorectal carcinoma cell line CT26 [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The polysaccharide resulted in the upregulated expression of angiostatic factors and especially IFN-γ, as well as increased tumor infiltration of IFN-γ-expressing T cells and myeloid cells.
