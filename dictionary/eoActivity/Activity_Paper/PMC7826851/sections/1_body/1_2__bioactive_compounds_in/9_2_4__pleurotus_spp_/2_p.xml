Both treatments showed a marked inhibition of cancer cell viability and apoptosis induction, and a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl2 mRNA ratio; they also inhibited cell migration and affected homotypic and heterotypic cell–cell adhesion by inducing an increase in E-cadherin expression and negatively modulated the phosphorylation of both protein tyrosine and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2.
