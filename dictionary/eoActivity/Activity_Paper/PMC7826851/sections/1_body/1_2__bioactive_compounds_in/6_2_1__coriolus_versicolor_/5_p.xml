<p>PSK is a proteoglycan of about 100 kDa, with a polysaccharide-to-peptide balance of 40–60%. The carbohydrates are mannose, xylose, galactose, arabinose, and rhamnose [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since it is also composed mainly of β-glucans, its activities and mechanisms are similar to PSP, again demonstrated in vitro or in mice models. Krestin showed both direct and indirect cytotoxic effects on cancer cells in vitro. As shown by Lu et al. [

 <italic>neu</italic> transgenic mice and in mice carrying a defective TLR2 gene, the antitumor action of this compound is mediated by TLR2 in mice. It increased dendritic cells (DC)s and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased B cells, induced the secretion of Th1 cytokines and IL-2, increased IFN-γ levels, and promoted DC maturation (CD86+ MHCII; higher levels of IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 were recorded, as was the inhibition of tumor growth. Other research has reported similar results, such as the activation of cytotoxic T cells (TC cells), improved DC maturation, the increased production of IL-8 and other cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ) through the activation of T cell receptors (TCRs), enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression by tumor cells, the inhibition of tumor growth, and the in vitro reduction of tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], this molecule was also shown to improve insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia by regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines; a reduction in plasma triglycerides (TGs) and free fatty acids, the downregulation of the proinflammatory factors IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-1β, and the upregulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 were observed. Therefore, PSK could be an important adjuvant in the management of cardiovascular risk related to hyperlipidemia.
