<p>PSP extraction is done by boiling mycelia or even basidioma in water and further precipitation in ethanol. This protein-bound polysaccharide has a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa, has a polysaccharide-to-peptide balance of 90–10%, is highly water soluble, and its carbohydrates are mannose, xylose, galactose, and fructose.

PSP possesses immunomodulating, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects, as reported by several in vitro and in vivo studies and some clinical trials; it has also shown other physiological effects, such as liver-protecting, system-balancing, antiulcer, antiaging and learning, and memory-enhancing properties, as well as reducing adverse events related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments [

The immunomodulatory activity is due to the ability to a) act on cytokine release, b) increase the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6), histamine, and prostaglandin E, c) activate natural killer (NK) cells and enhance dendritic and T cell infiltration into tumors. These actions are attributable to the β-glucan component of the polysaccharide, as these compounds are known to activate various immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors (such as dectin-1, toll-like receptors TLR-2, TLR-4, and TLR-6, and CR3 complement receptors) [
