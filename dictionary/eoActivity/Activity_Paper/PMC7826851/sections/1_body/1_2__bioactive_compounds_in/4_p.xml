<p>Mushrooms are rich in proteins, which have cytotoxic and anticancer properties. Some of them are known for their characteristic and marked immunomodulatory effect. These proteins are indicated as fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) whose mechanisms of action can be diverse [

Proteins also include lectins, which bind reversibly to mono- and oligosaccharides with high specificity, recognizing and interacting with various carbohydrates and proteoglycans on the cell surface. They are involved in many biological activities, such as innate immunity and cell-to-cell interaction, and their immunomodulatory mechanism varies depending on the origin of the compound. They also have immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antiproliferative properties [
