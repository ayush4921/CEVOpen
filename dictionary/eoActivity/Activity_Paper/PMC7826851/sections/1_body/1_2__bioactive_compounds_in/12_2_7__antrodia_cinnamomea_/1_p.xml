This mycochemical was reported to have antitumor effects on human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, in which it arrested epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes by upregulating E-cadherin and occludin proteins and downregulating N-cadherin and vimentin proteins through suppressing their transcriptional repressor ZEB-1; it also caused induction of the ZEB-1 repressor miR-200c, associated with the transcriptional activation of p53, and the inhibition of cell motility and invasiveness [
