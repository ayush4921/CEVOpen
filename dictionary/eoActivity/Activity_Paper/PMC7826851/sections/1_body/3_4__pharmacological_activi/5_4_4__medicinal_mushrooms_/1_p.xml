 <italic>bisporus</italic>, or white button mushroom (WBM), to achieve in humans the effects of suppressing aromatase activity and inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation already established in vitro and in preclinical tests, Palomares et al. [
 <xref rid="B114-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] carried out the following dose-finding study: a 12-week course of treatment with 5, 8, 10, or 13 g daily of the fungal extract in postmenopausal women previously diagnosed with breast cancer but no longer undergoing treatment and who are recurrence free. Aromatase inhibition by aromatase activity (AA) tests and a decrease in free estradiol (FE2) and cytokine levels were the counted parameters. No subject met the predefined response criterion, but despite this, it was observed that FE2 tended to increase over the 12-week treatment period for the 5 g and 8 g dose groups, while it remained stable for the 10 g and 13 g groups; in the first two groups, AA testing also revealed a substantial increase in post-prandial peak, which decreased in the 10 g group and disappeared in the 13 g group. In addition, albeit without a clear dose–effect correlation, there were increases in IL-1β and IL-2, and a decrease in IL-6. The authors concluded that antiaromatase bioactive compounds were present in plasma at a consumption level of 10–13 g of extracts (corresponding to 100–130 g of the whole mushroom), but not in sufficient concentration to cause a significant reduction in estrogen, at least over the time period evaluated.
