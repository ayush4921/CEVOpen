<p>Still dealing with oyster mushroom, an interesting study by Jesenak et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] highlights the efficacy of pleuran in preventing morbidity in children due to recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs), while also outlining its complex immunomodulatory activity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial, 175 children with more than five respiratory infections were randomized to receive 5 mL/5 kg Imunoglukan P4H
 <sup>®</sup> (Nové Záhrady I č., Bratislava, Slovak Republic) syrup (10 mg pleuran and 10 mg vitamin C in 1 mL of syrup) or placebo (only vitamin C, 10 mg/mL) for 6 months. Blood samples and questionnaires were taken for 12 months. A higher proportion of the treated group compared to the placebo group did not suffer from any respiratory infection throughout the treatment. Furthermore, in the P4H group, there were significant reductions in the frequency of flu and flu-like disease and the number of lower respiratory tract infections, as well as a statistically significant modulation of humoral and cellular immunity. In particular, in the treated group, the concentration of IgG and IgM increased during the treatment period and remained heightened throughout the study; IgA increased more in the P4H group than in the placebo one; Immunoglukan was also associated with an increase in NK cells and prevented the decline in CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocytes.
