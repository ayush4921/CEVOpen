<p>Pleuran has also been tested for the management of herpes simplex virus type I infection, as the typical remedy acyclovir can cause viral resistance if used for long periods. Urbancikova et al. [
 <xref rid="B117-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the effect of this compound on the duration and intensity of herpes symptoms and the incidence rate and duration of acute respiratory symptoms and intercurrent diseases in HSV-1-positive patients. This was done in 90 patients randomly assigned to receive pleuran or placebo, and the study was divided into two phases: an acute treatment phase, lasting 10 days, in which either Immunoglukan P4H
 <sup>®</sup> ACUTE (300 mg pleuran, 160 mg vitamin C, 10 mg Zn) or placebo (160 mg vitamin C, 10 mg Zn) was administered daily; and a subsequent 120-day preventive phase, with daily administration of either Immunoglukan P4H
 <sup>®</sup> (100 mg pleuran, 100 mg vitamin C) or placebo (100 mg vitamin C). Active treatment resulted in a significant shortening of the duration of herpes symptoms. During the preventive phase, the duration and severity of respiratory symptoms were lower. In both phases, no side effects were observed.
