<p>Based on previous studies that suggested PSK could improve the survival of cancer patients when combined with chemotherapy, presumably through immunological mechanisms such as the induction of cytokines, regulation of Th1/Th2 balance, and inhibition of immunosuppressive molecules, Akagi and Baba [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] set out to test this product on advanced gastric cancer patients. Twenty-one subjects were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg tegafur/uracil (UFT) alone or 3g PSK together with 300 mg UFT daily for at least one year after surgery; immunological parameters were monitored and measured. Overall survival was markedly improved in the PSK group, with a 3-year overall survival of 62.2% compared with 12.5% in the untreated group. This result is possibly related to the observed reduction in CD57+ T-cells, known to indicate a poor prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, PSK is presumed to improve the overall survival of patients partly through the inhibition of CD57+ T cells.
