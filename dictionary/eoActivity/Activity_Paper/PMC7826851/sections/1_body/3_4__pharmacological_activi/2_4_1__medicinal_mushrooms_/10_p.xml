<p>The dietary supplement based on maitake Î²-glucans, with recognized immunomodulatory properties, is also known to stimulate hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production, and the recovery of peripheral blood leukocytes after bone marrow injury. Therefore, Wesa et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] wanted to evaluate the effects of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>frondosa</italic> extract on 21 patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by giving them 3 mg/kg twice a day for 12 weeks and measuring the following parameters before and after treatment: neutrophil count and function, the latter tested as endogenous or stimulated neutrophil production of ROS by flow cytometry. 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic>, the bacterial peptide fMLP, and phorbol ester were used as ROS activators. Maitake showed beneficial effects on MDS. It caused increased endogenous neutrophil and monocyte function and, compared to before treatment, an increased monocytic response to 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> and fMLP-stimulated ROS production response were detected afterward.
