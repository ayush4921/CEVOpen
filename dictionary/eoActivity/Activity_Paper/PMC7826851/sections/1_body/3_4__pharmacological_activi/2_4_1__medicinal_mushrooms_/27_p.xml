 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> (J.E. Lange) Imbach showed promising results against prostate cancer by reducing immunosuppressive factors. In phase I, a single-arm, unblended, single-facility trial involving 36 patients, Twardoski et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] observed that, following the administration of tablets of fungal extract (six mushroom dose cohorts: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 g/day), there was a decline in PSA level from the first few months of intake until it became undetectable. At the same time, there was an increase in baseline IL-15 levels, and declines in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The maximum dose level was capped at 14 gm daily, which was the highest dose that was thought to be practical to ingest over a long period of time, based on the number of tablets required.
