<p>Powdered mycelium of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>versicolor</italic> was evaluated by Torkelson et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] in a phase I two-center, dose-escalation clinical trial to work out the maximum tolerated dose when taken daily in divided doses for 6 weeks by women with breast cancer after standard chemotherapy and the recent completion of radiotherapy. Nine participants were assigned to three cohorts to take 3, 6, or 9 g of mushroom preparation (500 mg lyophilized mycelial powder/capsule). All three doses were well tolerated. Only nine adverse events were detected, seven mild, one moderate, and one severe (anxiety, probably unrelated to the treatment). The effects on the immunological system were also positive, with an increase in lymphocyte counts at 6 and 9 g/day, increased natural killer cell functional activity at 6 g/day, and a dose-related increase in CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells, unlike CD4+ T cells or CD16+56+ NK cells. Although this study showed the safety of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>versicolor</italic> at a 9 g daily dose, did not determine the safety and tolerability of higher doses, i.e., the maximum dose tolerated (MDT), and the sample size was very small.
