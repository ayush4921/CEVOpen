A mushroom extract (tablets) in doses of 30 mg/kg/d or placebo was administered to the two subgroups for six months, monitoring their metabolic, biochemical, and enzymatic profile, as well as parameters describing quality of life. In contrast to the placebo group, several significant positive effects were found in the treated group, such as the reduction of fasting plasma glucose level, reduction of total cholesterol, reduction of serum thyroglobulin and creatinine levels, decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and also of IgA and IgM, and the reduction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), whereas total protein content and globulin increased. Regarding quality of life, the treated group showed improvements in various aspects (quality of sleep, appetite, pain, mood, and gastrointestinal symptoms).
