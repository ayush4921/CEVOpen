 <italic>C. versicolor</italic> was tested by Chay et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] in an RCT with 15 severe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had poor liver function or were unsuitable for standard therapy. A dose of 2.4 g/d of the extract was used. Compared to the placebo group, the mushroom-treated group had a higher median time to progression (TTP) (2.5 months vs. 4.2), median progression-free survival (PFS) (2.5 months vs. 1.1), and median overall survival (OS) (6.5 months vs. 2.2). A decrease in interleukin IL-17F and MCP-1, and an increase in prolactin and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands were detected. Besides, there was an improvement, even if not statistically significant, in social, emotional, physical, and cognitive parameters, as well as a significant marked reduction in symptoms normally associated with disease progression, such as loss of appetite and pain. Therefore, this mushroom seems to be particularly promising for patients with palliation needs.
