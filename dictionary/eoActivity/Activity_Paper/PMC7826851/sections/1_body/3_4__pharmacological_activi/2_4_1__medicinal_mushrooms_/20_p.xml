<p>Back in 2010, Oka et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], wishing to confirm the cancer-preventive action of the water-soluble extract of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> mycelia (MAK) in vivo, conducted a no-treatment concurrent controlled study with 123 patients with colorectal adenomas who were disposed to undergo colonoscopy. They were given 1.5 g/d MAK for 12 months, after which they underwent a colonoscopy to detect the size, location, and macroscopic type of adenomas, then the data were compared with the untreated control group. In contrast to the untreated group, there was a significant decrease in both the number and size of adenomas in the individuals taking MAK, suggesting a suppressive effect of the extract on the development of colorectal adenomas and precancerous lesions of the large bowel.
