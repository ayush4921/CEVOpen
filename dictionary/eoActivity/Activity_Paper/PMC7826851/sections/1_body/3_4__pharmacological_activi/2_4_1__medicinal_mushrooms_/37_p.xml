<p>A dose of 3 g/d of AHCC was given for 1 month to seven patients suffering pancreatic, lung, or colorectal adenocarcinoma. At the end of treatment, there were consistent increases in neutrophils and the population ratios of CD3/CD4, CD4/CD8, CD8/CD3 (suppressor/cytotoxic), and CD3+/CD16+/CD56 NK cells, while lymphocytes and monocytes decreased. Thus, Î±-glucans were more effective on innate immunity (CD8, CD56) than acquired immunity (CD4), and exerted a marked modulation of NK cells, which are crucial for the direct destruction of neoplastic cells. No toxicity was observed.</p>
