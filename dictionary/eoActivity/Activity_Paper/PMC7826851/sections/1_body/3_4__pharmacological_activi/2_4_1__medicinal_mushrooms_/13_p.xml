<p>Glycoprotein PSK was evaluated by Ito et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for its possible influence on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in advanced gastric cancer patients after surgery. They compared two groups of subjects, one receiving only chemotherapy and the other immunochemotherapy with 3 g/day PSK for 19 months, in a total of 349 individuals. The two groups did not differ in their MHC class I expression. Nonetheless, within the PSK group, while MHC class I-positive patients had a relatively poorer prognosis than control patients, recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly higher in expression-negative subjects. Concerning the pN factor (number of lymph node metastases), expression-negative patients with pN2 or greater exhibited significantly higher RFS values. In contrast, for the factors pT (depth of tumor invasion) and venous invasion, no statistically significant differences were observed. The authors hypothesized the effectiveness of PSK adjuvant immunochemotherapy in MCH class I-negative patients and patients with advanced lymph node metastasis of pN2 or greater.
