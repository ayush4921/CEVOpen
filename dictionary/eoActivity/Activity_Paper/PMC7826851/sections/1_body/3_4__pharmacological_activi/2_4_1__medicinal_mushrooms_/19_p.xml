 <sup>®</sup> (Alpha s.r.l., Lodi, Italy) (a polysaccharide product from

 <italic>lucidum</italic>) three times daily for 12 weeks, a marked improvement in the quality of life was observed, as demonstrated by significantly higher Karnofsky scores than in the placebo group. Quality of life in general also improved significantly, regarding disease-related symptoms such as fever, weakness, insomnia, sweating, and coughing. Ganopoly
 <sup>®</sup>, administered at doses of 1800 mg/d three times daily for 12 weeks in 34 advanced lung cancer patients, also had positive effects on immunological functions, producing significant increases in plasma IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ concentrations, Cd56+, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) responses, and NK activity, as well as significant decreases in IL-1 and TNF-α [
