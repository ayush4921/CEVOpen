<p>A case study was reported by Inanaga [
 <xref rid="B112-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] about the treatment with HE of an 86-year-old subject with recurrent depressive disorder suffering mild cognitive impairment during antidepressant therapy with mirtazapine. After 6 months of the intake of HE extracts in the form of Amyloban
 <sup>®</sup>3399 (US patent pending. Mushroom Wisdom, Inc., East Rutherford, NJ, USA), both cognitive function and body weight were successfully restored. The supplement Amyloban
 <sup>®</sup>3399 was also evaluated by Okamura et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] for the treatment of sleep disorders in eight female undergraduate students through the daily intake of six tablets for 4 weeks, measuring sleep quality and general well-being status by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and PSQI. Anxiety and insomnia showed a decreasing trend, as well as the PSQI scores. Furthermore, after 4 weeks of mushroom intake, increased levels of salivary free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (free MHPG) were detected, with this considered an accurate index of chronic stress and depressive symptoms, thus reflecting sympathetic nervous system activity. Although this pilot study showed the ability of

 <italic>erinaceus</italic> to improve well-being, sleep disturbance, and negative mood, as recognized by the authors themselves, caution should be exercised in making conclusions, as the sample size was too small. Besides, the selected subjects were recruited in the month before a major national examination, so all complaints probably lacked the severity and chronicity of clinically diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders. A more recent randomized clinical trial was performed to assess how

 <italic>erinaceus</italic> can act on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and binge eating [
