<p>Choudhury et al. [

 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>ostreatus</italic> on the blood pressure and glycemic status of 27 hypertensive diabetic DMT2 drug-treated males. Capsules with sun-dried powdered mushroom (3 g/d; thrice daily amounts of 1 g) were administered for 3 months. A significant reduction of both SBP and DBP was detected, as well as of FGP and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), resulting in an improved glycemic status and blood pressure control. Moreover, no adverse effect on renal function was detected, as demonstrated by no significant change of plasma creatinine level.
