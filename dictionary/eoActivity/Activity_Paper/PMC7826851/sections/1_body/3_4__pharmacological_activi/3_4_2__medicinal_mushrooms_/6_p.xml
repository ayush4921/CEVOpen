<p>The cholesterol-lowering properties of an oyster mushroom diet were investigated for the first time in humans by Schneider et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In their RTC, 20 individuals with moderate untreated hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to take either a soup containing 30 g dried oyster mushrooms or a tomato soup as a placebo daily for 3 weeks. In the mushroom-fed group, significant reductions in TG concentrations and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels were detected, as well as a significant trend towards a lowering of TC values.
