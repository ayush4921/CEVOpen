 <xref rid="B98-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Agaricus blazei</italic> mushroom(ABM) extract was administered for 12 weeks at a dose of 1500 mg/d and then the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was evaluated. The administration of the ABM extract was associated with a significant improvement in insulin resistance, probably due to an increase in plasma adiponectin concentration, as this parameter increased reasonably in the ABM group and decreased in the placebo group.
