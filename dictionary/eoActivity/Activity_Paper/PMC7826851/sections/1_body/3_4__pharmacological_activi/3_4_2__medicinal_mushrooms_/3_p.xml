<p>No significant positive results were obtained by Klupp et al. 8 [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] when they investigated the effectiveness of reishi in treating hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk components of metabolic syndrome through a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. For this purpose, they selected a total of 84 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) and metabolic syndrome and randomized them to receive 3 g/d of

 <italic>sinensis</italic> (Berk.) Sacc, or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood glucose was measured in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but also other parameters like blood pressure, triglycerides, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), health-related quality of life, C-reactive protein, total High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A and B. Surprisingly, at the end of the treatment, reishi had not significantly influenced any of the aforementioned factors, thus not supporting the hypothesis of its possible use in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.
