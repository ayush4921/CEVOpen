<p>A further uncontrolled study was carried out by Choudhury et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] to investigate the effect of oyster mushrooms on the lipid profile of obese or overweight hypertensive non-diabetic subjects. After administrating pulverized mushroom capsules at a dose of 3 g/d for 3 months to 14 patients, significant decreases in plasma TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed. TGs and HDL-C also decreased, although not significantly.
