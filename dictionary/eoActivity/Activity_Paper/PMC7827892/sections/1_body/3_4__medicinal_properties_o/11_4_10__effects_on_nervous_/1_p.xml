<p>The effect of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys on the nervous system is summarised in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00197-t012" ref-type="table">Table 12</xref>. Tualang honey has been reported in several studies to improve memory and reduce depressive-like behavior in animals and humans. In noise stress-induced memory deficits in aged rats, Tualang honey administration was shown to protect against memory decline via enhancement of medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal morphology, possibly through the reduction of brain oxidative stress and the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration and cholinergic system [
