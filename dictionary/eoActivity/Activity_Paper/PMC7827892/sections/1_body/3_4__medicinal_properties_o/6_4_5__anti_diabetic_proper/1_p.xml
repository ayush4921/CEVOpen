<p>Only Tualang and Kelulut honeys were found to have an anti-diabetic effect in three animal studies [

 <xref rid="B110-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], as summarised in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00197-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Studies using a diabetic model of rat showed that Tualang honey possessed moderate hypoglycaemic effect [

 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], and possessed a synergetic benefit on glycaemic and metabolic profiles when administered together with metformin or glibenclamide [
