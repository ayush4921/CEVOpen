 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00197-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>. All animal studies reported a positive effect of Tualang honey on the cardiovascular system, whilst human studies reported varied results. Khalil et al. (2015) showed that the pretreatment of ischaemic rats with Tualang honey yielded significant protective effects on cardiac troponin I, triglycerides and total cholesterol. The authors contributed to improving the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Tualang honey [

 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Devasvaran et al. (2019) stated that in vitro Tualang honey could inhibit H
