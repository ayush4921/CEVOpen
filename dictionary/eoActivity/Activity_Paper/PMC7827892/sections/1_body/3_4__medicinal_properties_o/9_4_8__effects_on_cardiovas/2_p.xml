<p>A randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of Tualang honey and hormone replacement therapy for 4 months showed no demonstrable effects on blood pressure measurement, BMI and waist circumference. No significant difference was found in the lipid profile, blood sugar profile and bone density between the two groups. However, a statistically significant increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and FBS levels was observed in the honey-treated group at 4 months of the study compared with the baseline value [

A study on humans compared the effect of 20 g Tualang honey only and honey cocktail (a mixture of Tualang honey, beebread and royal jelly) for 12 months. Supplementation of Tualang honey only showed a significant effect in lowering diastolic blood pressure and FBS compared with supplementation of honey cocktail. However, no demonstrable effect of Tualang honey on the lipid profiles and anthropometric measurements was found [
