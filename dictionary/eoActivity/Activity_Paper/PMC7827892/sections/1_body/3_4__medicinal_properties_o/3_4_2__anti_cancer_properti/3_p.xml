<p>The anti-cancer effect of Tualang honey was successfully demonstrated in another three in vitro studies using the human breast cancer cell line [

 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These studies have shown that Tualang honey treatment-induced caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 activation and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in all tested cancer cells, indicating that Tualang honey-induced apoptosis occurred least via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway [

 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane in breast cancer cell lines increased when Tualang honey was used in conjunction with tamoxifen compared with treatment with tamoxifen alone [

Interestingly, Tualang honey was found to be cytotoxic to breast cancer cell line (MCF-7); it also protected non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cell line (MCF-10A) from the toxic effects of tamoxifen active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen by increasing the efficiency of the DNA repair mechanism in these cells, as evidenced by the increment in DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 [

Therefore, clinical trials may focus on Tualang honey as a possible adjuvant to be used with tamoxifen to minimise tamoxifen dosage and thus minimise the adverse effects. In a clinical trial, the combination of Tualang honey and anastrozole in decreasing breast background parenchymal enhancement in breast cancer patients was more successful than anastrozole alone [

Three-tier evidence from animal, in vitro and human studies demonstrated the benefit of Tualang honey in breast cancer, highlighting the potential use of Tualang honey as a natural supplement to chemotherapeutic agents used for breast cancer treatment.
