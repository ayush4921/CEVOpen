<p>Other various anti-cancer potentials of Tualang honey have been discovered through in vitro studies, including anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cell lines; this activity shares the same mechanism as in the in vitro study on breast cancer cell lines discussed above [

In another in vitro study, Tualang honey protected keratinocytes from ultraviolet radiation-induced inflammation and DNA damage by modulating the early biomarkers of photocarcinogenesis, thus providing significant protection from the adverse effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and a suggestion for its photochemopreventive potential [

These patients received either 20 mg of Tualang honey or 100 mg of vitamin C tablet for 8 weeks, in which the level of fatigue and quality of life were measured using questionnaires with additional measurement of white cell count and C-reactive protein level. No significant changes were detected between the vitamin C and Tualang honey groups for the white cell count and C-reactive protein. However, the Tualang honey group showed a substantial improvement in fatigue and quality of life compared with the vitamin C group [
