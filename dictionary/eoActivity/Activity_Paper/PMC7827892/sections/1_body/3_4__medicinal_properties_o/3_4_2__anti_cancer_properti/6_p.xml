<p>Anti-cancer properties were also exhibited by Kelulut and Gelam honeys. A study by Yazan et al. (2017) showed that 1183 mg/kg of Kelulut honey treatment twice daily for 8 weeks significantly reduced the total number of aberrant crypt foci, aberrant crypts and crypt multiplicity in colorectal cancer-induced rats [

 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A combination of Gelam honey and ginger produced synergism that provided an anti-cancer activity toward colon cancer cell through stimulation of early apoptosis (upregulation of caspase-9 and IκB genes) accompanied by downregulation of the expression of KRAS, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) genes, which are related to cancer cell proliferation [
