<p>Tualang honey also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties; pretreatment with Tualang honey reduced neuroinflammation by reducing the elevation of TNF-α, IL-1β, glial fibrillary acidic protein, allograft inflammatory factor 1 and COX-2 in the rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brainstem in kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus rat [

However, the anti-inflammatory properties of Tualang honey could not be translated to humans as a randomised controlled study demonstrated that Tualang honey supplementation has opposite effects on TNF-α and highly sensitive C-reactive protein, indicating the inconclusive effect of honey on inflammation amongst chronic smokers; thus, further studies are needed on other inflammatory markers or other study population [
