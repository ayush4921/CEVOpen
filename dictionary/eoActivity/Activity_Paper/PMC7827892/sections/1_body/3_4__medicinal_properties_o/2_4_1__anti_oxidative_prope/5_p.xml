<p>The antioxidant properties of Gelam honey were well demonstrated by animal and in vitro studies discussed above. However, future works should explore the anti-oxidative effect of Gelam honey on humans. The antioxidant properties of honey have been attributed to its phytochemical content, which is phenolic and flavanoid. A study reported that the antioxidant activity of several types of honey originating from different countries depends on the concentration of phenolic and flavonoid groups [
