<p>The antibiotic resistance of bacteria is increasing nowadays; thus, the discovery of alternative antibacterial agents is urgently needed. Honey has been reported in numerous studies to possess anti-microbial activity. Although the anti-microbial activity of honey has been effectively established against an extensive spectrum of microorganisms, it differs depending on the type of honey. The anti-microbial activity of Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys has been documented in various studies.
