<p>Many studies found that the antioxidant capacity of honey is strongly correlated with the concentration of its phenolic contents [

 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The phenolic content of honey comes from the plant that the bees feed on [

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Colour intensity is also associated with antioxidant properties. Numerous studies, including those on Gelam, Tualang and Kelulut honey, associated the honey colour intensity with antioxidant properties. Darker-coloured honey showed higher antioxidant activity and higher total phenolic content [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,

 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The present review also found that these three honeys have a high content of phenolic and flavonoid. Amongst the reviewed studies comparing the antioxidant properties of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honey, one study showed that Kelulut honey has the highest antioxidant properties in ranking after Manuka honey amongst Gelam and Tualang honeys [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By contrast, another study found Tualang honey to have higher antioxidant properties than Manuka, Kelulut, and Gelam honeys [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, the study also revealed higher free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity in Tualang honey than in Gelam and Borneo honeys [
