<p>Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity of honey is used to determine the botanical origin and purity of honey [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An electrical conductivity of less than 0.8 mS/cm indicates blossom honey, whilst more than 0.8 mS/cm indicates honeydew honey [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to the European Honey Legislation and the Codex Alimentarius Standards, honey’s electrical conductivity should not be more than 0.8 mS/cm. However, the Malaysian Standard Kelulut has not determined any range for an acceptable limit of electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys reported in this review is in a broad range of 0.74–1.51 mS/cm. Various factors, such as storage, time, temperature, water content and concentration of ions and minerals, were reported to contribute to the electrical conductivity of honey [
