<p>Honey from different botanical and geographical origins has different physicochemical properties and compositions that ultimately affect their biological properties [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous studies were conducted to investigate the physicochemical properties of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys. Twenty-two studies related to the physicochemical and content analyses on these selected honeys were found. These honeys have unique physicochemical properties mostly attributed to Malaysiaâ€™s tropical climate.

Considering Kelulut honey is a polyfloral honey, this review only included studies on Kelulut honey that mainly originated from the
