<p>An updated study to comprehensively analyse the benefits of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honey is still required compared to other types of honey such as Manuka honey which has been extensively reviewed. With the recent growth in the body of literature for these kinds of honey, assessment of Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys is needed to avoid future cross-studies or unnecessary research due to missed reviews of the existing research. In this review, relevant studies related to the medicinal properties, health benefits and physicochemical properties of Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys were identified and critically analysed. The findings showed that most studies reported the health advantages of honey consumption, whereas some reported disadvantages or no significant changes upon consumption. Furthermore, analyses of physiochemical-related research revealed that Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys have high-quality contents and excellent antioxidant sources.</p>
