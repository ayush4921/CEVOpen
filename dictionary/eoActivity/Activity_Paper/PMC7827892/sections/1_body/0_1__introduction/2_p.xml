<p>Tualang honey, Gelam honey and Kelulut honey are tropical rainforest honeys that mostly originated from Malaysia. The health benefits of these honeys have recently been gaining increased attention and popularity, as evidenced by numerous documented studies. Tualang honey is a wild polyfloral honey produced by 
 <italic>Apis dorsata</italic>. This honey is named after one of the tallest tropical rainforest trees, the 
 <italic>Koompassia excelsa</italic> tree (known locally as the Tualang tree), where bees build their hives. The bees collect nectar from plants in the tropical rain forest in the North-eastern region of Peninsular Malaysia in Kedah. This honey possesses anti-microbial, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects attributed to its high antioxidant contents [

 <italic>A. dorsata</italic> bees, which build hives on trees locally called Gelam, or 
 <italic>Melaleuca cajuputi Powell</italic>. Gelam honey is mostly obtained from the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia in Terengganu state. This honey may delay the onset of chronic diseases and infections and regulate the optimal level of enzymatic activity in the body [
