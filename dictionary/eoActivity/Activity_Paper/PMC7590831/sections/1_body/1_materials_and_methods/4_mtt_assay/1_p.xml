<p>The cytotoxic activity of n-hexane, DCM and MeoH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>on MCF-7, WEHI-164, and HUVEC cells was examined by MTT assay. Briefly, the cells in logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 96-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) at a density of 1× 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well for 24 h at 37 °C with 5 % CO
 <sub>2</sub> and treated with different concentrations of extracts (10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400 µg/mL) for 12, 24 and 48 h. Untreated cells and cells exposed to paclitaxel (0.5 µg/mL) served as negative and positive control, respectively. Then, 20 μL of MTT solution (5.0 mg/mL) was added to the cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed from each well and replaced with 200 µL DMSO and 50 µL Sorenson buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm using a microplate ELISA reader (BioTeck, Germany).
