<p>The number of viable cells in a cell suspension was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Briefly, 1× 10
 <sup>4 </sup>cells/well were dispensed into 96 well-plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then treated with same different concentrations of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts for 24 h. Untreated cells and cells exposed to paclitaxel (0.5 µg/mL) served as negative and positive control, respectively. At the end of incubation, the cells were trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the resultant pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS. Thereafter, equal volumes of 0.4 % trypan blue dye and cell suspensions were mixed and the number of viable and dead cells was counted using a hemocytometer (Weber, U.K.).
