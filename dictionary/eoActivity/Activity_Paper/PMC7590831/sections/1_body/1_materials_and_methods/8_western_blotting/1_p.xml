<p>The cells were grown at a density of 1×10
 <sup>6 </sup>cells/well in 6 well-plates and treated with 48-h IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of DCM and MeOH extracts for 24 h. Afterward, the treated and untreated cells (negative control) were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (1 % Triton X-100, 1 M HEPES, 5 M NaCl and 0.5 M EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method based on the bovine serum albumin standard. Equal amounts of protein were fractioned by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche, Germany). The membranes were then blocked with 4 % skim milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 h, incubated with anti-PARP (1:500 primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:1000) for 2 h at RT. After three washes with TBST, the protein bands were developed on X-ray film using ECL advance Western blotting detection kit.
