<p>Following treatment, total RNA of treated and untreated cells (negative control) were extracted using a high pure RNA isolation kit. RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA by RevertAid
 <sup>TM </sup>first strand synthesis kit for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers for the target genes (p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2) and the reference housekeeping gene β-actin were designed using the Primer-Blast tool from the NCBI website online (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>. qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and designed primers. Sequentially, qRT-PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of at 95 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The expression levels of target genes were normalized to β-actin and the relative fold changes were calculated using the ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[
