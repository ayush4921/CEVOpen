<p>The aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>were harvested from Sahand mountain, located in East Azerbaijan province, Iran. The plant was authenticated and a voucher specimen (2817) has been deposited at the Herbarium of Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The air-dried powdered aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>(1800 g) were subjected to Soxhlet apparatus and extracted sequentially with organic solvents n-hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), and methanol (MeOH). The extract solutions were then concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Heildolph, Germany) at 45 °C. Afterward, 20 mg of each extract was separately dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO, diluted with RPMI-1640 medium and sterilized with 0.22 μm syringe filters (Nunc, Denmark). Finally, 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>extracts were stored at 4 °C for further biological experiments.
