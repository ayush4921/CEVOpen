<p>Different species of medicinal plants are shown to exert remarkable anticancer activity through apoptosis without causing undesired side effects (Safarzadeh et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; Murthy and Alice, 2018[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is a vital component of various processes comprising normal cell turnover, embryonic development, immune system regulation, tissue homeostasis and chemical induced cell death. Dysfunction of the apoptotic cell death is powerfully associated with the cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. Hence, it is a validated strategy to evaluate traditional medicinal plants for their apoptosis inducing potential in cancer cells (Pistritto et al., 2016[
