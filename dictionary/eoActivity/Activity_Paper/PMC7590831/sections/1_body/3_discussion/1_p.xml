<p>Over the last few years, medicinal plant-based therapeutics have gained great attention in the treatment of cancer as they are more cost effective, natural, readily available and exhibit fewer undesirable side effects. In addition, the potential of plant-derived compounds to induce cellular apoptosis constitute a key event in anticancer activities of medicinal plants (Desai et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; Maqsood et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Ahmed et al., 2019[
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Herein, we performed a pilot study to firstly examine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of various extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> on cancer cell lines MCF-7, WEHI-164 and normal cell line HUVEC. The results demonstrated that DCM and MeOH extracts dose- and time-dependently inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells with little harmful effects on normal HUVEC cells, which highlight the selective cytotoxicity of these extracts. Furthermore, n-hexane extract did not show any inhibitory effects against cancer and normal cells. It is also worth mentioning that DCM extract exerted a cytotoxic activity more superior to that of MeOH extract at all tested time points. Thus, it could be concluded that high level of bioactive compounds of
 <italic> S. amplexicaulis</italic> may be in DCM extract. The other 
 <italic>Scrophularia </italic>species such as 
 <italic>Scrophularia atropatana</italic>, 
 <italic>Scrophularia oxysepala</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scrophularia frigida</italic> have also been reported to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells generally in a time- and dose- dependent way (Valiyari et al., 2013[
