<p>Cell death detection ELISA uncovered a remarkable apoptosis induction in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells following exposure with DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic>. Notably, the rate of apoptosis induced by DCM extract was much stronger than that caused by MeOH extract. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation detected by TUNEL assay also confirmed the results obtained from the ELSA. On the other hand, Western blot analysis exhibited that there was PARP cleavage in the cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts. The nuclear enzyme PARP appears to be implicated in a variety of biological processes such as DNA repair, maintenance of genomic integrity and apoptosis. It is a 113 kDa protein that is cleaved by activated caspase-3 into two fragments of 89 and 24 kDa. This cleavage is considered as an important hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis (Agarwal et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Pham et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). These results are in line with the cytotoxicity data indicating 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts as reliable apoptotic triggers.
