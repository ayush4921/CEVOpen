<p>In this work, we chose amphiphilic dihydropyridine derivatives as synthetic lipids and their structural analogues as objects to study pleiotropic activities. The cytotoxic properties of 3 types of amphiphilic compounds in 3 cell lines, namely, normal NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast), cancerous HT-1080 (human lung fibrosarcoma), and MH-22A (mouse hepatoma), were evaluated. The studied compounds could be divided into 3 groups according to their structural fragments: (a) 1,4-dihydropyridines containing two cationic moieties as a conjugated cyclic bis(
 <italic>β</italic>-carbonylvinyl)amino system and some structurally related compounds; (b) 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridones containing a cationic moiety as an isomeric 3,4-dihydropyridine structure with an additional intracyclic carbonyl group—a N-
 <italic>β</italic>-carbonylvinylamido system; and (c) 2-amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkylammonium derivatives as acyclic, open-chain 
 <italic>β</italic>-aminovinylcarbonyl systems. Lipophilicity of the selected compounds was characterized using log
 <italic>P</italic> and molecular topological polar surface area calculations. Evaluation of electrochemical oxidation potentials of the selected compounds was also performed.
