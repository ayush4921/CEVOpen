<p>Liposomes may induce oxidative damage to normal tissues [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation products not only are cytotoxic but may also perform and modulate signal transduction in cells [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the levels of ROS and the activity of scavenging/antioxidant enzymes in drug-resistant cancer cells are typically increased compared to nonresistant cancer and normal cells. Thereby, multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells may be more susceptible to alterations in ROS levels. Numerous studies suggest that compounds modulating cellular ROS levels can enhance MDR cancer cell death and sensitize MDR cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic drugs [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was concluded that unspecific elimination of ROS by use of low molecular mass antioxidants was not successful for disease initiation and progression. However, controlling specific ROS-mediated signaling pathways by selective targeting offers a perspective for more refined redox medicine in the future [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additional antioxidant activity (antiradical activity) could be beneficial as it would protect cells and organisms in case of oxidative stress or, in general, be involved in the process of redox regulation and master switch systems [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this way, 1,4-dihydropyridines, being a group of synthetic antioxidants, could be used for the modulation of cellular redox signaling. Lipids reveal cancer cell-selective cytotoxicitiesâ€”they are less cytotoxic in noncancerous healthy cells [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nonviral synthetic lipid vectors may interact with biomolecules through functional moieties (biosignature), resulting in biological impacts: intrinsic genomic and nongenomic effects [
