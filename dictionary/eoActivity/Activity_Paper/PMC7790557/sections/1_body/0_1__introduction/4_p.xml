<p>Our research group has developed liposome-forming cationic 1,4-dihydropyridine (1,4-DHP) amphiphiles capable of transfecting pDNA into different cell lines 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. To assess the influence of different molecular architectures on gene delivery properties, numerous 1,4-DHP amphiphiles were studied [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Besides, some of these amphiphilic compounds revealed anticancer activity in HT-1080 and MH-22A cells and antiradical activities (27–40% in DPPH tests) [
