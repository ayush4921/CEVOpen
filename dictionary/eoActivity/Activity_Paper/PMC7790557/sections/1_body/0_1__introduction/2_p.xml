<p>Lipids and liposomal agents as liposome-forming building blocks depending on their physicochemical properties can influence the immune system. For the development of new liposomal systems, it is important to perform analysis on the liposome-forming lipid properties with an emphasis on toxicity to healthy tissues and immune responses [

Synthetic cationic amphiphilic bilayers can act as gene, vaccine, or drug carriers; at the same time, they can interact with negatively charged prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, causing cell adhesion and loss of cell viability. Lipids and liposomes deserve to be investigated as potential drugs [
