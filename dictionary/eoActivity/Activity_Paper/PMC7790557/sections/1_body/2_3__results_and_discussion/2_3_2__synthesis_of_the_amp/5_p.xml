<p>The 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridones (DHPDO) possess various pharmacological properties as 
 <italic>α</italic>1a adrenergic receptor antagonists [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Rho-kinase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], P
 <sub>2</sub>X
 <sub>7</sub> receptor antagonists [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or G-protein-coupled kinase receptor antagonists [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Synthesis of 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridone amphiphiles 
 <bold>28</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold> was performed according to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch3">Scheme 3</xref>. In this case, Meldrum's acid was used as the second dicarbonyl component in a Hantzsch-like reaction with heterocyclization, with a corresponding 
 <italic>β</italic>-ketoester and a corresponding aldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate in refluxing glacial acetic acid [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The parent DHPDO solution in chloroform was treated with bromine affording the respective 6-bromomethyl-DHPDO, which on subsequent reaction with pyridine or N,N-dimethyldodecyl-1-amine in dry acetone yielded the corresponding amphiphilic DHPDO derivatives 
 <bold>28</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold>.
