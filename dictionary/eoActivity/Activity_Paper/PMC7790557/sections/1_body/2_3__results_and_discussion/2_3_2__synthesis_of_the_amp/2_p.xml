<p>Previously, 3,5-bis(dodecyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-DHPs containing cationic moieties were elaborated as synthetic lipid-like compounds having promising gene delivery properties for DNA transfection; the basic structure-activity relationships have been verified for the cationic 1,4-DHP derivatives as gene delivery systems, and it has been shown that the molecular structure affected their self-assembling properties, pDNA-binding ability, and properties of the formed 1,4-DHP amphiphile-pDNA complexes [

The final step was nucleophilic substitution of bromine in the 2,6-di(bromomethyl)-1,4-DHP by N-heterocycles or amines, which is facile and generally takes place in good yields.
