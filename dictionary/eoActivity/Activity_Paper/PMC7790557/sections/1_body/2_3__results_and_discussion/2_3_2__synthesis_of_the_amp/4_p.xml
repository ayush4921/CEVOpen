<p>The unsymmetrical 1,4-DHP amphiphile 
 <bold>23</bold> was designed for analysis of the influence of mixed perfluorinated and alkyl ester moiety substituents on the properties of amphiphiles. The 1,4-DHP 
 <bold>23</bold> molecule contains only one of the two esters as a perfluorinated ester moiety while the other is an alkyl esterâ€”the same as previous compounds. The synthetic procedure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>) includes a reaction between an enamine and benzylidene in diglyme with inclusion of n-butylpyridinium chloride as a phase transfer catalyst (PTC) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to affording the parent dodecyl 5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,12-heptadecafluorododecyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-phenylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate in 43% yield. Without the PTC, the yield was only 25%. Subsequent bromination with NBS formed the corresponding 2,6-dibromomethylene DHP which was used without further purification in nucleophilic substitution with pyridine yielding the unsymmetrical 1,4-DHP 
 <bold>23</bold>.
