 <sub>4</sub> according to the procedure elaborated by Turovska et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In some cases, the perchlorates were used for obtaining solid salts while the corresponding bromides existed as oils, and it was not possible to isolate them from the reaction mixture.
