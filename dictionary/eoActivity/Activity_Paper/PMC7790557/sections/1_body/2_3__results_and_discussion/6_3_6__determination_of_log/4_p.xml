<p>Nevertheless, TPSA never surpasses 90, so the compounds are prone to permeate cells; additionally, they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Among all tested amphiphiles, only for 1,1′-((4-(2-(difluoromethoxy)phenyl)-3,5-bis((propoxymethoxy)carbonyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(pyridin-1-ium) dibromide (comp. 
 <bold>7</bold>) was the TPSA value higher than 90, i.e., 98.34 Å
 <sup>2</sup>. This could be explained by the influence of the structure components of the compound. TPSA values for the other compounds were defined in accordance with the main fragments of the compound structures. So, for the other 1st group compounds—dicationic 1,4-DHP amphiphiles—TPSA values were in the 71–77 Å
 <sup>2</sup> interval; for the 2nd group compounds—cationic 3,4-dihydropyridone amphiphiles—TPSA values were in the 50–58 Å
 <sup>2</sup> interval with the exception of compound 
 <bold>28</bold> which had a TPSA value of 67.64 Å
 <sup>2</sup>; and for the 3rd group compounds—open-chain 2-amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkylammonium cationic moiety containing amphiphiles—the TPSA values were in the 52–56 Å
 <sup>2</sup> interval.
