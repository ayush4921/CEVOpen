 <italic>(2) Modification of Substituents at Position 4 of the 1,4-DHP Ring</italic>. Variations of several types of substituents in position 4 of the DHP ring of 3,5-bis(diethyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-DHPs were performed. Compounds with phenyl (comp. 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>), substituted phenyl (2-difluoromethylphenyl (comp. 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold>), trifluoromethyl (comp. 
 <bold>6</bold>)), and ethoxycarbonyl (comp. 
 <bold>8</bold>) substituents were obtained, but no significant influence on the cytotoxicity of the tested 1,4-DHP amphiphiles was observed. Introducing an HO-substituent in a phenyl moiety in position 4 of the 1,4-DHP ring gives comp. 
 <bold>18</bold> and 
 <bold>19</bold> which are 4-(4′-hydroxyphenyl) analogues of corresponding 4-phenyl-DHPs 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>, respectively. It was demonstrated that the introduction of an HO-substituent does not give a strong influence on the cytotoxicity of the compounds.
