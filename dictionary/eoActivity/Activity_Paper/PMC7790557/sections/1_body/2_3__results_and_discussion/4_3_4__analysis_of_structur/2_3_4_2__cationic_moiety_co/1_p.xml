 <italic>(1) Modification of Ester Alkyl Group</italic>. Same as in the case of 1,4-DHP amphiphiles also, pyridones with a short alkyl chain—the methyl group in the ester moiety and pyridinium in the cationic part of the molecule (comp. 
 <bold>28</bold> and 
 <bold>29</bold>)—were inert to tested cancer cells HT-1080 and MH-22A and demonstrated high calculated LD
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 2000 mg/kg. In the case of comp. 
 <bold>29</bold>, the influence of the N-substituent in the pyridone and, in the case of comp. 
 <bold>28</bold>, the influence of substituent in the phenyl moiety at position 4 of the pyridone cycle were not taken into account. Two other methyl esters—comp. 
 <bold>33</bold> and 
 <bold>36</bold>—demonstrated significant cytotoxicity on all the tested cell lines. This could be explained by the influence of the cationic moiety in the compound.
