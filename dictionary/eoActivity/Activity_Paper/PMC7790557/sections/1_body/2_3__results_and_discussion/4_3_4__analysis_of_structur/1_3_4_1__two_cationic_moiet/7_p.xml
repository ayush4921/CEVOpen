 <italic>(5) Change of Dehydrogenation Degree</italic>. Lipid-like pyridine derivative 
 <bold>27</bold>, as the oxidized form of compound 
 <bold>10</bold>, demonstrated very close cytotoxicity data to the corresponding dihydro compound 
 <bold>10</bold>, in all cases around 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, while basal toxicity on noncancerous cell line NIH3T3 is significantly diminished: comp. 
 <bold>27</bold> is not harmful at all (LD
 <sub>50</sub> is 3948 mg/kg). In this case also, the influence of the anion was not taken into account, but it may give an effect (ClO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> instead of Br
