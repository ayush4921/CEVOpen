<p>Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen atoms in alkyl chains of the 1,4-DHP amphiphiles decreased cytotoxicity of the abovementioned compounds. Thus, substitution of the 3,5-dodecyloxycarbonyl alkyl chain's most distant hydrogen atom by trifluoromethyl groups (comp. 
 <bold>22</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>) leads to lower cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines HT-1080 (10–18 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and MH-22A (10–19 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 3–6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and to higher cytotoxicity to noncancerous cell line NIH3T3 (771 mg/kg versus 1482 mg/kg). In this case, the influence of the anion was not taken into account, but that also could give an effect. Substitution of seven methylene groups of a 3-dodecyloxy moiety by seven difluoromethylene groups leads to the formation of an unsymmetrical 1,4-DHP amphiphile 
 <bold>23</bold>, which has lower cytotoxicity to the studied cancer and normal cell lines (comp. 
 <bold>23</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>)—a cytotoxicity of around 47–75 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 3–6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on cancer cell lines and LD
 <sub>50</sub> 3448 mg/kg versus 1482 mg/kg, respectively. Further substitution of the next seven methylene groups by seven difluoromethylene groups (comp. 
 <bold>24</bold>) leads to subsequent diminishing of cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines (around 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and also low calculated toxicity to noncancerous cell line NIH3T3 (&gt;2000 mg/kg). In the case of the more extended partially fluorinated 3,5-heptadecafluorononadecyl chains (comp. 
 <bold>25</bold>), the compounds revealed undetectable toxicity to the two cancer cell lines and also low toxicity to the noncancerous cell line NIH3T3. So, from the obtained results (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it is evident that the perfluorinated 1,4-DHP amphiphiles (compounds 
 <bold>23</bold>–
 <bold>25</bold>) are nontoxic in the tested cell lines.
