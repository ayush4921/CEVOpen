<p>Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen atoms in the alkyl chain of the pyridone amphiphiles did not give a strong influence on the cytotoxicity of the compounds, and it seems that this also was dependent on the cationic moiety and other substituents of the compound. So, in the case of 4-unsubstituted pyridones with the N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moiety, comp. 
 <bold>37</bold> with hydrogen atoms in the ester moiety and comp. 
 <bold>38</bold> with fluorine atoms in the ester moiety demonstrated similar cytotoxicity in all of the tested cell lines, while for cytotoxicity of 4-phenyl pyridones with N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moiety, comp. 
 <bold>34</bold> with hydrogen atoms in the ester moiety versus comp. 
 <bold>35</bold> with fluorine atoms in the NIH3T3 cells was two times higher (346 mg/kg versus 898 mg/kg, respectively).
