 <italic>(4) Modification of the Cationic Moiety</italic>. It is demonstrated that the dihydropyridone amphiphile 
 <bold>30</bold> with a triphenylphosphonium polar head group was about 3 times less cytotoxic than the analogous dihydropyridone 
 <bold>31</bold> with a pyridinium head group in the NIH3T3 cells, i.e., 1779 mg/kg versus 604 mg/kg. Change of pyridinium to N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moiety as the cationic head group of dihydropyridone—comp. 
 <bold>31</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>35</bold>—led to a slightly diminished cytotoxicity on cells in the case of comp. 
 <bold>35</bold>. In this case, we observed the opposite relationship as for 1,4-DHP amphiphiles where it was demonstrated that quaternary ammonium surfactants are more toxic than their heterocyclic analogues. Toxicity of cationic lipids may be connected with the structure of their head groups [
