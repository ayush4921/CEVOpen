<p>Compounds from the 2nd group—amphiphilic 3,4-dihydropyridone derivatives with a pyridinium methylene moiety in position 6—have more positive electrooxidation potential. So, the unsubstituted at position 4 pyridone derivative 
 <bold>29</bold> has an electrooxidation potential of 2.35 V. A compound possessing a phenyl substituent at position 4 and a 5-heptadecylfluorododecylcarboxy moiety in position 5 (comp. 
 <bold>38</bold>) has a slightly lower oxidation potential (2.04 V), while the parent 4-unsubstituted or 4-phenyl-substituted 3,4-dihydropyridone derivatives without cationic moiety in position 6 have electrooxidation potentials of 1.52–1.64 V [
