<p>Compounds from the 1st group, containing cationic pyridinium methylene groups in positions 2 and 6 in the 1,4-DHP ring, have electrooxidation potentials of 1.57–1.58 V both in the case of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl- and 3,5-didodecyloxycarbonyl-1,4-DHPs (comp. 
 <bold>1</bold> and comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>). This is also in agreement with our previous results, where the electrochemical oxidation potential of comp. 
 <bold>1</bold> was determined as 1.7 V and electrochemical oxidation of this compound was demonstrated as a two-electron process [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Introduction of the CF
 <sub>3</sub> groups at the 
 <italic>ɷ</italic>-carbon atom of a dodecyl chain in the ester moieties (comp. 
 <bold>18</bold>) does not change the value of the electrooxidation potential, which is also 1.57 V. On the contrary, the addition of a CF
 <sub>3</sub> group in the pyridinium moiety in the 2 and 6 positions of the 1,4-DHP cycle (comp. 
 <bold>21</bold>) leads to a slight increase of the electrooxidation potential (1.63 V). Moreover, a change of the 17 terminal H atoms to F atoms in one or both dodecyl chains leads to a further increase of the electrooxidation potential of 1.69–1.70 V (comp. 
 <bold>23</bold> and comp. 
 <bold>24</bold>). It should be noted that the parent compounds—1,4-DHP derivatives without cationic moieties—demonstrated lower electrooxidation potentials. Thus, 4-phenyl-substituted Hantzsch 1,4-dihydropyridine has a 1.08 V potential on a glassy carbon electrode [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the other 4-aryl-substituted 1,4-DHPs have 1.11 V potentials [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], but 4-monoalkyl-substituted 1,4-dihydropyridines at the same conditions have 1.01–1.03 V oxidation potentials [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
