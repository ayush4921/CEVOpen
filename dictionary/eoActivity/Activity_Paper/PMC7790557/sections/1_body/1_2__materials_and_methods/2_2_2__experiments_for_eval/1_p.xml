<p>Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out on a PARSTAT 2273 electrochemical system. A stationary glassy carbon disk electrode (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.5 mm) served as the working electrode, while the counterelectrode was a Pt wire. The oxidation potentials were measured relative to a Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> reference electrode. Acetonitrile was dried over P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> and distilled; the distillate was stored over CaH
 <sub>2</sub> and redistilled just before use. Recrystallized tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF
 <sub>4</sub>) was used as a supporting electrolyte at 0.1 M concentration.
