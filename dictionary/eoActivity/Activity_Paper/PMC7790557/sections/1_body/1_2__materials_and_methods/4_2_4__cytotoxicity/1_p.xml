<p>Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined on HT-1080 (human lung fibrosarcoma) and MH-22A (mouse hepatoma) cell lines and on the normal NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cell line. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is the compound concentration (
 <italic>Î¼</italic>g/ml) at which 50% of the cells die. CV is a triarylmethane dye that can bind to ribose-type molecules such as DNA in nuclei. CV staining can be used to quantify the total DNA of the remaining population and thus is used to determine the number of live cells based on the concentration of the dye which remains after staining. MTT is a standard colorimetric assay used to measure cellular proliferation. Yellow MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) is reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells.
