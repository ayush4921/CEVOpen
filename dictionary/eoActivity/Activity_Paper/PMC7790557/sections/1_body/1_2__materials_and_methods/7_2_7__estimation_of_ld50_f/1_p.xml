<p>Data from the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests were used for estimating the starting dose for acute oral systemic toxicity tests in the rodent. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> starting dose is an estimated LD
 <sub>50</sub> value calculated by inserting the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>IC
 <sub>50</sub> value into a regression formula: log LD
 <sub>50</sub> (mM/kg) = 0.439 log IC
 <sub>50</sub> (mM) + 0.621 [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The value is recalculated to mg/kg, and compounds are evaluated in accordance with 4 toxicity categories [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]: category 1—LD
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 5 mg/kg (highly toxic); category 2—5 &lt; LD
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 50 mg/kg (moderately toxic); category 3—50 &lt; LD
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 300 mg/kg (slightly toxic); and category 4—300 &lt; LD
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 2000 mg/kg (practically nontoxic). Using an alternative 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> method allows the comparison between possibly toxic new compounds and selecting compounds for further study vastly reducing the number of animal experiments.
