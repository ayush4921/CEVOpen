<p>Briefly, the first step included the transesterification of the commercially available ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate with a corresponding carbinol without solvent by azeotropic removal of ethanol. The further reaction of the corresponding 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoates with ammonium acetate led to enaminoesters, which were used for quaternization by tertiary amines or heterocycles giving the target compounds
