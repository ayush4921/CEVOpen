<p>This study also revealed the correlation of the cytotoxic effects of 3 groups of structurally related synthetic cationic lipids according to their molecular structures. The results indicated that among the tested compound groups, amphiphiles based on the 1,4-DHP core demonstrated high cytotoxicity in cancer cells HT-1080 and MH-22A, but low cytotoxicity in the noncancerous NIH3T3 cells.</p>
