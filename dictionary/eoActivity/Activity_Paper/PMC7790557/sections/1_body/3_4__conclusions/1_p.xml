<p>Polyfunctional self-assembling synthetic lipid-like compounds, such as pharmacological and chemotherapeutical agents, namely, 3,5-dialkoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydropyridines (1,4-DHPs) comprising pyridinium or ammonium substituents at the 2 and 6 positions; structurally related compounds, derivatives of 3,4-dihydro-2-oxopyridines as isomeric 3,4-dihydropyridine structures with an additional intracyclic carbonyl group; and the N-
 <italic>β</italic>-carbonylvinylamido system, namely, 2-amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkylammonium halides as open chain analogues of the first type of the abovementioned compounds, were studied. The main properties and major functions of these compounds are their amphiphilic character, liposome-forming ability, RNA transfection (by self-assembling compounds), antiradical and antioxidant properties, growth regulation—both in malignant and nonmalignant cell types—anticancer properties due to cytotoxicity, and MDR inhibition [
