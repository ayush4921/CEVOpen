<p>β-glucosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds to terminal non-reducing residues in β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucosides and oligosaccharides with the release of glucose. Day et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported that the aglycone portion upon the hydrolysis of glycoside of isoflavonoids is further metabolized in the gut microflora environment. This explains the metabolism process of formononetin and biochanin A to produce demethylated metabolites to form daidzein and genistein, respectively. Moreover, daidzein is further metabolized by colonic bacteria to form equol or 
 <italic>O</italic>-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) via a pathway that involves the formation of the intermediate dihydrodaidzein (

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] evaluated the interaction of all aforementioned metabolites of different isoflavonoids against estrogen receptors and found that ODMA had the weakest affinity among all metabolites.
