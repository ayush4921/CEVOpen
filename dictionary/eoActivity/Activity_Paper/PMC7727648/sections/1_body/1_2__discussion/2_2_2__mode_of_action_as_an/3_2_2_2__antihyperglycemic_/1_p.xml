<p>It has been confirmed that abnormal digestion and malabsorption of dietary carbohydrate are mainly responsible for reduced glycogen storage, increased synthesis of glucose and overproduction of hepatic glucose, β-cell impairment, insulin resistance of peripheral tissue, and defect in insulin signaling pathways, which greatly contribute to the manifestation of diabetes mellitus [

The hypoglycemic effect of isoflavonoids has also been reported to be mainly associated with the reduced intestinal absorption of dietary carbohydrates, modulation of the enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, improvement of β-cell functions and insulin action, stimulation of insulin secretion and the antioxidative as well as anti-inflammatory attributes of these compounds. One of the most well-known properties of isoflavonoids on carbohydrate metabolism is the intestinal inhibition of

 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase obtained from fermentation broths of a 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] also reported that biochanin A, genistein, formononetin, and daidzein exhibited a potent in vitro inhibition on yeast α-glucosidase in a dose dependent manner.
