<p>Similarly, formononetin has further been reported to show the best effect in an IR HepG2 cell model [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This study showed correlation with the study that had earlier been done by Smith et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] who mentioned that genistein inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport and reduced immunocytochemical labeling of GLUT4 carboxyl-terminus. Genistein also showed an inhibitory mechanism on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in MC3T3-G2/PA6 adipose cells, which showed a good indicator of glucose homeostasis [
