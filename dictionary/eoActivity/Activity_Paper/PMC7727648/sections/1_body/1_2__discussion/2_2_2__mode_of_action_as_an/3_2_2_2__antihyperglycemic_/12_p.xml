<p>Rauter et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] also evaluated the antidiabetic effect of genistein isolated from 
 <italic>Genista tenera</italic> on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Wistar rats. The genistein and genistein 7-O-glucoside, along with another six flavonoids (viz. apigenin, chrysoeriol, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin 7,3′-di-O-glucoside) were administered intraperitoneally for seven days (4 mg/kg body weight/day). The protective effect of these compounds over the liver and kidneys of STZ-diabetic models was also evaluated by the determination of seric AST, ALT, and urea levels. After seven days of treatment, apigenin, chrysoeriol, and genistein significantly lowered the blood glucose levels of diabetic animals. This effect was found to be more pronounced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the oral glucose tolerance test. Glucose tolerance was also significantly improved in the rutin (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and in the genistein 7-O-glucoside (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) treated groups. In addition, almost all the tested flavonoids effectively protected the liver and kidneys against STZ-induced damage in rats. Moreover, Jesus et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] synthesized 8-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosylgenistein (the major component of 
 <italic>Genista tenera</italic>) and evaluated its therapeutical impact in the treatment of STZ-induced diabetic rats. It was found to produce normalization of fasting hyperglycemia and amelioration of excessive postprandial glucose excursions and increasing β-cell sensitivity, insulin secretion, and circulating insulin within seven days at a dose of 4 (mg/kg body weight/day). These results support it as a potential antidiabetic agent. Genistein treatment was also able to endorse estrogen-like effects in ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This study was found to be correlated with a study done by Nogowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], who reported that genistein influenced insulin receptors and insulin secretion in OVX rats. A similar result was observed in a more extensive study done by Maćkowiak et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] in which genistein was shown to influence the effect of insulin receptors in perfused liver of ovariectomized rats. Ae Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] reported that genistein was able to modulate hepatic glucose and lipid regulating enzyme activities in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Meanwhile, Weigt et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] added that genistein showed a molecular effect of ER α- and β-selective agonists on the regulation of energy homeostasis in obese female Wistar rats. All of these in vivo studies suggest that genistein is capable of regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose level, lipid peroxidation, and insulin resistance as well as β islet pancreatic modulation. This was further supported by the study by Arunkumar and Anuradha [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], who mentioned that genistein improved insulin action in the muscle by targeting AMPK in a high fructose diet fed-mice model of insulin resistance.
