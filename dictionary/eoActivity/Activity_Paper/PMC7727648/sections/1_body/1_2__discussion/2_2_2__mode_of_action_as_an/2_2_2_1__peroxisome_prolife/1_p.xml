<p>Isoflavonoids have been reported to activate the ligand-dependent transcription factors known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which play an important role in gene expression in diabetes mellitus [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, PPARs have been found to be highly associated with the gene expressions involved in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, PPARγ has been reported to be the central regulator of adipocyte differentiation, important in regulating lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] suggested that agonists of PPARγ could be therapeutically considered to counter hyperglycemia elicited due to type 2 diabetes. An oral antidiabetic agent, thiazolidinedione, which acts as an agonist of PPARγ, has been reported to exert serious side effects, making the discovery of novel ligands highly relevant that can lead to the discovery of potentially safe antidiabetic agents. In this regard, Shen et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] stated that compounds that target PPARα and PPARγ could potentially be used to regulate dyslipidemia and restore glycemic balance, respectively. Due to the fact that many diabetic patients suffer from atherogenic lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance, ligands that may stimulate both PPARα and PPARγ could be efficaciously used in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
