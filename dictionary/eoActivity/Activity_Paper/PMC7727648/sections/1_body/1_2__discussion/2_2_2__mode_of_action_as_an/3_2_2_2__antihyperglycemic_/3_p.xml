<p>Many studies have been done to determine whether isoflavonoids may play any role in reversing the insulin resistant effect in diabetes. More recently, an in vitro study was done by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] to determine the anti-diabetic effect of genistien, biochanin A, and formononetin based derivatives using an insulin-resistant (IR) HepG2 cell model. The results indicated that sulfated, esterified and prenylated derivatives of biochanin A, chromium complex of biochanin A, and genistein exhibited significant glucose consumption-enhancing effects in IR-HepG2 cells. In addition, the combinations of these derivatives displayed better anti-diabetic activity than the individual compounds. This study provides useful clues for the further design and discovery of safe anti-diabetic agents. In this regard, Wei et al. [

 <italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L (chickpea), a food and medicine used by the people of Xinjiang that has a beneficial hypoglycemic effect. To better utilize this national resource and develop hypoglycemic agents from components of the chickpea, a series of new derivatives of isoflavone compounds from the chickpea was synthesized. An insulin-resistant (IR) HepG2 cell model was used to screen the hypoglycemic activities of these derivatives of isoflavones. Several combinations of these derivatives of isoflavones displayed higher hypoglycemic activity than any single compound, and they had similar hypoglycemic activity to that of the positive control group (
