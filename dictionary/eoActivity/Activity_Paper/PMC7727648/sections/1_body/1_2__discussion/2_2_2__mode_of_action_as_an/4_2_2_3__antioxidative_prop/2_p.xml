<p>Asgary et al. [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] demonstrated that genistein containing soybean phytochemical extract exhibited antioxidant action. Persaud et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] claimed that genistein inhibited islet tyrosine kinase activity and glucose-, 4-α ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin release without affecting glucose metabolism. Genistein also inhibited protein serine/threonine kinase activities to a limited extent, but had no effect on Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, cyclic AMP- or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced insulin secretion from electrically permeabilized islets. These results suggest that genistein exerts its inhibitory effect on insulin secretion proximal to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entry and it was proposed that it acts at the site of the voltage-dependent Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel that regulates Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx into β-cells following nutrient- and sulfonylurea-induced depolarization.
