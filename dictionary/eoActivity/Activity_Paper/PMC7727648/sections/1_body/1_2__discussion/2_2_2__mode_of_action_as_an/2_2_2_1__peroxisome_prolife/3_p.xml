<p>Since the insulin sensitizing effect of an anti-diabetic drug, namely thiazolidinedione, is mediated through PPARγ, an extensive search has been done using 3T3-L1 cells in vitro. Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] claimed that daidzein enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes by increasing the expression of GLUT4 and IRS-1 via the stimulation of PPARγ. This was further supported by Kwon et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], who reported that daidzein had better insulin-sensitizing actions by activating PPARγ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Carrara et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] also previously mentioned the activity of daidzein and glycitein in the activation of PPAR transcriptional activity in human promonocytic U-937 cells. These results confirm that plant isoflavonoids activate gene expression through the stimulation of PPARα and PPARγ, and dietary isoflavonoids regulate adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.
