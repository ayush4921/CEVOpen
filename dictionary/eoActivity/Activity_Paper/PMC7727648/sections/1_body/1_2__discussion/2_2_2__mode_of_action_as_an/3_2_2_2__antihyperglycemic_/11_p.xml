<p>Oh et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] evaluated the hypoglycemic action of semipurified fractions obtained from hot-water extract of the submerged-culture broth of 
 <italic>Agaricus blazei</italic> Murill in streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal)-induced diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats, relative to the diabetes drug metformin. Prior to investigation, the hot-water extract was treated with ethanol to remove β-glucans and glycoproteins, freeze-dried, and fractionated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate (EA), and butanol fractions. In a 14 day-treatment study, the EA fraction (200 mg/kg body weight) was found to reduce (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the blood glucose level in the oral glucose tolerance test, relative to the other fractions and control. It was also found to elevate plasma insulin and glucose transport-4 proteins as well as reduce the levels of triglyceride and cholesterol in plasma, the activity of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in blood, and the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in the liver and kidney. The hypoglycemic efficacy of the EA (400 mg/kg body weight) was found to be similar to that of metformin (500 mg/kg body weight). Upon phytoconstituent characterization of the EA fraction, it was found to contain a substantial number of isoflavonoids including genistein, genistin, daidzein, and daidzin, which were suggested to have contributed to the EA fraction’s hypoglycemic action. These results indicate that the hot-water extract of the submerged-culture broth of 
 <italic>A. blazei</italic> contains an EA fraction with potent hypoglycemic action, which could be useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
