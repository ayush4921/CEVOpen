<p>Several studies have been carried out to explore the potential role of isoflavonoids in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Results from in vitro and in vivo studies have proven the hypoglycemic effect of isoflavonoids. It has also been testified that isoflavonoids can act as an insulin secretagogue that induces insulin secretion to ameliorate diabetic complications. Furthermore, it has been claimed that isoflavonoids improve insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in peripheral tissues that control the rate limiting enzymes involved in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway. Hence, isoflavonoids are nowadays indicated as potential significant natural compounds to enrich the recent therapy options against the manifestation of diabetes mellitus [
