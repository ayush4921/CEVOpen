<p>Apart from the above, daidzein has also been claimed to reduce serum insulin and insulin resistance in an animal model of obesity and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] reported that daidzein also modulated hepatic glucose and regulate lipid enzyme activities in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. This statement was later supported by another study in which it was clearly mentioned that the mixture of daidzein and glycitin demonstrated anti-obese and anti-diabetic effects in C57BL/6J mice fed with a high-fat diet [

 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] also evaluated daidzein’s in vivo antidiabetic effects. The results indicated that the postprandial blood glucose level was more significantly suppressed in the daidzein-administered group than in the water group of both streptozotocin-induced diabetic and normal mice. These results indicate that daidzein may be a potent antidiabetic agent. In summary, results of the studies clearly acknowledge that isoflavonoids favorably affect several aspects of diabetes-induced metabolic disorders and modulate carbohydrate metabolism, glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance as well as β islet pancreatic cell protection. Hence, they could be regarded as potent antidiabetic agents.
