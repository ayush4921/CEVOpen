<p>Isoflavonoids are plant based secondary metabolites abundant in plant species that predominantly belong to Papilonoidae, a subfamily of Leguminosae [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They are mainly derived via the classical phenylpropanoid pathway. Isoflavonoids are based on a 3-phenylchroman skeleton that is biogenetically derived from a 2-phenylchroman skeleton of flavonoids. Isoflavone aglycone possesses two aromatic rings that are joined together through a heterocyclic pyrane ring [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been reported that the allocation of the number and position of hydroxyl groups attached to the two aromatic rings influence the biological activity of isoflavonoids [
