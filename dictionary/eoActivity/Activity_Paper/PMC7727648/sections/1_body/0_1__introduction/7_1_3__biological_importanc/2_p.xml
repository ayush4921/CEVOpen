<p>Jang et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] mentioned that isoflavonoid aglycones seemed to have greater antidiabetic activity in soy fermentation, which led to opening a new window of knowledge among researchers to explore and reveal the potential of isoflavonoids that show various biological effects in human health. This was supported by Kawakami et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who claimed that an isoflavone aglycone-rich diet reduced liver and total cholesterol levels as well as triglyceride levels in rats fed with cholesterol. This indicates that increased isoflavonoid aglycone content may be effective in ameliorating metabolic disorders [
