<p>The selection of the solvent greatly influences the UAE extraction efficiency due to the solvent’s physical–chemical properties, such as the polarity, viscosity, and volatility. Therefore, the proportion of glycerol in water was used as the first independent variable. In accordance with their moderately polar nature, 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> phenolic acids were best extracted using relatively high glycerol concentrations. Several studies reported that water–glycerol mixtures were more efficient extraction media than water. Examples include the UAE of chlorogenic acid and other caffeic acid derivatives from spent filter coffee [
