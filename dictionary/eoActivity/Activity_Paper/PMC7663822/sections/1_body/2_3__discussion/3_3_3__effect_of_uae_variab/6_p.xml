<p>In accordance with previous research [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the results of this study showed that under the optimized conditions, UAE extraction was superior to classical maceration, because it achieved significantly higher yields of the desired phenolic acids within a much shorter extraction time than maceration. It was found that caffeic acid derivatives were best extracted using a high glycerol concentration without added ascorbic acid, a high temperature, and a low ultrasound power using a longer extraction time. This results correspond well with the described influences of independent variables. Application of those conditions led to an approximately 1.7-fold increase in caftaric acid concentration and up to a 2.6-fold increase in both the cichoric acid content and TPA in comparison with the best results achieved using the maceration protocol. Moreover, chlorogenic acid, which was absent from the extracts prepared by maceration, was present in the extracts prepared by UAE, albeit in rather low concentrations. The selected UAE variables affected the contents of targeted phenolic acids in a similar manner, which was rather expected due to their significant structural similarities. The results of this study may be used for direct preparation of the glycerol extracts suitable for use in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry, or for detailed investigation and optimization of the extraction using one of the designs suitable for response surface methodology, such as a Boxâ€“Behnken or central composite design.
