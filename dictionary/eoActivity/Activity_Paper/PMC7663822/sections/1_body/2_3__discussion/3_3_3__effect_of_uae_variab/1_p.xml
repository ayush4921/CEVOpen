<p>UAE is often used for extraction in solid–liquid systems because it is a simple and cost- and time-effective method, characterized by low CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions and solvent consumption [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is especially suitable for preparation of natural extracts due to its high reproducibility and short time of extraction. The cavitation, vibration, crushing, and mixing effects in media produced by ultrasound can break the cell wall and effectively increase the mass transfer process [

An efficient UAE process should maximize the recovery of target compounds with minimal degradation, resulting in an extract with high biological activity. Ideally, this should be accomplished using “green” environmentally friendly technologies and low-cost raw materials and solvents [

However, in order to determine the best UAE conditions for extraction of bioactive constituents, it is often necessary to perform multiple experiments and evaluate not only the direct influence of extraction variables, but their interactions as well. In order to achieve this, a two-level factorial design with six independent variables was employed.
