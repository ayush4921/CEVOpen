<p>In this work, efforts were undertaken to efficiently optimize the green extraction of bioactive phenolic acids from aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> and to obtain the extracts ready to use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. In order to achieve this, classical maceration performed using glycerol or water mixtures was compared with maceration using ethanol, water, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, the UAE of phenolic acids from 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> using glycerolâ€“water mixtures as the extraction solvent was developed.
