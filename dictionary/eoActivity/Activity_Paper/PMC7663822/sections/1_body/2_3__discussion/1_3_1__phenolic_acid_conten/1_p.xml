<p>Medicinal plants and plant extracts contain a myriad of secondary metabolites. While some of them have desirable pharmacological properties, the others may influence the overall activity of the natural extracts in either a positive or negative manner. Thus, medicinal plant extraction procedures aim to increase the amounts of desired metabolites while simultaneously decreasing the amounts of undesired or harmful ones. The amounts of secondary metabolites in the extracts depend on their physicochemical properties, extraction solvents, types of extraction, as well as on numerous extraction parameters related to the specific type of the extraction [
