<p>In this work, the extraction of bioactive phenolic acids from 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> was performed using mixtures of water with glycerol, a biodegradable, safe, affordable solvent available from renewable sources. The extracts prepared by maceration were rich in phenolic acids and potent radical scavengers. The 3 day maceration with either water, 50% ethanol, or 90% glycerol afforded extracts with activity equal to the activity of synthetic antioxidant, BHA. The UAE method, on the other hand, showed superior extraction characteristics, yielding up to 2.6-fold higher phenolic acid contents within shorter extraction times. The composition of the solvent, the time, and the temperature of the extraction significantly affected the efficiency of the extraction. Furthermore, the presence of ascorbic acid in the extraction medium lead to decreased phenolic acid contents in the prepared extracts. In addition, the presence of zinc in the plant material may contribute to the beneficial effects of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> preparations. Since glycerol is a non-toxic solvent with humectant properties, the prepared extracts can be directly used for preparation of cosmetics or oral pharmaceutical formulations without the need for solvent removal.
