<p>The most important phenolic acids in 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> are derivatives of caffeic acid. Cichoric acid is the most abundant among them. It exhibits a wide array of activities, such as antidiabetic, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and obesity prevention activities [

In particular, various studies on different models have found that cichoric acid may ameliorate inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in both cell cultures and mice. Reduced inflammation was associated with downregulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), two major regulators of inflammation responses. Several other proinflammatory factors, including nitric oxide synthase, COX-2, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-12, and IL-18, have also been reported to be downregulated by chicoric acid [
