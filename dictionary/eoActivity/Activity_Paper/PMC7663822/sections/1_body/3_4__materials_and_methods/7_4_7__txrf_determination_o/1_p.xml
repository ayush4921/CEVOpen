<p>TXRF analysis was performed using a commercial benchtop S2 PICOFOX TXRF spectrometer (BrukerNano, GmbH, Berlin, Germany) equipped with a low-power tungsten X-ray tube (50 kV, 1 mA) and a silicon drift detector (SDD) with a resolution &lt; 150 eV at Mn-K_(α). The evaluation of the TXRF spectra and calculation of the analyte net peak areas were performed using Spectra Plus 5.3 software (Bruker AXS Microanalysis GmbH, Berlin, Germany) linked to the equipment. The measurement time was established as 2000 s. The vegetation samples were sieved through a sieve (diameter less of 63 μm). Sample suspensions were prepared by weighing 20 mg of sample and adding 1 mL of de-ionized water containing 10 μg of Ga as an internal standard. Duplicates were prepared for each sample and 5 min sonication in an ultrasonic bath was applied. After this, an aliquot of 10 μL of the internal standardized sample was transferred onto a quartz glass sample carrier and dried using an infrared lamp, as described in [
