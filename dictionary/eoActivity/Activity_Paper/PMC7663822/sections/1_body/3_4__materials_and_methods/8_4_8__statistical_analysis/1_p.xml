<p>The extraction experiments were planned using Design Expert software v. 8.0.6 (Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The validity of the model was confirmed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). For macerations, measurements were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between extracts (JMP, SAS, San Diego, CA, USA) and Dunnett’s test for comparison with the control. 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
