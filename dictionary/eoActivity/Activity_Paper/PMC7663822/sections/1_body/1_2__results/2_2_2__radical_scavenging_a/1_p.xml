<p>The radical scavenging activity (RSA) results for the extracts prepared by maceration are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05142-f001">Figure 1</xref>d. The extract prepared using ethanol did not display any observable RSA, and thus is not presented in the figure. Unlike the phenolic acid content, the radical scavenging activity of the extracts was influenced by the solvent, and in some cases the duration of the maceration. After one day of maceration, water and 50% ethanol yielded the extracts with the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (and thus the lowest RSA), while the activity levels of 50% and 90% glycerol extracts were more pronounced. However, the activity levels of the 50% ethanol and water extracts prepared by 3-day maceration were significantly better than their 1 day counterparts. On the other hand, the activity levels of 50% and 90% glycerol extracts did not significantly change with prolonged maceration. The 3 day water extract was the best radical scavenger in the study, with an RSA IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 8.79 μg/mL ± 0.44 μg/mL, followed by the 50% ethanol (RSA IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.00 μg/mL ± 0.96 μg/mL) and 90% glycerol (RSA IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.88 μg/mL ± 0.41 μg/mL) extract. The RSA activity levels of these three extracts did not statistically differ (Dunnett’s test) from the activity of positive control, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), with an RSA IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.12 μg/mL ± 0.17 μg/mL. In the present study, the RSA and the contents of phenolic acids were not correlated (
