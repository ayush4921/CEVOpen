<p>The amounts of caftaric acids in the extracts varied greatly depending on the solvent used for the extraction. For example, E-1D and E-3D did not contain any detectable amounts of caftaric acid, while G90-1D and G90-3D contained about 20 μg/mL of phenolic acid. Similarly, in E-1D and E-3D, cichoric acid was present in very low amounts, while its content in G90-1D and E50-3D reached over 60 μg/mL. While the maceration duration did not significantly affect the contents of the target compounds, the influence of the solvent on the extraction efficiency was observable but rather low. The extraction efficiency levels for 50% ethanol, 50% glycerol, and 90% glycerol did not statistically differ from one another.</p>
