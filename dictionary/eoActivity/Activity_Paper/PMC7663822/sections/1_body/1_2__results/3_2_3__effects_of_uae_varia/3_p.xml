<p>Cichoric acid accounted for about two-thirds of the total phenolic acids (TPA) present in the extracts. Similar to maceration findings, the concentrations of caftaric and cichoric acids correlated significantly (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9169). In addition, their concentrations showed a week but significant correlation with chlorogenic acid (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = approximately 0.7), indicating that similar factors affected their concentrations. The concentrations of chlorogenic acid ranged from below LOD to 0.94 Î¼g/mL, and contributed to the TPA at less than 1%.
