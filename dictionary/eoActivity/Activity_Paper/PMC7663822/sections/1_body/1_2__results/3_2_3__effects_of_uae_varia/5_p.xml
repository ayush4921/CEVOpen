<p>The Pareto chart of the effects of the extraction conditions on caftaric acid content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05142-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) shows that the factors B and D are above the Bonferroni limit (
 <italic>t</italic>-value of effect = 3.6739), and thus are significant model factors. Both of them exert positive influence on the caftaric acid content. On the other hand, not all the variables above the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit (
 <italic>t</italic>-value of effect = 2.093) influence the content of caftaric acid positively. While its content increased together with A, F, and AD, the increase of variables E, DE, and ABC lead to the decrease of caftaric acid content. The actual vs. predicted result graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05142-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) shows a good agreement between the actual values and the values predicted by the model.
