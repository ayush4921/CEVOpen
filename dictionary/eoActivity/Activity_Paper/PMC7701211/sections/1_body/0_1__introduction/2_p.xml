 <italic>Corydalis</italic> Rhizoma (CR; the dried tuber of 
 <italic>Corydalis yanhusuo</italic> (Y. H. Chou and Chun C. Hsu) W. T. Wang ex Z. Y. Su and C. Y. Wu) is a well-known herbal medicine in TCM. Due to the efficacy of activating blood, promoting Qi, and relieving pain, CR has been widely used in treating varieties of pain for years, for example, stomachache, cardialgia, and dysmenorrhea. In clinical application, CR is usually used by combining with other herbal medicines, for example, herbal mixtures of Yingshen San (described in &lt;&lt;Weishi Jiacang Fang&gt;&gt;), Ersheng San (described in &lt;&lt;Qixiao Liangfang&gt;&gt;), and Shixiao San (described in &lt;&lt;Taiping Huimin Hejiju Fang&gt;&gt;) in treating abdominal cold pain, colic pain, and blood stasis pain [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By spectrum-effect relationship analysis, the CR alkaloids, that is, coptisine, berberine, palmatine, and dehydrocorydaline, were proposed to be closely related to anti-inflammatory potency of CR extracts [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to different physiological mechanisms of pain and inflammation, the mechanistic studies of CR, as well as its active components, on anti-inflammation have not been fully revealed. In general, CR contains 0.5 to 1% of total alkaloids [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, the protoberberine quaternary amine alkaloids (e.g., columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, and dehydrocorydaline), hydrogenated tertiary amine alkaloids (e.g., isocorypalmine, stylopine, rotundinum, canadine, and corydaline), proopioid protoberberine alkaloids (e.g., protopine and allocryptopine), and aphis alkaloids (e.g., glaucine) are the main parent structure of alkaloids being found in CR [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, the anti-inflammatory activities of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were chosen for further study.
