<p>Inflammation is an important predisposing factor and one of the leading causes of disease occurrence. Indeed, the excessive inflammatory responses are closely associated with cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, for example, hyperlipidemia, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis [

In clinic, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, paracetamol and indomethacin) and glucocorticoids (e.g., beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide) are commonly used to control inflammatory processes by acting on protein targets in inflammatory signaling [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the poor target selectivity, most of these anti-inflammation drugs have shortcomings of side effects, withdrawal rebound, and drug resistance [

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in clinic for thousands of years, and many of them show good therapeutic effects in chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, TCM is playing a comprehensive therapeutic effect in alleviating inflammation-induced clinical symptoms and improving quality of life: the pharmacological properties of TCM are mediated by multicomponents and multitargets [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Historically, there are many classical TCM prescriptions targeting anti-inflammation, for example, Mahuang Xixin Fuzi Tang (described in &lt;&lt;Shanghan Lun&gt;&gt;) in treating allergic rhinitis [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Zuojin Wan (described in &lt;&lt;Danxi Xinfa&gt;&gt;) in treating ulcerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alkaloids, for example, pseudoephedrine, berberine, and palmatine, in these herbal prescriptions are proposed to alleviate inflammatory response, to reduce tissue damage, and to regulate immune balance [
