<p>Alkaloids are the main components in CR extracts. The HPLC chromatograms of CR extracts by using different solvents of having varied amount of ethanol are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>. The major alkaloids, that is, columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline, glaucine, rotundinum, corydaline, and stylopine, were identified in the fingerprints, and their content in different extracts was determined and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. The structures of major CR alkaloids are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Besides, the closely related alkaloids previously found in CR, for example, allocryptopine, isocorypalmine, corydalmine, and canadine, were also presented; however, these alkaloids were not found in our current analysis. The amounts of alkaloids in CR crude drug were determined, and the linear relationships having

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The alkaloid content of CR extracts increased obviously with ethanol concentration in the extracting solvent. Maximal amount of alkaloid was revealed in solvent of 100% ethanol, that is, about 140 mg per gram of extract. In parallel, the peaks showing amount of alkaloids in CR were increased with an increase of ethanol fraction in extracting solvent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The yields of CR extractives however decreased when the ethanol fraction increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant alkaloid in CR extracts, nearly accounting for 50% of total alkaloid content. Corydaline, an analogue of dehydrocorydaline, also occurred in high amount in CR ethanol extract.
