<p>RAW 264.7 macrophage is often used as inflammatory cell model, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, for example, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, could be stimulated markedly by applied LPS. Cultured macrophages were incubated with CR extracts in 24-well plates, followed by adding LPS (20 ng/mL). The proinflammatory cytokines in culture medium were measured by ELISA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the inhibitory activities of CR extracts from 5 to 20 mg/mL on the LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines increased with an increase of alkaloid content, while CR extracts of water and 25% ethanol showed no inhibition on cytokine expression; CR extracts of 50% and 75% ethanol showed weak inhibition on cytokine expression. The CR extract of 100% ethanol showed good inhibition on the LPS-induced expressions of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The cytokine suppression was increased in accordance with the amount of ethanol in extracting solvent, as well as dose of applied herbal extracts. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control.
