<p>The translocation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B into nucleus contributes to inflammatory responses by upregulating transcription of key inflammatory genes. To further confirm anti-inflammatory mechanism of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine on NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling, the nuclear translocation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B in drug-treated RAW 264.7 cells was determined by immunofluorescence staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The recognition of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and nucleus was identified by red and blue color, respectively. Compared to control cells (not treated with drug and LPS), the nuclear accumulation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B was induced by ∼2 folds in LPS-treated cultures. However, the application of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine attenuated the nuclear translocation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B obviously in LPS-treated cultures, that is, reducing the nuclear accumulation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B by over 60%. Thus, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine showed robust effect in attenuating nuclear accumulation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B in RAW 264.7 cells.
