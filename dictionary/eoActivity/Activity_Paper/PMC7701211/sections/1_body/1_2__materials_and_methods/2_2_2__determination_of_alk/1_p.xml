<p>The herbal extracts of CR were weighed accurately and dissolved by 50% methanol with concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The dissolved extract was filtered by 0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Millipore filter, and subsequently the filtrate was collected for HPLC determination. The standards of columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline, glaucine, rotundinum, corydaline, and stylopine were weighed accurately and dissolved to stock solution at 1 mg/mL by methanol. Different volumes of columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline, glaucine, rotundinum, corydaline, and stylopine stocks were mixed to prepare the stock solution of alkaloids, with final concentrations of 96.00, 93.33, 126.98, 47.62, 349.21, 44.44, 96.00, 132.06, and 63.56 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. After that, the stock solutions of alkaloids in CR were diluted to series of working standards by methanol. The chromatographic analysis was performed by Waters 2695 HPLC with PDA detector. The separation of CR extract was achieved on an Innoval C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 
 <italic>µ</italic>m) with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 25°C. The mobile phase of CR was composed of MeCN (
 <italic>A</italic>) and water (
 <italic>B</italic>) containing 0.1% phosphoric acid and 0.22% triethylamine, using a gradient elution of 20–22% at 0–10 min, 22–30% at 10–30 min, and 30–80% at 30–60 min. The analyses were detected at 280 nm. The injection volume was set at 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L.
