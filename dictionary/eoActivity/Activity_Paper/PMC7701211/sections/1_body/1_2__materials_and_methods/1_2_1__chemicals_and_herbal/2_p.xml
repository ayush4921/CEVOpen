<p>CR is the tuber of 
 <italic>C. yanhusuo</italic> from Zhejiang, China. The authentication of CR herb was performed by Professor Xiangping Pei from Shanxi University of Chinese Medicine. The CR herb was weighed appropriately, and each of them was extracted twice (1st, 1 : 10 w/v, 40 min; 2nd, 1 : 8 w/v, 30 min) by reflux with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% ethanol volume fraction, and the twice filtrates were combined, concentrated to sticky state, and dried at 60°C. The herbal extracts of CR were weighed accurately and dissolved to stock solution with concentration of 40 mg/mL by DMSO. The standards of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were weighed accurately and dissolved to stock solution with concentrations of 50 mM by DMSO, respectively. The different concentrations of these alkaloids were prepared for evaluation of cell viability and anti-inflammatory activity by diluting from initial stocks.
