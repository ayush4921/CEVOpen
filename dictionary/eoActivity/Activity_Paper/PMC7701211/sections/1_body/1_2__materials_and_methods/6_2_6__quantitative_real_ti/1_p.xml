<p>The mRNA expressions of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> in cultured RAW 264.7 cells, treated with CR extracts (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL), dehydrocorydaline (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydaline (10, 15, 30 and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydalmine (15, 30, 60 and 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and dexamethasone (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA of RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plate was isolated by RNA simple Total RNA kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) and reversed transcribed into first-strand cDNAs synthesis by FastKing RT kit (World's Foregene Biotech, Chengdu, China) according to the manufacturer's specification. Real-time PCR was employed here by SuperReal PreMix Plus kit (World's Foregene Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers were as follows: 5′-AGT GAC AAG CCT GTA GCC-3′ (S) and 5′-AGG TTG ACT TTC TCC TGG-3′(AS) for murine TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> (251 bp; NM_013693); 5′-GGA GTA CCA TAG CTACCT GG-3′ (S) and 5′-CTA GGT TTG CCG AGT AGA TC-3′ (AS) for murine IL-6 (283 bp; NM_031168); 5′-AAA TAC CTG TGG CCT TG-3′ (sense primer, S) and 5′-TTA GGA AGA CAC GGA TTC-3′ (antisense primer, AS) for murine IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> (296 bp; NM_008361). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control, and its primer sequences were 5′-AAC GGA TTT GGC CGT ATT GG-3′ (S) and 5′-CTT CCC GTT CAG CTC TGG G-3′ (AS) (657 bp; NR_0215885). The SYBR green signal was detected by Agilent Technologies Stratagene Mx3000P (Santa Clara, CA). Each sample was run in triplicate. Transcript levels were quantified by the 
 <italic>ΔΔ</italic>Ct value method, where the values of target genes were normalized by the GAPDH in the same sample at first before comparison.
