<p>The activation of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> (∼39 kDa) in cultured RAW 264.7 cells treated with dehydrocorydaline (5, 10 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydaline (15, 30 and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydalmine (30, 60 and 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and dexamethasone (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) were determined by western blot assay. The cells were harvested with lysis buffer, shaken for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The protein content in supernatant was determined by Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (Solarbio, Lot 630P055), as standard. Samples were adjusted to the same amount of total protein. The homogenates were lysed with 2 × loading buffer and boiled for 5 min before being transferred to the 10% gel electrophoresis. The gel was run in electrophoresis buffer at 60 V for 30 min in stacking gel and at 90 V for 60 min in resolving gel. After electrophoresis separation, the proteins were moved from SDS-PAGE to a nitrocellulose membrane, using a Mini Trans-Blot Cell at 70 V, 0.2 A for 1 hour in 1 × transfer buffer. The membrane was stained with 
 <italic>Ponceau S</italic> to affirm the transfer and equal addition of the samples. After that, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk powder in TBS-
 <italic>T</italic> (Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20) for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated with primary anti-I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> antibody (1 : 5,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 12 hours at 4°C. After washing with TBS-T, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ImmunoWay Biotechnology Company, Plano, TX) at 1 : 5,000 dilution was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The immune complexes were scanned using the ECL method (A Biochemical Company). The expression level of protein was calculated using 
 <italic>α</italic>-tubulin as an internal control.
