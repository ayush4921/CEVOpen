<p>The cell viability of CR extracts and alkaloids was measured by colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, the cultured RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and treated with different concentrations of CR extracts and alkaloids for 24 hours. Then, the culture medium was discarded, and the cultured cell wells were added with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 hours followed by adding 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMSO. The cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 495 nm by calculated as the percentage of absorbance value of negative control (without drug treatment), where the absorbance value was set as 100%.
