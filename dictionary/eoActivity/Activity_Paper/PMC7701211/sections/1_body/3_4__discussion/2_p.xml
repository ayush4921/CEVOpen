<p>The anti-inflammatory potency of CR extracts with high amount of alkaloids was stronger than that of CR extracts with low amount of alkaloids, that is, the CR extract of 100% ethanol fraction significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokine with a good dose-effect relationship. In line with this notion, our current results showed that the abundant alkaloid (dehydrocorydaline and corydaline) demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced macrophages. Besides, as seen from Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, the protoberberine alkaloids with quaternary nuclear structure were the main components of CR, in which dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant component, accounting for about half of total alkaloid. Interestingly, the potency of dehydrocorydaline in suppressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines was stronger than corydaline and corydalmine. Therefore, similar to the structure-activity relationship of protoberberine alkaloids from 
 <italic>Corydalis</italic> species on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it is speculated that the quaternary nuclear structure with positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) could enhance the anti-inflammatory activity of protoberberine alkaloids. Besides the protoberberine scaffold, the methylenedioxy substitutions at R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 positions of benzene ring are also strongly correlated with the anti-inflammatory activity of protoberberine alkaloids, which however need to be studied further.
