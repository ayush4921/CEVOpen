  <p>The HPLC chromatograms and alkaloid determination of CR extracts in different extracting solvents. (a) Typical profiles and yields of CR extracts for each solvent, and the mixed standard substance chromatogram were shown here. The main alkaloids of CR extracts were identified (number as in (b)) by known chemical standards. (b) The alkaloids, determined in CR extracts, were shown. The identification numbers of alkaloids in CR extracts are labeled in HPLC chromatograms, as shown. Values are in mean ± SEM,
