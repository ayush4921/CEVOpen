  <p>Figure S1: the cell viability of CR extracts and alkaloids. The effects of CR extracts and alkaloids in cell viability. RAW 264.7 cells in 96-well plates were treated with the different doses of CR extracts by water and different fractions of ethanol (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for 24 hours, respectively. The cell viability of CR extract-treated macrophages was performed by MTT assay. The cell viability after treating CR alkaloids (dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine) was determined. Values are in the fold of change as compared to control, and in Mean ± SEM, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, each with triplicate samples.

   <italic>Corydalis</italic> Rhizoma (CR; the dried tuber of 
   <italic>Corydalis yanhusuo</italic>) is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine. Here, the major alkaloids of CR extract were identified and evaluated in LPS-treated macrophages by determining expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, I
   <italic>κ</italic>B
   <italic>α</italic> and NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B. It is revealed that dehydrocorydaline was the major alkaloid in CR extract, which, together with its analogous, accounted anti-inflammatory property of CR.
