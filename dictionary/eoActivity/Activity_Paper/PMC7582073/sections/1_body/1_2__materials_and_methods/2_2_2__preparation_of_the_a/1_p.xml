<p>Aerial parts of HS were air-dried at room temperature for 15 days and then used for toxicities studies. The powdered aerial parts of HS (80 g) were extracted with boiling water (800 ml) for 20 min, after which the boiled decoction was filtered and then concentrated in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The yield extract was about 21.25%. The extracted material was stored at −20°C in the dark until further use.</p>
