<p>Histological assessment of kidneys shows a slight variation in kidneys architecture in rats treated subacutely with HS extract at the doses 1000 and 2000â€‰mg/kg. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in biochemical markers of renal function in all rats treated. In light of this discrepancy between the biochemical and histological results of the kidneys, it can be said that HS extract does not present nephrotoxicity sufficient to have an alteration of the functions of the kidneys. This may be due to the short period of treatment (30 days), and therefore a chronic study is needed for the complete understanding of the nephrotoxicity of this plant.</p>
