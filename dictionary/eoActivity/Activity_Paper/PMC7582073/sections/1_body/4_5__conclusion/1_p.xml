<p>In the present work, the acute and subacute toxicities of the aqueous extract from HS by oral administration in rodents were performed. The result of acute toxicity showed that the oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of HS extract was lower than 5000 mg/kg, and this extract is regarded as slightly toxic. The findings of 30 days of oral subacute toxicity indicated that HS extract exhibited toxicity to the liver in rats determined by hematological, serum biochemical, and/or histological analyses at high concentrations (1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg).
