 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the effects of HS aqueous extract in mice after acute oral administration. The signs of toxicity, including anorexia and hypoactivity, were observed at doses of 5000, 7000, and 10000 mg/kg. The mortality rate as well as the acute toxicity of the orally administered HS extract increased progressively as the dose increased from 1000 to 10000 mg/kg. The mortality produced in the animals by the HS extract was used to calculate the LD
 <sub>50</sub>, which was 5 g/kg.
