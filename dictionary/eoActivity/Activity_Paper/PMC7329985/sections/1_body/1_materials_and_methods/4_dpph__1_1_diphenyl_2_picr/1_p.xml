The purple-blue 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) powder consists of stable free-radical molecules, which have a strong absorbance at 517 nm in solution. When DPPH reacts with a hydrogen-donating antioxidant, it results in discoloration and a drop in absorption at 517 nm; the lower the absorption value, the stronger the hydrogen-donor ability of the antioxidant (AH; i.e., the stronger the antioxidant's ability to scavenge free radicals). The reaction for reducing the DPPH radical (DPPH•) by an antioxidant (AH) is as follows:
