<p>We prepared 95% alcohol extracts of the herbal materials (250 µg/ml) as the test samples. An equal concentration of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the control. The assay was performed as follows: 20 µL of a prepared sample was added to 80 µL Tris-HCl (pH=7.4) and mixed with 100 µL DPPH (500 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was protected from light for 30 min, and the absorption was measured at 517 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The raw DPPH scavenging rates of the extracts were calculated and converted to the relative DPPH scavenging rates (%) of BHT using the scavenging rate of BHT in the positive control group as the denominator. The DPPH scavenging rates of individual extracts were calculated using the following formula:</p>
