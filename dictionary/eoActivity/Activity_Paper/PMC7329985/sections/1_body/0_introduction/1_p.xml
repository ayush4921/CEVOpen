<p>Herbal tea, a beverage prepared from a variety of plant materials excluding the leaves of the tea plant

For example, herbal teas commonly used in the Lingnan area in China are also known as liáng chá. Due to the humid and sultry climate in this area, diseases related to “dampness syndrome” and “heat syndrome” occur frequently, and the local people experience “yin deficiency” as they are prone to excessive sweating. As a remedy, the people consume a local drink called liáng chá, which has the main functions of clearing heat, dispelling dampness, and nourishing yin (

In Guangzhou, an over-the-counter drug, “Guangdong Liáng Chá Granules,” was developed by Wanglaoji Herbal Tea. Multiple studies have suggested that the drug's potency in purging heat could be related to the antioxidative properties of the herbal ingredients (
