<p>To record and better understand the characteristics of Taiwan's qīng-căo-chá tea, we conducted a survey of qīng-căo-chá teashops across Taiwan and carried out interviews using semi-structured questionnaires to assess the current situation and the raw materials of qīng-căo-chá tea used to date. We focused on identifying the unique cultural characteristics of Taiwan that facilitated the development of Taiwan's qīng-căo-chá tea.</p>
