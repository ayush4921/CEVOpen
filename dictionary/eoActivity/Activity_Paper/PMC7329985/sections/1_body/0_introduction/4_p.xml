<p>With the increasing awareness of health maintenance, more people are consuming natural health-promoting drinks. However, research studies on this aspect in Taiwan are insufficient. The formulas of raw materials for qīng-căo-chá tea have always been passed down verbally by tea shop owners, and there is no systematic collation or record. A book on prior related research (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Qiu, 2004</xref>) has collated 24 formulas and 137 raw materials. Although this book focuses on qīng-căo-chá tea, the sample number of traditional users appears to be insufficient. Other publications include a master's thesis on the investigation of qīng-căo pharmacies (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Jiang, 2005</xref>) and a government research project (CCMP93-RD-037), which investigated 86 shops and documented 47 commonly used raw materials for qīng-căo-chá tea. However, this work was not focused on qīng-căo-chá tea; instead, it only briefly mentioned this tea. There has been no systematic study on qīng-căo-chá tea varieties in Taiwan, indicating the need for further in-depth investigation and evaluation.
