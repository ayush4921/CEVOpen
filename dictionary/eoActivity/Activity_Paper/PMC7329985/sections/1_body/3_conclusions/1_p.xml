<p>In historical and modern times, herbal teas have benefited human health and quality of life. Qīng-căo-chá tea is an important traditional beverage in Taiwan that was developed over a long historical period when convenient access to traditional local materials was critical. Today, further commercial changes have taken place due to the development of modern logistics. However, with changes in society, the traditional use of local materials has become a gradually disappearing culture, and finding ways and innovations to continue this tradition in this era is a major issue. Furthermore, managing the safety and efficacy of different raw materials is also critical for their continued use. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore and scientifically sort the basic characteristics and uses of Taiwan qīng-căo-chá tea. Further research is needed to clarify its efficacy and safety, which will promote better use of qīng-căo-chá tea.</p>
