<p>Traditional efficacy descriptions identify five common “flavors,” i.e., “sour,” “bitter,” “sweet,” “acrid (pungent),” and “salty,” plus “plain,” and “astringent.” These categories represent three levels of meaning: (1) actual taste, (2) chemical composition changes, and (3) generalization of efficacy. Therefore, the description of “flavors” is a specific assessment of traditional efficacy. The classification of the flavors of qīng-căo-chá tea raw materials showed that most of them were either bitter (51.43%) or sweet (50.00%) (

Traditional practitioners in Taiwan have the perception that bitter ingredients protect the liver and reduce liver fire (here, the actual liver is referred to and not the liver described as the viscera of traditional Chinese medicine). Hence, the bitter flavor is related to the choices made to achieve efficacy. Interestingly, traditional Chinese medicine suggests that bitter medicinal materials enter the heart meridian (viscera and heart meridians of traditional Chinese medicine) and have the effects of clearing heat and eliminating dampness. Therefore, the perception of bitter among traditional Taiwanese practitioners differs from the traditional Chinese medicine theory. In addition, sugar or “sweet flavor” raw materials are added to improve the palatability of the tea. “Sweet flavor” also has the traditional meaning of “nourishing, harmonizing various drugs, and regulating the middle warmer,” which can ease the cold nature of the bitter flavor. Therefore, the sweet flavor is also related to choices for efficacy and taste. Moreover, many people do not consider sugary teas as healthy. Therefore, it is very important to adjust the palatability with sweet raw materials.
