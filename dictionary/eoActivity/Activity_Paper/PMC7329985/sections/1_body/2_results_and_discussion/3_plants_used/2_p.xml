<p>We identified 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton as the most commonly used plant. The traditional applications of

 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Yuris et al., 2018</xref>) and antioxidative activities (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency of its use was ranked 9
 <sup>th</sup> in a previous study (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Qiu, 2004</xref>), but 1
 <sup>st</sup> in this study. This might be because 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton has been actively promoted in Hsinchu County and Miaoli County in Taiwan in recent years, especially in the Kuanhsi Town of Hsinchu County, where 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton is widely cultivated. The local farmers' association has also guided many 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton processing plants and created several products for promoting this commodity (such as the 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton tea, 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton jelly, and 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton chicken stewing bag, etc.). In addition, the use of 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton has a long history in Taiwan, and its flavor is generally accepted by the local population. Beverages with 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton have a deep color, aroma, and an “ancient taste”; and therefore, this source plant is a suitable raw material for traditional qīng-căo-chá tea. Most shop sellers mentioned that 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton is inexpensive, and the longer it is stored, the better it tastes. Overall, its taste is easily accepted by the public. Interestingly, among the liáng chá raw materials used in the Guangdong area, 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton, also known as liáng-fen-căo, is an important herbal tea ingredient because of its heat-clearing effect. It is also the main constituent of guiling jelly (Guīlínggāo) and has been widely used in herbal teas in different regions due to its medicinal properties. Further research and development should be focused on this plant due to its wide application in food and its pharmacological effects.
