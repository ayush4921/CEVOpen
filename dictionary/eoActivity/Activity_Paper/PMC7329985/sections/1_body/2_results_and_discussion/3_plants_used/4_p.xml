<p>In our field investigation, we found that the traditional shops used different raw materials depending on their environment. Specifically, the use of 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> L. had the most significant regional differences. 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> L. is a plant from the family Lamiaceae. Because its volatile oil generates a cooling sensation, it is a critical raw material in qīng-căo-chá tea. We found that shops in central Taiwan (Taichung City, Nantou County, and Changhua County, etc.) did not favor the use 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> L., whereas large amounts were used in counties and cities in southern Taiwan, south of the Tropic of Cancer. Such differences may be related to climate and local hobbies. In the hot climate of southern Taiwan, the use of 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> L. can immediately generate a cooling sensation in individuals. However, in the mountainous areas of the central region with a mild climate, this effect may not be of importance in a local tea formula.
