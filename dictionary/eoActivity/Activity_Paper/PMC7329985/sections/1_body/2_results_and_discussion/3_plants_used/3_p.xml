<p>Besides 
 <italic>P. palustre</italic> (Blume) A.J.Paton, most of the raw materials are plants that are commonly found in the wild in Taiwan, which corresponds with the definition that raw materials for herbal teas are mainly “derived from local plants.” However, there are still some raw materials that are not produced in Taiwan, such as 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. These raw materials are traditional Chinese medicinal materials commonly used in Taiwan and are in conformance with the principle of “using local materials.” Therefore, the commonly used raw materials for herbal teas are not invariable; instead, they vary between different environments, local populations, and medical applications. However, raw materials that are easily accessible are given priority during selection.
