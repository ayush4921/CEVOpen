<p>In order to explore whether the compounds have antifibrotic activities in hepatic cells, we first tested their cytotoxicity against hepatic stellate cells, HSC-T6. Consistent with previous results, after 24 h treatment, viabilities of HSC-T6 treated by both compounds showed no significant differences compared to the blank control group even at the concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (

 <italic>β</italic>-stimulated HSC-T6 treated by RTA and RTB at the concentration of 3, 10, and 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M SLB acting as a positive control. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>. Stimulated by TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>, proliferation of HSC-T6 increased significantly; however, 24 h treatment by RTA and RTB could reduce the proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.
