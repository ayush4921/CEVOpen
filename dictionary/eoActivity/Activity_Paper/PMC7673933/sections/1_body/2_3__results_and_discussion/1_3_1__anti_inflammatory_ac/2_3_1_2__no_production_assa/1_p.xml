<p>RAW264.7 once stimulated by LPS will generate a great amount of NO which is one of the active radical species [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Excessive NO in return may greatly facilitate cascade reactions of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been widely accepted that LPS stimulation can significantly increase NO release in macrophages. In order to study the anti-inflammatory activities of RTA–B, we applied them to RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS to measure their effects on NO production and Indo was still chosen as a positive control. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(a)</xref> displays a dosage-dependent NO production inhibition effects of the compounds. In terms of intracellular NO, consistent with the previous results, these compounds could inhibit the production of intracellular NO represented by the fluorescence intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). And as for intracellular NO microscopy imaging, for all groups, the blue fluorescence representing living cells stained by Hoechst 33342 remained almost stable. The control group showed weak green fluorescence representing intracellular NO. In contrast, cells treated by LPS exhibited strong green fluorescence. However, green fluorescence significantly weakened by RTA and RTB treatment implying their potential for anti-inflammatory activities (
