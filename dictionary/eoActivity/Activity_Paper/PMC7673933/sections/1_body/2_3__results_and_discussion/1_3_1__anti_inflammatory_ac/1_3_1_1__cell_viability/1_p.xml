<p>Recruited myelo-derived free macrophages are important factors accounting for acute and chronic hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, two cell lines, RAW264.7 and LO
 <sub>2</sub>, were selected for the study on RTA and RTB for inflammation treatment. As a preliminary step, we tested their cytotoxicity against the two cells in 24 h treatment duration. As a result, even at the concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, viabilities of the two cells treated with both RTA–B were basically unchanged compared to the blank control group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>), suggesting cytosafety of these compounds. In addition, we investigated the cell viability of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 treated with RTA and RTB at the concentration of 3, 10, and 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M Indo acting as a positive control. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>. 100 ng/mL LPS could stimulate the proliferation of RAW264.7; however, 24 h treatment by RTA and RTB could reduce the proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.
