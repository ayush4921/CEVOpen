<p>In various cultures around the world, inflammation and relative diseases have always been treated by plant and plant-derived agents [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Among them, fruits of 
 <italic>Rosaceae</italic> were reported to possess potential anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As a potential substitute for 
 <italic>R. laevigata</italic>, the convenience of 
 <italic>Rosa laevigata</italic> var. 
 <italic>leiocapus</italic> in the food processing makes it more favorable to serve as a medicinal food source. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic has seriously affected the world's political and economic patterns leading to food insecurity [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; hence, seeking and making full use of food resources with pharmacological values seems more significant in the current crisis. Thus, the medicinal values of 
 <italic>Rosa laevigata</italic> var. 
 <italic>leiocapus</italic> need to be determined urgently. In this present study, the anti-inflammatory and anti‐liver fibrosis effects of two characteristic compounds from 
 <italic>Rosa laevigata</italic> var. 
 <italic>leiocapus</italic>, RTA and RTB, were elaborated. Taking together, our work not only lays a foundation for the development and application of 
 <italic>Rosa laevigata</italic> var. 
 <italic>leiocapus</italic> but also provides dietary supplements targeting at liver inflammation and fibrosis.
