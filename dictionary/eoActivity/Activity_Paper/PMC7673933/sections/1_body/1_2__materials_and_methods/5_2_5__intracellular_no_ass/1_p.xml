<p>The fluorescence data of intracellular NO were also detected using a NO-sensitive fluorescence probe DAF-FM DA. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were dispensed in 96-well microplates with a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well, and RTA and RTB were added to the cell culture medium 2 hours before LPS stimulation after adhesion. After 24 h incubation, cells were loaded with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of DAF-FM DA for 40 min at 37°C, then cells were carefully rinsed with PBS three times, and the data were recorded with 495 nm as excitation wavelength and 515 nm as emission wavelength using a microplate reader (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA).
