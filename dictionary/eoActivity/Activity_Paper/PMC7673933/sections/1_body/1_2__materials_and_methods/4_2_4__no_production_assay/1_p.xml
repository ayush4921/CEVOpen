<p>RAW264.7 macrophages were dispensed in 96-well plates with a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. After cell adhesion, different concentrations of RTA and RTB were added to the cell culture medium 2 hours before LPS (100 ng/mL) stimulation. After 24 h, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of Griess reagents A and B were added to the removed cell culture medium, respectively. The absorbance of the mixture was detected at 540 nm using the aforementioned microplate reader.
