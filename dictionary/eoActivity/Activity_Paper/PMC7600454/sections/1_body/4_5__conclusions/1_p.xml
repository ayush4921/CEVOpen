<p>In summary, our results demonstrate that CH is an interesting plant with rich antioxidant properties and bioactive compounds. Both CHP and CHL can protect human neuronal cells from glucose-induced neuronal senescence. The neuroprotective effect of CHP and CHL is mediated through cell cycle progression in cell cycle checkpoint proteins and SIRT1 up-regulation after SIRT1/GAPDH pathway activation. CH extracts could be developed as agents for the protection of high glucose-induced neuronal senescence.</p>
