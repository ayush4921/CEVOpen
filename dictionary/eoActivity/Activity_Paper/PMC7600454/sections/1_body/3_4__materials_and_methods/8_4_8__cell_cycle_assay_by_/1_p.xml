<p>Cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Having been incubated, cells were co-treated with 100 mM glucose and 1 µg/mL of CHP, CHL or gallic acid for 24 h. After treatment, cells were harvested, washed in cold PBS and re-centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. Cells were re-suspended in absolute ethanol at −20 °C for at least 2 h. Cells were washed and re-suspended in 1% (
