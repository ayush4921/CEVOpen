<p>The extracts (50 µL) and 10% Folin–Ciocalteu Phenol reagent (50 µL) were mixed and incubated in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. A sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) solution (35 µL) was added, mixed and incubated in the dark at RT for 20 min. Reaction absorbance was measured using the Enspire
 <sup>®</sup> Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin-Elmer) at 750 nm. Gallic acid was used as the standard. The amount of phenolic compound was in a Gallic acid equivalent (GE) mg/g of dry weight.
