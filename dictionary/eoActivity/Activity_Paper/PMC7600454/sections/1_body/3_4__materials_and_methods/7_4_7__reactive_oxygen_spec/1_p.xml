<p>The appropriate concentration of extracts was tested. Cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were treated or co-treated with 100 mM glucose or extracts for 24 h. Next, 5 µM of non-fluorescent 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA) was loaded, incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and then washed 3 times with PBS. The level of intracellular ROS was measured based on the ability of ROS to oxidize non-fluorescent H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA into a highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm.
