<p>Noticeably, the difference of the effect on cell-cycle associated protein expression between CHP-treated and CHL-treated groups might be due to the compositional differences of the two extracts, as shown by the GC-MS analysis. GC-MS analysis (

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) revealed that phytochemical constituents of isooxypeucedanin, Î±-terpineol and umbelliferone were only found in CHP and exerted antidiabetic effect by normalizing blood glucose level and re-establishing insulin sensitivity [
