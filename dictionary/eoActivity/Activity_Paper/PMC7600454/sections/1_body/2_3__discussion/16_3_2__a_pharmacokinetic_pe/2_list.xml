  <p>Absorption rate constant (
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>a</sub>) should be determined for a chemical compound of CH. The compound investigated should have high 
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>a</sub>, so its characteristics should be high lipid solubility, weak acids or weak bases and low rate ionization.

  <p>Constant elimination (
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>el</sub>) is a value that describes the rate at which an active compound of CH is removed from the human system. Its value is affected by all processes such as distribution, biotransformation and excretion.

  <p>Volume of distribution (
   <italic>V</italic>
   <sub>D</sub>) represents the distribution of a compound of CH in body tissues rather than the plasma. If 
   <italic>V</italic>
   <sub>D</sub> is higher than the total body water, it indicates a greater amount of tissue distribution. A smaller 
   <italic>V</italic>
   <sub>D</sub> means a compound remains in the plasma than CH distribution in tissues [
   <xref rid="B137-pharmaceuticals-13-00283" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. A compound studied for medicinal benefits should have higher 
   <italic>V</italic>
   <sub>D</sub>, so it should be characterized by high lipid solubility, low rates of ionization and low plasma protein binding capabilities.

  <p>Biotransformation represents the chemical alteration process of therapeutic agents in the body.</p>
