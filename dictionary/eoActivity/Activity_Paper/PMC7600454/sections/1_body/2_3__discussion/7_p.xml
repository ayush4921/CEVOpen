<p>Checkpoint processes control the cell cycle to avoid the accumulation of genetic damage. It does so by monitoring DNA integrity and cell growth during G1/S and G2/M transitions. These processes are common to all eukaryotic cells [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows, in the early and middle points of the G1 phase, Rb binds to E2F causing cells to arrest. However, in late stage of the G1 phase, Rb is phosphorylated by CDKs to increase gene transcription and permit cells to enter the S phase. Cyclin/cdc2 complexes control the cell cycle. Cdc2 is high in the S and G2 phases. In the S phase, G2/M transition control binds to cyclin A and cyclin B, respectively. Cyclin/cdc2 complexes are inactive due to Wee1/Myt1 phosphorylation.
