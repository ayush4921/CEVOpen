<p>Notably, in this study, radical scavenging activity assays of CHP and CHL extracts dissolved in DMSO were performed with DPPH and ABTS in ethanol. However, it still needs to be established whether CHP and CHL extracts’ radical scavenging activities could persist in living tissues’ aqueous environment under physiological conditions. CH extracts should be administered to animals treated with high glucose to induce senescence. Followed by CH’s biochemical evaluation on oxidative stress in blood and tissue samples should be investigated to clarify whether CHP and CHL have scavenging activities under physiological conditions. For example, using samples derived from blood or tissues, antioxidant biomarkers (such as Glutathione (GSH)) could be analyzed. The GSH content indicates the cell’s defense against ROS causing cellular injury [
