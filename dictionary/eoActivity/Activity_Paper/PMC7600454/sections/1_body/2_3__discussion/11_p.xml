<p>SIRT1 is an important protein that plays a role in cell senescence. We hypothesized that both CHP and CHL could protect cell senescence by up-regulating SIRT1 expression. The Western blot results confirmed our hypothesis. When cells were treated with either CHP or CHL, SIRT1 expression was significantly up-regulated.</p>
