<p>Interestingly, CHP and CHL extracts appeared to effectively reduce the intracellular ROS accumulation at the concentration of 1 Âµg/mL but not at higher concentrations. Notably, it is interesting that CHP and CHL may also possess a pro-oxidant activity when administered at high doses. It is worth noting that contributing factors such as dosage, phytochemical profile and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) may relate to the balance between the beneficial and deleterious activities [
