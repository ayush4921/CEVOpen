<p>SIRT1 plays an important role in cell cycle and cell senescence. SIRT1 expression is a response to glucose starvation, as it activates GAPDH phosphorylation. As revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-f009">Figure 9</xref>, SIRT1 and GAPDH expression levels were not significantly different between the control and 100 mM glucose-treated groups. In extract-treated groups, CHP, CHL and GA significantly reduced glucose level in cells. When the glucose level was low, GAPDH was phosphorylated and phospho-GAPDH translocated into a nucleus that up-regulated SIRT1 expression. For these reasons, we found that SIRT1 expression significantly increased and decreased GAPDH expression, which was observed in extract-treated cells (**
