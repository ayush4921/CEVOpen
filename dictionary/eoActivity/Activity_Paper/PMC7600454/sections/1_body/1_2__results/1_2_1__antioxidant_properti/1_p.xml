<p>In this study, 
 <italic>Citrus hystrix</italic> peels and leaves were designated as CHP and CHL, respectively. To investigate the free radical scavenging capacities of CHP and CHL, we used a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate or DPPH assay, as well as a 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) or ABTS assay. Strong antioxidant activity was found in both CHP and CHL extracts. In CHL extract, we found high phenolic (2134.48 ± 1.06 mg(GA)/g of dry weigh) and flavonoid (2856.15 ± 1.24 mg(QE)/g of dry weigh) contents.
