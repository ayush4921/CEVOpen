<p>To examine the effects of CHP and CHL on high glucose-induced intracellular ROS, this experiment was investigated by treating cells with 100 mM glucose alone or combined with different concentrations of CHP (1, 5 and 10 µg/mL) and CHL (1, 5, 10 and 25 µg/mL). The dose-response curve of CH extracts was obtained by isovolumetric additions of CHP and CHL solutions of different concentrations so that the DMSO concentration range was from 0.001 to 0.025% (
