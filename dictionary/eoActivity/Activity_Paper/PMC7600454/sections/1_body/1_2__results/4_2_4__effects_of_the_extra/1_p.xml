<p>Using the working concentrations of both extracts, CHP and CHL (0 to 100 µg/mL) were prepared. We found that all concentrations of CHL had no effect on cell viability. For the CHP effect, the results showed that CHP at the concentration of 50 and 100 µg/mL could significantly decrease cell viability. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the percentage of cell viability treated with CHP for 24 h was 85.50 ± 4.56% and 72.48 ± 16.12% in 50 and 100 µg/mL, respectively.
