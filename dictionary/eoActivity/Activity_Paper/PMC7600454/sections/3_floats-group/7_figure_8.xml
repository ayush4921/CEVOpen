  <p>Cyclin D1, phospho-Retinoblastoma (pRb) and phospho-cell division cycle 2 (pcdc2) expression, as shown in a representative Western blot (
   <bold>a</bold>)
   <bold>.</bold> Normalized values of Cyclin D, pRb and pcdc2 against β-actin ((
   <bold>b</bold>)
   <bold>,</bold> (
   <bold>c</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>)
   <bold>,</bold> respectively). The mean ± SD values of normalized Cyclin D, pRb and pcdc2 expression were obtained from three independent experiments, * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. control; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. 100 mM glucose alone. For Cyclin D1, 
   <italic>p</italic> values were 0.019 and 0.027 for 100mM glucose and CHP, respectively. For pRb, 
   <italic>p</italic> values were 0.037, 0.049, 0.001 and 0.002 for 100 mM glucose, CHP, CHL and GA, respectively. For pcdc2, 
   <italic>p</italic> values were 0.011 and 0.042 for CHL and GA, respectively.
