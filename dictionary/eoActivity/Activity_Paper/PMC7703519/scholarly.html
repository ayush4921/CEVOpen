Purpose</div> <p>Crucial steps have been adopted by health and regulatory authorities around the world to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods</div> <p>Documents and informational materials on regulating the development and management of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and classified. These materials were sourced from official websites and press releases from health authorities and international bodies from selected markets across the globe, and covered the period between January and July 2020. Additional information to support this study was gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available from the public domain, and was complemented with the authors' personal experience.</p> </div> <div class="findings" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Findings</div> <p>Communication has been vital in addressing the impact of COVID-19. A total of 1705 documents and informational materials related to health or regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic were gathered. Of these, 343 (around 20%) were identified as regulatory agilities. These agile approaches were classified into 3 categories, namely, where health and regulatory authorities had: (1) facilitated product management across the entire lifecycle, notably in expediting medical product use for COVID-19, ensuring the continuity of clinical trials, and addressing supply chain issues; (2) strengthened international cooperation; and (3) addressed regulatory burden with the adoption of electronic and digital tools.</p> </div> <div class="implications" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Implications</div> <p>While many regulatory measures have been introduced temporarily as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, there are opportunities for leveraging an understanding from these approaches in order to collectively achieve more efficient regulatory systems and to mitigate and address the impact of COVID-19 and further future-proof the regulatory environment.</p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0010">A global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19 has a significant, even transformative, impact on health care, particularly on those involved in developing COVID-19â€"related treatments, medical devices, and vaccines, and on those who ensure that already-approved medical products remain available to patients.</p> <p id="p0015">To address the effects of COVID-19 and to simultaneously ensure the continuity of development of non-COVID treatments, regulators have demonstrated significant regulatory agility while maintaining high standards of quality, tolerability, and effectiveness.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p> <p id="p0020">Regulators have adopted and made public crucial steps to raise awareness and to provide guidance to stakeholders on how to respond and navigate the current pandemic. In doing so, they have demonstrated tremendous agility. This review provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of these steps and of the approaches made available by regulatory authorities. Through this, we include reflections on some lessons learned and how to leverage solutions that continue to provide value-added, streamlined regulatory processes, or to address regulatory burden for the benefit of all stakeholders; from the medical-product developers through the regulators to health care practitionersÂ for the ultimate benefit of patients.</p> <p id="p0025">In this paper, we present several documents or informational materials related to the regulatory environment around the development and management of medical products concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these documents refer to actions, initiatives, or exceptional approaches where health or regulatory authorities have either: (1) advanced existing initiatives aimed at agile and responsive regulatory systems and processes; or (2) introduced new and innovative ways to expedite and improve such processes. For the purpose of this review, we refer to <i>regulatory agility</i> as the willingness of authorities to take quick action within the accepted regulatory framework to ensure that the regulatory ecosystem swiftly responds to the challenges imposed by the pandemic for the ultimate benefit of patients and society as a whole.</p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and Methods</div> <p id="p0030">The data collected for this analysis were extracted by the authors from COVID-19â€"related information (eg, guidance, guidelines, notices, administrative communications) issued by health authorities in selected markets and regional and international bodies (the African Union, the European Commission, the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization [WHO]) from January to July 2020 during the initial outbreak. These relate to information that has an impact on the policy environment around the development or lifecycle management of medical products. The information was sourced from the official websites of health authorities or bodies, when available, but excluded policies or information related to confinement and lockdown measures or to situational reports (eg, monitoring the number of cases in a region or country).</p> <p id="p0035">The documents were then classified by zone, country, regulatory authority, information format, and topic area. These documents were also further classified into what we refer to as â€œregulatory agilitiesâ€� by flagging those that explicitly indicate, within the text, the use of exceptional measures or flexible approaches of a regulation or regulatory process, which ultimately aim to facilitate the review, approval, and availability of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic within the January to July 2020 time frame. We have then used these data as a basis for extracting trends, learnings, and potential ways forward. To put trends and learnings into perspective, additional information was gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available from the public domain, as were the authors' experiences within the company.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Ensuring Continuous Supply of Medical Products and Avoiding Shortages</div> <p id="p0080">Ensuring the supply of medical products remains essential, especially in emergency health situations, when the risk for shortages can be elevated. Simplified and exceptional management of regulatory processes have therefore been adopted by various regulators to maintain supply and to lower the risk for such shortages. These processes have complemented industry efforts, such as increasing production and donating medical products where needed. Expedited reviews have been offered (<a href="#tbl1">TableÂ I</a>) and have been useful, especially for post-approval changes, such as in the case of the European Union's use of the exceptional change management process.<a href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a> With regard to ensuring good practices, regulators have offered to conduct inspections remotely<a href="#bib28"><sup>28</sup></a> or have granted sponsors existing marketing-authorization approval extensions, automatic recertifications, or temporary certifications.<a href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib29"><sup>29</sup></a></p> <p id="p0085">The use of flexible approaches to labeling has also been widespread. For example, printed labels and packages adopted to a specific market may take a long time to be approved and then produced to ensure their availability during a pandemic. Some of the proposed regulatory approaches to address this issue have included extending the permitted implementation time of the labeling update (except for significant safety updates),<a href="#bib30"><sup>30</sup></a> allowing nonlocal-language labeling,<a href="#bib31"><sup>31</sup></a> using electronic submissions of packaging and leaflets instead of physical samples,<a href="#bib32"><sup>32</sup></a> and packing down of larger packs of medicinal products.<a href="#bib33"><sup>33</sup></a></p> <p id="p0090">In addition, open and transparent communication across stakeholders through virtual communication platforms and online notifications have proved useful in identifying any potential out-of-stock situations (eg, the US Food and Drug Administration's Drug Shortages database<a href="#bib34"><sup>34</sup></a> and mobile app<a href="#bib35"><sup>35</sup></a>), as well as the creation of industryâ€"agency task forces and working groups that allow for regular interactions between industry and regulators on shortages (eg, the executive steering group on shortages and the industry single pointâ€"of-contact system in the European Union<a href="#bib36"><sup>36</sup></a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="greaterwork-sharingandtransversalcollaboration" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Addressing the Regulatory Burden</div> <p id="p0100">Evidently, the current pandemic has also seen progress in the swift adoption of electronic platforms across many countries around the worldâ€"propelling stakeholders into a predominantly digital work mode. Based on information collected from our tracker and our experience when interacting with regulatory authorities, video calls have been used extensively, and even by default, to ensure regular interaction, while the use of the cloud and other online storage tools have been encouraged to store and share documents and information in real-time. Some countries have also opted for online submission of marketing-authorization applications, such as through an email-based or online platform, notably where they have not been previously or extensively used.</p> <p id="p0105">While efforts to modernize regulatory processes through eliminating dated regulations and processes, and through the waiving of supplemental requirements, are not new, the pandemic has undoubtedly demonstrated that it is possible to reduce or even eliminate some unnecessary administrative steps and requirements that can often be burdensome for both regulators and stakeholders involved in the process. Some approaches that have been introduced to lower the bureaucratic burden include:</p> <p id="p0110">Issuance of electronic Certificates of Pharmaceutical Products that are signed and authenticated electronically<a href="#bib42"><sup>42</sup></a>;</p> <p id="p0115">Acceptance of e-signatures<a href="#bib43"><sup>43</sup></a>;</p> <p id="p0120">Waiving of legalizations/notarizations,<a href="#bib44"><sup>44</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib45"><sup>45</sup></a> with the condition of submitting legalized documents after the COVID-19 pandemic<a href="#bib46"><sup>46</sup></a>; and</p> <p id="p0125">Waiving of physical-sample requirements<a href="#bib47"><sup>47</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib48"><sup>48</sup></a></p> </div> </div> <div class="implicationsofcovid-19onhealthauthorityoperations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Implications of COVID-19 on Health Authority Operations</div> <p id="p0130">Many of the identified regulatory approaches have indeed been introduced temporarily to allow health authorities and stakeholders to manage the pandemic and to ensure the continuity of their respective operations. However, even with sustained operations, catching up on backlogs, delayed sponsor meetings, and other activities that had to be suspended during the pandemic constitute a challenge, as does resuming activities that have not yet been extensively tested in a virtual environment prior to the current pandemic (eg, remote inspections).</p> <p id="p0135">Furthermore, new priorities emerging from the pandemic, such as ensuring supply-chain integrity and managing increasing fake medicines,<a href="#bib49"><sup>49</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib50"><sup>50</sup></a> may require health authorities to seek additional tools and resources. In addition, the pandemic has affected the implementation of some new provisions, such as the EU Medical Device Regulation<a href="#bib51"><sup>51</sup></a> or Australia's adoption of TGO 91 labels,<a href="#bib52"><sup>52</sup></a> to which resources have already been initially allocated.</p> <p id="p0140">These new and/or emerging challenges can be addressed by continuously leveraging the agile approaches implemented during this pandemic. While these agile approaches have been triggered by COVID-19, there is indeed additional opportunity to expand them beyond the current pandemic and to adopt them to other services or products that could also benefit all stakeholders involved, notably patients.</p> </div> <div class="leveragingfindingsandopportunities" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Leveraging Findings and Opportunities</div> <p id="p0145">COVID-19 has precipitated several opportunities that could be sustained beyond the pandemic. Based on the trends discussed earlier and the adoption of such approaches to date, 5 considerations in moving forward can be proposed: (1) embedding regulatory agility and lessons learned; (2) accelerating the development process of innovative medical products; (3) address manufacturing and supply bottlenecks; (4) strengthening international cooperation, notably for clinical trials and vaccine development; and (5) committing to easing the regulatory burden and adopting the use of digital technologies.</p> <div class="embeddingregulatoryagilityandlessonslearned" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Embedding Regulatory Agility and Lessons Learned</div> <p id="p0150">Regulators have reacted quickly with the expedited issuance of relevant guidance during the acute phase of the pandemic, while making sure that these remain to meet quality requirements. This reaction was especially useful for the industry's understanding of â€œcurrentâ€� agency thinking and aligning approaches toward addressing the impact of the pandemic. To fully benefit from the gains achieved in the United States of these agile regulatory approaches and extracted lessons for the future, it would be useful to conduct ex-post or postimplementation reviews. These reviews would allow regulators to determine which specific approaches resulted in the most gains across the sector and to identify those that can be introduced temporarily during emergency situations or permanently adopted. Reviewing such approaches can also help to identify best practices that can be shared across regulatory authorities globally and allow for a closer examination to ensure that regulatory mechanisms remain fit for purpose,<a href="#bib53"><sup>53</sup></a> are increasingly harmonized, and take into account the possible risks and consequences in its application.</p> <p id="p0155">Various ways of conducting ex-post evaluations can be pursued, such as in the form of programed review mechanisms or special-purpose reviews.<a href="#bib54"><sup>54</sup></a> Effective stakeholder engagement throughout this process, through dialogue fora or other structured discussions and consultations, is essential for ensuring the uptake and implementation of any embedded regulatory approaches.</p> </div> <div class="acceleratingthedevelopmentprocessofinnovativemedicalproducts" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Accelerating the Development Process of Innovative Medical Products</div> <p id="p0160">In order to accelerate innovation of treatments and vaccines to meet (unmet) medical needs for the benefit of patients, expedited review and approval pathways continue to play an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among mature agencies. For example, the EMA implemented a rolling review tool to speed up the entire review process (<a href="#tbl1">TableÂ I</a>).</p> <p id="p0165">To also stimulate the uptake of innovative medical products in emerging markets, where no expedited pathways are already available, regulatory agencies can consider the use of such pathways beyond COVID-19 and for a wider gamut of products or services, such as in the case of emergency situations or in allowing for an expedited approval of medical products for serious, life-threatening diseases. Nonetheless, any new expedited pathway introduced need to be carefully crafted, and experiences from other regulators that have implemented such pathways can be further leveraged.<a href="#bib56"><sup>55</sup></a></p> <p id="p0170">In addition, the use of existing expedited pathways during the pandemic also offers an opportunity for regulators to reflect on and review the effectiveness of them to identify challenges and solutions to eventually introduce improvements to the process.</p> <p id="p0175">In cases in which the current system of a regulatory authority is still on the path to maturity, and in which resources for dedicated expedited pathways are limited, regulators can adopt reliance or work-sharing approaches that help facilitate the application of such approaches. For example, regulators can rely on trusted regulatory authorities according to the WHO-Listed Authority Interim List of National Regulatory Authorities.<a href="#bib57"><sup>56</sup></a> They can also depend on available global pathways and guidance through the WHO Emergency Use Listing or Prequalification program.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib58"><sup>57</sup></a></p> </div> <div class="addressingmanufacturingandsupplybottlenecks" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Addressing Manufacturing and Supply Bottlenecks</div> <p id="p0180">Medical products should be made available across their entire lifecycle. With the current pandemic affecting the availability across the globe, maintaining sustainable and resilient supply chains became even more important. Agile regulatory approaches related to manufacturing and supply chains, adopted to address some of the issues, have therefore been useful in providing guidance and complementing efforts carried out within industry. With careful review and analysis, such approaches can be broadly adopted and even improved.</p> <p id="p0185">For example, the need for immediately available updated label or package information has resulted in agile approaches to the use of nonlocal language labeling or packed down versions of the product. While the waiving of labeling requirements can be usefulÂ for emergency purposes, developing the use of QR codes or adopting dynamic e-labeling can ensure that the most updated packaging and labeling information are made available and accessible to regulators, health care practitioners, and patients online or through pharmacies, even beyond the current pandemic.<a href="#bib58"><sup>57</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib59"><sup>58</sup></a></p> <p id="p0190">Broader application of remote inspections outside the pandemic, while risk-based approaches are maintained, may also be explored when both the regulatory authority and the manufacturers have an environment suitable for conducting the virtual inspection. Remote inspections can also help to ensure a smooth site transition, in cases of issues encountered with the current manufacturing site, or the possibility of utilizing multiple manufacturing sites.</p> <p id="p0195">Furthermore, partnerships and platforms for discussionÂ that have been leveraged or established during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as those that ensure efficient notification of medical product shortages, remain essential. These partnerships or platforms can play an important role when developing future guidance on the supply of essential medical products that need to be maintained beyond the pandemic (eg, life-saving medicines) or when introducing or enhancing tools for postmarketing surveillance or for the notification of supply shortages.<a href="#bib60"><sup>59</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib61"><sup>60</sup></a></p> </div> <div class="strengtheninginternationalcooperation,notablyforclinicaltrialsandvaccinedevelopment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Strengthening International Cooperation, Notably for Clinical Trials and Vaccine Development</div> <p id="p0200">The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the increasing importance of working transversally across stakeholders to ensure that viable solutions are available for patients around the world. The benefits of different actors working close together is clearly evidenced by the various partnerships and platforms leveraged or initiated.</p> <p id="p0205">For example, lesser-resourced regulatory authorities, whose operations have been greatly impaired by the pandemic, can also benefit from insights from better-resourced regulatory authorities, and facilitate data sharing and approaches more broadly across different jurisdictions, especially on product development, clinical trials, and marketing authorization.<a href="#bib53"><sup>53</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib62"><sup>61</sup></a> Reliance and work-sharing approaches can be further explored, as suggested by the WHO.<a href="#bib63"><sup>62</sup></a> A recently released WHO draft guidance on good reliance practices in regulatory decision-making provides some additional information and insights on how these practices can be implemented by regulators.<a href="#bib64"><sup>63</sup></a></p> <p id="p0210">As various approaches are being pursued to test medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic, consistency and harmonization on the oversight, review, and management of clinical trials are important.<a href="#bib65"><sup>64</sup></a> The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentÂ offers some binding recommendations on the governance of clinical trials, including facilitating international cooperation, by which member states have agreed to abide.<a href="#bib66"><sup>65</sup></a> Approaches that facilitate the management and oversight of clinical trials, such as the use of remote clinical trials, can be further explored.<a href="#bib67"><sup>66</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib68"><sup>67</sup></a></p> <p id="p0215">Maintaining international cooperation across all stakeholders will be especially important for vaccine research and development, which can be a rather lengthy and complex process.<a href="#bib62"><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib69"><sup>68</sup></a> Various approaches are already being pursued to speed up and support the clinical-trial process, such as the use of remote clinical trials, e-consent, and direct-to-patient delivery of investigational medicinal products.

Committing to Easing the Regulatory Burden and Adopting the Use of Digital Technologies</div> <p id="p0220">Already-existing approaches that simplify or facilitate certain regulatory processes, such as the use of electronic submissions and payments, digital signatures, or online platforms for meetings, discussions, or information sharing are also some practices that can be retained or adopted more broadly.</p> <p id="p0225">Opportunities to adopt innovative digital technologies, platforms, and tools can be further explored to propel the regulatory environment further into the future.

Discussion</div> <p id="p0235">Significant efforts to manage and address the COVID-19 pandemic are being made and demonstrated by all stakeholders across the health sector. At the heart of the attention is the tremendous commitment from health authorities and regulators to ensure that communication channels remain open across stakeholders in order to collectively address the impact of the pandemic. Health authorities and regulators have responded promptly and communicated widely. They have provided guidance and demonstrated regulatory agility to complement efforts in the industry. These approaches have ensured that COVID-19 medical products are developed and made available to society, that new medical innovations under development continue to progress, and that existing medical products remain available to patients around the world. Such guidance and agile approaches remain valuable in addressing this crisis and in future situations, especially when they are consistent and aligned across regulatory authorities.</p> <p id="p0240">The current pandemic has provided lessons learned in addressing global emergency situations, and these experiencesâ€"both the challenges and solutions adoptedâ€"can be leveraged for preparation for any future situations and can serve as an opportunity to reflect on current regulatory processes and tools. The authors propose that all relevant stakeholders work together to arrive at concrete proposals and actions in adopting learnings identified from agile approaches used during the COVID-19 crisis. Initiatives to review learnings are being undertaken by some health and regulatory authorities to embed enhancements into future regulatory processes. In some instances, it may help agencies to â€œleapfrogâ€� into contemporary approaches (ie, maturing regulatory agencies looking into advancing their regulatory processes and systems and strengthening collaboration with other regulatory agencies and stakeholders).</p> <p id="p0245">The use of digital tools during the pandemic has also been remarkable and has facilitated the continuity of business operations. It has provided the opportunity for the pharmaceutical sector to reevaluate the use of tools to ensure that they are able to facilitate the efficient functioning of regulatory processes and operations that ensure that medicines are developed and made available to patients. More importantly, this pandemic has underscored the importance and the benefit of working across all stakeholders, which can be continuously leveraged even postpandemic. A robust, coordinated approach will be beneficial, given the shared aims of ending the pandemic, ensuring a healthy population, and better managing emergency situations in the future.</p> <p id="p0250">The deployment of digital-communication tools has seemingly lowered the barrier of communication and perhaps increased the frequency by which they have occurred, which has proven to be beneficial for all parties involved.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="p0255">The use of agile regulatory approaches during the pandemic has helped to ensure that medical products have remained available, and that new ones could be effectively researched to address patients' needs. Nonetheless, many of these approaches have been introduced temporarily to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on patients and society. A number of learnings can be leveraged to further improve the regulatory environment. Proposals include: (1) embedding regulatory agility and lessons learned; (2) accelerating the development of innovative medical products; (3) addressing manufacturing and supply-chain bottlenecks using flexible labeling requirements or digital approaches such as remote inspections to facilitate site transfers or use of multiple sites; (4) strengthening international cooperation, notably in clinical trials and vaccines development; and (5) committing to easing regulatory burden and adopting digital tools. The use of these agile regulatory approaches that add value and have the potential to create opportunities to progress innovative research and development of medical products will be crucial for the future benefit of patients and society.</p> </div> <div class="authorcontributions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
