 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution by zone, with Asia–Pacific having the highest number of documents issued. This number was driven by New Zealand and Australia, which respectively constituted 33% and 30% of the documents in the zone. China represented 13% of the total number of documents in the zone. The second-largest zone by number of documents came from Europe, of which 32% came from European Union–level authorities such as the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency. 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> provides a closer look at the distribution of these documents at the national level, hence excluding documents from regional (eg, African Union, European Medicines Agency) and/or global bodies.
