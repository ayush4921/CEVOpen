<p id="p0235">Significant efforts to manage and address the COVID-19 pandemic are being made and demonstrated by all stakeholders across the health sector. At the heart of the attention is the tremendous commitment from health authorities and regulators to ensure that communication channels remain open across stakeholders in order to collectively address the impact of the pandemic. Health authorities and regulators have responded promptly and communicated widely. They have provided guidance and demonstrated regulatory agility to complement efforts in the industry. These approaches have ensured that COVID-19 medical products are developed and made available to society, that new medical innovations under development continue to progress, and that existing medical products remain available to patients around the world. Such guidance and agile approaches remain valuable in addressing this crisis and in future situations, especially when they are consistent and aligned across regulatory authorities.</p>
