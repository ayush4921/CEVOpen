  <title>Purpose</title>
  <p>Crucial steps have been adopted by health and regulatory authorities around the world to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aims to highlight these steps by providing an overview of the regulatory approaches adopted during the onset of the pandemic, provide an assessment of observed trends, and offer some reflections and proposals to leverage learnings and opportunities from this current pandemic.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Documents and informational materials on regulating the development and management of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and classified. These materials were sourced from official websites and press releases from health authorities and international bodies from selected markets across the globe, and covered the period between January and July 2020. Additional information to support this study was gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available from the public domain, and was complemented with the authors' personal experience.</p>

  <title>Findings</title>
  <p>Communication has been vital in addressing the impact of COVID-19. A total of 1705 documents and informational materials related to health or regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic were gathered. Of these, 343 (around 20%) were identified as regulatory agilities. These agile approaches were classified into 3 categories, namely, where health and regulatory authorities had: (1) facilitated product management across the entire lifecycle, notably in expediting medical product use for COVID-19, ensuring the continuity of clinical trials, and addressing supply chain issues; (2) strengthened international cooperation; and (3) addressed regulatory burden with the adoption of electronic and digital tools.</p>

  <title>Implications</title>
  <p>While many regulatory measures have been introduced temporarily as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, there are opportunities for leveraging an understanding from these approaches in order to collectively achieve more efficient regulatory systems and to mitigate and address the impact of COVID-19 and further future-proof the regulatory environment.</p>
