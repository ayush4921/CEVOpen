    <td> Rolling reviews</td>
    <td>A procedure that allows the regulator to assess data on a particular medical product as they are made available on a rolling basis. In the case of the EMA, this review procedure involves appointed CHMP rapporteurs during the development phase and the agency reviewing the data on a rolling basis. This can be done through several review cycles. Each cycle lasts around two weeks depending on the data to be assessed until the data package is considered complete. Once complete, the sponsor can submit a formal marketing authorization application that is reviewed under a shorter timeline.
