<p>In the study of Ogeto et al., 
 <italic>Aloe secundiflora</italic> water extract was found active against L. major at the lowest concentration of 2000 μg/mL. Methanollic plant extract reported less antileishmanial activity as compared to Pentostam and amphotericn B with MIC of 1000 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 125 μg/mL, respectively. They marked higher antileishmanial activities though not of comparative concentrations than most of the reference drugs. The results also showed that plant extracts had lower toxicity against Vero cells as compared to the standard drug amphotericin B [31].
