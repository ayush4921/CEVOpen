<p>The peaks of NH
 <sub>2</sub> and C=O belonging to the starting amines and aldehyde respectively disappeared in the IR spectra of the compounds (1-9). Proton signal of imine group (N=CH) obtained by Schiff base reaction was observed as singlet at 8.57–8.64 ppm in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of the compounds (1-9). Aromatic protons belonging to benzo[ 
 <italic>b</italic> ]thiophen ring resonated at 7.37–7.97 ppm and CH
 <sub>2</sub> alkyl protons were seen at 1.28–3.68 ppm in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of the compounds as expected from alkyl groups. When carbon spectrawere examined, N=CH imine carbon was observed at 155.64–156.23 ppm in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of compounds 1-9. Aromatic carbon peaks of benzo [ 
 <italic>b</italic> ] thiophene were seen at 123.20–143.19 ppm and alkyl carbon peaks resonated at 24.87–60.58 ppm in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of the compounds. As a result, spectral data supports structures of the compounds (1-9).
