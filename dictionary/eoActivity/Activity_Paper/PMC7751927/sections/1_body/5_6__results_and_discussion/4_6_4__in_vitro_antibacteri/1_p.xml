<p>Different concentrations of some compounds against standard bacterial isolates and yeast isolates were found to have antimicrobial activity, while some compounds were found to be ineffective at the concentrations studied. The test images of compound 1 which have the most effective antibacterial and antifungal effect are given in the Figure 3. The MIC values of the compounds are given in Table 2. It was determined that the compounds showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against 6 of the studied standard bacteria and yeast isolates.</p>
