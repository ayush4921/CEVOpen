<p>Recent advances made in molecular biology and computational chemistry open new avenues in designing novel therapeutic compounds. Molecular biology has provided the crystal structures and cryo-electron microscopy structures of crucial targets for different diseases, which can be used as accurate templates in modeling studies. Computational chemistry offers a range of simulation, multiscale modeling and virtual screening tools for definition and analysis of protein-ligand, protein-protein interactions. Development of new techniques on statistical methods and free energy simulations help to predict novel optimal ligands. Thus, in this study, we performed in silico-guided biological activity studies for a set of newly synthesized compounds. We aimed to synthesize a new series of Schiff bases including benzo [ 
 <italic>b</italic> ] thiophene for more efficacious biologic activities. In order to predict the biological activities of synthesized compounds before the experimental studies, therapeutic activities of these novel compounds were predicted. The therapeutic activity value (TAV) of each compound was calculated by binary QSAR models of 25 common disease QSAR models. In silico results represented that synthesized compounds may show potential activity against in following diseases: bacterial, angina, allergy, depression and obesity. Therefore, these compounds were then tested for their antimicrobial and antileishmanial activities. Moreover, molecular docking study for one of the most active compounds as antibacterial agent was performed and its molecular interactions were studied.
