<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure of the target was used from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB IDs of 5TW8. Protein preparation module was utilized [26], [27]. Missing side chains are filled via prime module and PROPKA [28]. was subjected to determine the protonation of side chains at physiological pH. Finally, a restrained minimization in OPLS2005 force field was applied to these optimized structures.</p>
