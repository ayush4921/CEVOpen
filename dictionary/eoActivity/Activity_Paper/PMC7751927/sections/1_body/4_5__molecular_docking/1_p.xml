<p>The molecules which possessed desirable pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties were subjected to a grid-based Glide/XP docking protocol from Schrodingerâ€™s Maestro molecular modeling package [29]. Binding pocket was determined from cocrystallized ligand and default protocol was employed. Shortly, we used flexible docking approach. Hydroxyl and thiol groups of binding pocket residues were allowed for rotation throughout the docking. Extra precision (XP) protocol of Glide was used. Ten poses were requested at the docking and postdocking minimization was performed.</p>
