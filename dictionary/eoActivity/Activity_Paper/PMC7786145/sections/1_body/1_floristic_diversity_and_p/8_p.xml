 <italic>D. draco</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>ajgal</italic> is located in the Assif Oumaghouz mountain in the Anti-Atlas (Benabid and Cuzin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>), participates in an original and endemic association constituted by 
 <italic>Davallio canariensis-Dracaenetum ajgal</italic> Benabid and Cuzin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>. It is characterized by 
 <italic>D. draco</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>ajgal</italic>, which is an endemic and very rare sub-species (Fennane and Ibn Tattou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1998</xref>), 
 <italic>D. canariensis</italic> and various endemics. According to Médail and Quézel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1999</xref>) the population of 
 <italic>D. draco</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>ajgal</italic> is representative case for North Africa of a refuge for tertiary flora. However, a recent study (Durán et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>) claimed that 
 <italic>D. draco</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>ajgal</italic> may be a taxon at early stages of speciation differentiated from the island source area.
