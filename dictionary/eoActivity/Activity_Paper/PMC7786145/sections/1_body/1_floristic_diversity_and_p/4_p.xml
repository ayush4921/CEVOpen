<p id="Par9">The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by great seasonal variations marked by hot and dry summers with cold and rainy winters (Emberger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1955</xref>). Globally, the area can be divided into two bioclimatic domains, the first of which corresponds to the coastal and subcoastal sectors. Extending from Safi in the north, to the Draa River in the south and including the Souss plain, the southern slope of the western High Atlas and the northern slope of the western Anti-Atlas, have altitudes close to 800 m. This domain is subject to the prevalence of maritime trade winds, particularly in summer (Delannoy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1996</xref>). Due to the oceanic influence, fog and mist are frequent and atmospheric humidity exceeds 85% for many months of the year, mainly in summer and autumn (Delannoy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1975</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1980</xref>). Occult precipitations constitute an important factor related to remarkably dense vegetation. Precipitation levels vary between 100 and 400 mm according to the location and the altitude. The littoral sector is characterized by moderate temperatures (18.5 °C annual average in Agadir and Sidi Ifni) while the inland parts show high values (19.7 °C annual average in Taroudant). The boundaries of this domain are those of the inframediterranean belt.
