 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>; Idm'hand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>). The number of aromatic and medicinal plants is about three hundred with only a few of them being exploited. Further studies are needed to investigate biological activity and confirm their effectiveness in the human health care system and in industrial uses. These plants constitute a significant source of revenue for local populations; indeed some plant species are known of economist interest and are commercialized nationally and internationally. In Morocco, medicinal and aromatic plants play a very important socioeconomic role with annual revenues for export of about approx. 55.9 million dollars and provide 500,000 work days per year for local population (H.C.E.F.L.C.D.
