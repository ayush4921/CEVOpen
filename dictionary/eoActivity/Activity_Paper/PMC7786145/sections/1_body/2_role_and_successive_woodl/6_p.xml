<p id="Par20">Medicinal benefits and properties of argan oil support its use as a dietary supplement. Drissi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>) have shown that regular consumption of virgin argan oil, in ninety-six subjects, has a LDL-cholesterol lowering effect together with antioxidant properties, and can play an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular risk. Similar results have been obtained in rats after treatment with argan oil (Berrada et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>; Berrougui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). Antioxidant effects of argan oil and argan fruits extracts have been proven in several studies (Cherki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; El Babili et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>; El Midaoui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>). This activity is due to the high contents of antioxidants as polyphenols, tocopherols, and sterols (Masella et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2001</xref>). The antioxidant properties of argan oil have revealed that the polyphenols and sterols present in oil have an inhibitory action on the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines (Bennani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). Additionally, the ethyl acetate extract and the decoction of argan fruits showed interesting antimalarial and antioxidant activities (El Babili et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). Argan oil is used traditionally as a cosmetic to treat hair, nail, and skin (El Monfalouti et al.Â 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>). Moukal (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2004</xref>) reports that argan tree leaves have been used traditionally for their antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties, argan wood for its gastroprotective properties and reports the use of press cake as a shampoo and for its antiscabies properties.
