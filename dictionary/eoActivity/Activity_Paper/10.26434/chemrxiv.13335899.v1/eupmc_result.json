    "<p>A comprehensive <i>in silico</i> binding affinity of fifteen guanidine alkaloids against five different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 has been investigated. The investigated proteins are COVID-19 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and non-structural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H). The binding energies for all tested compounds indicated promising binding affinities. A noticeable superiority for the pentacyclic alkaloids particularly, crambescidin 786 (<b>5</b>)<b> </b>and<b> </b>crambescidin 826<b> </b>(<b>13</b>) have been observed. Compound <b>5</b> exhibited very good binding affinities against M<sup>pro</sup> (ΔG = -8.05 kcal/mol), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (ΔG = -6.49 kcal/mol), and nsp10 (ΔG = -9.06 kcal/mol). Compound <b>13</b> showed promising binding affinities against M<sup>pro</sup> (ΔG = -7.99 kcal/mol), spike glycoproteins (ΔG = -6.95 kcal/mol), and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (ΔG = -8.01 kcal/mol). Such promising activities might be attributed to the long ω-fatty acid chain, which may play a vital role in binding within the active sites. The ADMET studies were carried out <i>in silico</i> for the 15 compounds, all examined compounds (except compounds <b>8</b> and <b>15</b>) have low or very low BBB penetration levels. Compounds <b>1</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> showed optimal range levels of ADMET aqueous solubility. Compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>15</b> were predicted to have good intestinal absorption levels, while compounds <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>14</b> showed moderate absorption levels. All examined alkaloids (except the bicyclic compound <b>8</b>) were predicted not to be inhibitors of CYP2D6, non-hepatotoxic, and bind plasma protein with a percentage less than 90%. The toxicity of the tested compounds was screened <i>in silico</i> against five models (FDA rodent carcinogenicity, carcinogenic potency TD<sub>50</sub>, rat maximum tolerated dose, rat oral LD<sub>50</sub> and rat chronic LOAEL). All compounds showed expected low toxicity against the tested models. </p>"
