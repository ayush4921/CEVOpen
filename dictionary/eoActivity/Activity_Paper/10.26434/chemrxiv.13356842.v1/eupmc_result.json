    "<div>Since the worldwide is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no drugs or vaccines have been approved</div><div>for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging</div><div>human infectious coronaviruses. As part of our endeavour in combating this COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper, we</div><div>report on the discovery of an active antiviral small-molecule from Indonesian traditional herbal medicine used in Jamu</div><div>to inhibit 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 using in-silico approaches. As one of the mega biodiversity countries, Indonesia has</div><div>more than 1,180 species that can be prospected for medicine plants. Jamu, the Indonesian traditional herbal medicine,</div><div>is supposed to have similar potentials as those of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, due to the lack of</div><div>scientific proof, Jamu is not recognised in the Guideline of COVID-19 Patients, particularly in Indonesia. Thus, in</div><div>this study, we performed virtual docking screening along with pharmacokinetic and DFT studies of selected 49</div><div>bioactive phytochemicals from several medicinal plants used in Jamu against the 3CLpro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2.</div><div>From the result, it was noted that from a set of 49 phytochemicals of medicinal plants used in Jamu, 2 phytochemicals,</div><div>i.e., Luteolin and Naringenin were identified as potential druggable inhibitors candidates of 3CLpro of SARS CoV-2.</div>"
