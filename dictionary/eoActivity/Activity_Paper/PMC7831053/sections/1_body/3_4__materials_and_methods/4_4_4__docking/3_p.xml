<p>To provide enough space for free movements of the ligands, the grid box was constructed to cover the active sites as defined using AutoDock 1.5.6. The grid points for ClpP1P2 were set to 18 × 20 × 12, at a grid center of (x,y,z) −84.697, −2.336, 38.022 with a spacing of 1 Å. For DprE1, the grid points were set to 20 × 20 × 20, at a grid center of (x,y,z) 14.99, −20.507, 37.226 with a spacing of 1 Å. For InhA, the grid points were set to 26 × 24 × 22, at a grid center of (x,y,z) −5.111, 33.222, 13.410 with space ng of 1 Å. For KasA, the grid points were set to 20 × 20 × 20, at a grid center of (x,y,z) 38.342, −7.033, 13.410 with a spacing of 1 Å. For PanK, the grid points were set to 20 × 20 × 20, at a grid center of (x,y,z) −18.742, 13.919, 11.679 with a spacing of 1 Å. For PknB, the grid points were set to 21 × 20 × 20, at a grid center of (x,y,z) 61.518, 2.429, −25.588 with a spacing of 1 Å. For Pks13, the grid points were set to 16 × 18 × 14, at a grid center of (x,y,z) 3.954, 27.324, 8.499 with a spacing of 1 Å.</p>
