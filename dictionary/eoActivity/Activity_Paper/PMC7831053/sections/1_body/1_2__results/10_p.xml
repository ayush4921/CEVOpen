<p>The interaction between the lignan α-cubebin and Pks13 was examined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f006">Figure 6</xref>) as it had a lower docking scoring (−11.0 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared to the control I28 (−10.5 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). α-cubebin interacts with Pks13 via two H-bonds with the residues Asp1644 and Gln1633 and several hydrophobic interactions with the residues Tyr1637, Ser1636, Phe1670, Ile1643, Tyr1663, Tyr1674, Ala1667, Asn1640 and Arg1641. The interaction with the residues Tyr1663, Tyr1674, Asn1640, Asp1644 and Gln1633 are also key features in the binding of the control drug I28 against Pks13 [
