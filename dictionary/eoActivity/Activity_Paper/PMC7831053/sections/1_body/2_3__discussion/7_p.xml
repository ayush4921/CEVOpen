<p>In conclusion, we show how four promising NPs—tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine, 13′-bromotiliacorine and α-cubebin—have very lower binding energies than the respective controls against three “druggable” anti-mycobacterial targets PnkB, DprE1 and Pks13. Due to problems in obtaining the NPs from natural sources or complex total synthesis, the predicted in silico activity/binding will greatly facilitate drug optimization prior to further studies. Even though in silico and in vitro results are not always correlated, our approach based on reverse docking will generate hypotheses that should inform further in vitro validation studies and aid the optimization of new and promising anti-TB natural products.</p>
