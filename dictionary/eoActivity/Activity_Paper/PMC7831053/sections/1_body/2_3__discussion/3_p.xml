<p>A key aspect of our approach was to identify several “drug-like” properties of the NPs and compare them with conventional anti-TB drugs [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our analyses first assessed the chemical space occupied by the NPs against ClpP1P2, DprE1, InhA, KasA, PanK, PknB and Pks13, which were compared with the respective control inhibitor. This identified NPs which occupied the same “chemical space” as most of the anti-TB drugs. Only isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin and levofloxacin, exhibited higher hydrophilicity compared to the NP. This could indicate that a few NPs have high cytotoxicity due to their higher relative lipophilicity. This will must be directly assessed through experimental testing.
