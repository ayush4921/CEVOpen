<p>In this study, we established that endophytic fungi isolated from medicinal plant of South Africa possess excellent antifungal properties against pathogenic fungi. Endophytic fungi are untapped territories filled with effective, novel bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to control fungal pathogens responsible for the mortality rate and high crop losses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). In conclusion, these endophytic fungi have potential to be used as a natural biocontrol agent in the agricultural sector; antifungal agents in the medical as well as the pharmaceutical industries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on antifungal activity of endophytic fungi isolated from 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> L. plants. Future research should focus on the isolation and characterization of these novel, lead bioactive compounds resulting in product development for a more efficacious, safer and eco-friendly fungicide and antifungal agent.
