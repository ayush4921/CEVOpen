<p>The survival spores, widespread by wind and massive abundance in soil, result in a rapid spread of fungal pathogens in nature. Plant pathogens not only affect the plant cultivation but also influence post-harvest storage and distribution before the consumption of agricultural products such as grains, roots, and fruits. Pathogenic fungi in the soil can result in difficulty for the same area to be used to grow vulnerable crops. They have caused terrible agricultural and economic impact. The aim of this present study is to investigate the antifungal potential of the endophytic fungal community isolated from native
