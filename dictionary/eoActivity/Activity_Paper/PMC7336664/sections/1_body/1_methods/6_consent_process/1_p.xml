<p id="Par63">The process for obtaining consent for this study will be exchanging information between the study staff and potential participants and any other person the participant wishes to include in the discussion. A participant information sheet (PICF) will be provided in written form and will be used as the basis for the discussion. This will cover the purpose, expected procedures, participant requirements, risks, benefits, burdens and side effects that are expected or possible during the study. Participants are specifically informed that due to the nature of this medication and current laws in Queensland, you will NOT be able to drive or operate heavy machinery whilst taking the medication. Potential participants will be given the opportunity (in time and physical capacity) to consider the study and formulate any questions. All questions will be addressed and answered fully. An actual time point for consent will not be specified as this will be determined by the personâ€™s physical condition. The consent form is to be completed by trained study team members in accordance with the requirements of the approving ethics committee. The form is to be signed and dated by the participant.</p>
