<p id="Par50">This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel trial of escalating doses of oral THC/CBD 10 mg/10 mg/mL oral solution. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD combination or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians.</p>
