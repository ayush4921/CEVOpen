<p id="Par51">Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of the two study arms. Randomisation schedules will be developed for each site using random number tables, computer generated at an independent centre. Treatment for each patient will be allocated according to a permuted block randomisation schedule held by the central registry. Block randomisation within each centre will ensure even allocation to each arm in each site. The pharmacy will be notified of a participant, and a completed script with the participantâ€™s study ID number will be given to the site pharmacy. The pharmacist will randomise the participant according to the schedule and dispense the medication in a labelled bottle. The participant ID, allocation number, date of request, preparation and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the site pharmacist for each randomisation.</p>
