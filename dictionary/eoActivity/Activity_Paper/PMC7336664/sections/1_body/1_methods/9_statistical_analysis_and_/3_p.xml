<p id="Par90">Descriptive analyses and frequency distributions will be generated from participantsâ€™ demographic and clinical characteristics, with all variables explored using graphical methods and summary statistics. For the primary outcome, generalised estimating equations with the appropriate link function will be developed to assess the effect of treatment adjusted for centre. For secondary outcomes, where measurements from individual subjects are recorded several times over the course of the study, change over time in the various secondary outcome measures will be assessed using mixed models, accounting for within-subject correlation and effects due to centre. For all statistical analyses, any influence of potential covariates, for example age, sex, type of cancer and disease severity, will be explored. This study is powered to detect superiority of arm 1 over placebo.</p>
