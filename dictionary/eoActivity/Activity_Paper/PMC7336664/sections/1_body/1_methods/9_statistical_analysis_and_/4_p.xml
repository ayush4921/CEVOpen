<p id="Par91">An interim analysis will be performed after 50% participants have completed 14â€‰days of the trial. The analysis will be performed by an independent biostatistician blinded for the treatment allocation and reported to the investigators and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The purpose of the interim analysis is primarily to monitor and ensure safety of participants rather than evidence of such benefit that early stopping of the trial is justified. AEs and SAEs will be stratified by type and severity. The frequency of AEs and SAEs will be compared between treatment groups using chi-square tests and logistic regression if indicated to adjust for any baseline differences between groups. Differences in baseline characteristics are not anticipated, as the randomisation process should ensure that the patient groups are similar at baseline. However, as the numbers at interim analysis will be relatively smaller, it is possible that differences may arise by chance. All baseline characteristics will be assessed and any imbalance addressed in the analysis.</p>
