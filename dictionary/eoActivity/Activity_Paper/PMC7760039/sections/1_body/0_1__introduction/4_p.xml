Despite the importance of maize in smallholder farming systems and the need for alternative forms of crop protection to traditional pesticides, little research has been carried out on bio-pesticides. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo antifungal activity of extracts obtained from the leaves of eight selected medicinal plants against different maize seed 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. Extract selection was based on previous in vitro study against the same pathogens [
