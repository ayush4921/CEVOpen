<p>The smallholder farming system is faced with challenges, including climate change, crop diseases, spoilage of grains during storage and poor seed germination [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These challenges, among others, may result in drastic yield loss and an increase in food insecurity and food prices. Nevertheless, smallholder farming remains an important source of food and income generation, particularly in poor rural communities [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Successful maize production in smallholder farming is dependent on locally sourced seeds. After harvest, the seeds are stored, exchanged or sold to other community members for consumption or for cultivation during the next planting season. This household-based seed system approach is self-sustainable [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it is threatened by microbial infections that often occur during cultivation, transportation and post-harvest storage [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Microbial infections can reduce yield, nutritional value of the seeds and negatively affect seed germination [
