<p>Maize (

 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has the potential to alleviate poverty and plays a key role in food security and economic wellbeing particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In most developing countries, maize is consumed primarily as a porridge and sometimes as freshly boiled or roasted grains. It is also consumed in processed form, such as snacks and cereals. Naturally, it is a source of carbohydrate, fat, fiber, vitamins, macro- and micronutrient elements [

In South Africa, both commercial and smallholder-farming systems are responsible for the production of maize, although this production is dominated by commercial farming. In addition to the availability of cultivated land, commercial farmers rely on irrigation systems, fertilization, pesticides, improved maize cultivars or hybrids and modern machineries to optimize production. In contrast, maize production in smallholder farming is labour-intensive and almost fully rain-fed. Smallholder farmers depend on indigenous knowledge and traditional rudimentary methods to control crop diseases both in the field and during storage.
