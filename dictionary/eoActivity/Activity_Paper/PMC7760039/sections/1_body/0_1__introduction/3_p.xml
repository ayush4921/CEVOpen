These chemicals are largely inaccessible and unaffordable to smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming is practiced in resource-poor communities, where stored grains may be consumed during the storage period. Therefore, seeds or grains treated with synthetic fungicides may cause complications or food poisoning. There is a need to develop relatively cheap and sustainable strategies that can be used to control or reduce grain spoilage, particularly during storage in poor rural communities.
