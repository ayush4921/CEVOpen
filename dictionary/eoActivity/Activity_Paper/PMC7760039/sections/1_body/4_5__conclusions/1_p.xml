<p>The potential application of medicinal plant extracts as alternative bio-pesticides to protect maize seeds against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens was established. Different solvent extracts from the same medicinal plant species demonstrated different activities against tested organisms. Although some plant extracts can be used individually, the combinations of some extracts exhibited stronger activity than their individual extracts against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. Almost all the tested extracts did not have any negative effect on maize seed germination. A combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract had no negative effect on maize seedling growth. The chemical composition of the extracts and any potential toxic effect on human or livestock, as well as the stability of the extracts during grain storage treatment and the frequency of applications, are aspects that require further research.
