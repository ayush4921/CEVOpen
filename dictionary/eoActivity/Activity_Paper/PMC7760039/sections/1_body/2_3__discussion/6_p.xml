<p>Thus, similar to the individual extracts, the activity of the combined extracts also depends on the polarity of extraction solvents and is pathogen-specific. A combination from 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract showed improved antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> and 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. Nonetheless, a combined ethyl acetate extract from the same plant species (
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>) demonstrated reduced activity against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, whereas an improved activity was demonstrated against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Apart from polarities of extraction solvents, the difference in cellular structure and defence mechanisms of the pathogens may also influence antifungal efficacy of medicinal plant extracts. It was observed that acetone extract of 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> was very effective in inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, but ineffective against 
 <italic>F. subglutinans</italic>, 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. A similar trend was also observed with individual application of ethyl acetate extracts from 
 <italic>S. mauritianum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> against both 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. 
 <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> showed large variation in its antifungal activity against different 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, 
 <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, 
 <italic>F. equisite</italic> and 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic>). Generally, the antifungal activity of the extract appears to depend on both the polarity of extracting solvents and the pathogens.
