<p>In this study, we investigated the in vivo antifungal activity of individual and combined plant extracts against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. Moreover, we conducted the phytotoxicity evaluation of the extracts on maize seed germination and plant growth. We found that, in spite of the polarity of the extraction solvents and the tested pathogens, individual extracts obtained from plant species, such as 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic>, 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>, 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic>, 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> and 
 <italic>C. molle</italic> showed remarkable in vivo antifungal activity with values ranging from 68% to 98% inhibition.
