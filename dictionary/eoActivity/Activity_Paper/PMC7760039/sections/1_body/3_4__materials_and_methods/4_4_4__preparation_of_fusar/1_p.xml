Fungal strains were sub-cultured on potato dextrose agar (Merck, South Africa) and incubated at 27 °C in the dark for four to seven days. Thereafter, pathogen suspensions were prepared in potato dextrose broth (Merck, South Africa), which were incubated at 27 °C in the dark for three to four days. Fungal spores were collected by straining cultured broth through sterilized cheesecloth. The number of spores was determined using a microscope and haemocytometer, and appropriate dilutions were made to adjust final spore concentration to 1.0 × 10
