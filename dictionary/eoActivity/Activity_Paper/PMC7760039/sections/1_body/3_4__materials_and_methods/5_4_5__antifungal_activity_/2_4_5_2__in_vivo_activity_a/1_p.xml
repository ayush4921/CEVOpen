<p>A combination of 
 <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> acetone extract was evaluated against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> inoculated on maize seedlings. The extract was selected based on its remarkable antifungal activity exhibited against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>. Moreover, it showed very strong synergistic antifungal activity against more 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens as compared to other combinations as was reported in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Maize seeds were treated with a combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract (2.5 mg/mL) and air-dried in a bio-safety cabinet. Each seed was planted in a 25 cm pot filled with moistened sterilized red soil. The experiment or trial was laid out randomly with ten replications and it consists of untreated seed, plant extract treated seed and commercial fungicide (Efekto-Virikop
 <sup>®</sup>, Efekto, Johannesburg, South Africa) treated seed. After planting, 200 mL of 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> at 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> fungal spore/mL was added to pots with treated seeds and untreated seeds. The second set of untreated seed received 200 mL water and served as negative control.
