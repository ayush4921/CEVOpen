<p>Approximately 7.5 g of disinfected maize seeds was added to a sterilized jar, and inoculated with 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogen (1000 µL) adjusted to 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL. The seeds were shaken for few seconds and air-dried aseptically in a bio-safety cabinet for an hour. Thereafter, 1000 µL of medicinal plant extract at 2.5 mg/mL (combined or individual) was added, shaken well and dried for an additional hour. The selection of combined plant extracts was based on their additive and synergistic antifungal activity against tested 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens, as was reported in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In that study, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.001 mg/mL was reported; however, some plant extracts have demonstrated antifungal activity of more than 2.5 mg/mL. Hence, the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was used in in vivo study as the optimal concentration in which the extracts can easily dissolve in acetone without precipitating.
