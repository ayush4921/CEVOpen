<p>Both individual application of acetone and ethyl acetate extracts from 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> showed poor antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The combination of acetone or ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> resulted in a significantly improved antifungal activity when compared to their individual activity against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Similarly, a combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> acetone extracts resulted in a significantly improved antifungal activity (
