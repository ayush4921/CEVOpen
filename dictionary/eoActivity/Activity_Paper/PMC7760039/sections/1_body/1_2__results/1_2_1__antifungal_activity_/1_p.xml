<p>An individual application of 
 <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic> ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> acetone extracts showed antifungal activity of more than 50% inhibition against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, their corresponding different solvent extractions were less active (â‰¤50% inhibition) against the same pathogen. The combined application of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract showed a somewhat synergistic antifungal activity (66.9% inhibition), against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. There was no significant difference in terms of antifungal activity observed between the positive control (97.1% inhibition) and 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> acetone extract (97.1% inhibition) against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> (
