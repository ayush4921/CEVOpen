  <p>Percentage germination of maize seeds treated with extracts of different plants. Plant compounds were either extracted in WA: Water, or EA: Ethyl acetate, or AC: Acetone. The extracts were produced from 
   <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, 
   <italic>Combretum molle</italic>, 
   <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic>, 
   <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic>, 
   <italic>Solanum mauritianum</italic>, 
   <italic>Melia azedarach</italic>, 
   <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> and used at a concentration of 2.5 mg dried extract/mL of 10% acetone. Water was used as a negative control. There were 5 replicates per treatment, each comprising 20 disinfected maize seeds, and the experiment was repeated twice. Data from the two repeat experiments were averaged and analysed statistically. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), as determined by Duncanâ€™s Multiple Range Test.
