  <p>Percentage inhibition by plant extracts against 
   <italic>Fusarium semitectum</italic> (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> spores/mL) inoculated on maize seeds. Plant compounds were extracted in EA: Ethyl acetate. The extracts were produced from 
   <italic>Lantana camara</italic>, 
   <italic>Combretum molle</italic> and used at a concentration of 2.5 mg dried extract/mL of 10% acetone. Amphotericin B antibiotic (2.5 mg/mL) was used as a positive control. There were 3 replicates per treatment, each comprising 7.5 g of disinfected maize seeds, and the experiment was repeated twice. Data from the two repeat experiments were averaged and analysed statistically. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), as determined by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test.
