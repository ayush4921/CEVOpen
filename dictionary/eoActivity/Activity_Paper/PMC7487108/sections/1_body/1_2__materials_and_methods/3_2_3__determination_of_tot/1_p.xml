<p>The total phenolic content was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In brief, 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of each sample was mixed with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of Folin–Ciocalteu phenol reagent and 80 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of sodium carbonate solution (75 g/L). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm. A calibration curve was plotted using gallic acid solutions (31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL). Total phenolic content was determined as 
 <italic>µ</italic>g gallic acid equivalent per ml of nipa palm vinegar (
 <italic>µ</italic>g GAE/mL).
