 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mass spectra data were recorded in ionization mode for a mass range of m/z 100–700. Phenolic standards from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) were gallic acid (≥99% purity), tannic acid (≥99% purity) and hydroquinone (≥99% purity), catechin (≥98% purity), rutin (≥94% purity), isoquercetin (98% purity), eriodictyol (98% purity), quercetin (95% purity), apigenin (≥95% purity), and kaempferol (≥97% purity), and their purity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
