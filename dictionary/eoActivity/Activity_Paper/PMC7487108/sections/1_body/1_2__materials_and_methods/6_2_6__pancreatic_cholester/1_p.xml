<p>The pancreatic cholesterol esterase inhibition assay was performed according to a previously published method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, different concentrations of nipa palm vinegar were incubated with mixtures containing 5.16 mM taurocholic acid, 0.2 mM p-nitrophenylbutyrate (p-NPB) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.0. Porcine pancreatic cholesterol esterase at concentration of 1 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL was added into the reaction tube, and samples were incubated at 25°C for 5 min. After that, the absorbance of the solutions was measured at 450 nm. Simvastatin served as a positive control. Results were based on triplicate analysis.
