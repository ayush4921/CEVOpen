<p>Dyslipidemia is a key risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases which leads to increased morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Natural products have been used as an alternative medicine for the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are many risk factors for dyslipidemia including genetic factors, hormonal abnormalities, and lifestyle factors. A diet especially high in fat is believed to be one of the greatest risk factors for the development of dyslipidemia [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Normally, pancreatic lipase is a key enzyme that hydrolyses ester linkages of triglyceride [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, pancreatic lipase inhibition is a goal to reduce fat absorption to control dyslipidemia. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase is an enzyme which hydrolyses cholesterol esters, so inhibition of pancreatic cholesterol esterase can reduce cholesterol absorption and may be useful for therapeutics for controlling cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, the reduction of micelle formation is a target for lowering blood cholesterol level [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This study evaluated nipa palm vinegar for its total phenolic content and the presence of phenolic compounds as well as determined its ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase, inhibit cholesterol esterase, and inhibit cholesterol micellization.
