<p>According to our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> finding, it can be hypothesized that phenolic compounds including gallic acid, isoquercetin, quercetin, catechin, and rutin from NPV may be the main active compounds with possible cholesterol-lowering effects through inhibition of pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase activities as well as the inhibition of solubility of cholesterol micelles. More 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in animal and clinical human studies are required to determine the anti-dyslipidemia activity of NPV and to confirm its mechanism for the aim of application in the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia.
