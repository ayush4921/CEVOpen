<p>Orlistat is a well-known pancreatic lipase inhibitor which is produced from 
 <italic>Streptomyces toxytricini</italic>. It reacts with lipases at the active site serine by forming a covalent bond and thus inactivating the ability of these enzymes to hydrolyse dietary fat in the small intestine [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Adverse effects of orlistat are liquid stools, steatorrhea, fecal urgency, incontinence, flatulence, abdominal cramping, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Recently, many researchers have been focused on the effects of natural products for the treatment of dyslipidemia [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our study determined the inhibitory activity of NPV towards pancreatic lipase, and the results showed that NPV can inhibit pancreatic lipase in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 69.95 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/mL. In a previous study, an aqueous extract of NPV was able to significantly reduce blood glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aqueous extract of NPV also stimulated insulin secretion in RIN-5F cells [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, nipa palm sap and its syrup inhibited 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase which hydrolyses polysaccharides [
