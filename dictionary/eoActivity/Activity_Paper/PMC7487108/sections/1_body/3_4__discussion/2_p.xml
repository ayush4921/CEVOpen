<p>Natural phenolic compounds as secondary metabolites of plants consist of phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, stilebenes, curcuminoids, coumarins, lignans, quinones, and others [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Phenolic compounds have been shown to have several pharmacological effects including antioxidant [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], anti-hypertensive activity [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], antidiabetic effect [

 <italic>µ</italic>g GAE/mL and showed antioxidant activity against DPPH free radicals [
