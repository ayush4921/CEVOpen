<p>Pancreatic cholesterol esterase exerts important functions in controlling the bioavailability of cholesterol from dietary cholesterol esters, contributing to the incorporation of cholesterol into mixed micelles, and in helping to transport free cholesterol to enterocytes [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has previously been reported that inhibition of pancreatic cholesterol esterase and the solubility of cholesterol micelles by gallic acid, catechin, and epicatechin from grape seed extract results in delaying the absorption of cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The current findings revealed that NPV inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase and the solubility of cholesterol micelles in a concentration-dependent manner. There was a positive correlation between pancreatic lipase inhibition and pancreatic cholesterol esterase inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol micellization inhibition had a positive correlation with pancreatic lipase inhibition and pancreatic cholesterol esterase inhibition. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the NPV can inhibit pancreatic cholesterol esterase and may protect against cholesterol micellization.
