<p>Spectrophotometric method involving DPPH scavenging by plant extracts was adopted for determination of antioxidant activity. This method is based upon the bleaching of violet color of DPPH reagent to yellow by polyphenols present in extracts [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The DPPH scavenging was an index of antioxidant potential and measured as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (µg/mL). A standard antioxidant compound (BHA) was also used as reference standard. The plant extracts (50–250 µg) were added to freshly prepare methanolic DPPH reagent solution. After addition of plant extracts, the samples were stayed for a period of 20 min at 35 °C for reaction completion. After incubation, the samples were subjected to absorbance measurement at 517 nm. The results of radical scavenging % were computed by using following mathematical relation:
 <disp-formula>Scavenging effect (%) = (Control
  <sub>absorbance</sub> − Sample
  <sub>absorbance</sub>/Control
  <sub>absorbance</sub>)
 </disp-formula>
