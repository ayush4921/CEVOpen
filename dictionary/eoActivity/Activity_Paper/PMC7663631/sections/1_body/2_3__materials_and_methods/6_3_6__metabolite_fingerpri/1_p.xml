<p>Based upon data of different assays, the most potent extract was dissolved in MeOH (aq.). The methanolic extract was filtered for sample preparation through Poly-tetrafluoroethylene filter (0.45 µm). The UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) technique was used for metabolite identification due to its robustness, rapidness, efficacy and authenticity. The instrument was operated with scanning range of 50 to 1200

 <italic>z</italic> (negative ionization mode). The solvent system was composed of water and acetonitrile each having 0.1% formic acid. Gradient elution was performed, and flow of mobile phase was set at 0.8 mL/min with sample injection volume of 20 µL. Sciex Peak views 2.1 software (Sciex, Selangor, Malaysia), ACD/Lab and ChemSpider/PubChem databases were utilized for data analysis [
