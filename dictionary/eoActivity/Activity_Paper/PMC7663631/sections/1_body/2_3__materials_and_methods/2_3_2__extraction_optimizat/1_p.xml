<p>Mature fresh 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> leaves were acquired from periphery of Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Pakistan. The plants were collected and retained carefully for identification. The identification of plant species was conducted at Botany Department of University of Gujrat, Pakistan and voucher specimen (UOGCHEM47/2018) was also submitted. Freshly collected leaves were cleaned gently to remove dust. The cleaned leaves were immediately treated with liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> to stop the metabolic processes for maximum conservation of secondary metabolites. They were then subjected to lyophilization at −68 °C for 48 h to obtain fully dried fluffy material. The freeze dried leafy material was converted into fine powdered (60mesh) and stored in Ziplock packing at −80 °C till further experimentation. The powder (10 g) was then extracted in 100 mL of binary solvent system (ethanol: water solvent, i.e., 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 
 <italic>v/v</italic> and pure ethanol) at ambient conditions of temperature (35 ± 0.2 °C) and humidity (25 ± 5%) for 2 days. After that obtained extracts were vortexed for 2 h (Wise Mix SHO1D, DAIHAN Scientific, Seoul, Korea) followed by sonication at 20 KHz for 30 min (Soniprep 150 ultrasonicator MSE, Buckinghamshire, UK), centrifuged at the rate of 13,000 rpm for 10 min and filtered using filtration assembly attached with a vacuum pump for proper removal of debris. Evaporation of excess solvent was carried out using a rotary vacuum evaporator under reduced pressure to avoid loss to phyto-constituents. Finally, the extracts were subjected to another freeze drying at −68 °C and stored at very low temperature in freezer till future use.
