<p>The identified secondary metabolites were subjected to docking studies. For the purpose, Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2016.08) software (Chemical Computing Group, Köln, Germany) was utilized. The porcine pancreatic lipase structure was downloaded, and compounds were docked in the active site region. The ligand–enzyme conformations were prepared, and binding energies were computed after minimizing the energy. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions at various amino acid residues were studies. The docking result analysis of surface with graphic representation was done using MOE and discovery studio visualize (3ds, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
