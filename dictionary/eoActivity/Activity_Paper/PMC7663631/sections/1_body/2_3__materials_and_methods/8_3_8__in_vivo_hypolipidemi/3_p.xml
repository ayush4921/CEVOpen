<p>The mice were treated as per design for a further eight-week period. After completion of treatment protocol, mice BW were compared, and fecal fat contents were determined. The dietary intake was also recorded. The blood from the lateral vein of the mice was subjected to determine the total cholesterol (TC) in mg/dL, high density lipoproteins (HDL) in mg/dL, low density lipoproteins (LDL) in mg/dL and triglycerides in mg/dL [

The changes in liver function test enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) were calculated to observe the changes in biochemical profiles of mice. Mice were dissected by applying lignocaine and ether anesthesia. All the ethical guidelines were followed to reduce the suffering of animals from experimental procedure. Mice were dissected to collect liver, heart and kidney with care and subjected to weight determination.
