<p>The 60% ethanolic plant extract being the most potent regarding antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties was selected for in vivo dosing. The comparison of weight gain of obese mice, their fecal fat contents and food intake is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04935-f004">Figure 4</xref>a–d. The weight change data showed that an increase of 44.94% was observed for HFD mice whereas this increment for NDG was 22.21% at the end of eight weeks HFD treatment (

After eight weeks HFD treatment, the obese mice were split into groups to evaluate the influence of plant extracts on obesity parameters. The treatment with plant extracts and orlistat remained continue for further eight weeks period. The HFD mice treated with plant extract at 300 mg/kg BW restricted the weight to 32.22 ± 1.86 g when compared to HFD group (52.66 ± 2.03 g) at the end of eight weeks experimental protocol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04935-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). The orlistat also inhibited the weight gain and eight week’s value of BW of mice was 30.09 ± 1.61 g. The increase in body weights upon consuming HFD was most probably due to massive acylation of saturated fatty acids which were stored in adipose tissues. HFD also reported to reduce the satiety signal which resulted in weight gain [
