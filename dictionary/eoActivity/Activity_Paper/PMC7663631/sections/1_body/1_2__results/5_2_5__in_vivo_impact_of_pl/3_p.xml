<p>The mice were dissected and vital organs like liver, heart and kidney were collected, weighed and compared. The results of organ weight are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04935-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The HFD increased the liver, heart and kidney weights of mice. The comparison of liver weight showed that plant extract (HFD + 300) inhibited the increase in liver weight efficiently even higher than orlistat and statistical analysis revealed that the value of liver weight for HFD + 300 mice was significantly lower (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The restriction in organ weight gain upon administrating plant extract may be attributed to some metabolic changes, e.g., modifications in diets which activates the melanocyte hormone and promotes organâ€™s weight loss and reduction in triglycerides absorption resultant in organ and body weight loss. Moreover, reduction in total cholesterol and LDL concentration also leads to reduction in weight by regulating the adipogenic and lipogenic transcription factors [
