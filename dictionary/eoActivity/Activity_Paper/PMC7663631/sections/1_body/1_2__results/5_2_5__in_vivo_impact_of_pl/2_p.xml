The lowest fecal fat contents of 2.25% were observed for NDG mice while highest fat contents of 11.65% were noted for orlistat-treated mice. The high extract dose of 300 mg/kg BW substantially increased the fecal fat contents (9.92%) than HFD mice with fecal fat content value of 5.67%. The increase in fecal fat contents by plant extract was considered as an important phenomenon involved in antiobesity properties of plant extract [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04935-f004">Figure 4</xref>d. The lowest food intake of 3.44 g/mouse/day was observed for NDG mice whereas highest food consumption of 4.12 g/mouse/day was noticed for HFD mice. The values of food intake for HFD + 300 and HFD + Orlistat groups were 3.65 and 3.8 g/mouse/day, respectively. There was a slight variation among food intake values during the period of eight weeks.
