<p>Extraction is an important step in studies involving biologic potential of plants. Functional molecules are usually occurred in low concentration in plant extracts. The high extract yields may guarantee the relatively higher amounts of active compounds. The role of solvent polarity and extraction techniques is imperative for high extract yields. Extracts with high polyphenol concentrations reflect high antioxidant and related pharmacological activities [

Phenolics are vital plant bioactives with the ability to scavenge free radicals for improvement in physiological attributes especially under diseased or stressed conditions. The antioxidant activities of polyphenols are mainly due to site specific interaction of their structural moieties with reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

Hence, it is imperative to quantify the phenolics and flavonoids to predict about possible antioxidant and antiobesity potential of a particular plant extract or fraction. The experimental outcomes of current work regarding extract yields, total phenolic and flavonoids from leaves of

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04935-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It was noted that maximum extract yield was recovered in case of 60% hydroethanolic extract being significantly higher among all extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The extract yield substantially increased by increasing ethanol component of solvent system up to 60% and then a decline was observed for further increase in the ethanol concentration. The solvent polarity set by 60% ethanol along with freeze drying and ultrasonication might be an effective combination to improve the extract yields [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The highest concentration of total phenolic contents (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) was computed in 60% hydroethanolic extract (123.42 ± 0.007 mg GAE/g, 55.81 ± 0.004 mg RE/g) followed by 80% extract (70.46 ± 0.004 mg GAE/g, 34.92 ± 0.003 mg RE/g), pure ethanolic extract (69.42 ± 0.005 mg GAE/g, 33.97 ± 0.004 mg RE/g) and 40% hydroethanolic extract (33.53 ± 0.003 mg GAE/g, 21.09 ± 0.005 mg RE/g). Minimum amounts of TPC and TFC were detected in 20% hydroethanolic extract (18.53 ± 0.004 mg GAE/g, 12.82 ± 0.001 mg RE/g). The extract yields and polyphenol concentration increased significantly by increasing the alcoholic fraction of solvent system up to 60% and then decreased upon further increase in ethanol. Comparatively larger amounts of polyphenols from 60% hydroethanolic extract may be due to polarity of the solvent which creates compatibility with polar compounds. A statistical comparison produced a statistically insignificant difference of means for TPC and TFC values among 80% hydroethanolic and pure ethanolic extracts (

The strong linkage between phytochemicals present in plant extracts and antioxidant activity is well reported and established phenomenon [
