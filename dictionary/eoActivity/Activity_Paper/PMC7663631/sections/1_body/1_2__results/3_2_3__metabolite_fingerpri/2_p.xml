<p>Precursor ions [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> were generated by negative ionization mode of mass spectrometer, which were further analyzed by product ion mode to produce their fragments or daughter ion peaks. Totally, 21 compounds peaks were analyzed for identification purpose. Compound (

 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 317 and the molecular formula C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> was suggested as myricetin. The MS/MS fragment of the same compound was observed at 226, which indicated the possible loss of C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (loss of 91). It also indicated characteristic fragment ion at 165 most probably due to the neutral loss of C
 <sub>7</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (loss of 152) from the precursor ion [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>2</bold>) (eluted at the retention time of 0.78 min) gave a deprotonated molecular [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at

 <italic>z</italic> 451 (C
 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O
 <sub>11</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The MS/MS spectrum of this compound presented fragments at 415, 405 and 235, indicating possible cleavage of 2H

 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>O (loss of 46) and C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> (loss of 216) from the mother ion at 451, respectively while a characteristic fragment at 307 might be due to C
 <sub>7</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>O (loss of 108) from the ion at 415. Based on the molecular composition and fragmentation mechanism, compound (
 <bold>2</bold>) was tentatively identified as curculigoside B. Compound (
 <bold>3</bold>) eluting at 0.79 min displayed precursor [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 191. The same molecular ion was further fragmented into daughter ions at 173[M – H − H

 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 18), 127 [M – H − 2H
 <sub>2</sub>O − CO]
 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 64), 111 [M – H − 2H

 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 80) and 85 [M – H − C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 106), whereas the peak at 93 could be attributed to the phenol group. These fragmentations were consistent with previously reported studies [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Hence, compound (
 <bold>3</bold>) was confirmed as quinic acid on the basis of spectral information. Compound (
 <bold>4</bold>) was recorded at the retention time of 0.81 min in negative ionization mode and produced molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 215 (C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>9</sub>NaO
 <sub>4</sub>). A prominent peak was also appeared at 179 (C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) after possible loss of CH
 <sub>2</sub>Na group (loss of 36) from parent ion. The deprotonated ion on further fragmentation led to the formation of fragment ions at 161 [M – H − CH
 <sub>3</sub>ONa]
 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 54), 143 [M – H – C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>O

 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 72) and 89 [M – H – C
 <sub>7</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> (loss of 126).This fragmentation mechanism was consistent with the literature [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based on QTOF-MS/MS data, characteristic fragment ions and reported literature, compounds (
 <bold>4</bold>) was most probably identified as sodium ferulate. Metabolite (
 <bold>5</bold>), with molecular formula C
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (recorded at retention time of 0.94 min) and having the precursor [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 133 in the negative ionization mode, was characterized as 2-hydroxy-succinic acid and was confirmed by matching with literature data [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>6</bold>) (eluting at 6.22 min) with parent ion peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 177 and the molecular formula C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> was identified as a daphnetin and agreed with the previously reported data [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The molecular ion of the compound (
 <bold>7</bold>) at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 421 [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> eluting at retention time of 7.14 min, produced the diagnostic fragment ion at 331, which was due to the cleavage of C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> molecule (loss of 90) from the ion at 421. The presence of daughter ion at 301 was due to loss of C
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (loss of 120) from the precursor ion. Based on spectral and literature data, compound (
 <bold>7</bold>) was tentatively assigned isomangiferin [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>8</bold>) appeared at the retention time of 7.26 min and was identified as apocynoside I. The molecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 385 [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> (C
 <sub>19</sub>H
 <sub>30</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) and mass spectrum with product ions at 205 and 153 (which may be derived by cleavage of C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> (loss of 180) and C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> (loss of 232) residue from precursor ion, respectively) were in accordance with this compound [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>9</bold>) was identified/characterized as lappaol C on the basis of its MS/MS spectrum and retention behavior, which was same as the standard lappaol C. The MS/MS spectrum of lappaol C indicated [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion of

 <italic>z</italic> 553 in negative ionization mode [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While the fragment at 517 may be due to the neutral loss of water molecules (loss of 36) from precursor ion. Compound (
 <bold>10</bold>) appeared at retention time of 7.78 min exhibited a mass spectrum with deprotonated [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 387. Examination of mass data bank (PubChem) indicated these data to be consistent with the structure of icariside B4. Compound (
 <bold>11</bold>) eluting at the retention time of 7.96 min showed a molecular [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 609 that generated a characteristic fragment ion at 447 ([M − H − 162]
 <sup>−</sup>, suggesting possible neutral loss of hexosyl residue). As per reported data, the fragment at 447 is typical for kaempferol glucoside [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, compound (
 <bold>10</bold>) was identified tentatively as kaempferol-3,7-diglucoside. Metabolite (
 <bold>12</bold>) was identified as (−)-olivil-4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside owing to precursor ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 537 [M − H]
 <sup>–</sup> (C
 <sub>26</sub>H
 <sub>34</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Still, MS/MS spectrum of compound (
 <bold>12</bold>) in negative ion mode indicated product ion at 327 may be due to neutral loss of C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (5-hydroxyferulic acid group, loss of 210) from parent ion at 537. Compound (
 <bold>13</bold>) (retention time of 9.33 min, 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 579 [M − H]
 <sup>–</sup>) exhibited a fragment at 285 [M − H − 294]
 <sup>−</sup> (after possible cleavage of 
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranoside (loss of 132) and hexoside (loss of 162) residues). Furthermore, the fragment at 285 [kaempferol − H]
 <sup>−</sup> was indicative of kaempferol derivative [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>13</bold>) was therefore tentatively identified as kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranoside.
