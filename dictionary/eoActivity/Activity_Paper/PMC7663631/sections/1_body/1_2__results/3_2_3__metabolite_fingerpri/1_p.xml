<p>In vitro studies revealed that 60% hydroethanolic extract from 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> leaf was most effective. Hence, the same was processed for identification of bioactive metabolites by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. The base peak chromatogram of chromatographic analysis of said extract is given as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04935-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Mass spectral data of all identified bioactives (including [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ions, MS/MS fragments, retention times and class of compounds) is given in
