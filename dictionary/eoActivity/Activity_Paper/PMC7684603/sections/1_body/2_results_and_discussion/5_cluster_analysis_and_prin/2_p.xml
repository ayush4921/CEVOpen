<p>Another goal of this study was to monitor the differences and similarities between different phenological stages in order to find the consequences of different harvesting time on identified phytochemical compounds in 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic>. The results of the main components analyses are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Based on these results, three components had highest eigenvalue, reporting 89.45% of the total variance. The relative variance for the first, second, and third components was 55.52%, 23.28%, and 10.65%, respectively. In the first component, the compounds of butyl butyrate, carene, 4‐methylpentyl isobutyrate, hexyl butyrate, cis‐5‐octen‐1‐ol, octyl acetate, hexyl 2‐methylbutyrate, octyl isobutyrate, β‐bisabolene, 1‐tetradecicanol, p‐hydroxybenzoic acid, rosmarinic acid, and essential oil content had the highest loading factor. Differently, in the second and third components, m‐coumaric acid and gallic acid compounds had the most top loading factor, respectively (Table
