<p>Since 78.80% of the total variance was allocated to the first and second components, they were used for the biplot diagram obtained from the PCA. Different phenological stages were divided into three distinct groups which shown in the Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The biplot analysis showed the vegetative stage (S1), based on the first and second components alone and with high distance with other phenological stages. It was strongly correlated with the compounds of carene, rosmarinic acid, anethole, caryophyllene, β‐pinene, limonene, and salicylic acid. The phenological stages of floral budding (S2) and full flowering (S3) were segregated in one group according to the first and second components which have a high correlation with β‐bisabolene, p‐hydroxybenzoic acid, anethole, p‐coumaric acid, γ‐terpinene, apiol, a‐pinene, myristicin, ferulic acid, extraction content, cinnamic acid and, vanillic acid compounds. On the other hand, other phenological stages, including early seed development, mid‐mature seed, and mature seed, were grouped together and have a strong correlation with butyl butyrate, 4‐methyl pentyl isobutyrate, hexyl 2‐methyl butyrate, hexyl butyrate, octyl acetate, cis‐5‐octen‐1‐ol, octyl isobutyrate, caffeic acid, gallic acid, and essential oil content. In research on the

 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Results of this study also showed that the measured phytochemical compounds were affected by different treatments. Moreover, they showed that for the first component, eight compounds had the highest loading factor. Esmaeili et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) showed the first two components accounted for 95% of the total variance using the principal component analysis based on phytochemical compounds of 
 <italic>Oliveria decumbens</italic> (Esmaeili et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). They showed that 12 and 7 compounds accounted for the highest factor loading in the first and second components, respectively. Other researchers also used principal component analysis to identify the dominant compounds in the useful components in other medicinal plants like
