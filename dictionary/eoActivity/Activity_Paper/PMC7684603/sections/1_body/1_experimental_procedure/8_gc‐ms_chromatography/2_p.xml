<p>In addition to GC, a gas chromatography device connected to a mass spectrometer (Model: Agilent 7890 A G Chromatograph and Agilent 5975 c Mass), called GC‐MS chromatography, was used to analyze the essential oil. In this experiment, GC‐MS chromatography was equipped with HP‐5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm). According to the planned program, the oven temperature remained constant at 50°C for 3 min and remained constant for 5 min after increasing the temperature to 260°C with a ramp‐up of 3°C/min. Here again, nitrogen was utilized as carrier gas at the rate of 1 ml/min. The analysis was performed with scan time (30 m/z), range of analysis (600 m/z), ionization 0/6 s, 70 Electron volt and solvent evaporation rate of 2 min. The compounds were then identified by index (ki) and Wiley Library and Nist11.</p>
