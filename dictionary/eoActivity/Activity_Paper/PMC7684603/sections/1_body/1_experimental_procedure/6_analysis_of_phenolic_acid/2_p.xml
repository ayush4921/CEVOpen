<p>In order to analyze the phenolic acid compounds, HPLC (Waters 2695, USA) system equipped with a diode‐array detector, a 20 µl loop, and an ODS column (250 mm × 0.46 mm, 5 µm) was operated. The reverse‐phase separation was done with gradient elution solvent A [methanol TFA (99.9:0.1, v/v)] and B [water TFA (99.9:0.1, v/v)] at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with the following elution gradient: 20% A, at 0 min; 30% A, (from 0 to10 min); 60% A, (from 10 to 30 min); 80% A, (30 to40 min); 100% A, (40 to 45 min); 20% A, (from 45 to 52 min); isocratic, 6 min. The phenolic compounds were detected at 254 nm, 275 nm, and 320 nm, and identified based on the retention time and spike method. Finally, the standard external method was applied to quantify the studied phenolic acids. The results were expressed as mg per g of the extract weight.</p>
