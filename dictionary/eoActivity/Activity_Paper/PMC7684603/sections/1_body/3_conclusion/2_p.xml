 <italic>H. persicum</italic> is one of the most important aromatic medicinal plants in Iran that has valuable phytochemicals compounds, which make it a precious medicinal plant to grow in other parts of the world. The results of this study clearly indicated that the yield and quality of the phytochemical composition of the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> were significantly changed during the growth period and strongly depends on various phenological stages. The highest yield of essential oil was obtained in the intermediate stage of seed mature, and the highest content of extract was captured in the floral budding stage. Limonene, myristicin, and anethole were predominant compounds in vegetative and flowering stages, and the best stage for achieving the maximum value of hexyl butyrate and octyl acetate content was the seed formation stage. The results of the present study introduced 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> as a rich source of phenolic acids, of which cinnamic acid was one of the predominant compounds in all growing stages, and its highest value was obtained in the floral budding stage. Finally, it can be concluded that to reach the maximum essential oil content and composition of aliphatic esters compounds, harvest at the seed set stage, especially in the mid‐mature seeds stage, is desirable. In addition, harvesting the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> at the flowering stage, especially at the floral budding stage, leads to maximum content of extract yield and phenolic acid compounds.
