 <p>The herb 
  <italic>Isodon serra</italic> (Maximowicz) Kudô, which is widely distributed in China and its neighbor regions, is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant. In this study, we characterized the complete plastid genome sequence of 
  <italic>I. serra</italic> using Illumina sequencing data. The plastome is 152,676 bp in length and contains a typical quadripartite structure. The inverted repeat (IR), large-single copy (LSC) and small-single copy (SSC) regions each has 25,716 bp, 83,564 bp, and 17,680 bp. The genome contains 80 protein coding genes (PCGs), 30 transfer RNAs (tRNA), and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNA). The phylogenetic result indicates 
  <italic>I. serra</italic> together with genera 
  <italic>Ocimum</italic> and 
  <italic>Lavandula</italic> formed tribe Ocimeae clade.
