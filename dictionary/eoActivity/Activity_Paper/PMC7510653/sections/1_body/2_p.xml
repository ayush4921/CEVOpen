<p>The plastome of 
 <italic>I. serra</italic> is 152,676 bp in length and contains a typical quadripartite structure, comprising two copies of inverted repeat (IR) regions (25,716 bp), a large-single copy (LSC) region (83,564 bp), and a small-single copy (SSC) region (17,680 bp). It has 80 protein coding genes (PCGs), 30 transfer RNAs (tRNA), and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNA). The GC content of the genome is 37.6%, and varies among three regions. Specifically, LSC, SSC, and IR regions each has 35.7, 31.1, and 43.1%. The ML tree based on 80 PCGs shows that tribe Elsholtzieae (only represented by 
 <italic>Perila</italic> in this study) is sister to the remainder of the subfamily Nepetoideae, followed by a sister group tribe Ocimeae + tribe Mentheae. 
 <italic>I. serra</italic> together with genera 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> and 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> formed tribe Ocimeae clade (
