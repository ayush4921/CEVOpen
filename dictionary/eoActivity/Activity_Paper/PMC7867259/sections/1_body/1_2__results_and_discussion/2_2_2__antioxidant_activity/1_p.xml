<p>The antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> leaves were evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays; the results were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00759-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The antioxidant activity is based on the redox properties of the extracts which facilitate their activity as reducing agents; such ability is generally associated with the presence of reductants which exert antioxidant action through breaking the free radical chain by donating a hydrogen atom or preventing peroxide formation [

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00759-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> the two extracts of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> showed significant antioxidant activity with significant variability between organic extracts and the used methods: the ethyl acetate extract was the most active in terms of antioxidant properties with values of IC50 = 12.3 ± 3.83 µg/mL and IC50 = 37.0 ± 2.45 µg/mL attained by DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively; a value of 531.1 ± 17.08 mg AAE/g DW was determined by FRAP assay. By comparison of the three methods used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00759-f001">Figure 1</xref>), the DPPH scavenging activity assay was the most sensitive one in terms of IC50. The ethyl acetate extract which contained the highest level of phenolic compounds and flavonoids yielded the smallest IC50 value, in agreement with previous studies [
