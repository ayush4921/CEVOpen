<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) is reported as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) (Y = 0.253x + 0.23, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999), and the obtained results showed that the highest TPC with (56.5 ± 0.61 µg GAE/mg of extract), was found in the ethyl acetate extract, while the chloroform extract showed the lowest value with (18.9 ± 0.48 µg GAE/mg of extract), (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00759-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The total flavonoid content (TFC) is reported as catechin equivalents (CE) (Y = 0.0054x + 0.1506, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998), and also in this case the ethyl acetate extract yielded the highest flavonoid content (30.2 ± 0.55 µg CE/mg of extract) when compared to the chloroform extract which presents a value of (18.0 ± 0.36 µg CE/mg of extract). By comparison of these results with the available literature on the same species, the obtained values are considerably higher than those reported by Athmouni et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that the values of TPC and TFC in leaves extracts of Tunisian G.A were 8.04 mg GAE/mg DW and 0.67 mg CE/mg DW, respectively. The same consideration can be done when comparing our values with the work by Chograni et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who determined lower content of TPC (22.30 mg GAE/g DW) and TFC content (4.72 mg RE/g D.W) of the methanolic leaves extracts of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> (Korbous Jebel Mountain, Tunisia). Also, El khantouch et al.’s study [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported lower TFC content (8.96 mg QE/g DW) for the hydro-acetate extract, as well the Djeridane et al.’s study [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which carried out in Algeria, reported a value of 21.54 mg GAE/g DW and 4.54 mg RE/g DW of TPC and TFC, respectively. Further lower values were attained by Krimat et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who determined lower values of TPC content (25.38 mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoid content (3.76 mg QE/g extract) for the same extracts. On the other hand, a very recent study carried out by Tiss et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in Tunisia suggest significant values of TPC and TFC of 81.3 mg GAE/g and 61.2 mg RE/g, respectively.
