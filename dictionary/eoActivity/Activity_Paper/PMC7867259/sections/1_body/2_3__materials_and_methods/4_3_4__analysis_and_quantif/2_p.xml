<p>TFC of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> leaves extracts was determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method, according to the protocol described by Dewanto et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, 250 µL of each plant extract was mixed with 1250 µL of distilled water and subsequently with sodium nitrite solution (5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>); the mixture was incubated for 6 min at room temperature. Thereafter, 150 µL of aluminum trichloride solution (10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) were added and then allowed to stand for 6 min. Afterwards, 500 µL of sodium hydroxide solution (4%NaOH) were dissolved in 275 µL of distilled water. Then, the mixture was thoroughly mixed and allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm 
 <italic>versus</italic> reagent blank containing methanol instead of the sample. Catechin was used as a standard compound for the quantification of total flavonoids. All trials were performed in triplicate. Results were expressed as µg of catechin equivalents per mg DW extracts (µg CE/mg).
