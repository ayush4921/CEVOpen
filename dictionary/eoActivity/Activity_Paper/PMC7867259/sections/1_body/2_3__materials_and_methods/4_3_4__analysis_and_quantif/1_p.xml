 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with slight modification. Briefly, 100 µL of the diluted extracts, 500 µL of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 400 µL of 7.5% saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>), were mixed; the mixture was then thoroughly homogenized and incubated for 30 min at 40 °C. After incubation, the absorbance of each sample was measured at 765 nm against methanol as blank and the TPC was calculated by using the gallic acid calibration curve. All assays were performed in triplicate. The TPC was expressed as µg GAE/mg of extract.
