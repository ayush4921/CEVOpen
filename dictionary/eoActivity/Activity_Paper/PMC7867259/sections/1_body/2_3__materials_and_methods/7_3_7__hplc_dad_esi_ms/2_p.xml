 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The mobile phase was composed of two solvents: water/acetic acid (99.85/0.15 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, solvent A) and acetonitrile/acetic acid (99.85/0.15 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, solvent B), The flow rate was fixed at 1 mL/min under gradient elution: 0–5 min, 5% B, 5–15 min, 10% B, 15–30 min, 20% B, 30–60 min, 50% B, 60 min, 100% B. DAD detection was applied in the range of λ = 200–400 nm and a wavelength of 280 nm was monitored (sampling frequency: 40.0 Hz, time constant: 0.08 s). MS conditions were as follows: scan range and scan speed were set at
