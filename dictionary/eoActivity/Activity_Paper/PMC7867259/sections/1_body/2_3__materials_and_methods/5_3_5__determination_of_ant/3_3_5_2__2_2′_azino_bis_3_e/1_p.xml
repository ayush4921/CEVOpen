<p>ABTS radical scavenging activity was determined according the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The ABTS stock solution was produced by reacting ABTS aqueous solution (7 mM) with 2.45 mM aqueous solution of potassium persulfate, and allowed the mixture to react in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h; then the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> stock solution was diluted with methanol to an absorbance of 0.7 ± 0.02, at 734 nm. 15 µL of the test sample was mixed with 185 µL of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> diluted solution, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The results were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (µg/mL) and the percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the following equation:
 <disp-formula>ABTS Scavenging effect % = [(A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub>] × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where: A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the absorbance of the sample.
