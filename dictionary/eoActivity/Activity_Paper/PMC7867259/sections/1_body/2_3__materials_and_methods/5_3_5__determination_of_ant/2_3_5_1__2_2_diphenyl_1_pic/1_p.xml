<p>The radical scavenging activities of the extracts of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> were measured using the stable free radical DPPH(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) according to a slightly modified method by Hatano et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. DPPH methanolic solution (500 µL, 0.2 mM) was added to leaves of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> (2 mL, 2.5–100 µg/mL). The mixture was vortexed thoroughly and after 30 min incubation time in darkness and at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm with a blank containing DPPH and methanol. The butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control and the DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated according to the equation:
 <disp-formula>DPPH radical scavenging activity I (%) = (A blank − A sample)/A blank × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
