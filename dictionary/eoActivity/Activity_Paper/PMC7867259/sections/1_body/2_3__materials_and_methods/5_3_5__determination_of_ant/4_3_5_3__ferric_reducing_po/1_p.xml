<p>The reducing power of extracts was determined according to the method reported by Oyaizu [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] with minor modifications: a volume of 1 mL of test sample solution (10 µg/mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide (1%

 <italic>v</italic>), and 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6). Then the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 50 °C, and 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%) were added. After centrifugation of the mixture for 10 min at 3000 rpm, 2.5 mL were collected from the upper layer, mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water, and 0.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1%). Ascorbic acid (10 µg/mL) was used as a standard for the preparation of the calibration curve, and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm by a spectrophotometer. Results were expressed as mg of ascorbic acid equivalents per mg AAE/g DW. All tests were performed in triplicate.
