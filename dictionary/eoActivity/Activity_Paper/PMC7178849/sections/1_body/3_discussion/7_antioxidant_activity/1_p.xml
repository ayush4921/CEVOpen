<p>The plant flavonoids and phenolic content are important phytochemicals that possess free radical scavenging activities mainly because of their redox properties (Duarte-Almeida et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The results indicated that 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> extracts, treated with SA and MWCNTSs, caused around 80% inhibition in the formation of peroxidation products compared to its standard BHT in β-carotene bleaching test and TEAC standard for DPPH assay (50% inhibition). Also, the antioxidant activity of RA has been proven previously through both

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and MWCNTSs can play a vital role in the production of phytomedicine by stimulating plant
