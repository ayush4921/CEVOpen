<p>The next part of this study aimed to evaluate the ability of exogenously applied MeJA and MWCNTs to 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> nodal segments culture, to overcome stress-induced responses involving antioxidative enzymes and ROS. The activities of CAT, POD, and APX enzymes were estimated under the mentioned treatments. The responses of given enzyme were variable at different concentrations of MWCNTSs and MeJA treatments. ROS are cytotoxic, have important roles in cell signalling and homeostasis, regulating the expression of genes related to antioxidant defence mechanisms (Neill et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Plants have a highly efficient protective enzyme, including antioxidant enzyme defence system, POD, APX, and CAT to scavenge ROS, enhancing plant tolerance to different stress factors (Jiang and Zhang 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Nano materials could cause higher enzyme loading due to their higher surface area (Kim et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). An augmentation in CAT, POD, and APX activities at different concentrations of MWCNTs treatments showed the ability of MWCNTs to induce plant defence system. It had been shown that applications of MWCNTs could increase the activities of antioxidant enzyme POD (Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It can be assumed that enhance the peroxidase activity is related to the oxidative stress caused by MWCNTs.
