<p>According to this result, in the present study, decreasing the RA content from 50 to 100 mg/L might be due to toxicity of MWCNTs, while increasing it from 100 to 250 mg/L could be related to activation of defensive system in plants (Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Translocation studies of carbon nanotubes assumed that an interaction happened between cell wall and carbon nanotubes through adherence forces such as hydrogen bonding (Dapkevicius et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Thus, a penetration could be taking place through the apoplastic pathway and envelop to the surface of cells till arriving at a narrower passage than their size, being then accumulated and leading to change in metabolic functions as well (Villagarcia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). There is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of MWCNTs on plant growth and metabolic features. However, results from this study suggested that the metabolic characteristics were markedly influenced by the employed both MWCNTs and MeJA.
