<p>It was reported that the plant phytohormones such as MeJA, as a main compound in signal transduction pathway, had an important role to induce plant defence against subsequent attack of stresses (Bulgakov et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) through various biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms (Hyun-Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Application of exogenous MeJA caused to produce high levels of secondary metabolites in various plants (Hyun-Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Also, carbon nanomaterials, had been found to apply in plants due to their unique characteristics and could have great impacts on plant secondary metabolite. However, it has been suggested that high doses of MWCNTs have cytotoxicity effects on plant cells due to their density (Lei et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As a result, it can cause structural damage in plant cells and conditional death.
