<p>In the second part of this study, the RA contents were evaluated in greenhouse grown plants treated with 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA. The quantitative HPLC analysis showed the higher amount of RA in treated plants rather than untreated one. The highest content of RA was obtained at the time point of 72 h after SA treatment. Also, MWCNTSs treatment at 24 h could be supposed as threshold time. Phytotoxicity of MWCNTs at the time points of 48 h and 72 h may have led to low RA content. It has been suggested that application of excess SA, an endogenous growth regulator, causes to the uptake of exogenous SA into the cells that result in H

 <sub>2</sub> could increase the production of secondary metabolite in plants. SA generated a wide range of metabolic and physiological responses which were involved in plant defence. It also activated the ROS generation and other defensive procedures that could help the plant cells to withstand oxidative damage, specifically to cope with ROS generated by the oxidative stress (Ghorbanpour and Hadian
