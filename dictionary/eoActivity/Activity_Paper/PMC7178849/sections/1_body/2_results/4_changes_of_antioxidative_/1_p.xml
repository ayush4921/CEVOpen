<p>The response of CAT, POD, and APX enzymes were variable at different concentrations of MWCNTSs and MeJA treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A–F)</xref>). The maximum activity of CAT enzyme was obtained with 50 mg/L of MWCNTSs and gradually reduced by application of 100 and 250 mg/L of MWCNTSs treatments (
