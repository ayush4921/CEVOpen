<p>Several factors such as biotic and abiotic stresses can affect plant secondary metabolites. Application of elicitors effectively promotes the production and yield of plant secondary metabolites 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in an easy and direct manner (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques are applied both to rescue the plant species and to produce biologically active compounds. It has been reported that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> plant cultures induce higher amounts of RA than the wild plants (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The most important factor enhancing metabolite synthesis is the elicitation process (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Among signalling molecules salicylic acid (SA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been applied as oxidative stresses to induce RA production in some species. On the other hand, jasmonic acid (JA) and its methyl ester methyl jasmonate (MeJA) have a main role in a signal transduction process. These compounds are also widely used in plant cell cultures to activate secondary metabolite and defence genes. It seems that RA acts as a main accumulated defence compound against pathogens, herbivores and can also reduce oxidative damage (Hadian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). MWCNTSs (Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and SA (Vicent and Plasencia 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were known as potent enhancers of some secondary metabolites in previous studies. Several studies showed that SA signalling pathway was involved in biosynthesis of terpenoids (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Researchers demonstrated that lower concentrations of SA could increase monoterpene contents in 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> Thunb. (Saururaceae) (Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
