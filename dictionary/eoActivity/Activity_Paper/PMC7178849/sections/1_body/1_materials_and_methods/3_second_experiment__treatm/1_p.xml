<p>In this experiment,

 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> at the full flowering stage were sprayed by 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA (Merck Company). The volume of the spray was 100 mL per plant. The untreated plants (control) were sprayed with distilled water. The treated and non-treated plants were then zipped with a vinyl pack for 1 h. The shoots from the treated and untreated (control) plants were randomly sampled at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment.
