<p>Establishment of nodal segment culture was done in 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> species. Suitable nodal segments (segment with 1 node) were cut from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> plants grown in the greenhouse at reproductive stage and were washed under running tap water for 10 min. The nodal segments were surface sterilised by 1.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, and then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water for 5 min. Twenty sterilised nodal segments were transferred to the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL liquid MS (Murashige and Skoog 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>) culture medium supplemented with 2 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The samples were placed at 24 ± 2 °C in a growth chamber with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 40 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> (provided by fluorescent tubes) and a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod with continuous shaking at 120 rpm. They were sub-cultured to proliferate every 2 weeks into new liquid MS media supplemented with materials as described above. The MWCNTs (Iranian Nanomaterials Pioneers Co., Mashhad, Iran) were sterilised by autoclave (121 °C and 1.2 bar) and was dispersed in distilled water using ultrasonic vibration for 30 min. Seven days after the transfer of nodal segments into the new liquid MS culture medium, the dispersed stock solution of MWCNTs was added to the nodal segment culture to obtain appropriate concentrations (0, 50, 100, 250 mg/L). Also, 7-day-old nodal segments were treated by MeJA (Merck Company). The stock solution was filter sterilised and added to nodal segment cultures at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 250 mg/L). In both MWCNTs and MeJA elicitors, samples were taken after 48 h from elicitations, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further usage.
