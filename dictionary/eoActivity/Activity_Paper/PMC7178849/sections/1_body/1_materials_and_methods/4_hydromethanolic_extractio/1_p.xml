 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> samples of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> were harvested and dried in a dark condition at room temperature. The samples were minified (1000 mg) and suspended in methanol/water (80/20 v/v) in 250 Erlenmeyer flasks, placed in darkness for 2 days. Then, the mixtures were kept in continuous shaking at 80 rpm for 5 h followed by sonication for 30 min. Finally, the homogenate was filtered through Whatman paper (No. 1) and the obtained supernatant was evaporated at 50 °C using rotary evaporator (Heidolph, Germany). The residues were dried and the hydroalcoholic extract was scraped and stored in a dark place. Nine different concentrations of RA standard were prepared in 1 mL methanol/water (50/50 v/v) ranging from 1 to 200 mg/L. The peak areas obtained from the injections were used to calculate the calibration curve. The HPLC column was a Spherisorb ODS-2 (5 mg/L) reversed phase 4.6 mm × 250 mm. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 25 °C and detection at 333 nm. The injection volume was 20 μL. Two mobile phases, A and B, were used; mobile phase A was H
 <sub>2</sub>O and mobile phase B was methanol. Solvent composition of gradient was in low Pressure, 75% A and 25% B for the first 5 min, followed by 50% A and 50% B for the next 10 min, and finally 100% B for an additional 15 min. Each extract (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL methanol/water (50/50 v/v) and were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. The chromatography peak of RA was confirmed according to the retention time of the reference standard. The quantitative analysis was performed with external standardisation by measurement of the peak areas using Agilent ChemStation software.
