Plant secondary metabolites are unique sources of pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavours, and other industrial uses (Rates <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The genus <italic>Satureja</italic> (Savoury) (Lamiaceae) comprises about 200 species worldwide (Momtaz and Abdollahi <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These are highly valuable medicinal plants, mainly distributed in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. Fourteen species of this genus grow in northern, northwestern, western, southwestern, and central parts of Iran (Hadian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). About 30 species of this genus are commonly named savoury, among which <italic>Satureja khuzistanica</italic> Jamzad. is a medicinal plant endemic to Iran (Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The plants have traditionally been used in Iran for its antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, antibiofilm, and anti-inflammatory compounds (Hadian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>There is another group of phenolic compounds in extracts of this species; the main one is rosmarinic acid (RA). That is why the use of <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> has become important in recent years in medicine and pharmacology research. RA belongs to the group of polyphenols which is found most notably in many Lamiaceae plants, and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. RA helps to prevent cell damage caused by free radicals, thereby reducing the risk of cancer and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Several factors such as biotic and abiotic stresses can affect plant secondary metabolites. Application of elicitors effectively promotes the production and yield of plant secondary metabolites <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> in an easy and direct manner (Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In addition, <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> techniques are applied both to rescue the plant species and to produce biologically active compounds. It has been reported that <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> plant cultures induce higher amounts of RA than the wild plants (Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The most important factor enhancing metabolite synthesis is the elicitation process (Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Among signalling molecules salicylic acid (SA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been applied as oxidative stresses to induce RA production in some species. On the other hand, jasmonic acid (JA) and its methyl ester methyl jasmonate (MeJA) have a main role in a signal transduction process. These compounds are also widely used in plant cell cultures to activate secondary metabolite and defence genes. It seems that RA acts as a main accumulated defence compound against pathogens, herbivores and can also reduce oxidative damage (Hadian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). MWCNTSs (Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and SA (Vicent and Plasencia <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were known as potent enhancers of some secondary metabolites in previous studies. Several studies showed that SA signalling pathway was involved in biosynthesis of terpenoids (Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Researchers demonstrated that lower concentrations of SA could increase monoterpene contents in <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> Thunb. (Saururaceae) (Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Nanoparticles could act as signal compounds inducing metabolic and physiological responses in <italic>Pelargonium zonale</italic> L. L&#x02019;H&#x000e9;r. (Geraniaceae) (Hatami and Ghorbanpour <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previous research reported that nanosilver particles could cause oxidative stress, raise lipid peroxidation, and catalase activity in <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. (Compositae) (Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Also, some studies revealed that nanoparticles could activate plant antioxidant systems and increase activities of superoxide dismotase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) in spinach chloroplast (Lei et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It was shown that MWCNTs had ability to enhance the growth of tobacco cells at different concentrations (Khodakovskaya et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this study, two separate experiments were performed. At the first experiment, different concentrations of MWCNTs and MeJA were applied on nodal segments cultures of <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> grown <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro.</italic> The second one was performed to investigate the potential effects of spraying 100&#x02009;mg/L MWCNTs and 200&#x02009;mg/L SA at different time points on <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> plants. Phytochemical responses, including RA contents, enzyme activities; catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were measured in both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> treated plants. Antioxidant activities of the extracts (DPPH and &#x003b2;-carotene) were measured in <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> plants exposed to MWCNTs and SA treatments at different times from initial treatments. Finally, the antifungal effects of <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> extracts and also inhibitory impacts of callus were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Plant materials and growth condition</title><p><italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> (NCBI:txid1114304) (Jamzad <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) plants were supplied from Research farm of Khorraman Pharmaceutical Co., Lorestan, Iran.

The nodal segments were surface sterilised by 1.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 5&#x02009;min, and then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water for 5&#x02009;min. Twenty sterilised nodal segments were transferred to the 250&#x02009;mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100&#x02009;mL liquid MS (Murashige and Skoog <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>) culture medium supplemented with 2&#x02009;mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).

Seven days after the transfer of nodal segments into the new liquid MS culture medium, the dispersed stock solution of MWCNTs was added to the nodal segment culture to obtain appropriate concentrations (0, 50, 100, 250&#x02009;mg/L). Also, 7-day-old nodal segments were treated by MeJA (Merck Company). The stock solution was filter sterilised and added to nodal segment cultures at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 250&#x02009;mg/L). In both MWCNTs and MeJA elicitors, samples were taken after 48&#x02009;h from elicitations, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for further usage.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Second experiment: treatment of <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> grown plants with MWCNTs and SA elicitors</title><p>In this experiment, <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> greenhouse plants of <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> at the full flowering stage were sprayed by 100&#x02009;mg/L MWCNTs and 200&#x02009;mg/L SA (Merck Company). The volume of the spray was 100&#x02009;mL per plant. The untreated plants (control) were sprayed with distilled water.

It was supposed that the high amount of RA observed 48&#x02009;h after treatments, as optimum time for <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> culture of Lamiaceae plants (Krzyzanowska et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Park et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>It was reported that the plant phytohormones such as MeJA, as a main compound in signal transduction pathway, had an important role to induce plant defence against subsequent attack of stresses (Bulgakov et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) through various biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms (Hyun-Jin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Application of exogenous MeJA caused to produce high levels of secondary metabolites in various plants (Hyun-Jin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Also, carbon nanomaterials, had been found to apply in plants due to their unique characteristics and could have great impacts on plant secondary metabolite. However, it has been suggested that high doses of MWCNTs have cytotoxicity effects on plant cells due to their density (Lei et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hadian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Vicent and Plasencia <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Khodakovskaya et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Villagarcia et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hatami and Ghorbanpour <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As a result, it can cause structural damage in plant cells and conditional death.</p><p>According to this result, in the present study, decreasing the RA content from 50 to 100&#x02009;mg/L might be due to toxicity of MWCNTs, while increasing it from 100 to 250&#x02009;mg/L could be related to activation of defensive system in plants (Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Translocation studies of carbon nanotubes assumed that an interaction happened between cell wall and carbon nanotubes through adherence forces such as hydrogen bonding (Dapkevicius et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Thus, a penetration could be taking place through the apoplastic pathway and envelop to the surface of cells till arriving at a narrower passage than their size, being then accumulated and leading to change in metabolic functions as well (Villagarcia et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). There is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of MWCNTs on plant growth and metabolic features. However, results from this study suggested that the metabolic characteristics were markedly influenced by the employed both MWCNTs and MeJA.</p><p>In the second part of this study, the RA contents were evaluated in greenhouse grown plants treated with 100&#x02009;mg/L MWCNTs and 200&#x02009;mg/L SA. The quantitative HPLC analysis showed the higher amount of RA in treated plants rather than untreated one. The highest content of RA was obtained at the time point of 72&#x02009;h after SA treatment. Also, MWCNTSs treatment at 24&#x02009;h could be supposed as threshold time. Phytotoxicity of MWCNTs at the time points of 48&#x02009;h and 72&#x02009;h may have led to low RA content. It has been suggested that application of excess SA, an endogenous growth regulator, causes to the uptake of exogenous SA into the cells that result in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and oxidative defence. Maffei et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) reported that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could increase the production of secondary metabolite in plants. SA generated a wide range of metabolic and physiological responses which were involved in plant defence. It also activated the ROS generation and other defensive procedures that could help the plant cells to withstand oxidative damage, specifically to cope with ROS generated by the oxidative stress (Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Our results were in accordance with the reports where exogenous application of SA induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and oxidative enzymes in <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> to overcome oxidative stress.</p><sec id="s0022"><title>Changes of antioxidative enzymes under MWCNTSs and MeJA treatments <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic></title><p>The next part of this study aimed to evaluate the ability of exogenously applied MeJA and MWCNTs to <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> nodal segments culture, to overcome stress-induced responses involving antioxidative enzymes and ROS. The activities of CAT, POD, and APX enzymes were estimated under the mentioned treatments. The responses of given enzyme were variable at different concentrations of MWCNTSs and MeJA treatments. ROS are cytotoxic, have important roles in cell signalling and homeostasis, regulating the expression of genes related to antioxidant defence mechanisms (Neill et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Plants have a highly efficient protective enzyme, including antioxidant enzyme defence system, POD, APX, and CAT to scavenge ROS, enhancing plant tolerance to different stress factors (Jiang and Zhang <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Nano materials could cause higher enzyme loading due to their higher surface area (Kim et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). An augmentation in CAT, POD, and APX activities at different concentrations of MWCNTs treatments showed the ability of MWCNTs to induce plant defence system. It had been shown that applications of MWCNTs could increase the activities of antioxidant enzyme POD (Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It can be assumed that enhance the peroxidase activity is related to the oxidative stress caused by MWCNTs.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that the level of enzyme activity decreases by enhancing the MWCNTs concentration that could be due to inactivation of related molecules by MWCNTs or other chemical interactions. This result was compatible with the result of Smirnova et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). They showed that peroxidase activity was enhanced in <italic>Onobrychis arenaria</italic> (Kit.) DC. (Leguminosae) seedlings at the concentrations of 100 and 1,000&#x02009;mg/L MWCNTs, which was significantly higher than the control (Smirnova et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The same results happened to CAT and APX enzymes in this study. It was shown that increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes is caused by exogenous application of MeJA (Anjum et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), leading to oxidative stress in plant cells. The antioxidant enzymes can play protective roles against the harmful effects of ROS, which is observed at initial moments of MeJA exposure (Afkar et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The plants use enzymatic-antioxidant systems to minimise the damage caused by ROS (Smirnova et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In our study the enhancement of CAT, POD and APX enzyme activities can be due to stimulation of the defence system against ROS, while the decrease in the enzyme levels may be caused by hyper toxicity of ROS. As reported by Woodward and Bartel (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), the increase of peroxidase enzyme activity changes the plant stress hormone levels resulting in oxidative defence in plants. In accordance with the results of this study, the exogenous treatment of <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) with MeJA significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (POD, SOD) (Afkar et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0023"><title>Changes of antioxidative enzymes under MWCNTSs and SA treatments <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic></title><p>Relative to the control of this experiment, the MWCNTs at the time point of 72&#x02009;h suppressed the CAT activity in <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>, which were related to the high ROS content and intense oxidative damage. Previous reports have also confirmed that the application of carbon nanomaterials caused an increase in ROS generation, which subsequently induced different detrimental effects (Dapkevicius et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Ghorbanpour and Hadian <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). According to Khodakovskaya et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) carbon nanomaterials could up-regulate the genes which were involved in stress signalling and molecular response as biotic elicitors do. The highest CAT activity ratio in plants exposed to the MWCNTs and SA treatments at the 24&#x02009;h time point indicated the maximum activity of CAT enzyme and oxidative defence. Here, up-regulation of RA biosynthesis following exposure to 100&#x02009;mg/L MWCNTs at the time point of 24&#x02009;h was linked to the highest CAT, POD and APX activities. In contrast, a greater elevation in amount of RA was found in plants treated with SA at spraying time point of 72&#x02009;h, which a rise in POD activity has been shown, might refer to the crucial role of POD in RA biosynthesis and oxidative defence. No significant differences were recorded in POD activities between 24&#x02009;h and 48&#x02009;h treated plants. The sudden decrease in CAT activity from 24&#x02009;h to 72&#x02009;h and reduction of APX activity at 72&#x02009;h could be pointed to the phytotoxicity of plant at both treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s0024"><title>Antioxidant activity</title><p>The plant flavonoids and phenolic content are important phytochemicals that possess free radical scavenging activities mainly because of their redox properties (Duarte-Almeida et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The results indicated that <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> extracts, treated with SA and MWCNTSs, caused around 80% inhibition in the formation of peroxidation products compared to its standard BHT in &#x003b2;-carotene bleaching test and TEAC standard for DPPH assay (50% inhibition). Also, the antioxidant activity of RA has been proven previously through both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (Chen and Chen <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> experiments.

We hypothesised that reduction in FsK growth may be related to the RA inhibitory effect which was produced in plants and activated resistance mechanisms in natural condition. The same results observed in tomato plants (Garantonakis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) confirmed our understanding. It is clear that all the extracts and callus showed an inhibitory effect on FsK aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>) and diameter growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). The lowest FsK aggregation for <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> extract in number of conidia (1.82&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1010), fresh weight (6.51&#x02009;g) and dry weight (0.21&#x02009;g) and on the other hand, the reduction in FsK growth diameter to 2.75&#x02009;mm on 5th in callus treatments demonstrated the inhibitory effects of RA on FsK growth. These results suggested that the growth diameter and aggregation of FsK was inhibited by the callus and RA induction compared to the control. Bais et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) showed that fungal elicitors induced a rapid increase in RA production and RA was over-produced to inhibit fungal growth due to its polyphenolic properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated that MeJA, SA and MWCNTSs induced different biochemical and physiological processes with different responses both <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. They presumably elevated the level of oxidative stress in the <italic>Satureja</italic> plants through inducing an up-regulation in the gene expression level involved in the flavonoid metabolism resulting to activate specific key enzymes such as CAT, POD and APX. These results could be utilised for the induction of plant defensive system against ROS that will enable the plant to withstand many biotic and abiotic stresses. However, it caused a decrease in the RA contents and enzyme activity in severe oxidative stress. These results draw attention to the fact that exogenous application of MeJA, SA, and MWCNTSs influences biochemical and physiological aspects of <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> plant. They can act as an effective elicitor to enhance the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically active molecules such as RA, which may be considered as part of the daily human diet in treatment of several diseases.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work benefitted from financial support from the Department of Agronomy and Plant breeding, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran.
