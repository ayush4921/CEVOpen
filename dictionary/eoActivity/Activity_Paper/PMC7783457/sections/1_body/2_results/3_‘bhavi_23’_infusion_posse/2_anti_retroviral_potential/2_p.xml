<p id="p0065">This assay was performed with major (A), medium (B), minor (C), trace (D) and total (T1: 1.4% and T2: 2.8%) components of ‘BhAVI-23’ mix (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The extracts displayed prominent RT inhibition and the extent of RT inhibition was found to be 30, 37, 36, 30, 47, 56%, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, B). These observations also indicated about the possibility of synergism being shown at the level of HIV1-RT inhibition by the components of the ‘BhAVI-23’.
