<p id="p0030">The anti-retroviral potential of ‘BhAVI-23’ extract was assessed through the colorimetric reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition assay kit (Roche, Switzerland). This colorimetric assay utilizes the property of reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize fresh DNA from the template/primer hybrid incorporating digoxigenin and biotin labeled nucleotides. As a measure of the RT activity, the detection as well as quantification of the newly synthesized labeled DNA is achieved through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The surface of the microplate is precoated with streptavidin which serves as a high affinity binding platform for the biotin-labeled DNA. Subsequently, the bound DNA is subjected to antibody treatment in which the specific antibody to digoxigenin conjugated with peroxidase (anti-DIG-POD) gets bound to the digoxigenin labeled DNA that is already affixed to streptavidin. For the detection, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) is added that serves as a chromogenic substrate for the POD which oxidizes it leading to the formation of a colored reaction product (stable green radical) whose absorbance (at 405 nm) is quantified in an ELISA reader.</p>
