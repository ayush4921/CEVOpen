<p id="p0040">Anti-viral potential of the infusion was also evaluated using a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriophage system. The P1 (virulent) bacteriophage is known to form plaques in host bacteria through host cell lysis. This property was employed to assess infectivity lowering potential of ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion against P1 virulent phage. Four different experimental conditions were set: A) 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; B) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> + P1 (vir) lysate; C) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> + P1 (vir) lysate + ‘BhAVI-23’extract (1.75%); D) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> + ‘BhAVI-23’extract. These cultures were incubated (1 h, 37 °C) followed by pour plating using soft agar on LB agar plates. These plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for qualitative evaluation of the antiviral property of the ‘BhAVI-23’ extract.
