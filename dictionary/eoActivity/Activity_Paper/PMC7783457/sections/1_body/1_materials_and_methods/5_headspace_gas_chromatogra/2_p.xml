<p id="p0050">Headspace gas analysis was performed as per the method reported earlier [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A 15 ml of herbal extract (0.55%) was prepared (section 
 <xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>) and taken in 40 ml SPME vial. In this extract 4.5 g of NaCl was added. 2-octanol (82 μg/L) was added as an internal standard. Samples were kept on a magnetic stirrer and equilibrated (10 min, 40 °C). Extraction was performed at 40 °C for 10 min employing a pre-conditioned (250 °C, 5min) 50/30 μm polydimethylsiloxane carboxen/divinyl benzene solid phase micro extraction fiber. Extracted volatiles were injected in GC/MS by desorbing the fibre on the injection port kept at 250 °C for 2 min. The analytical procedure was performed on GC/MS having GC capillary column Rxi-5 ms (l: 20 m, inner diameter: 0.18 mm, film thickness: 0.18 μm). Helium gas served as a carrier gas. The injector port was equipped with inlet liner (0.75 mm ID, Supelco) compatible for solid phase micro-extraction analysis. With a split ratio 5, the injections were done. Initial temperature setting of GC was 40 °C (hold time 3.2 min) which was further raised to 200 °C (rate of increase: 6.2 °C/min) and subsequently to 280 °C (15 °C/min) which was further maintained for 7 min. The mass–spectrometry parameters were: ionization voltage (70 eV), electron multiplier voltage (1 kV), and

The identification of the detected peaks was performed by comparing the Kovat retention indices based on a homologous series of n-alkanes (C5–C24) with that of standards and also from the MS data accessible in the mass spectral library (NIST/EPA/NIH, 2014 version). Internal standard was used for evaluating the peak areas of the targeted volatile compounds.
