<p id="p0045">Haemoglobin (Hb) undergoes non-enzymatic chemical linkage with sugars including glucose leading to the formation of glycated Hb and under hyperglycemic conditions the level of glycated Hb significantly rises. Therefore, the anti-diabetic potential of the ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion was assessed through non-enzymatic glycosylation assay of haemoglobin (Hb) [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The solutions of ampicillin (0.02%), glucose (2%), and haemoglobin (0.06%) were prepared in phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4). Later, 1 ml each of these solutions were mixed followed by addition of 1 mL of ‘BhAVI-23’ extract at varying concentrations. The reaction mixture was incubated (72 h in dark) at room temperature followed by spectrophotometric measurement of haemoglobin glycosylation at 520 nm. Percentage inhibition of glycosylation was calculated based upon the absorbance of the samples along with control (without any extract).
