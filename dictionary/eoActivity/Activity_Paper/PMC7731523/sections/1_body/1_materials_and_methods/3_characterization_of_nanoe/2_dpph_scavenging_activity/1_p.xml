<p>The DPPH (0.2 mM, 1 ml) reagent was used for determining the antioxidant activity of the buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/ml, 1 ml) [

 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. DPPH ethanol solution and nanoemulsion were mixed and kept in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The mixtures of DPPH and distilled water were used as the controls. Meanwhile, the suspension and the ascorbic acid were also examined using the above method. The DPPH scavenging activity was calculated by the following equation:
