<p>Pyrogallic acid (25 mM, 10 Âµl) was added to 3 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2). The absorbance of the mixture was determined every 30 s for 4 min at 325 nm. According to the absorbance, the auto-oxidation rate of pyrogallic acid was evaluated by the slope of the absorbance-time curve. Then the samples (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/ml) were measured following the above method, and the scavenging rate of superoxide anion radical was calculated by the following formula [
