<p>The buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion and suspension were administered intragastrically at a dose of 60 mg/kg to the test and control groups [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The blood samples (0.5 ml) were withdrawn from the fundus venous plexus into heparinized tubes at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after oral administration of the drugs. The plasma was separated by centrifuging the blood sample at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 8 min. Then, the morin hydrate (internal standard) was added to 100 µl of plasma, vortexed for 3 min, and 300 µl of methanol was added subsequently and mixed for 5 min. The mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 8 min to precipitate the protein aggregates. The supernatant was dried, re-dissolved in 100 µl of methanol, and then centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC using a mobile phase containing methanol:acetic acid aqueous solution (0.5%; 50:50) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The analysis of samples and internal standard was not influenced by endogenous impurities. The standard curve, y=15,677 x+8.328 (
 <italic>r</italic>=0.9990), was plotted with the ratio of peak areas of the standard and internal standard as ordinate against the standard concentration as abscissa. The recovery rate was 95%–105%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 3%; the RSD of precision was less than 3%, and the RSD of reproducibility was less than 2%.
