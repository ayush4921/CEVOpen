<p>The experimental design was carried out by the central composite design (CCD) response surface experiment [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,â€‰
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on the solubility study and the pseudo-ternary phase diagram, three factors of the oil phase (A), surfactant and cosurfactant (S
 <sub>mix</sub>, B), and water phase (C) were used as the independent variables, and the particle size (Y
 <sub>1</sub>) and encapsulation efficiency (Y
 <sub>2</sub>) were considered as the dependent variables. Design-Expert 8.0.6 software was used to analyze the experimental data, and the three-dimensional response surface graphs were plotted. The fitted model was expressed by the coefficient of 
 <italic>R</italic>, and its statistical significance was determined by the 
 <italic>F</italic>-test.
