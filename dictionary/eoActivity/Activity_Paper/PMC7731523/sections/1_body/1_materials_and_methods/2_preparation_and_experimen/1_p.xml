<p>Buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion was prepared through self-nanoemulsification. Briefly, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (surfactant) and propylene glycol (cosurfactant) were thoroughly mixed with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature, and castor oil was added to the mixture. Subsequently, the buckwheat flavonoids were added into the admixture and stirred, until they were dissolved completely. Then, distilled water was added dropwise into the system until the nanoemulsion was formed.</p>
