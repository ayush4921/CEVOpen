<p>From the design response surface experiment, we evaluated the predictive optimum formulation composition of oil (16.5%), S
 <sub>mix</sub> (38.7%), and water (44.8%). Three batches of samples were prepared in parallel according to the optimized conditions. The predicted and experimental values of the particle size were 23.72 nm and 23.16±0.25 nm, respectively, and the statistical prediction error was − 2.36%. The predicted and experimental values of the encapsulation efficiency were 93.67% and 98.15%±0.19%, respectively, and the statistical prediction error was 4.78%. The model fitted well with the actual situation.
