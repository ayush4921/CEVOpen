<p>According to the results of regression analysis, three-dimensional response surface diagrams of the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables were drawn (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
  <bold>1</bold>
 </xref>). Among the main factors affecting the particle size, the water phase (C) showed the greatest effect, followed by the surfactant and cosurfactant (B) and the interaction items (B and C). The particle size of nanoemulsion was increased with the S
 <sub>mix</sub> and the water phase, and the effect of the oil phase (A) on the particle size was not very significant (

 </xref>). As shown in 
 <bold>Fig.</bold> 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
  <bold>1B</bold>
 </xref>, the particle size was increased with the increasing values of the S
 <sub>mix</sub> and water phase simultaneously, which implied that the interaction effects of B and C were positively significant. Among the main factors of the encapsulation efficiency, the quadratic of oil phase showed a significant effect, and other factors were not significant. Among the main factors affecting the encapsulation efficiency, the surfactant and cosurfactant showed the greatest effect, and the encapsulation efficiency of nanoemulsion was increased with the increase in the surfactant and cosurfactant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
  <bold>1D</bold>
  <bold>,E</bold>
 </xref>). The oil phase and water phase also affected the encapsulation efficiency significantly (
 <bold>Fig.</bold> 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
  <bold>1D</bold>
  <bold>−F</bold>
 </xref>). The encapsulation efficiency was increased first and then decreased with the increase in the oil phase, and the encapsulation efficiency was enhanced when the water phase was increased.
