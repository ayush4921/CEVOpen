<p>Hydroxyl radicals are the most active free radicals, capable of lipid peroxidation and destruction of the biomacromolecules in cells. The buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion exhibited potent hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and its activity was increased in a concentration-dependent manner (

As a positive control, ascorbic acid displayed a strong free radical scavenging ability, and at the concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, the hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities of ascorbic acid, nanoemulsion, and suspension were 91.21%, 79.55%, and 40.45%, respectively. The scavenging ability of the nanoemulsion to hydroxyl radicals was significantly stronger than that of the suspension.
