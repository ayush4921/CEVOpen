<p>The analysed extracts from selected wild plants of the Asteraceae family showed a high antioxidant potential and content of phenolic compounds: phenolic acids and flavonoids derivatives. Cytotoxicity studies using the IPEC-1 cell line indicate yarrow (
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>) and tansy (
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic>) as cytotoxic plants, which clearly indicates that these plants can be dangerous and should be used carefully in human and animal nutrition. In the case of goldenrod (
 <italic>Solidago gigantea</italic>) leaves and flowers, the results are more promising; a properly selected dose can support the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and may potentially be used in protection of this tissue. However, the correlation between cytotoxicity and antioxidant properties was not found. Tansy must be used carefully due to undesired effects after higher doses application. On the other hand, use of goldenrod seems to be safer. The positive effects of plant extracts are tested often, but evaluation of their cytotoxicity is also necessary.
