<p>The advantage of the xCELLigence system lies in its ability to monitor cell changes throughout the treatment with test substances and, based on CI changes, it can determine the duration of exposure and amount of extract at which the substance is beneficial to a living organism and when it becomes toxic and leads to changes in cellular morphology, proliferation or adherence. Based on CI values, it is possible to select a time suitable for subsequent end-point analyses, which will further determine the real state of the cells. To determine the true cell status at the end of the experiment, we used an end-point analysis MTS ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. It evaluates changes in metabolic activity or viability of treated cells at the end of treatment (48 h). This protocol is increasingly used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of various plant extracts [
