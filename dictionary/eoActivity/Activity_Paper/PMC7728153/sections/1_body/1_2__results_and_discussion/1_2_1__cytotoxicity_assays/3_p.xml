<p>After addition of lower concentrations of goldenrod leaves and flowers extracts (125 and 250 µg/mL), a positive effect on either cell adherence or proliferation was observed. On the other hand, higher concentrations (500 and 1000 µg/mL) caused a significant decrease in CI shortly after addition. This effect is frequently observed when plant extract contains polyphenols. Lower concentrations can support proliferation, while higher concentrations cause negative effects. Similar relationships have been previously observed in other experiments, for example: water-acetone extracts of dandelion (

 <italic>Oenothera paradoxa</italic> extracts on Caco-2 cells [
