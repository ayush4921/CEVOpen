<p>The total phenolic content values, determined with Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method and HPLC-DAD technique, are positively correlated (r = 0.761). It should be noted that the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent is not specific for polyphenols. Its reduction can also be caused by other compounds present in plant extracts, e.g., amino acids, proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, metal complexes, unsaturated fatty acids, which makes this method not entirely reliable for determining the total content of phenolic compounds. It has been postulated that it is better used to express the antioxidant activity of samples, however, it is still a popular method for determining the polyphenol content in plant extracts and food samples [
