<p>To evaluate cytotoxic effects of tested extracts, MTS colorimetric assay (CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used. This experiment was conducted simultaneously with RTCA and cells from the same passage were used. The cells were seeded into two 96-well plates (Greiner-Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) in an amount of 8.6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well in 100 μL of medium. After 20 h, the same extract concentrations (125 to 1000 μg/mL) were added to cells and incubated for 48 h. Subsequently, 20 µL of MTS solution was added to each well and absorbance was measured at 490 nm after 4 h incubation using microplate reader (Synergy HT; Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The absorbance of the control cells was considered as 100%. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
