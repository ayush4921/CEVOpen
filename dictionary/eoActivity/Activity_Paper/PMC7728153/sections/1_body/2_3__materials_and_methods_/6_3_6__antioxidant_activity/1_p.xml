<p>DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity was measured based on procedure described by Dżugan et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, 0.2 mL of plant extract was added to 1.8 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH (Sigma Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) solution in methanol (Sigma Aldrich Co., USA), and left in dark for 30 min. Then, the absorbance was measured at λ = 517 nm using a UV–VIS Spectrometer (Biomate 3, Thermo, Madison, WI, USA). The obtained results were expressed as µmol Trolox (Sigma Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)—Trolox equivalents (TE) equivalents per 1 g of dry weight of the extract based on prepared standard curve (5–60 nmol of Trolox solution in methanol).
