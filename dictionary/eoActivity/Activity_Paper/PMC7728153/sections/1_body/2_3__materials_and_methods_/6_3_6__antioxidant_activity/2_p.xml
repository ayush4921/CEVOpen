<p>FRAP Assay (ferric reducing antioxidant power) was also determined according to Dżugan et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, 0.2 mL of plant extract was mixed with FRAP reagent (containing 2.5 mL of 10 mM TPTZ solution in 40 mM HCl, 2.5 mL of 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> and 25 mL of 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6)) and the absorbance of mixture was measured spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS Spectrometer Biomate 3, Thermo Sci., Madison, WI, USA) at 593 nm after 10 min incubation at 37 °C against blank. Calibration curve was prepared for Trolox (Sigma Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) ethanol solution at the range 25–300 nmol/mL and the results were expressed as μmol of Trolox equivalents (TE) per 1 g of dry weight of the extract.
