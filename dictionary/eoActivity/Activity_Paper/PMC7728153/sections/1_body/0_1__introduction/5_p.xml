<p>Giant goldenrod (
 <italic>Solidago gigantea</italic> Aiton) is a perennial herb from Asteraceae family. It occurs naturally in North America but has become an invasive species in a large area of Europe, as well as on other continents [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is one of the most efficient producers of nectar, thus, it is ideal for cultivation to enrich bee-pollinated crops [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> species show a wide spectrum of health-promoting properties, exhibiting antioxidant, antimicrobial, spasmolytic, anti- inflammatory, anti-obesity, gastroprotective, and diuretic effects, which have been proven in many studies [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the research mainly focuses on only two goldenrod species: 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, whereas the biological activities of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> have been poorly investigated [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This latter species has been shown to contain some flavonoids, such as quercetin derivatives (hyperoside, rutoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin) and kaempferol [
