While most cases of this new disease show mild to moderate symptoms, a small fraction of cases, especially those with comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension, can develop fatal conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe lung damage [

By 30 January 2020, the 2019-nCoV had spread to more than 20 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern. On 11 February 2020, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses permanently named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the WHO named the associated disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By 11 March 2020, COVID-19 had spread to more than 150 countries across six continents and the WHO upgraded the status of the epidemic to pandemic. As of 27 July 2020, the number of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths have already surpassed 16 million and 650,000, respectively, with the worst affected countries as USA, Brazil, UK, Mexico, Italy, India, France and Spain (
