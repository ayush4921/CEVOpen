<p>In the third stage, we performed protein-ligand docking using AutoDock Vina [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For protein-ligand docking, an appropriate grid box was manually determined for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). To decide on a stringent binding energy cut off for the identification of potential inhibitors, docking was first performed for known inhibitors of target proteins (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). Based on the docking binding energies of the known inhibitors, camostat and nafamostat, to TMPRSS2, we decided on a stringent criteria of binding energy ≤−8.5 kcal/mol for the best docked pose of screened ligands to identify potential inhibitors of TMPRSS2 (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). Similarly, based on the docking binding energies of the known inhibitors, E-64d and PC-0626568, to cathepsin L, we decided on a stringent criteria of binding energy ≤−8.0 kcal/mol for the best docked pose of screened ligands to identify potential inhibitors of cathepsin L (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). Thereafter, docking was performed for the prepared ligands in the phytochemical library against the prepared structures of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). Lastly, we filtered the subset of phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked pose with TMPRSS2 (respectively, cathepsin L) is ≤−8.5 kcal/mol (respectively, ≤−8.0 kcal/mol). Moreover, the best docked pose with TMPRSS2 or cathepsin L of each filtered phytochemical was separated from AutoDock Vina output file, and then, combined with the target protein structure to obtain the docked protein-ligand complex in .pdb format (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>). At the end of third stage, we obtained 101 phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked pose with TMPRSS2 is ≤−8.5 kcal/mol and 16 phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked pose with cathepsin L is ≤−8.0 kcal/mol.
