 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f005">Figure 5</xref>b shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T2. T2 forms 12 hydrogen bonds with residues A386, N398, A399, V434, D435 and D440 of TMPRSS2. The phenolic hydroxyl group of T2 acts as both acceptor and donor forming O-H⋯O and N-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with the substrate binding residue D435 and C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with residue V434. The hydroxyl groups attached to the pyran ring of T2 form hydrogen bonds with residues A386, N398 and D440. Further, T2 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, I381, A400, N433, and A466.
