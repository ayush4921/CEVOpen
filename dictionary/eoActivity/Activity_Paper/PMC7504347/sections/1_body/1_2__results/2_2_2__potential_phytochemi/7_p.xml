 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref> shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T8. The two 1,3-dioxole groups present in T8 form hydrogen bonds with G383, E388, E389 and A400. One of the hydroxyl groups present in T8 forms C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with residue C437. Further, T8 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues T387, A399, E388, N398, E260, and A466.
