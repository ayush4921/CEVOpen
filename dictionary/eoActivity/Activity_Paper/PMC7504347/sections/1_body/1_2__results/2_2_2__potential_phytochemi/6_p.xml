<p>Phytochemical T5, bicuculline, has a binding energy of −9.3 kcal/mol, and it is a stereoisomer of T3. T5 is an isoquinoline alkaloid and is produced by herbs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f005">Figure 5</xref>e shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T5. The two 1,3-dioxole groups present in T5 facilitate the formation of an extensive hydrogen bond network with residues E388, E389 and A400. The Furan-2-one ring also forms a C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with C437. Further, T5 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, T387, E388, N398, A399 and A466.
