<p>As mentioned above, we have identified 96 potential natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 by computational screening of 14,011 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants, and these 96 compounds labelled T1-T96 are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Table S1</xref> along with their PubChem identifier, common name, IUPAC name and structure in SMILES format. In this section, we provide a detailed discussion of the top nine phytochemical inhibitors (labelled as T1–T9) whose binding energies in the best docked poses with TMPRSS2 are ≤−9.2 kcal/mol. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f004">Figure 4</xref> displays the structure of these top 9 phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and
