<p>Phytochemical T3, adlumidine, also has a binding energy of −9.6 kcal/mol. T3 is produced by 
 <italic>Fumaria indica</italic>, a herb used in traditional medicine to treat fever, cough, skin ailments and urinary diseases [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f005">Figure 5</xref>c shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T3. The two 1,3-dioxole groups present in T3 facilitate the formation of an extensive hydrogen bond network with E388, E389, S436, C465 and A466. T3 also forms C-H⋯S type hydrogen bond [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with C437. Further, T3 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, I381, S382, T387, N398, A399 and A400.
