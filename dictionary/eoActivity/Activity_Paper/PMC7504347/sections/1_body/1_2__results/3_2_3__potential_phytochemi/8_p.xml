 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref> shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C7. C7 has four hydroxyl groups which help in the formation of an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with residues Q21, A138 and G139. C7 also forms two N-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with H163 and W189. Also, the residue W189 forms a face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C7. Further, C7 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues G23, A138, L144, H163 and W189.
