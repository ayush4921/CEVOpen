 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S4b</xref> shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C8. The carboxylic group of residue D162 forms two C-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with C8. Also, residues M70 and G23 form hydrogen bonds of type C-H⋯S and C-H⋯O, respectively, with C8. Also, the residue W189 forms a face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C8. Further, C8 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues G23, L69, D162 and W189.
