<p>Phytochemical C1, ararobinol, has a binding energy of −8.9 kcal/mol. C1 is a bianthraquinone produced by herb 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> used in Ayurveda. In traditional medicine, 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> has been reported for antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-cancer activities [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on potential use of ararobinol to treat human influenza virus infections, however, this suggests only a potential antiviral activity of C1 not specific to SARS-CoV-2 which further needs to be verified through in vitro and in vivo experimental studies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>a shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C1. Residues Q19 and A138 form C-H⋯N and C-H⋯O type of hydrogen bonds, respectively, with C1. Also, the residue W189 forms both face-to-edge and face-to-face type of π-π stacking interaction with C1. Further, C1 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues C25, G139, L144, H163 and W189.
