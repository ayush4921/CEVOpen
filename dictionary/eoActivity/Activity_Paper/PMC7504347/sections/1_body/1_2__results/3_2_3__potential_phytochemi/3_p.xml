 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>b shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C2. The 2,5-dihydro-furan ring present in C2 forms two N-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with residue Q19 and W189. The catalytic residue H163 forms N-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with C2. Also, the residue W189 forms a face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C2. Further, C2 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues G139, H140, H163 and W189.
