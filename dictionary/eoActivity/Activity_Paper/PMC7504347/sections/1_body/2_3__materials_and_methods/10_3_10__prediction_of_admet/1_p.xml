<p>In order to assess the pharmacokinetic properties and potential toxicity of the inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L predicted from this study, we have also computed the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of the inhibitors using SwissADME [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and vNN-ADMET [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].
