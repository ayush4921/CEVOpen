<p>We use the crystal structure (PDB 5MQY) [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] of human cathepsin L with 1.13Å resolution obtained from Protein Data Bank for virtual screening. UCSF Chimera was used to minimize the energy of the cathepsin L structure. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f003">Figure 3</xref> displays the cathepsin L structure with important residues in S1, S2 and S1′ subsites of the enzyme [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Previous research has also revealed that S1 and S2 subsites of cathepsin L are important for the specificity of the enzyme [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In cathepsin L, the catalytic site consists of Cys25 (C25) and His163 (H163) in the S1 subsite, and Trp189 (W189) is at the center of the S1′ subsite [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In cathepsin L, the S2 subsite with important residues Asp162 (D162), Met161 (M161), Ala135 (A135), Met70 (M70) and Leu69 (L69) forms a deep hydrophobic pocket, and lastly, the conserved residue Gly68 (G68) is at the center of the S3 subsite [
