<p>TMPRSS2 is a trypsin-like serine protease whose catalytic site consists of the triad Ser441 (S441), His296 (H296) and Asp345 (D345) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is well established that trypsin-like serine proteases cleave peptide bonds following positively charged amino acid residues such as arginine or lysine, and this specificity of the enzyme is determined by a negatively charged aspartate residue located at the bottom of its S1 pocket [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In TMPRSS2, this specificity is determined by the conserved negatively charged residue Asp435 (D435) at the bottom of the S1 pocket [
