<p>Using GROMACS 5.1.5 [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] along with GROMOS96 54a7 force field [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], we have performed MD simulations for the top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L to assess the stability of their protein-ligand complexes. The Automated Topology Builder (ATB) version 3.0 (
 <uri xlink:href="https://atb.uq.edu.au/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://atb.uq.edu.au/</uri>) was used to generate topology for the top inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The protein-ligand complex was placed in the center of a cubic periodic box and was solvated by the addition of simple point charge (SPC) waters. Then net charge of the system was neutralized by addition of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ions. Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm. Then the system was heated to 310 K during a constant number of particles, volume, and temperature (NVT) simulation of 500 ps with 2 fs time step. Then the pressure was equilibrated to 1 bar during a constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT) simulation of 500 ps with 2 fs time step. In both the above simulations, protein and ligand were position restrained. Thereafter, the position restraint was removed and a production MD run was performed for a period of 180 ns with 2 fs time step. During the MD simulation, the structural coordinates were saved after every 2 ps. Temperature was maintained at 310 K using the v-rescale temperature [

 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Time constant for the temperature and pressure coupling were kept at 0.1 ps and 2 ps, respectively. The short-range interactions were computed for the atom pairs within the cutoff of 1.4 nm, whereas the long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method with fourth order cubic interpolation and 0.16 nm grid spacing. All bonds were constrained using the LINCS method. The trajectories obtained from the MD simulations were then used to compute and analyze the radius of gyration of the protein (R
 <sub>g</sub>), root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone Cα atoms and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the protein backbone Cα atoms using GROMACS scripts.
