<p>Secondly, we have used the MD trajectory of TMPRSS2 in complex with the top three potential inhibitors (T1, T2 or T3) from 40 ns to 80 ns to validate the TMPRSS2 model structure. The MD trajectory of TMPRSS2 in complex with the inhibitors from 40 ns to 80 ns was used for validation, 80 ns to 100 ns was used for equilibration, and from 100 ns to 180 ns for finding the binding energy of T1, T2 or T3 with TMPRSS2 using MM-PBSA method. To validate the TMPRSS2 model structure, the binding energy computed using MM-PBSA method of T1, T2 or T3 with TMPRSS2 during 40 ns to 80 ns was compared with binding energy of T1, T2 or T3 with TMPRSS2 during 100 ns to 180 ns of the MD simulation. We find that T1, T2 and T3 have average binding energies of −37.507 ± 2.537 kcal/mol, −30.383 ± 4.005 kcal/mol and −26.586 ± 2.506 kcal/mol, respectively, with TMPRSS2 during 40 ns to 80 ns of the MD simulation. The above reported binding energies of T1, T2 and T3 with TMPRSS2 during 40 ns to 80 ns are very close to the binding energies computed for the same inhibitors in complex with TMPRSS2 during 100 ns to 180 ns of the MD simulation as reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03822-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. These results further validate the TMPRSS2 model structure used for binding energy computations during 100 ns to 180 ns of the MD simulations.
