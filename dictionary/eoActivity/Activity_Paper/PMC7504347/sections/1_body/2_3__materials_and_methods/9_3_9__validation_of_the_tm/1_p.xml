<p>In order to validate the model structure of TMPRSS2 built using SWISS-MODEL, we have used two approaches. Firstly, we have run a 180 ns MD simulation of the TMPRSS2 free protein and have computed radius of gyration (R
 <sub>g</sub>), RMSD and RMSF for the TMPRSS2 free protein from its MD trajectory (

 <sub>g</sub> of the TMPRSS2 free protein remains largely stable throughout the 180 ns MD simulation (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). This signifies that the TMPRSS2 model structure remains structurally intact and stable during the MD simulation. The RMSD of the TMPRSS2 free protein becomes stable after 60 ns (
