<p>Recent experiments have shown that both camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, which are approved for human use in Japan, can block the TMPRSS2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. By docking these two inhibitors to TMPRSS2 using AutoDock Vina with exhaustiveness set at 50, the predicted binding energies of camostat and nafamostat was found to be −7.4 kcal/mol and −8.5 kcal/mol, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S6a,b</xref> show the best docked poses of nafamostat and camostat with TMPRSS2, and it is seen that both molecules form hydrogen bonds with the substrate binding residue D435. Importantly, in comparison to camostat mesylate, nafamostat mesylate in a recent experiment was shown to inhibit the TMPRSS2-dependent cell entry with 15-fold higher efficiency and an EC

Based on above observations, we decided on a stringent criteria of docked binding energy ≤−8.5 kcal/mol for screened ligands to be identified as potential inhibitors of TMPRSS2.
