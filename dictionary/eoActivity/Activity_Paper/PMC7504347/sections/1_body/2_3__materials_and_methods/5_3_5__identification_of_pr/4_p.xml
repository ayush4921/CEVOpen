<p>Chalcogen bonds. In contrast to hydrogen bonds, chalcogen bonds are of type C-Y⋯A, where Y can be a S or selenium (Se) atom and A can be a N, O or S atom. The accepted geometric criteria for chalcogen interactions are as follows. Firstly, the distance between Y and A should be less than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Secondly, the angle formed by the triad, that is ∠C-Y⋯A, should lie in the range 150° to 180° (
