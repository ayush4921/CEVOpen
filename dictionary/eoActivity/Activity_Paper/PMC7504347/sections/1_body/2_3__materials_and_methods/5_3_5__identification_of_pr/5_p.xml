<p>Halogen bonds. Halogen bonds are of type C-Y⋯A-B, where halogen Y can be a Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br) or Iodine (I) atom and A can be a N, O or S atom. The formation of the halogen bond is favoured when the distance between Y and A is ≤3.7 Å and the angle θ
 <sub>1</sub> of the A atom relative to the C-Y bond, and the angle θ
 <sub>2</sub> of the halogen Y relative to the A-B bond should be ≥90° (
