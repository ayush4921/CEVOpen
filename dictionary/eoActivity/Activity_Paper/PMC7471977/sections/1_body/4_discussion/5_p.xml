<p>In conclusion, the present study gives evidence of the antinociceptive and anxiolytic-like effects of 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic>, in part due to the presence of the diterpene 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane 7-keto-neoclerodan-3,13-dien-18,19: 15,16-diolide obtained for the first time as a crystal, reinforcing the medicinal properties of this species as a tranquilizer and for pain relief.
