<p>The genus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> has been a source of medicinal plants with activity on the CNS (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), regarding to the antinociceptive activity of different species of 
 <italic>Salvia.</italic> It has been explored in several organic extracts. However, the medium polar extracts have demonstrated higher activity among them. For example, acetone extract showed greater reduction of the nociceptive response than methanol extract of 
 <italic>Salvia aegyptiaca</italic> L. evaluated at doses from 250 to 2000 mg/kg, p.o. in the writhing and formalin tests in mice (Al-Yousuf et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Hexane and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> leaves produced dose-dependent anti-inflammatory response by inhibiting croton oil-induced oedema in the mouse ear, where chloroform extract was the most active in comparison to a lower response obtained with methanol extract (Baricevic et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In a similar manner, a chloroformic extract of 
 <italic>Salvia wiedemannii</italic> Boiss. at 500 mg/kg, i.p. produced significant antinociceptive effect in the writhing and tail-flick tests in mice while, polar extracts like aqueous, ethanol or butanol were not effective (Ustun and Sezik 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nevertheless, some 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species have been tested prepared only as a polar extract, for example, the ethanol of 
 <italic>S. plebeia</italic> evaluated at doses of 50–200 mg/kg, p.o., which showed activity in abdominal pain and inflammation induced by carrageenan in mice (Jung et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The antinociceptive effect in different types of nociception has been also reported for 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic>, partly due to the presence of salvinorins found in the medium polar extracts (Tlacomulco-Flores et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). All these results together suggest that medium polar constituents of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species are mainly responsible of their antinociceptive effects and potential source of analgesic drugs.
