<p>This device is made of wood and consists of an elevated cross with two open arms, 30 × 5 cm and two closed arms of 30 × 5×15 cm. These arms extended from a central platform of 5 × 5 are elevated 50 cm from the ground. Mice were individually placed in the junction of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm. Then, the time that animals remained in the open arms for a 5 min period was counted (Lister 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The increased examination in open arms was indicative of the anxiolytic-like effects.
