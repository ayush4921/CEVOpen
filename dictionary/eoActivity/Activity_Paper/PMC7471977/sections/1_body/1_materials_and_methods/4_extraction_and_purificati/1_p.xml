<p>The extraction of the active metabolite was carried out by fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract using conventional open-column chromatography packed with silica gel 60 GF
 <sub>254</sub> (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The elution system consisted of 100% hexane, followed by hexane–ethyl acetate mixtures of increasing polarity until eluting with ethyl acetate (100%). Finally, it was eluted with 100% methanol. A total of 214 fractions of 100 mL each were collected, which were concentrated in a rotary evaporator for later analysis by thin layer chromatography. The plates were revealed with ceric sulphate to gather those with similar profile obtaining 42 subfractions.
