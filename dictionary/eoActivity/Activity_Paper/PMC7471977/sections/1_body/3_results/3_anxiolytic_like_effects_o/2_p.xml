<p>In the case of compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, it produced a significant increase in the open-sided arms examination resembling the reference drug clonazepam response in comparison to the vehicle group (

 <bold>1</bold> significantly modified ambulatory activity of mice in the open-field test (

 <bold>1</bold> almost reached similar response to that observed with clonazepam (

 <sub>4,25</sub> = 4.72, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (
