<p>Taking into account the chemical content range, the correlation network based on components from 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> EO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05482-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. There were strong positive correlations between 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and limonene (r = 0.75; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), as well as between 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and sabinene hydrate (r = 0.76; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, the strongest negative correlation was between geraniol and compounds such as 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (r = −0.86 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), limonene (r = −0.74; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and borneol (r = −0.66;
