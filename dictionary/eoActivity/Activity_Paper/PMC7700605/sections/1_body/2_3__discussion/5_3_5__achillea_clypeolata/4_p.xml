 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> has not been investigated thoroughly yet, with the exception of its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In this study, the EO of 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> exhibited the strongest activity against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, even stronger than the antibiotic Ampicilin, which was used as the standard for comparison. 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> EO showed lower activity against Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but still stronger than Ampicilin, while 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most resistant to the oil [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Indeed, previous study on 
 <italic>Cinnamomum longepaniculatum</italic> leaf EO has shown that its compounds have excellent antibacterial activities, and the antibacterial mechanism of 1,8-cineole against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> might be attributed to its hydrophobicity [
