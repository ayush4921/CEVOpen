<p>The main compounds in the 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> EO from Mt. Rtanj (collected in July 1996) were 1,8-cineole (38.6%) and camphor (19.9%) [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The concentration of 1,8 cineole in 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> in this study was a bit higher. This variation in the chemical composition could be attributed to the weather conditions during the year, collection time, population and exposition. Because this is an endemic species in the Balkan region, there were very few studies on its EO composition. 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> of Serbian origin contained 1,8-cineole as the dominant compound [

 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], and 1,8-cineole as a potential chemotype of this species was confirmed by this study. However, 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> grown in a botanical garden in Italy could be characterized as 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-pinene chemotype [
