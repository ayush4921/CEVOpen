<p>Correlation network based on

 <italic>vulgare</italic> EO constituents is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05482-f003">Figure 3</xref>b. There were two groups of correlations between 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> EO constituents. Compounds in positive correlations were predominantly germacrene D, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, sabinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, thymol and linalyl acetate. On the other hand, compounds with predominantly negative correlations were 
 <italic>β</italic>-citronellol, carvacrol and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), with the last two having a strong positive correlation (r = 0.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
