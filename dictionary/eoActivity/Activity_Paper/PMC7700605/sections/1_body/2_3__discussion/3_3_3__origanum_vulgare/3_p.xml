<p>An antimicrobial effect of synthetic antibiotic in combination with germacrene D showing growth inhibition on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] is noted. Conversely, 1,8-cineole derivatives displayed significant antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene displayed moderate antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Sabinene exhibited prominent antibiofilm properties against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> providing a novel and effective alternative/complementary approach to counteract chronic infections and the transmission of diseases in clinical settings [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The weak antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> EO could be attributed to low concentrations of bioactive compounds and their inability to exhibit activity.
