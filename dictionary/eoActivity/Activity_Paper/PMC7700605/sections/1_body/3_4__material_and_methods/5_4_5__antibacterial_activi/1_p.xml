<p>The antimicrobial activities of the tested EOs were investigated using American Type Culture Collection test strains of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 8739) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923). Strains were cultured on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Isolated colonies were picked and transferred to 5 mL of Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The density of the suspensions used for tests was adjusted to 0.5 Mc Farland units (~1–2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) using a densitometer DEN-1 and standard plate counts. Efficacy of EOs on microorganisms was determined according to the CLSI (2018) [
