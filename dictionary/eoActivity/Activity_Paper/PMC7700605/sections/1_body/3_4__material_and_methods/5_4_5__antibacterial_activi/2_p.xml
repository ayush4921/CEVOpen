<p>Tested EO was dissolved with sterile water supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 and added to 96-well microtiter plates at concentrations from 200 to 0.781 μL/mL (the final concentration in microtiter plates was from 20 to 0.078 μL/mL). The 160 µL in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) were also added to each well, and in the end, 20 µL of overnight bacterial cultures suspensions were inoculated. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, 20 µL of the resazurin solution (0.01%) were added to each well, and the plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in darkness. A change of color from blue (oxidized-resazurin remained unchanged) to pink (reduced) indicated the growth of bacteria.</p>
