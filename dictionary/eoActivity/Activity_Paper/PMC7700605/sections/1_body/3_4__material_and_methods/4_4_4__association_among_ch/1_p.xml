<p>The association of the chemical compounds of EOs was estimated using the Spearman non-parametric correlation coefficient. In order to further analyze and represent the associations among the chemical compounds, a correlation network graph [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] was used. In this type of graph, the chemical compound variables are represented by the nodes, which are connected by the edge whose width is directly proportional to the strength of the correlation coefficient. The correlation network graph is easier to interpret than a numerical correlation matrix, and the pattern of the correlations, i.e., the clusters of the correlated variables, can be visually identified [
