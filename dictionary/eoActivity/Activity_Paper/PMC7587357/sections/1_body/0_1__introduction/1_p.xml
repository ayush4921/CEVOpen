<p>Polyphenols are natural compounds that are widely found in plants and their importance continues to grow, in particular because of their impact on organoleptic and health benefits [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indeed, in the extraction of active ingredients with high added value from plants, especially polyphenols, the extraction method applied is a very important step in the isolation, as well as in the identification, of phenolic compounds. As a result, many authors have studied the influence of different extraction methods on the extraction yields of phenolic compounds in plant sources [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among others things, the solubility of the phenolic compounds is affected by the polarity of the solvent used. Further, the determination of phenolic compounds from plant materials is influenced by the extraction technique, the extraction time and the temperature. Therefore, it is difficult to develop an extraction process suitable for the extraction of all the phenolic compounds of plants [
