<p>The data analysis showed significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the total polyphenol content (TPC) among the plant parts (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04672-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After dosing and calculation of the TPC extracted by decoction and by maceration for the different parts of the 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> plants, we can conclude that extraction by decoction gave better general results compared to solvents extracted by maceration.
