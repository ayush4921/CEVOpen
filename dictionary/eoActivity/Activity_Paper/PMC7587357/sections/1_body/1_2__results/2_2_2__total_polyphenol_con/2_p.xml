<p>The highest TPC level extracted from the different parts of 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton via the decoction method with methanol in combination with sodium fluoride (MeOH NaF) was recorded in general at the leaves, followed by the roots. The total polyphenol content in these two species are given in the following descending order: leaves &gt; roots &gt; stems &gt; flowers). In this sense, the TPC in the leaves of 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton exhibited the highest levels for decoction (1976.95 ± 62.04 and 1637.82 ± 47.29 mg eq GA/100 g DM, respectively), followed by the roots (1466.08 ± 49.69 and 1398.69 ± 36.46 mg eq GA/100 g DM, respectively). The highest TPC contents in the different parts of 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton via the maceration method were obtained with MeOH NaF from the leaves (1597.17 ± 41.45 and 1824.34 ± 27.72 mg eq GA/100 g DM, respectively). In addition, regardless of the solvent used, the total polyphenol content in the different parts of 
 <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> were obtained in the following order: roots &gt; leaves &gt; stems &gt; flowers. This order was independent of the method applied (maceration or decoction), but the TPC level obtained was in general higher when the decoction method was applied.
