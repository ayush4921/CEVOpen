<p>The flavonoid contents of the decocts and macerates of the four parts of the plant under study, obtained by the different solvents (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04672-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), show that maceration is preferable for extracting flavonoids in general from the leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> and for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> leaves, which recorded the highest level, with a mean of 736.10 Â± 5.38 mg eq Qu/100 g DM for MeOH NaF. On the other hand, decoction was in general the best method for an optimal flavonoid extraction from the flowers, stems and roots of 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and
