<p>Flavonoids—The flavonoid assay was performed according to the method detailed by Woisky and Salatino [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In total, 500 μL of each extract to be analyzed was mixed in duplicate with 1500 μL of methanol at 95%, 100 μL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> at 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>), 100 μL of 1 M sodium acetate and 2.8 mL of distilled water. The whole mixture was vortexed and then incubated at room temperature in a dark condition for 30 min. The blank was made by replacing the extract with methanol at 95%, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm by a UV-1700 Pharma spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The results were expressed in mg equivalents of quercetin-3-rutinoside/100 g of dry matter with reference to the calibration curve of quercetin-3-rutinoside. All samples were analyzed in duplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12). The selection of these methods allowed for comparison with other investigations, since they are the most common methods used to quantify these compounds with a good specificity and without additional equipment requirements.
