<p>Determination of the antioxidant activity in the lipophilic phase (L-TAA)—In total, 30 μL of 10 mM ABTS solution was mixed with 30 μL of 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 25 μL of 10 µm peroxidase and 850 μL of ethanol. The absorbance of this mixture was measured at 730 nm against a blank prepared from ethanol. In total, 25 μL of each soluble lipid phase in duplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) was added to the preceding mixture and the absorbance was measured again at 730 nm after 1 min. The results were expressed in mg trolox equivalent/100 g of dry vegetable material with reference to the trolox calibration curve [
