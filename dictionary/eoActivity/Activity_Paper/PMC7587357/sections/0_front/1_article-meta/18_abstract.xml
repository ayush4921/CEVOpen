 <p>The extraction of secondary metabolites by water, MeOH:water (8:2) containing NaF, methanol, ethanol and acetone (all of them diluted (7:3) in water)from the different parts (leaves, flowers, stems and roots) of 
  <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> L., 
  <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> L. and 
  <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton via decoction and maceration methods was studied. The highest extraction yields were recorded by methanol for decoction and acetone for maceration. The total polyphenol content (TPC) obtained by decoction had the highest TPC contents, and MeOH containing NaF was the best solvent for the extraction of TPC. Maceration was suitable for flavonoid extractions, with ethanol and acetone being the best solvents. In general, the highest levels of TPC and flavonoids were obtained from 
  <italic>Passiflora</italic> leaves regardless of the solvent or extraction method applied. Furthermore, the roots of 
  <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
  <italic>Solanum</italic> showed important levels of these compounds in consonance with the total antioxidant activity (TAA) evaluated in the different organs of the plant in the three species. In this study, the solvents and extraction methods applied were tools that determined significantly the level of extraction of bioactive compounds, showing a different impact on plant organs for each medicinal species studied.
