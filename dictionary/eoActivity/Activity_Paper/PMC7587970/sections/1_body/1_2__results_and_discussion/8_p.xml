<p>Compound

 <sup>+</sup> (calculated for C

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) data of 
 <bold>7</bold> showed very similar signals with those of 
 <bold>6</bold>. The only two oxygenated methines signals [

 <sub>C</sub> 83.2] were observed in 
 <bold>7</bold>, suggesting that it had one less hydroxy group than that of 
 <bold>6</bold>. Further analysis 2D NMR spectra permitted to determine the structure. The HMBC correlations from H
 <sub>3</sub>-28 (or H
 <sub>3</sub>-29) to C-3 (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 79.0), C-4 and C-5, indicated there was a hydroxy group at C-3, while the HMBC correlations from H
 <sub>3</sub>-18 to C-12 (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 30.9), C-13, C-14 and C-17, suggested hydroxyl at C-12 in 
 <bold>6</bold> disappeared in 
 <bold>7</bold>. Notably, coupling constant of H-3 [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04807" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> is different with that of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>6</bold>, implying its stereochemistry is not β-orientation, which is confirmed by the NOESY correlation between H-3 and H-5. Therefore, the structure of 
 <bold>7</bold> was determined as depicted, named officimalonic acid O.
