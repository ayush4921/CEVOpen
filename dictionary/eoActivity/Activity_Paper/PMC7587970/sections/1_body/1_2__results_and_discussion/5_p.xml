<p>Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was obtained as a colorless amorphous solid; its HR-ESI-MS displayed a quasi-molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 615.3512 [M + HCOO]
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>, corresponding to the molecular formula C

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) data of 
 <bold>4</bold> revealed it shared the close structure similarity with that of officimalonic acid B, previously isolated from the same species [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04807" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The difference between these two compounds is the absence of a carbonyl group signal and the presence of a methylene in 
 <bold>4</bold>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04807-f003">Figure 3</xref>) of H-5/H-6/H-7, and the HMBC correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04807-f003">Figure 3</xref>) from H-6 to C-8 and from H-7 to C-9, indicated that compound 
 <bold>4</bold> possess methylene at C-7 in 
 <bold>4</bold> instead of a carbonyl group in officimalonic acid B. The structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was thus elucidated as depicted, gave a trivial name officimalonic acid L.
