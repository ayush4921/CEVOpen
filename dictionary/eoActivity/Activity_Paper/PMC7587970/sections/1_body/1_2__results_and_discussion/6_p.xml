 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) data of 
 <bold>5</bold> showed almost the same as those of officimalonic acid B, the only difference being the presence of one more methoxyl signal in 
 <bold>5</bold>. The methoxy group was attached to C-3′ of malonate half-ester by the HMBC correlation from

 <sub>C</sub> 167.4). Therefore, the structure of 
 <bold>5</bold> was determined as depicted, named officimalonic acid M.
