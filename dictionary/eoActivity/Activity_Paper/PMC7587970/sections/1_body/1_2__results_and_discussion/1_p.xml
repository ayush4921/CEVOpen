<p>Compound

 <sub>50</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>Na, 609.3403) (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04807">Supplementary Materials</xref>). The IR spectrum of 1 showed the absorption bands for hydroxyl (3545 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and carboxyl (1779 and 1732 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), which indicated the presence of a strained lactone unit. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of 
 <bold>1</bold> exhibited four tertiary methyl groups at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 1.07, 1.03, 0.96 and 0.90 (each 3H, s), three secondary methyls at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 1.18 (3H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.8 Hz), 1.15 (3H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.1 Hz) and 0.99 (3H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.3 Hz), two oxygenated methine protons at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 4.68 (brs, H-3) and 4.21 (t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.1 Hz, H-12), as well as a oxygenated methylene protons at 3.91 (1H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 14.3 Hz) and 3.88 (1H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 14.3 Hz). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) spectra indicated the presence of 33 carbons sorted to seven methyls, nine methylenes, seven methines and 10 quaternary carbons (three of which are carbonyls). It is worth to mention that the NMR data of CH
 <sub>2</sub>-2′ were not observed when they were acquired in CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD, which is consistent with that of officimalonic acid A [
