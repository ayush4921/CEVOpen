<p>Further analysis of 2D NMR data (
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY, HSQC, HMBC) revealed that the structure of 
 <bold>1</bold> was similar with that of officimalonic acid C, previously isolated from this species by our group [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04807" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The only difference between them is the absence of C-7 carbonyl in 
 <bold>1</bold>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04807-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) of H-5/H-6/H-7, and the HMBC correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04807-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) from H-6 to C-8 and from H-7 to C-9, confirmed the assignment. The relative configurations of 
 <bold>1</bold> were determined by the NOESY correlations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04807-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) and coupling constant. The H-3 was established as β-configuration by its broad singlet-like signal. The NOESY correlation between H-12 and H
 <sub>3</sub>-30 indicated they were α-configuration. Considering the biogenetic relationship, the absolute configurations of 
 <bold>1</bold> were tentatively assigned as those of officimalonic acid C. Thus, the structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was elucidated as depicted, given the trivial name officimalonic acid I.
