<p>In the current study, seven new 24-methyl-lanostane triterpenoids were isolated and identified from the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>Fomes</italic>
 <italic>officinalis</italic>. For the structure characteristics, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>−
 <bold>3</bold> possessed an unusual spirostructure moiety at C-23, while compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>−
 <bold>7</bold> had 23,26-lactone unit. The anti-inflammatory bioassay indicated that compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited significant inhibitory activities against NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and COX-2, which may account for the traditional use for the inflammatory related disease.
