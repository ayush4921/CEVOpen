<p>Detection of accumulated nitrites was performed using Griess reagent (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04807" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, the RAW264.7 cells at approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well were incubated for another 24 h, then cultured with or without LPS (1.0 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of the test compounds or positive control (10 μL) for another 24 h, the culture supernatant (50 μL) and Griess reagent (100 μL) were mixed to measure the optical density at a wavelength of 540 nm. Dexamethasone was used as positive control.
