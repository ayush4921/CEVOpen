<p>Air-dried ground powder of 
 <italic>F. officinalis</italic> fruiting bodies (1.0 kg) was extracted with MeOH (4.5 L × 3) by maceration at room temperature (seven days each time) to afford a crude methanol extract (575.9 g). The crude extract was suspended in distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O and then extracted successively with EtOAc and 
 <italic>n</italic>-BuOH. The EtOAc fraction (135.8 g) was then applied to a column of MCI gel (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 50:50 to 100:0,

 <italic>v</italic>) to yield five fractions (A−E). Fraction B (8.4 g) was then subjected to silica gel CC eluted with a CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>: MeOH (100:1 to 1:1 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) gradient to obtain seven fractions (B1−B7). Fraction B1 (1.3 g) was subjected to RP-18 silica gel CC (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 60/40 to 100:0, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) to give four sub-fractions (B1a−B1d). Purification of B1b (87.0 mg) by semi-preparative HPLC, eluting with MeOH-H
