<p>The COX-2 inhibitory activity study was carried out using ovine recombinant COX-2 enzyme by a COX colorimetric inhibitor screening assay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The assay was performed following the protocol provided by the manufacturer of assay kit. Non-selective inhibitor, naproxen, was used as a positive control. The COX inhibitory activity was expressed as % inhibition and was calculated as following Equation:
 <disp-formula>%inhibition = (ΔAbs 
  <sub>control</sub> − ΔAbs 
  <sub>sample</sub>) × 100/ ΔAbs 
  <sub>control</sub>
 </disp-formula>
