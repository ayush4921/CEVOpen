<p>IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer. The optical rotations were measured on an Auto Pol IV automatic polarimeter (Rudolph Research, Flanders, NJ, USA) at room temperature. 1D and 2D NMR data were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz instrument with TMS as internal standard. HR-ESI-MS data were acquired using a Triple TOF 6600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Semi-preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Hitachi Chromaster system consisting of a 5110 pump, 5210 autosampler, 5310 column oven, 5430 diode array detector, and a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250 × 10 mm, S-5 μm), all operated using EZChrom Elite software. All solvents were of ACS or HPLC grade, and were obtained from Tansoole (Shanghai, China), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively. Silica gel (300−400 mesh), C18 reverse-phased silica gel (150–200 mesh, Merck, city, country), and MCI gel (CHP20P, 75−150 μM, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were used for column chromatography (CC), and pre-coated silica gel GF254 plates (Qingdao Marine Chemical Plant, Qingdao, China) were used for TLC.</p>
