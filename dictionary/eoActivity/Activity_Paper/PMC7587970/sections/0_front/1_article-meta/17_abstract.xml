 <p>In the current study, further chemical investigation of the fruiting bodies of 
  <italic>Fomes officinalis</italic> led to isolate seven new 24-methyl-lanostane triterpenoids, named officimalonic acids I−O (
  <bold>1</bold>–
  <bold>7</bold>). Their structures were elucidated based on the analysis of spectroscopic data (HR-MS, 1D and 2D NMR, UV, IR). Compounds 
  <bold>1</bold>−
  <bold>3</bold> possessed an unusual C-23 spirostructure moiety, while compounds 
  <bold>4</bold>−
  <bold>7</bold> had 23,26-lactone unit. Anti-inflammatory assay revealed that compounds 
  <bold>3</bold> and 
  <bold>5</bold> exhibited significant inhibitory activities against NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and cyclooxygenase (COX-2).
