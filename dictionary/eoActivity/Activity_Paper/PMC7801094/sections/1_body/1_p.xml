<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>Lophatherum gracile</italic> were collected from Tea Garden of Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities (26.28°N, 107.47°E) in Duyun City, Guizhou Province, China. The specimen (DZ20200608) was deposited in the herbarium of Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities. Total DNA was extracted from fresh leaves using a CTAB method and then sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq platform. Low-quality reads and adapters were trimmed off using the FastQC software (Andrews 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and genome was de novo assembled using SPAdes v3.9 (Bankevich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and then annotated using Plann software (Huang and Cronk 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The complete chloroplast genome was submitted to the GenBank database (Accession Number: MT872396).
