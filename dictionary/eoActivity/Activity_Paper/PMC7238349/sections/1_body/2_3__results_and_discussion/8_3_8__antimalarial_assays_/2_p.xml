 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>. Lemongrass (Poaceae) is a perennial grass, evenly distributed in the tropic region, South and Central America, and has an outstanding profile in the folk medicine [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The antimalarial potential of aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> assessed on twenty-five Swiss albino mice demonstrated significant prophylactic and chemotherapeutic potency against mice infected with 0.2 ml O
 <sup>+</sup> human parasitized blood of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> after 72 h. Significant inhibition was observed in parasitaemia level of blood of infected mice [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A larvicidal test of geranial, an essential oil in 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic>, was evaluated against 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> (mature larvae) and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> according to the WHO standard procedure. Prominent activities were recorded at LD
 <sub>50</sub> (35.5 ppm and 34.6 ppm) after 6 h. Geranial also displayed significant antiplasmodial activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> (4.2 ± 0.5l g/mL) when assessed by the radioisotopic method. Geranial could serve as effective natural biocides for combating the larvae of malaria vectors [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The antiplasmodial activity of aqueous leaf and root extracts of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) and chloroquine (5 mg/kg) was examined against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> in mice using 4-day suppressive test model at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. A dose-dependent suppressive pattern was observed with chloroquine and 800 mg/kg (aqueous root extract) [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> plant displayed significant antimalarial activity than herbal concoction or chloroquine (3200 mg/kg) (control) when used as a prophylactic treatment against CBA/Ca mice with patent 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA or 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS at doses of 1600 and 3200 mg/kg. In addition, the synergetic activity of chloroquine and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> plant exhibited high activity than chloroquine alone against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>. The antimalarial activity of entire 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> plant aids inevitable efforts to developing whole plant remedies for the treatment of malaria [
