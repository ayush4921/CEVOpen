 <italic>Morinda lucida.</italic> The antimalarial investigation of partly purified cysteine-stabilised peptide extracts of 
 <italic>M. lucida</italic> leaf was assessed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> W2 and its activities on certain liver and erythrocyte antioxidant parameters in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> NK65-infected mice. Low activities were observed in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> W2 (IC50: &gt;50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml); however, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> led to 51.52% reduction in parasitaemia on 96 h after inoculation and considerably decreased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) malondialdehyde concentrations in the liver and erythrocyte at high doses in contrast to untreated controls [

 <italic>M. lucida</italic> leaf extract conducted using standard techniques showed significant activities at 0.6 mg/ml [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The antimalarial activities of 
 <italic>M. lucida</italic> investigated in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>-infected mice exhibited dose-dependent chemosuppression of 39.8–90.5 which show pronounced activities than quinine [
