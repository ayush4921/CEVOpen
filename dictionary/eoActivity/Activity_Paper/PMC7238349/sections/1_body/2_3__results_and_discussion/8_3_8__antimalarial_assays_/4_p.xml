 <italic>Enantia chlorantha. Enantia chlorantha</italic> Oliver (or 
 <italic>Annickia chlorantha</italic>) belongs to Annonaceae family, so-called Awopa, Osu pupa or Dokita igbo, Eru meru, Kakerim, and Erenba-vbogo in Nigeria. It is dense and widely distributed in Nigeria, Angola, Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo [

 <italic>E. chlorantha</italic> inhibited 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> in mice at 0.2 to 150 mg/ml while ethanolic extract inhibited the parasite at dose of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/g. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts have ED
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0·34 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup>and 6·9 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> which are schizonticidal in the mode of action. The activities could be linked to the presence of saponins, tannins, simple sugars, and alkaloids [

 <italic>E. chlorantha</italic> with 
 <italic>N. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. altilis</italic> were reported to display significant antimalarial and prophylactic activities. This justifies the ethnomedical practice of combination of antimalarial herbal therapies in combating acute or chronic malaria [
