 <italic>Azadirachta indica. Azadirachta indica</italic> extract is appraised to contain bioactive compounds which dictate its potencies against 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falcifarum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Ethanolic leaf extracts assessed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> absolutely inhibited 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> growth, at azadirachtin dosage of 50 mg/kg mouse body weight [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiplasmodial potency of aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts was examined in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>-infected BALB/c mice at dosage of 50 to 200 mg/kg/day. Both extracts exhibited significant antiplasmodial potency in a dose-dependent technique which could be due to the active antiplasmodial compounds screened [
