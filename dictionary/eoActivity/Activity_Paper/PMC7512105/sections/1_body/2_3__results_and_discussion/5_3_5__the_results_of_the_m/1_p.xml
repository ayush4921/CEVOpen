 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root, and high concentrations values were found in potassium (43 mg/l or ppm) followed by phosphorous (28.5 mg/l), calcium (15 mg/l), sodium (3.65 mg/l), and magnesium (0.145 mg/l). Similar findings were reported by Agbugui et al. [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in the other species of the same family. He showed these elements from a part of the rigid body structure, soft tissue, and body fluids of most vertebrates, and Anhwange et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported that, in general, minerals work in combination with each other and other nutrients; therefore, deficiency of any mineral may cause health problems. Sodium and potassium maintain water balance in cells, and they are important for nerve impulse transmissions and stimulation of normal movement of the intestinal tract. Glew et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that magnesium is essential because it maintains, repairs cells, and provides energy and its deficiency may result in vertigo, convulsions, nervousness, and heat palpitation. It also assists the muscles to keep reservoir of oxygen and increases the body's resistance to infection. Its deficiency results in anemia, tiredness, insomnia, and palpitations.
