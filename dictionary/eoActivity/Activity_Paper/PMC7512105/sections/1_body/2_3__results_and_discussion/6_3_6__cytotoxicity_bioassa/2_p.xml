<p>This studies of larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts had LD
 <sub>50</sub> values 1564721 ppm, 1412.54 ppm, and 1412.54 ppm, respectively, and were carried out against 3
 <sup>rd</sup> instar of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquito larvae (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), which revealed that the results of the lethal doses determined in both n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts were larvicidal significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and highly effectively safe for mosquito larvae with increased LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1564721 and 1412.54, respectively, and this indicates that nonpolar (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) and intermediate polar ethyl acetate have more potent activity to larvae. The methanol extract showed least effective larvicidal significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) moderate effect for mosquito larvae with an LD
 <sub>50</sub> value 257.54 ppm.
