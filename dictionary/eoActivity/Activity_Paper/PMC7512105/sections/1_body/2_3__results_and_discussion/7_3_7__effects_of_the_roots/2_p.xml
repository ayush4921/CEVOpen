<p>The phytochemical profiling of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root extracts presented in this study revealed a diverse range of the bioactive phenolics compound. Some of the identified bioactive phenolics were reported by several authors for antidiabetic activities; Valle et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], Can et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and Mohammed et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Besides, the larvicidal activity was carried out against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquito larvae, which showed that the methanol extract showed moderate effects and n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts showed safe effects. The larvicidal activities clearly showed safe effects in this part at high dose required for insecticidal action (1000 ppm), but the methanol extract is lower than doses used in animal study (200 ppm) for diabetic action.
