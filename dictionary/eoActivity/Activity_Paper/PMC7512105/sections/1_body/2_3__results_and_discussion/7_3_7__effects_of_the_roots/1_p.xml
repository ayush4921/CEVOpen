<p>In the present study, the effects of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> (L.) roots were determined on blood glucose levels of all animals treated with the supplement and were seen to reduce significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) by about 58.25%, 48.59%, and 41.93%, respectively, when compared with that of the untreated diabetic control group (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) and cause a favorable hypoglycemic activity when compared to fasting glucose levels within groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) significant reduction by 53.15%, 20.94%, and 32.87%, respectively, but with standard glibenclamide 10â€‰mg/kg significant reduction only between one hour with the value 37.10% and a significant increasing for the other 29.56% and 18.96%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This study proved the use of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> roots in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes and showed that 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> roots supplement has good potent hypoglycemic effects which may be due to its high contents of active phytochemical constituents such as flavonoids that was reported in most medicinal plants with hypoglycemic and antidiabetic properties. This finding agrees with those of Gidado, et al. [
