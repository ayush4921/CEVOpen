<p>This was an attempt to identify the potent antidiabetic and pesticides compounds from 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root. This plant is widely distributed, and it can be predicted that the potent antidiabetic and larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root is due to presence of compounds that have potential to be used in local communities for antidiabetic activity and also used as mosquito control during infestation seasons, thus promoting the use of natural antidiabetic and pesticides. It is concluded that 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> (L.) in parts showed higher potent hypoglycemic activity in glucose-loaded diabetic rats than other plants. However, further effects can be investigated by the increase in the treating dose of the extract, and other pharmacological studies should be performed, specifically on dose 200 mg/kg, which was presented as the antidiabetic activity. Isolation and identification of more bioactive compounds were highly recommended. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies are needed to be conducted on these active ingredients to study the mechanism of action by which these compounds exert their effect as an antidiabetic activity. I recommended studying the antidiabetic activity using alloxan-inducing diabetic type 2 in same dose 200 mg/kg and histopathological in animal by the same manner. Gidado et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Verma et al. [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] they reported in their previous studied on 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> leaf part and whole parts showed 
 <italic>β</italic>-cell regenerating potential as depicted by the histopathological studies of the pancreatic tissue, even though some cytotoxic agents such as the cytotoxic saponins may be present in the supplement which is capable of causing damage to both the pancreas and liver and induced hepatotoxicity.
