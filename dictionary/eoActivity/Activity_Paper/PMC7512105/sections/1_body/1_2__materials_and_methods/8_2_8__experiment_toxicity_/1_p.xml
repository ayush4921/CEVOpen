<p>The larvicidal activity of the 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root was determined to investigate lethality bioassay against 
 <italic>Culex quinefasciatus mosquito</italic> third instar larvae of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> roots. The cytotoxicity bioassay experiment was performed according to modification procedure described by Nguta et al. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thirty larvae were selected and transferred into three test tubes by means of a 23 cm disposable Pasteur pipette from an aluminum dish, each containing 5 ml of distilled water. The samples for the experiment were prepared by dissolving 20 mg of each different extracts in each 5 mL of dimethyle sulphoxide (DMSO). Appropriate amounts of this DMSO solution (5 
 <italic>µ</italic>L, 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L, and 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) to give three different concentrations of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (10 ppm, 100 ppm, and 1000 ppm ppm (or mg/L), respectively) were transferred into 100 ml test tubes (3 test tubes for each dose and 1 for control). Three replicates were prepared for each dose level and, then, dried further in vacuum for 1 h to remove DMSO completely. Control was prepared using only DMSO, and then, the thirty larvae were placed in each test tube. The surviving larvae were counted with the aid of a 3x magnifying glass, after 24 hours. The second count was performed after 72 hrs, and larvae were considered after dead when they fail to rise to the surface or settle motion less in the bottom of the test tube.
