<p>196 g of the dried plant was weighted and, then, extracted successively with n-hexane (for four hours), ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts (eighteen hours), and the single ethanolic extract was also extracted by using a shaker apparatus at room temperature. All extracts were air-dried and kept separately in universal bottles till used for subsequent experiments. Their physical appearance and percentage yields properties were tabulated in results. Percentage yields were calculated as follows:
