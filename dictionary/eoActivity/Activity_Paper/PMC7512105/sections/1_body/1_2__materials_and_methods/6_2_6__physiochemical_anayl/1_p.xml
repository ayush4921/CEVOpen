<p>Physicochemical properties such as the proximate composition (moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, crude lipid, and nitrogen-free extract %) of the roots were investigated using the standard methods of the Association of Analytic Chemist (AOAC, 1990-2005) methods [

The mineral compositions of the root sodium and potassium contents were determined by using a flame photometer, while calcium and magnesium contents were determined by using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (1100 B Perkin-Elmer, Germany) and phosphorus was determined by the vandomolybdate standard colorimetric method [
