<p>Insects, ticks, and mites are dangerous vectors of deadly pathogens and parasites, which may be considered as epidemics in the increasing world population of humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mosquitoes are the most important single group of insects in terms of public health importance, which transmit malaria, filariasis, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Reduction of the source of infection is an essential step in the control of mosquito-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although synthetic organic insecticides have been produced and used to eliminate mosquitoes. The treatment of the disease vectors using synthetic insecticides has failed due to their efficiency in attaining physiological resistance and effect on nontarget organisms [

 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> has been isolated and such compounds are reviewed as sennoside, anthraquinone glycosides, fatty oils, flavonoids, glycosides, galactomannan, polysaccharides, and tannins [
