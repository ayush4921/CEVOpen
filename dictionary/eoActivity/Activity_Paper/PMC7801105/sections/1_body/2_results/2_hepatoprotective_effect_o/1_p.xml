<p>The statistical measurements of SGOT, GPT, ALP, and GGT levels in rat serum showed that the healthy and hepatotoxic control groups were significantly different (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05), as listed in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The results showed that intoxication by giving 3 g/kg BW of paracetamol has succeeded in damaging or intoxicating the liver. An increase of SGOT, SGPT, ALP and GGT activity in hepatotoxic-induced rat serum has confirmed the occurrence of liver damage due to paracetamol intoxication.
