<p>The SGOT and SGPT activities in the serum of rat intoxication with paracetamol were much higher than in the healthy rat. Statistical results showed that SGOT and SGPT activities in the healthy and hepatotoxic control groups were significantly different. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> also shows that the administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract can inhibit the increase of SGOT and SGPT activities caused by paracetamol intoxication. The one-way ANOVA analysis revealed that there was a significant effect (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the SGOT and SGPT activities of treated groups compared to the hepatotoxic control group. The average of SGOT activity in the hepatotoxic control group was 885.20 U/L while in the groups treated with plant extracts of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg BW were 463.60 U/L, 190.80 U/L and 109.80 U/L, respectively. Moreover, the average of SGPT activity in the hepatotoxic control group was 1636 U/L while in the groups treated with plant extracts of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg BW were 334 U/L, 156 U/L, and 49 U/L, respectively (
