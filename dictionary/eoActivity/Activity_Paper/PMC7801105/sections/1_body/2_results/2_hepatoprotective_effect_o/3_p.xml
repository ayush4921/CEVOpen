<p>The administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extracts with doses of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg and silymarin 200 mg/kg BW significantly decreased the ALP and GGT activities in paracetamol intoxication. It appeared that the ALP and GGT activities treated with 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract and silymarin were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to the hepatotoxic group. The ALP and GGT activities of rat models that were given 600 and 900 mg/kg BW extracts were not significantly different from the healthy rats (
