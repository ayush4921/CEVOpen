<p>Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma, consisting of approximately 50% of the total plasma protein. Albumin is a single polypeptide with about 585 amino acids. Its molecular weight is around 66 kDa. Clinically, reduced albumin in blood plasma can affect redox balance, haemostatic disorders, impaired liver metabolism, acid-base imbalances, and, especially, reduce detoxification capacity and antioxidant activity (Bernardi et al.

 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract in doses of 600 and 900 mg/kg were not significantly different compared to the healthy rat group (
