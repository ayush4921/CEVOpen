 <bold>γ</bold>-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme that is bound to cell membranes that catalyze the reaction of γ-glutamyl transfer from a peptide to amino acids or other peptides. GGT is not only found in the membranes of liver cells but also found in membranes of various other tissues, including the membranes of proximal tubular cells of the kidney, pancreas, intestine, and spleen. GGT is mainly located in the biliary epithelial cells and the apical membrane of hepatocytes in the liver. However, GGT in serum is produced from the liver. Therefore, the increasing GGT activity in the serum is most likely derived from the liver.
