<p>The administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extracts with doses of 600 and 900 mg/kg BW could inhibit the toxic effects of paracetamol. The administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract with a dose of 300 mg/kg BW has a hepatoprotective power of approximately equivalent to silymarin 200 mg/kg BW, where ALP and GGT activities in the serum were not significantly different. The ALP and GGT activities of rat models that were given 600 and 900 mg/kg BW extracts were not significantly different from the healthy rats that possessed the inhibition of paracetamol intoxication (
