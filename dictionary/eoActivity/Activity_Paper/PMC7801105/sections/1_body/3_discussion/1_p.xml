<p>Flavonoids belong to phenolic compounds commonly found in several parts of plants, mostly in plant cells that require photosynthesis. Flavonoids are known to have biological activities such as antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotector (Tapas et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zhong et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Total flavonoids and phenolic compounds in this study were higher (0.5 and 11.62%, respectively) compared to the previous study (Adkar and Bhaskar 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Phenolic compounds in general can reduce free radicals and have a variety of functional properties such as anti-inflammatory, hypo-allergenic, antithrombotic, hepatoprotective, and anticarcinogenic properties (Itoh et al.
