<p>Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) is the most commonly used marker of liver toxicity. SGPT is a liver enzyme that plays an essential role in amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from alanine to α-ketoglutarate to produce glutamate and pyruvate. Normal SGPT levels are in the range of 5–10 U/L. The increased SGPT level occurs in liver damage. Measurement of SGPT levels is a more specific test to detect liver abnormalities due to it is mainly found in the liver. This enzyme is also found in skeletal and heart muscle, but its activity is lower. Thus, SGPT can detect liver cell necrosis (Lin et al.
