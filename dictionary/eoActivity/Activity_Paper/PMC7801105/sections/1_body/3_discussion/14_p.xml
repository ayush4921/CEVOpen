<p>Total protein concentration and haematocrit values increase in cases of dehydration, followed by an increase in albumin and globulin concentrations (Jackson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Decreased total protein concentration can also be caused by malnutrition and mal-absorption, liver disease, chronic and acute diarrhoea, burning, hormonal imbalance, kidney disease (proteinuria), low albumin concentration, and low globulin concentration (Meiklejohn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). An increase in total bilirubin levels and direct bilirubin activity and a decrease in albumin levels and total protein level in the hepatotoxic-induced rat is indicating damage to the integrity or function of liver cells due to paracetamol intoxication (Valášková and Muchová 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Yoon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
