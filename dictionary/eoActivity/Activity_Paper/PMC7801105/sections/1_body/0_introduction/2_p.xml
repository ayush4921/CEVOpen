<p>Acute liver disease can be caused by the excessive use of paracetamol or acetaminophen (Larson 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Yan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Paracetamol is a drug that can act as antipyretic and give analgesic effects at a therapeutic dose (Badmann et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, excessive doses of paracetamol may cause liver damage (Naguib et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Liver damage caused by paracetamol produced a toxic metabolite of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI) (Naguib et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Paracetamol is metabolized through glucuronidation, sulphation, and oxidation reactions by cytochrome P-450 isozymes which primarily occur in the liver excreted through the kidney. The oxidation process by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes will alter paracetamol into NAPQI (McGill and Jaeschke 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). NAPQI will react with glutathione (GSH) in the liver cell (Soliman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, excess doses may be toxic to the liver, and the damaged liver cells could be indicated by the elevated intracellular enzymes, especially aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Yoon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Acetaminophen poisoning effects such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia have toxic effects on the liver that can lead to death (Yoon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The increasing levels of ALT, AST, ALP, triglycerides, total bilirubin, as well as lower levels of protein and albumin are an early marker that more specific for detecting liver damage (Badrick and Turner
