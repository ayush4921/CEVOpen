<p>About 20 μL of serum was added in 1000 μL of reagent 1 of total protein (sodium hydroxide, potassium sodium tartrate), incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, added with 250 μL reagent 2 of total protein (sodium hydroxide, potassium sodium tartrate, potassium iodide, Cu-sulphate) and homogenized. The absorbance was measured at 540–546 nm. The measurements of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, and total protein levels were conducted in Laboratory Presidential RS Gatot Subroto Army Hospital in Central Jakarta (Biotechnica 3500, International Federation of Clinical Chemistry [IFCC]).</p>
