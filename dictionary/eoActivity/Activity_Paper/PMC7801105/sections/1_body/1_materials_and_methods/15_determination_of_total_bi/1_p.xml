<p>About 25 μL of serum was added into 1000 μL of reagent 1 containing phosphate buffer and NaCl, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reagent 1 was added by 250 μL of reagent 2 containing 2,4-chlorophenyl diazonium and HCl, incubated for 5 min, and homogenized. The absorbance was measured at 546 nm, and total bilirubin was calculated.</p>
