<p>Missing information in some studies particularly the local names, growth habit of the plants, and misspelled botanical names were retrieved from botanical databases: The Plant List, International Plant Names Index, NCBI taxonomy browser and Tropicos, and the Google search engine. Where a given species was considered as distinct species in different reports, the nomenclature as per the botanical databases took precedence. The traditional perception of malaria as well as the families, local names (Digo, Giriama, Kamba, Kikuyu, Kipsigis, Kuria, Luo, Markweta, Maasai, Nandi, and Swahili), growth habit, part (s) used, preparation, and administration mode of the different antimalarial plants were captured.</p>
