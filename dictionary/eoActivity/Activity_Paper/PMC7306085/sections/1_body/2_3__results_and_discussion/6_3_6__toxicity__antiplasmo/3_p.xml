<p>In total, 139 (48.6%) of the species identified have been investigated for antiplasmodial (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25, 18%) or antimalarial activities (
 <italic>n</italic> = 135, 97.1%). However, there is no record on antiplasmodial or antimalarial activity of about 51.4% of the species used although they could be potential sources of antimalarial remedies. In the antiplasmodial activity, parasite suppression ranged from 3.5 to 5.2% in 
 <italic>Leucas calostachys</italic> Olive aqueous leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] to 90% in 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> aqueous leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. In antimalarial studies against chloroquine-sensitive (D6, 3D7, D10, FCA/GHA, FCR3, K39, and NF54) and chloroquine-resistant (DD2, ENT 30, FCR3, K1, V1/S, and W2) 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates, 49.6% (67/135) were active with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml recorded against NF54 isolate for spermine alkaloids in 
 <italic>Albizia gummifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. On the other hand, 68 species (50.4%) were inactive. The most active extracts were those of isolated pure compounds. For example, spermine alkaloids: budmunchiamine K, 6-hydroxybudmunchiamine K, 5-normethylbudmunchiamine K, 6-hydroxy-5-normethylbudmunchiamine K, and 9-normethylbudmunchiamine K from 
 <italic>Albizia gummifera</italic> bark [
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>] had IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml recorded against ENT30. Curine, isolated from 
 <italic>Cissampelos mucronate</italic> roots, showed antimalarial activity against W2 isolate with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. At present, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], and 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] have been subjected to clinical studies. Artemisinin from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> is an ingredient of artemisinin-based combination therapy currently recommended for treatment of malaria [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. As identified earlier, few clinical trials have been done on antimalarial plants. This is partly due to the regulatory requirements for clinical studies, as well as the financial input required.
