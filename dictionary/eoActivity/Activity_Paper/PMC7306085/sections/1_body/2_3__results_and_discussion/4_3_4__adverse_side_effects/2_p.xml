<p>However, purgation and emesis are interpreted as signs that malaria is leaving the body and that the healing process has begun [

 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> were reported in Ethiopia to cause vomiting, nausea, headache, urination, and diarrhea when used for management of malaria [
