<p>Aluminum chloride complex forming assay was employed to determine the total flavonoid content of the extracts. Serial dilutions of the standard (Quercetin) were prepared in methanol with concentrations 1, 0.50, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.065 mg/mL, to establish calibration curve. 1 mL of the standard was then transferred into test tubes. 0.3 mL 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> was added and left for 5 minutes. Another 0.3 mL of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> was mixed with the solution and allowed to stand for 5 minutes. After that, 2 mL solution of 1M NaOH was added into the solution followed by quantity sufficient distilled water to make up the volume to 10 mL. Finally the solution was incubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The absorbance of the solution was recorded at 510 nm on UV spectrophotometer (Jenway Model 6500, England). The same procedure was repeated with the extract (1 mg/mL) and the blank solutions. The total flavonoid content was determined using a standard curve of quercetin (y=0.5957x - 0.0055, R2 = 0.9982). The calculated total flavonoid results were expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent per 100 g of extracts. All the procedures were performed in triplicate.
