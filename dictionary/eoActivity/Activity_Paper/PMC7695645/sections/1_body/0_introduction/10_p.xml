<p id="Par12">Literature lacks sufficient data regarding addition of natural antibacterial agents to GICs, despite that some of them have shown effective results against cariogenic salivary flora as mouthwashes or toothpaste. Hence, the aim of the study was to increase the antimicrobial properties of GICs through its modification by mixture of

 <italic>O. europaea</italic> extracts to be evaluated along with an 0.5% CHX-modified GIC with regard to biological and compressive strength properties.
