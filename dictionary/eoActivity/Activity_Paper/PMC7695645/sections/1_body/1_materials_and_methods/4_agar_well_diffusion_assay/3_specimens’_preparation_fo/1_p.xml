<p id="Par20">The powder and liquid of GIC for each group were mixed with sterile spatulas according to the manufacturer instructions. Nine Petri dishes were used for each bacterial strain. Four wells (5 mm diameter) were prepared in each plate using a sterile cork borer so that each plate could receive the freshly mixed, unset control and modified groups with the different concentrations. Seven specimens were prepared for each group. For monitoring the antibacterial effect of the tested groups, the plates were incubated (Heraeus GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Hanau, Germany) at 37 ± 1 °C for 48 h to allow the microorganisms to grow, and then the diameters of the circular inhibition zones around the samples were measured by using a digital micrometer [
