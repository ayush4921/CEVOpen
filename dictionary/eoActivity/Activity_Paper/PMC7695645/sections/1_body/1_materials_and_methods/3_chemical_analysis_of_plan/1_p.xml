<p id="Par17">The analysis was done at the Agriculture Research Center, Giza, Egypt using a gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent Technologies 7890A) interfaced with a mass-selective detector (MS) (MSD, Agilent 7000). One milliliter of the PE was diluted in diethylether and injected to analyse its chemical constituents. The GC was equipped with a polar Agilent HP-5ms (5%-phenyl methyl poly siloxane) and a capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 µm film thickness). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 200 °C and 250 °C respectively. The carrier gas was helium and delivered at a linear velocity of 1 ml/min. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV ionization potential, acquisition mass range of 50–800

A tentative identification of the compounds was performed based on the comparison of their relative retention time and mass spectra with those of the of the authentic compounds and by computer matching with NIST and WILEY library as well as by comparison of the fragmentation pattern of the mass spectral data with those reported in literature [
