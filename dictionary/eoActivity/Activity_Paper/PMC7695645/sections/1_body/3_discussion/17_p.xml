<p id="Par46">However, the current study based on its conditions and findings contradicts with Cefaly et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], Ewoldsen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and Sanders et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The reduction in compressive strength with antimicrobials in the former studies was attributed to the alteration of the powder/liquid ratio of the mixture and/or interference of antimicrobials with the cross-linking of GIC that occurs by the coordination of Al
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>with the COOH groups on the acidic polymers, thus decreasing the mechanical properties. Moreover, the majority of antimicrobial agents are added in the form of powders that easily absorb water, decreasing the compressive strength of the GIC. This explanation does not comply with the present study as the PE was added in the form of liquid and CHX powder was added in a very small percentage that did not seem to cause such a problem [
