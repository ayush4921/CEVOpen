<p id="Par48">Moreover, Cinnamic and bornyl acetic carboxylic acids were identified by GC/MS in the extract. It was assumed that by adding these acids, to glass ionomer liquids, the degree of cross-linking increases together with polysalt bridge formation and subsequently the mechanical properties of the set cement. This was in accordance with Prentice et al. [
