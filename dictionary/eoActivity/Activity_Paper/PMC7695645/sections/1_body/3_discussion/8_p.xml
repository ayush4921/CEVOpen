<p id="Par37">For 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic>, mean inhibition zones of 2:1 PE plant modified group were significantly higher than the control group. However, CHX-GIC group was significantly the highest followed by 2:1 PE group compared to the other tested groups, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This can be explained on the basis that 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> is very sensitive to chlorhexidine which can be efficiently taken up by the bacteria according to Wendel et al. [
