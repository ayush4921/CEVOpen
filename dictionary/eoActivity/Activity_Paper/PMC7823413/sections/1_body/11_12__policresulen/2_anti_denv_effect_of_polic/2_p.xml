<p>A study performed with a recombinant viral protease found that the compound policresulen is a potent inhibitor of DENV-2 NS2B/NS3, acting as a competitive protease inhibitor, affecting its stability and efficiently decreasing virus replication [

To understand the interaction between this phenolic compound and the viral protease, tests were carried out based on biophysical technology, molecular coupling and directed mutagenesis. The results showed that policresulen interacts with the Gln106 and Arg133 residues of the protease through hydrogen bonds. This finding differs from previously described interactions with other DENV protease inhibitors that bind to catalytic triad residues (His51, Asp75, and Ser135), offering a new target site for the protease [
