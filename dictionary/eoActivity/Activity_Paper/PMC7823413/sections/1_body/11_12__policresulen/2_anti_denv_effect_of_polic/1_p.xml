<p>Viral proteases are an interesting target for the development of antivirals for DENV [
 <xref rid="B183-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. As a viral protease complex, NS2B/NS3 cleaves various sites of the viral polyprotein to allow the conformation of both structural and nonstructural proteins; therefore, the inhibition of NS2B/NS3 leads to a clear interruption of the replicative cycle [
