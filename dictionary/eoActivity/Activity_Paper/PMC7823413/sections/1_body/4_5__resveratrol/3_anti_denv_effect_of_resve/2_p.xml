<p>A study found that resveratrol can inhibit DENV-2 infection in Huh7 cells, inducing HMGB1 protein accumulation. Resveratrol increases the amount of nuclear HMGB1 and improves the production of genes stimulated by interferon (ISG), leading to a more efficient innate immune response inside the cell, which is crucial to restrict virus replication and infection [
