 <italic>H</italic>-indol-2-one) is a 3′ substituted indolone. This structure has been related to neuroprotective activities, since this chemical core has been used and improved, and this biological activity remains [
 <xref rid="B187-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>] and even is related to the capability of this compound to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). GW5074 has been reported as a potent in vitro inhibitor of the kinase c-Raf [
 <xref rid="B188-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>], but in neurons and in in vivo models, it has the opposite action, activating B-Raf and C-Raf, which are mainly responsible for the neuroprotective effect [
