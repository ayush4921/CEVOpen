<p>The flavonoids naringin and catechin also inhibited DENV-2 NG at MOI 1 in VERO cells (47.9 μg/mL; SI: 13.5; and 33.7 μg/mL; SI: 24.8, respectively), especially posttreatment (64.5% and 91.8% inhibition, respectively), and only catechin at pretreatment [

 <sub>50</sub>: 43.12 µg/mL; SI: 5.72) and after infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 55 µg/mL; SI: 4.49), with no direct virucide activity. However, naringenin, a naringin precursor, exhibited direct virucidal activity against DENV-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.64 µg/mL SI &lt; 1) [
