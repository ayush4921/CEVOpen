<p>Due to the antiviral reports of this compound, including activity against arboviruses and flaviviruses, flavonoids also have several reported anti-DENV effects with multiple mechanisms involved. Nonneutralizing heterotypic antibodies have been documented to induce antibody-dependent potentiation (ADE) in secondary DENV infection, leading to increased entry of infectious viral particles into phagocytes, cells that produce a series of proinflammatory cytokines involved in the immune response in severe dengue pathogenesis [

In this context, a recent study evaluated the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of polyphenols in U937-DC-SIGN cells (boosted or not with antibodies) infected with DENV-2 and DENV-3 at an MOI of 1. Only quercetin at 100 µM and fisetin at 40 µM showed activity (flavonoids that only differ in one hydroxyl group at carbon 5 of the A ring). Furthermore, DENV-2 induced more IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-10 than DENV-3, but both viruses induced similar amounts of TNF-α that were downregulated by the compounds [
