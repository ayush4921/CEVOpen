<p>The antiviral effects of the polyphenols delphinidin and EGCG in three different flaviviruses (DENV, West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)) were evaluated. In those studies, the infection was reduced, likely by affecting virus internalization [

 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], which can affect pH-dependent viral fusion. According to these results, another study determined that both phenolic compounds, delphinidin and EGCG at 10 Î¼M, have anti-flavivirus effects in DENV, WNV and ZIKV models when added at the first steps of infection in VERO cells. The mechanism of action could act directly on the viral particle [
