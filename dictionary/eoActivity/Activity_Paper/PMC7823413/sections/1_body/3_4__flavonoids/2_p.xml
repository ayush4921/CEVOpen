<p>Flavonoid compounds have been one of the most studied secondary plant metabolites in different health disorders. The phenolic hydroxyl groups present on the B ring are related to their antioxidant activity [

Additionally, many flavonoid compounds have been related to antiviral activity against many viruses, such as HIV, HSV, influenza virus (IV), RSV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), measles, and rotavirus [
 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This demonstrates that flavonoids could be one of the most active compounds against different types of viruses, with multiple mechanisms of action, such as the inhibition of adsorption, virus entry, virus binding, RTase, integrase, protease, replication inhibiting DNA and RNA polymerases, and protein complex formation [
