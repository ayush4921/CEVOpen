<p>Studies evaluating compounds with mechanisms of action on the immune system are important due to the immunopathological nature of DENV [
 <xref rid="B152-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Among these compounds is salidroside, which has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties [

 <xref rid="B154-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. This compound is derived from the plant 
 <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>. Anti-DENV-2 activity in vitro has been demonstrated in THP-1 cells infected with DENV-2 (MOI 3) and incubated for 48 h after infection with salidroside (166 µM). The effect was determined by evaluating DENV envelope protein expression by Western blotting, and the density ratio of viral protein and salidroside-treated cells to beta actin decreased more than ten-fold in comparison to virus-infected cells without salidroside treatment [
 <xref rid="B155-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. It was also postulated that the mechanism of action of salidroside is related to the increased expression of RIG-I, which specifically recognizes viral RNA [
 <xref rid="B156-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], initiating a downstream signaling cascade that induces positive regulation of IRF-3 and IRF-7, which limit initial stages of DENV infection [
 <xref rid="B157-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. On the other hand, salidroside increases the expression of PKR and P-eIF2
 <italic>α</italic>, which restricts the synthesis of viral proteins, decreasing the expression of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B [
 <xref rid="B158-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Another effect is the increase in IFN-α and NK cells observed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), which helps reduce viral replication during the early stages of DENV infection and therefore limits subsequent pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B159-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. These results indicate that the phenolic glycoside salidroside could be considered for the development of an effective therapeutic multitherapeutic agent against DENV infection [
