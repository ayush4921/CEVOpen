<p>Despite the promising effects of curcumin, its obtainment from 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> is limited; moreover, the extraction of the compound in large masses is not entirely feasible, and the processes are often carried out in the presence of toxic solvents, such as methanol. The aqueous extraction of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> was evaluated as an easier process to perform, and curcumin was found to be the major component in more than 80% of the samples, followed by two remaining analogs, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin [

Then, a study evaluated the inhibition of DENV-4 protease activity from the recombinant protein NS2B-NS3 and determined the water soluble extracts prepared with this acid or steviol glycosides with primary inhibitory activity against the viral protease [
 <xref rid="B142-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. It was concluded that the glucosides used in the aqueous extraction process, stevioside (Ste), rebaudioside A (RebA), or steviol glucosides (SG), were able to maintain the biological activities of the evaluated compounds, making the extraction process easier and less toxic to obtain compounds with promising activity. In this context, Ste, RebA, and SG showed inhibitory activity against NS2B-NS3pro of DENV4, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 14.1 ± 0.2, 24.0 ± 0.4, and 15.3 ± 0.4 μg/mL, respectively [
