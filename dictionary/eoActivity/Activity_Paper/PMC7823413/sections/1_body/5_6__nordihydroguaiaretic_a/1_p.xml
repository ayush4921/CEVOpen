<p>Phenolic lignan, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), has been isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>Larrea tridentate</italic> (DC.) Coville found in Mexico and USA deserts. NGDA is approximately 5 to 10% of the leaf dry weight (80% of all phenolic compounds in the resin). The catechol rings present in their structure confer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to this hypolipidemic agent [

These facts make NDGA a promising antitumor compound that regulates several signaling pathways and controls cellular damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
