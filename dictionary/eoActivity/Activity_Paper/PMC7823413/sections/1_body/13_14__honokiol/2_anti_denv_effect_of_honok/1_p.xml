<p>DENV-2 strain PL046 infection in BHK and Huh-7 cells (MOI 0.1 and 1, respectively) was inhibited by honokiol posttreatment (48 h; 10 µM and 20 µM) by more than 90%. The possible mechanisms of action in both cellular models, BHK and Huh-7 cells treated with 10 and 20 µM honokiol, respectively, included viral protein expression reduction (NS1 and NS3; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and viral replication inhibition (intermediate, double-stranded RNA—dsARN—reduction; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Additionally, it was demonstrated that honokiol could inhibit the early steps of DENV infection, suppressing the upregulation of early endosomes, but it did not affect the attachment of the virus in Huh-7 cells (MOI of 10; 10 µM and 20 µM honokiol posttreatment) [
