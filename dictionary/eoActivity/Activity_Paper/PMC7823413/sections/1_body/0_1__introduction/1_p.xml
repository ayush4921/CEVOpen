<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae, which includes Zika virus, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses. Regarding genetic and structural characteristics, DENV is enveloped and has a spherical shape, with a positively sensed and single-stranded RNA that encodes structural proteins (capsid, membrane and envelope precursor) as well as nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5). In addition, DENV has four genetically distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) [
