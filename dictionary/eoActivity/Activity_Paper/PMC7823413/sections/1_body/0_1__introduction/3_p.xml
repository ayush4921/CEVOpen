<p>Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites produced mainly by plants. These compounds are chemically characterized by having one or more aromatic rings attached to at least one hydroxyl substituent, and it is estimated that more than 8000 different phenolic compounds have already been identified [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Phenolic compounds are ubiquitous in nature and have already been isolated from several plant families, including Sapindaceae [

 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Zygophyllaceae [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Rubiaceae [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They have strong antioxidant activity due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyls that give them the ability to neutralize several free radicals through the donation of hydrogen atoms, generating more stable and less toxic molecules [

 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, studies indicate that these compounds have anticancer [
