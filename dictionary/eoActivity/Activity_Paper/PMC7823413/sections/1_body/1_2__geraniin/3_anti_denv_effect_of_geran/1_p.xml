<p>Due to its antiviral properties, its effect on DENV-2 infection has been studied. The antiviral effect was evaluated using a cocktail compound of four aqueous extracts of different species of local Malaysian medicinal plants (
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> spp.: 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> Schum. &amp; Thonn., 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> L., 
 <italic>P. urinaria</italic> and 
 <italic>P. watsonii</italic> Airy Shaw) through three different strategies (pre-, trans- and post-treatment) onto confluent VERO cell monolayers. For all treatment strategies, the cultures were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. An antiviral effect was found in the trans-treatment (possible effect on viral particles) and pretreatment (possible effect on cellular proteins) strategies. Using a protein profiling assay, the study also demonstrated that pretreatment with 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> altered several cellular proteins involved in biological processes, including viral entry, viral transcription and translation regulation, cytoskeletal assembly, and cellular metabolism. Several bioactive compounds were identified in the pool, including gallic acid, syringin, corilagin, and geraniin, but the latter constituted the greatest amount in the extract. However, these components together could have had a synergistic anti-DENV effect in this study [
