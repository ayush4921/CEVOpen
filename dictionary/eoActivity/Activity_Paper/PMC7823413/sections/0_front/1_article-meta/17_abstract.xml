 <p>Phenolic compounds have been related to multiple biological activities, and the antiviral effect of these compounds has been demonstrated in several viral models of public health concern. In this review, we show the antiviral role of phenolic compounds against dengue virus (DENV), the most widespread arbovirus globally that, after its re-emergence, has caused multiple epidemic outbreaks, especially in the last two years. Twenty phenolic compounds with anti-DENV activity are discussed, including the multiple mechanisms of action, such as those directed against viral particles or viral proteins, host proteins or pathways related to the productive replication viral cycle and the spread of the infection.</p>
