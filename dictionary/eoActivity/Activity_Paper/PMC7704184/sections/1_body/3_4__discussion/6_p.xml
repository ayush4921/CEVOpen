<p>In this review, we are citing some natural sources that are used traditionally in Morocco to treat gout disease. The table classifies 23 species, their scientific names, families, the traditionally used parts, traditional use method, experimental used part, extraction methods, and the experimental study towards gout, and we are reporting the toxic plants. In fact, the cited plants had shown experimentally an antigout effect by blocking and inhibiting “xanthine oxidase” which is the enzyme that catalyzes xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors play an essential role to reduce uric acid levels, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the kidney and are able to prevent glomerular hypertension, afferent arteriolar, and ischemic renal histologic changes [

Besides, plants contain bioactive compounds that can enter into the active site of xanthine oxidase, producing a complex xanthine oxidase-bioactive compound through hydrophobic forces, related with surrounding xanthine oxidase amino acid and occupied the active site, thus preventing the entrance of substrate and inhibiting uric acid synthesis [

The Lamiaceae family is the most dominant family with six species. Recently, it was reported that the phenolic compounds isolated from the Lamiaceae herbs had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions [
