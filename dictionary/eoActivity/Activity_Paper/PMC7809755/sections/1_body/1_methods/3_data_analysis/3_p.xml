<p id="Par26">Statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages, Mean, Median, Standard Deviations,) were calculated to describe the sample demographics and frequency of specific activities, and are presented to show a trend (increasing or decreasing) that describes the correlation coefficient. The calculated values of indices of particular activities were compared between the subgroups of the respondents (the length of work experience as a nurse in years: 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49). We used nonparametric Spearman’s correlations between the indices and the length of work experience measured on the ordinal scale to assess relationships between them. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p>
