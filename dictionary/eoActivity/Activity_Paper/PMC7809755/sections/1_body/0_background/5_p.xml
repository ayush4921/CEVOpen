<p id="Par12">In Poland, the PHC is the first contact for most patients within the healthcare system. The PHC system in Poland is financed by the National Health Fund. Its aim is to ensure effective and efficient care for the patient and their family, to coordinate the care, evaluate and determine care priorities, identify, eliminate, or reduce physical and mental health problems, and ensure health promotion, disease prevention, and health education activities. The patient care responsibilities are shared by the PHC team made up of a physician (the manager of care), a nurse, and a midwife. Typically, the PHC physician and nurse care-team provides care for a panel of approx. 2500 patients annually.</p>
