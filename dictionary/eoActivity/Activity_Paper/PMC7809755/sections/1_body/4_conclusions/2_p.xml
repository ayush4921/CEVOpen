<p id="Par41">PHC nurses in Poland perform work associated more with carrying out physicians’ orders than the nursing work for which they were prepared. Engaging nursing and medical students in interprofessional education, attendance at conferences and dissemination of nursing research through conference presentation and publication, and advocacy of nursing professional organizations on behalf of the profession may be an effective strategy to overcome the current barriers to practicing PHC nursing at the top of the license. The findings of our study may also be used to update the content of qualification and specialist courses for PHC nurses. Research is needed to identify potential differences in how PHC nurses with fewer years of professional experience carry out their work activities. Moreover, repeating the study in a few years with a larger and more diverse sample to identify any generational differences and potential changes in Polish PHC nurses’ work to better align with that of PHC nurses in other developed countries is needed.</p>
