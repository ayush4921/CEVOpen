    "<h4>Background</h4>In some countries, including Poland, nurses have acquired autonomy from being a designated \"ancillary staff\" to \"professional staff\" only in recent decades. No prior published studies have examined, however, whether the actual nursing practice in primary health care (PHC) has evolved with the advancement of education and professional autonomy. The aim of this study is to assess the scope of practice of a PHC nurses and their actual work activities.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study design using an investigator-developed survey was conducted in Poland, in 2018. The survey was sent to professionally active PHC nurses in Poland. Of the 225 questionnaires distributed, 202 (89.8%) were returned.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 44 work activities examined, the most often performed activity was administering medications. Less frequent activities included recognizing patients' nursing needs and health problems and monitoring, assessing, and interpreting basic vital signs. A correlation was found between the length of work experience and the following three activities: performing nursing care, issuing referrals for specific diagnostic tests, and ordering of specific treatments, medications, and nutritional supplements. The longer was the work experience, the more often the nurses performed nursing care (r = 0.15; p = 0.035) but less often issued referrals for diagnostic tests (r = - 0.24; p = 0.001) or orders within their scope of practice (r = - 0.23; p = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>While nurses in general are most likely to carry out physician orders, junior nurses tend to be more likely to work toward professional autonomy and pursuing new challenges. PHC nurses in Poland perform work associated more with carrying out physicians' orders and less with what they were prepared to do. Engaging nursing students in interprofessional education, dissemination of nursing research, and advocacy of nursing professional organizations on behalf of the profession may be an effective strategy to overcome the current barriers for PHC nurses to work the top of their license."
