<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and toxic effects of leaf extracts, and some compounds from leaves of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> in Nigeria [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there is no adequate scientific evidence to back the use of the stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> in the management of pain and inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available scientific data supporting the analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy of the stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> in Kenya, despite the continued ethnomedicinal applications for inflammatory disorders [
