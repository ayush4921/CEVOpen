<p>Inflammation is defined as a reaction to infection, irritation, or injury to tissues. It is characterized by five cardinal features, namely, tumor (swelling/oedema), color (redness), dolor (pain), fever (warmth), and 
 <italic>functio laesa</italic> (organ/tissue dysfunction) [

The underlying goal of inflammatory events is localization and elimination of harmful assaults, and removal of damaged tissues, with their components, culminating in healing of injured tissues [
