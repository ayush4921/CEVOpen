<p>Acute oral toxicity effects of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> were also investigated in this study. The results demonstrated no observable signs of toxicity and lethal effects in experimental groups of mice even at the limit/cut-off dose of 2000 mg/kg bw. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values for each of the studied plant extracts were thus envisaged to be above 2000 mg/kg bw.
