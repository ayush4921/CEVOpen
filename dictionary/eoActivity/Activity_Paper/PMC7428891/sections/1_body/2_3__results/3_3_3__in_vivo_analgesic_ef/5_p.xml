<p>A comparison of the effects of the studied plant extracts on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice was also done in this study (

 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> conferred significantly higher percentage inhibition (less writhing frequency) of acetic acid-induced writhing compared to its methanolic counterpart at the same dose levels (
