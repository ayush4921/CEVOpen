<p>Extraction was performed according to the method described by Harborne [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and modified by [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, 500 g of the powered material was macerated in 1 liter of analytical grade methanol in a 2-liter conical flask, and then covered with a foil paper with constant shaking for 48 h. The menstruum was decanted and filtered using a filter paper (Whatman No. 1). This procedure was repeated three times to exhaust extraction. The resultant filtrates were combined and reduced 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> at 55°C using a rotary evaporator. Thereafter, the extract was transferred into a clean, dry universal glass bottle, and placed in a hot-air oven set at 35°C, for complete drying. The extract was stored at 4°C in a refrigerator awaiting bioassay.
