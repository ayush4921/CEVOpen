<p>According to the OECD [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] guidelines, 10 mg should be reconstituted in 0.2 ml of the vehicle (normal saline). In this study, a 10 ml stock solution containing 500 mg/kg bw of either the aqueous or the methanolic stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> was prepared and serially diluted with normal saline to obtain 100 mg/kg bw, 20 mg/kg bw, and 4 mg/kg bw doses. The same procedure was followed for the standard drug (dexamethasone, 10 mg).
