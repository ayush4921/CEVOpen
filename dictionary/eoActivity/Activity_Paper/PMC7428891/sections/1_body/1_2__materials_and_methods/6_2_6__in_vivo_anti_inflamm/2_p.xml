<p>After 60 minutes, oedema in each mouse was induced by smearing 1 drop of xylene on the inner pinna of the right and left ears for 15 minutes. Afterwards, the experimental mice were anesthetized using diethyl ether and both the right (oedematous) and left ears were dissected and accurately weighed using an analytical balance. The respective weights were recorded and used to calculate the anti-inflammatory effects of the extracts and expressed as the percentage inhibition of oedema according to the formula described by Igbe et al.
