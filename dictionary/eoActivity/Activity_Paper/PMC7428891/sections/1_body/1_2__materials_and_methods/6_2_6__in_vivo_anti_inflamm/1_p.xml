<p>In this study, the xylene-induced ear oedema technique described by Igbe et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was adopted. Experimental mice were randomly divided into six groups (A, B, C, D, E, and F), with each group having five (5) mice. Mice in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively, were orally administered with 4 mg/kg bw, 20 mg/kg bw, 100 mg/kg bw, and 500 mg/kg bw of the studied plant extracts 
 <italic>p.o</italic>. and 1 drop of xylene topically. The control groups (E and F, respectively) received 1 mg/kg bw of dexamethasone as positive control and 10 ml/kg bw of distilled water as negative control respectively, 
 <italic>p.o.</italic> and 1 drop of xylene topically. The volume of administration was 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l for all the agents except for xylene which was administered by smearing 1 drop of xylene on the inner pinna of the right ear.
