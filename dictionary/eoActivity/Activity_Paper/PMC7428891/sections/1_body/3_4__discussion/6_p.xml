<p>Generally, acetic acid-induced writhing test serves as a standard technique for evaluating antinociceptive/analgesic efficacy of natural products [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this method, acetic acid induces the release of various endogenous noxious mediators such as histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin which drive the cardinal signs associated with inflammation, especially pain [
