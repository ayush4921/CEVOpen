<p id="Par6">The chloroformic fungal extract showed significant inhibition against the mutagenicity of S9-dependent mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF). In case of co- incubation, inhibitory effect ranged from 21.9 to 67.1% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.79 mg/ml while in case of pre incubation mode, it ranged from 30.4 -70% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.35 mg/ml. This demonstrated good inhibitory effect in case of pre incubation as compared to co incubation. The chloroformic extract was found to be neither mutagenic nor toxic to the 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> strain as the number of colonies was comparable to spontaneous mode which did not contain any mutagen. A significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed between the various concentrations as revealed by one way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s t-test (Table
