<p id="Par11">Phenolic compounds are predominantly responsible for the antioxidant potential of microbial extracts. Thus, total phenolic and flavonoid content present in the chloroformic fungal extract is directly proportional to its antioxidant activity. The phenolic content of the chloroformic extract of the fungus was found to be 18.12 ± 0.037 mg GAE/100 mg. The values have been expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 mg of chloroformic fungal extract and the calibration curve of gallic acid followed the linear equation of 2.87x + 0.025, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99. On the other hand total flavonoid content was 1.862 ± 0.0265 mg quercetin equivalents/100 mg of chloroformic fungal extract. The calibration curve of quercetin followed the linear equation of 21.76x + 0.082, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.96.
