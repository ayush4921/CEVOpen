<p id="Par10">FRAP assay estimates the reducing potential of an antioxidant, reacting with a ferric tripyridyltriazine (Fe3+ -TPTZ) complex and producing a blue coloured ferrous tripyridyltriazine (Fe2+ -TPTZ). The ferric reducing power of the chloroformic fungal extract was calculated from the linear calibration curve of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> and the reducing power was expressed as mM FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> equivalents/mg of the fungal extract. The chloroformic extract showed the reducing potential of 86.6 ± 0.032 mM FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> equivalents/mg. The results showed the linear relationship with the concentration of the chloroformic extract used.
