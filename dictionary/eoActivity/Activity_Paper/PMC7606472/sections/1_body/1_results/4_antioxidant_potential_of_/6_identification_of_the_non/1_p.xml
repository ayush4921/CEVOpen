<p id="Par13">The fraction obtained from column chromatography showing single band on TLC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) was subjected to HPLC and further analysed for GC–MS which revealed the presence of various compounds with corresponding peaks at different retention times (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thirty compounds were detected in GC–MS, out of which five were the major compounds namely phenol, 2,4 bis (1,1dimethylethyl); E-14-hexadecenal; 10-heneicosene (c,t); 3- eicosene and 1-heneicosanol (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
