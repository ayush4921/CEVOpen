<p id="Par8">DPPH assay is an excellent method to estimate the potential of antioxidant compounds to scavenge free radicals. When DPPH accepts the hydrogen atom from the antioxidants, discoloration of the molecule takes place. The chloroformic extract tested at the concentration range of 20–100 µg/ml, exhibited 30.59–89% DPPH scavenging activity. The percentage inhibition at the lowest concentration of 20 µg/ml was 30.59%, which significantly increased with the increase in concentration of chloroformic extract. Ascorbic acid as control showed 4.77–75.05% scavenging activity at a concentration range of 2–10 µg/ml. The linear plot obtained at different concentrations of chloroformic fungal extract followed the equation y = 0.744x + 16.40, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.992 and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) was found to be 45.16 µg/ml. (Fig.
