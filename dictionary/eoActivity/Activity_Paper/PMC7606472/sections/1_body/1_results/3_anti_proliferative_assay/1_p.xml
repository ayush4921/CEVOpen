<p id="Par7">The chloroformic fungal extract was assayed for antiproliferative activity against three cancer cell lines; HCT- 15 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HeLa (cervical cell line), U87-MG (human glioblastoma) by MTT assay. The chloroformic fungal extract showed the dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against all the tested cancer cell lines. In case of HCT- 15 cell line, the viability reduced to 9.26% at the highest concentration of chloroformic fungal extract i.e. 1 mg/ml and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was found to be 0.051 mg/ml. In case of HeLa cell line, the viability at its highest concentration was found to be 15.7% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.11 mg/ml and at its lowest concentration the viability was 93.8% whereas in case of U87-MG the viability reduced to 16.3% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.014 mg/ml. Thus, the chloroformic fungal extract showed potent antiproliferative activity against all the cell lines tested (Fig.
