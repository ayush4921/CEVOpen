<p id="Par2">The use of synthetic drugs for various diseases may cause many side effects and sometimes resistance, which justifies the need to find out novel and effective bioactive agents with better mode of action. Many mutagenic and carcinogenic agents are also present in the environment which are responsible for pathogenesis of degenerative diseases
