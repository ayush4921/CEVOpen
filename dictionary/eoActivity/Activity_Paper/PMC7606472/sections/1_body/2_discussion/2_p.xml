<p id="Par15">In the current study, 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> an endophytic fungus isolated from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> has been evaluated for antimutagenic activity by Ames test. The chloroformic fungal extract showed a good inhibitory effect on mutagenesis induced by S9-dependent mutagen 2AF (polyaromatic hydrocarbon; PAH) and the inhibitory activity increased with increasing concentrations. The PAH's are promutagens which get activated to their reactive metabolites that covalently bind to DNA. Cytochrome p450, member of CYP1 family is the most active metabolizing enzyme which is involved in the formation of dihydrodiol epoxides, which can subsequently cause mutations in genes

 </sup>. P-450 enzymes metabolize 2-AF into a reactive carcinogenic ester, N-hydroxyl derivative (2-acetylaminofluorene-N-sulfate), which in turn interacts with guanine residues of DNA, resulting in mutagenicity

 </sup>. Therefore, the inhibitory potential of the chloroformic fungal extract can be attributed to its ability to scavenge the free radicals produced during the activation of 2AF
