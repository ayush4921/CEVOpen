<p id="Par20">Fifty ml of yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD) was inoculated with two discs (8 mm of size) of 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> grown on yeast glucose agar (YGA) plates. The flasks were then incubated for 5 days at 25 °C as stationary cultures. The harvested broth was filtered through Whatman filter paper no. 1. The filtrate so obtained was extracted twice with equal volume of chloroform and the solvent layer was evaporated using rotary evaporator. The dried residue obtained was reconstituted in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 27.2 mg/ml stock was used for further experimentation
