<p id="Par34">The GC–MS analysis of the collected fraction was carried out using Thermo Trace 1300GC coupled with Thermo TSQ 800 Triple Quadrupole MS with column BP 5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm). The instrument was set to an initial temperature of 60 °C, and maintained at this temperature for 3 min. Then the oven temperature was raised up to 280 °C, at an increase rate of 15 °C min
 <sup>-1</sup> and maintained for 19 min. Injection port temperature was ensured at 260 °C and Helium flow rate as 1 ml min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The ionization voltage was 70 eV. The samples were injected in split mode as 10:1. Mass spectral scan range was set at 50–650 (m/z)
