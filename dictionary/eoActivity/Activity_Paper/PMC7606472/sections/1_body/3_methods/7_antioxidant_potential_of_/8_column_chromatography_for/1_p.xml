<p id="Par32">For the extraction of the bioactive compounds, fifty ml of YPDS (yeast extract peptone dextrose starch) broth, taken in 250 ml conical flasks, were inoculated with two discs (8 mm of size) of the fungal culture grown on YGA plates. Incubation was carried out for 5 days as stationary culture. The culture broth obtained from different flasks was pooled and extracted with equal volume of chloroform and then solvent was evaporated using rotary evaporator. Two litres of broth yielded 140 mg of solid residue. Thereafter, it was subjected to column chromatography using silica gel (120–200 mesh size, column 18 mm × 300 mm; Hi-media) packed and pre-equilibrated with chloroform. The column was first eluted with equilibration solvent i.e. chloroform (two bed volumes) followed by linear gradients of chloroform: ethyl acetate (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80, 10:90, 0:100) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). Different fractions, of 25 ml each, were collected and after concentration, were subjected to thin layer chromatography. Chloroform;˗ethyl acetate (3:7) was used as screening system to develop the chromatograms which were observed under UV light (254 and 365 nm) and in iodine chamber. Fractions which showed similar TLC pattern were pooled and concentrated again. Further, the HPLC analysis was carried out.</p>
