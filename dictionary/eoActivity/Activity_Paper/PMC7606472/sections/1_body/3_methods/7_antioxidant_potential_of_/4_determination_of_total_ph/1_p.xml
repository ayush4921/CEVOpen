 </sup>. Test sample (500 µl) was mixed with 100 µl of the 0.5 N FC reagent and after allowing it to stand for 15 min, 2.5 ml of sodium carbonate was added and mixed completely. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and its absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Gallic acid was taken as standard and TPC was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 mg of the extract.
