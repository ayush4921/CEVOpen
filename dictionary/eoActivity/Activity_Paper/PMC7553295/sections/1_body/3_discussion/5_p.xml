<p>From the results it is evident that most of the studies are focused on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> rather than 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of plants against the protoscoleces of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>granulosus</italic>. This could be attributed to the fact that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of plants is cost effective, less time consuming, and quick turnover of results, which allow plants screening on a large scale. In addition, these tests measured the effect of anthelmintic activity directly on the process of hatching, development, and motility of parasites without interfering the internal physiological functions of the hosts [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies is that after getting reliable results, then the extract/compound could further be evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. However, compounds/extracts that are effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> may or may not active 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to the same extent [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This type of discrepancy in the activity of testing new anthelmintic drugs is relatively common which may be attributed to several factors such as (a) bioavailability and intrinsic pharmacology of the compound tested (b) the possible destruction or insolubility of the compounds in the rumen of animal (c) and additional protection of the parasite [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This limitation/gap signifies the importance of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies for the industrial development of new anthelmintic products against 
 <italic>E</italic>.
