<p>Treatment of the disease depends on stage, size, location, and complications of the cysts. At present, four treatment modalities are in practice for CE: surgery (the only treatment until the 1980s), chemotherapy with synthetic drugs like benzimidazole compounds, puncture aspiration injection and re-aspiration (PAIR), and the watch and wait method for clinically silent and inactive cysts [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these treatment methods have significant limitations. Some of the chemotherapeutic drugs used against CE are only used for inoperable cysts, though 20â€“40% cases do not respond favorably to those drugs and there are many related adverse effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During surgical practices, there is a high risk of intraoperative release of cystic fluids that subsequently results in secondary infection and relapse of hydatid cysts in approximately 10% of the cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that existing scolicidal agents like cetrimide, ethanol, hypertonic saline, silver nitrate and others are related to severe side effects such as sclerosing cholangitis [

 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There are indeed a large number of medicinal plants whose scolicidal activity has been demonstrated against the protoscoleces of
