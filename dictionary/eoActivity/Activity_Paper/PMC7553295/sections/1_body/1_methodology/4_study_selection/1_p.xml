<p>Endnote (Thomson Reuters, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to compile the articles. Initially, two investigators (RA and MR) assessed titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles for eligibility criteria. Then, the relevant full text published articles were reviewed by three investigators (RA, MR, and MK). In case of any controversy a fourth investigator (MA) was invited to discuss the article. Information including species of plant used, habitat, part(s) used, compound(s) used, concentration/dose, exposure time, scolicidal efficacy, and the name of the country in which the experimental work was performed was considered in the selection process. “Plant list” (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tropicos.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.tropicos.org</ext-link>) were referenced for the standardization of plant scientific names, synonyms and families. PubChem (
