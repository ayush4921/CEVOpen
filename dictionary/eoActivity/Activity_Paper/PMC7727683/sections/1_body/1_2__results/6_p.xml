 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Interestingly, tylophorine has also been reported to inhibit the replication of the HCV [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. More recent studies have shown that tylophorine-based compounds, whether extracted from plants or artificially synthesized, act as strong inhibitors of many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [

 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. One study described natural (tylophorine and tylophorinine) and synthetic tylophorine compounds as novel and potent anti-CoV agents for the treatment of TGEV and SARS-CoV infections. The authors reported EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the natural and synthetic tylophorine compounds ranging from 8 to 1468 nM and 5 to 340 nM, in ST and Vero 76 cells, respectively. Additionally, the tylophorine compounds showed strong anti-coronavirus replication activity, ultimately blocking virus-induced apoptosis and subsequent cytopathic effect in cells in vitro [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In a further study to understand the mode of action of tylophorine-based compounds, Yang and colleagues (2017) demonstrated that these compounds target viral RNA, thereby inhibiting TGEV replication. The authors further reported that tylophorine-based compounds act jointly with CYT387—a JAK family inhibitor—to exert comprehensive anti-TGEV activities. They concluded that the combination treatment, using a tylophorine compound and a JAK2 inhibitor, is more efficacious for the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV than either treatment on its own [
