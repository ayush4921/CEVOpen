 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> is a traditional Chinese medicine used in clinical settings for its anti-viral properties in the treatment of diseases like influenza, hepatitis, and encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In one study, indigo—a major compound of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root extract—showed potent antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in vitro replication in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, time-of-addition assays showed that indigo exhibits a strong antiviral effect before or during infection, but not after viral cell entry [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Chang and colleagues (2012) hypothesized that this indicated that the antiviral mode of action of indigo is associated with the blocking of virus attachment to the cell receptor [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root was also frequently used for the prevention and treatment of SARS during the SARS-CoV outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In fact, Lin and colleagues (2005) reported that both the 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root extract, as well as indigo, showed a significant inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV in the micromolar range. Similar to other 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root compounds, indigo inhibits the cleavage activities of the 3CLpro—a viral replication enzyme that mediates the proteolytic processing of coronavirus replicase polypeptides into functional proteins [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], in a dose-dependent manner. In the end, the authors reported indigo IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for cell-free and cell-based assays of 300 μM and 752 μM, respectively; this is indicative of indigo acting as an efficient blocker 3CLpro functioning. Lastly, a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.4 mM in Vero cells was reported indicating that indigo is not toxic to Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This contradicts the hypothesis for the mode of action for indigo proposed by Chang and colleagues (2012) but could merely be a function of the virus studied or the assays used. Further studies on different viruses, and in different systems, would be needed to elucidate the exact mode of action of indigo.
