<p>Lycorine is one of the major alkaloids isolated from the plant 
 <italic>Lycoris radiate</italic>, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This alkaloid possesses many diverse biological functions, including antiviral [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Lycorine has been reported to have antiviral action against many diverse viruses, including DV [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], poliovirus [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], HCV [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and coxsackievirus A16 [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], avian influenza H5N1 virus [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], HSV1 [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and bunyaviruses and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Using a high throughput screening MTS assay to check for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), Li and colleagues (2005) screened more than 200 anti-viral Chinese medicinal herb extracts for antiviral activity against the human SARS-CoV. In the end, they reported that lycorine—with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.7 ± 1.2 nM, a CC
 <sub>50</sub> in Vero E6 and HepG2 cell lines of 14,980.0 ± 912.0 and 18,810.0 ± 1322.0 nM, respectively, and an SI value higher than 900 inhibits SARS-CoV replication in vitro, making it an ideal candidate as a new anti-SARS-CoV drug [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Unfortunately, this observation was made post the SARS-CoV outbreak, and could never be tested in an in vivo setting. Moreover, the authors did not speculate on the anti-SARS-CoV mode of action of lycorine. Based on the previous study by Li and colleagues (2005), Zhang and others (2020) tested the inhibitory effect of lycorine on SARS-CoV-2 in in vitro cell culture replication. Using a dose-dependent rescuing CPE assay, they reported that lycorine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro replication in a cell-independent manner [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While previous studies have reported that the antiviral action of lycorine is primarily through the suppression of viral RNA replication [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], by blocking the elongation of viral RNA translation during EV71 infection [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], others have reported that lycorine is able to stop the movement of influenza virus nucleoprotein from the nucleus [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and is able to downregulate autophagy [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Based on these previous reports, Zhang and colleagues (2020) postulated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of lycorine is likely due to the alkaloid modulating host factors instead of directly targeting viral factors [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; however, this needs to be verified in future studies.
