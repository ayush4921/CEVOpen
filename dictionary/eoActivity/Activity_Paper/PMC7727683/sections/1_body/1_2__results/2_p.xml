<p>Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a plant-derived alkaloid extracted from some species of the 
 <italic>Cephalotaxus</italic> genus [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. HHT exhibits antiviral activity against a diverse range of viruses, including the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], hepatitis B virus (HBV) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], human echovirus 1 (HEV1) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and HSV1 [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] among others. Moreover, groups have reported that HHT shows strong anti-viral activity against diverse human and animal coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a screen of 727 compounds in the NIH Clinical Collection small molecule database, HHT—with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the 84 compounds identified—was identified as the strongest inhibitor against various coronaviruses. In this study, HHT effectively inhibited coronavirus infection (a reduction in virus titer of ≥8 log
 <sub>10</sub>) by interfering with the coronavirus replication. The authors reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of about 0.011 μM with a dose-dependent effect on virus inhibition [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a later study by Dong and colleagues (2018), HHT was shown to effectively reduce porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) viral load in infected cells and animals. The alkaloid was reported to provide optimal inhibitory activity, without death, at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg in piglets. Interestingly, HHT treatment effectively decreases mRNA levels of PEDV nucleocapsid in pig intestine and blood, indicating efficient inhibition of PEDV replication in vivo. Moreover, HHT-dosed piglets did not show a pathological change in tissues or symptoms of diarrhea and cachexia [

 <sub>50</sub> of 59.75 μM, and an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.55 and 2.14 μM for the reduction in infectious virus and reduction in viral RNA copy numbers, respectively [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The authors do not speculate on the mode of HHT action but it has previously been reported to be a protein synthesis inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], so this might provide clues for future studies on the mode of action.
