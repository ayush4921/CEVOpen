<p>The outcome of our docking study of the selected alkaloids and reported compounds with SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05496-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Where the previously reported KT185, KT203, GSK1838705A, BMS195614, and RS504393 gave a libdock score of 95.9, 101.43, 72.7, 91.75, and 120 (Kcal/mol), respectively, the chosen alkaloids gave a libdock score ranging from 64.26 (Kcal/mol) to 109.11 (Kcal/mol). This finding indicated higher binding stability for alkaloids-S1-RDB complexes. In other words, S1-RDB favored interactions with most alkaloids, especially homoharringtonine which revealed the highest docking score. The interaction of homoharringtonine with S1-RBD involved three hydrogen bonds acceptor with Ser494, Ser494, and Gln 493 and two hydrogen bond donors with Tyr453 and Pro491. In addition, there were hydrophobic interactions with Leu455, Lys452, and Phe 497. Also, with cepharanthine, the high docking score (106.74 Kcal/mol) could be attributed to the formation of five hydrogen bond acceptors with Arg 454, Arg 457, Lys 458, Lys 458, and Ser 469 and one hydrogen bond donor with Gln474. All the docked structures showed similar binding modes in the binding region of S1-RBD of SARS-COV-2 and interaction with various amino acid residues, including the Leu455, Phe486, Asn487, Gln493, Ser494, Tyr495, and Gly496 [
