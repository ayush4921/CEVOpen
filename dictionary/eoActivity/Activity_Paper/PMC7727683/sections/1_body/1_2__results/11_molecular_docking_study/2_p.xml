<p>In this study, the S1 subunit of SARS-COV-2 was targeted by an in silico approach to repurpose drug molecules that bind the S-protein and blocks its interaction with the ACE2 receptor, rendering it incapable of infecting a host cell. From a previous study [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], it was reported that several drugs were found from in a high-throughput virtual screening approach of FDA approved LOPAC library drugs to be active against the S-protein receptor of the virus. KT185, KT203, GSK1838705A, BMS195614, and RS504393 were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein. So, in order to gain insights into the binding mode and crucial molecular interactions of the chosen alkaloids, molecular modeling simulation studies were performed with the S-RBD protein of SARSCOV-2 using Libdock protocol in Discovery Studio 2.5 Software. The analysis of their binding modes was performed to predict their biological activities and to achieve further insight into binding orientations and interactions. Alkaloids interacting with S1-RBD could potentially interfere with virus attachment to host receptors and, hence, inhibit virus entry into the host cell. Therefore, a molecular docking study was performed to identify and understand the interaction and binding affinity of these alkaloids with the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2.
