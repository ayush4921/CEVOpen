<p>Creating and using universal sets of primers, databases and standards to catalogue species by research groups all around the world, would increase the level of reliability and the number of species available for study (which has reached the greatest level ever achieved by the scientific community) while also making it possible to identify an ever-growing number of species [

Most importantly, before these plant-based drugs can be incorporated into conventional medicine, more randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials are need on a larger scale. Data generated from such experiments should also be logged in a universal, open-access database. Countries dependent on traditional, synthetic medicine, need to re-shift focus to programs aimed at systematically studying the bioactive compounds from plants, and synthesizing new drugs from compounds.
