<p>Modern research around the world should now focus on the pharmacological activities of the phytochemicals and mapping their genomes and transcriptomes to produce target drugs. There is a need for more systematic botanical, physicochemical and chemical analyses of thousands of potential medicinal plants. Further research is required to determine the efficacy, dosage standards, optimum extraction methods/solvents, cytotoxicity/hepatoxicity, pharmacokinetics, molecular mechanisms of action, phytoantiviral screening methods, and drug interactions for many phytoantivirals.</p>
