<p>Jamaica’s enormous “ethnopharmacopoeia” in addition to rigorous community-driven scientific data sharing through globalization could potentially expedite natural-product development, lower the cost to purchase natural-products and the cost for commercialization of natural-based drugs, and increase the availability of natural-based pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing scientific evidence supporting the medicinal value of plants native to and cultivated in Jamaica, commercialization of natural-products derived from these efforts is limited by factors including inadequate testing systems, uncertain regulatory landscapes in natural-product biomedical research, manufacturing practices, commercialization, licensing and intellectual property. As a result, the lack of a rational approach to a creating a sustainable natural-product pharmaceutical industry has been limited.</p>
