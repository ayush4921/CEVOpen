<p>Some active compounds in these plants responsible for the therapeutic effects of phytoantivirals include alkaloids, anthraquinones, coumarins, polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids), phenolic acids and their derivatives, lignans, naphthoquinones, peptides, nitrogenated compounds, polysaccharides and terpenes. Lipophilic terpenoids (essentials oils) disrupt the virus envelopeâ€™s lipid double layer and may even cause it to lyse [

Phytochemicals like alkaloids (e.g., quinoline), furanocoumarins, aristolochic acid, macrozamin and cyasin can attack and mutilate nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) either by alkylating the DNA molecule or intercalating within the DNA molecule [

Other active ingredients that have been used in ancient/traditional medicine include strychnine, quinine, and morphine (European medicine), camptothecin and taxol (Chinese medicine), and Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine extracts from the Madagascar periwinkle (
