<p>Liver disease in general, is a major global health burden. Viral hepatitis is a disease of the liver characterized by liver inflammation and damage as a result of viral infection. Viral hepatitis is commonly caused by one of five hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E), but may be caused by other viruses like the herpes simplex virus (HSV) Yellow fever virus (YFV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV). Hep A, Hep B, and Hep C are the most common causes of viral hepatitis. Hep A and Hep E are spread by the fecal-oral route, that is, contamination via contaminated food or water. Hep B, Hep C and Hep D are spread through blood transfusion. There is evidence that these may also be spread sexually.</p>
