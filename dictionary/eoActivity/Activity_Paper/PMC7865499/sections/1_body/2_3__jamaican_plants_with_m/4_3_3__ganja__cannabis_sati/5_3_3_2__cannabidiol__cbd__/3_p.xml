<p>In a 2017 in vitro study by Lowe and colleagues explored the bioactivity of CBD against hepatitis B and C viruses [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The anti-hepatitis B assay was carried out using HepG2 2.2.15 cells that produce high levels of the HBV wild-type ayw1 strain. The anti-hepatitis C assay utilized Huh7.5 cells mixed with cell-culture derived HVC. In both assays, cells were plated in a 96-well microtiter plate. A single concentration of 10μM of the test compound (CBD) was then added to both microtiter well plates, incubated, and an analysis of antiviral activity was determined by calculating the percent of inhibition of viral replication. CBD was shown to have inhibitory effects against viral hepatitis C (HBC) but not viral Hepatitis B (HBV). In a dose–response assay, at a single concentration of 10 µm, CBD was able to dose-dependently inhibit HCV replication by 86.4% [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CBD shows in vivo activity through its interaction with the CB2 receptor. This interaction inhibits the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis by inducing the apoptosis of thymocytes and splenocytes. This in turn, inhibits T-cells and macrophages attacking the liver thereby inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [
