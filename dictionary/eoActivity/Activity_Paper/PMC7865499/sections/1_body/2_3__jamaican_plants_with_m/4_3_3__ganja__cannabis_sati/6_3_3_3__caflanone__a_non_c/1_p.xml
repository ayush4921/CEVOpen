<p>Caflanone is a small phytoantiviral flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human coronavirus hCov-OC43 (COVID-19) disease belonging to clade b of the genus Betacoronavirus same as SARS-COV-2 [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In preclinical studies, Caflanone inhibited the hCov-OC43 human Coronavirus with an EC50 of 0.42 ÂµM [

In silico studies show that the Caflanone molecule carries out its prophylactic mechanism of action by inhibiting the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found in the lung and respiratory tract, used by the virus to cause an infection [
