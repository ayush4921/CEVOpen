<p>In Jamaica the fresh calyx of the flower of sorrel is commonly made into a drink and eaten in salads. However, it possesses significant medicinal value and may have applicability as a diuretic, sedative, emollient, demulcent antiscorbutic, analgesic, purgative, antipyretic, cholagogue, antiseptic, anti-tumorigenic, anti-cancer, aphrodisiac, and may be used to treat dyspepsia, disorders of the heart, hypertension, biliary disorders and abscesses [

This bioactivity attributed to sorrel may be attributed to a number of secondary metabolites including saponins, flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, gossypitrin and hibiscetin-3-glucoside, organic acids (e.g., protocatechuic, malic acid, hydroxycitric acid, and hibiscus acid), anthocyanins (e.g., anthocyanidin and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside), glycosides, alkaloids, phenolic acids and phenolic compounds (e.g., Î±-tocopherol) [
