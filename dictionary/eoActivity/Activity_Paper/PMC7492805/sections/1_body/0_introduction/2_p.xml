<p id="p0010">One of the main actions taken by the meat industry to extend the shelf-life and quality of meat and meat products is through the use of meat preservatives (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzo et al., 2018</xref>). These meat preservatives prevent oxidation, enzymae reactions and microbial spoilage, which impair the nutritional value and quality of meat and meat products (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Falowo et al., 2014</xref>). Synthetic antioxidants and antimicrobials have been and continue to be used in the meat industry as preservative agents to reduce economic losses and protect consumer health. However, there has been a serious concern about the use of synthetic preservatives in the food production chain due to the adverse effects on consumers (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, the incorporation of synthetic preservatives in meat and meat products has been reported to cause toxicity and to promote the development of cancer in consumers (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>). However, certain spoilage microbes such as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> are resistant to these conventional synthetic antimicrobials (

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tajkarimi et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the use of such synthetic antimicrobials in the meat production chain has resulted in the emergency of bacterial-resistant strains that render the management and treatment of livestock, poultry and human diseases difficult (
