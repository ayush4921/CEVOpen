<p id="p0145">The study showed that synthetic antioxidants (BHT and rutin) had the greatest antioxidant effect on almost all the assays. The various extracts displayed significant free radical scavenging activity therefore 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> can potentially be used as a natural source of antioxidants. As a result, the significant antioxidant activity demonstrated by 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts could be pointed to the presence of these phytochemicals in the extracts. For example, the ethanol extract had the highest ABTS scavenging potential compared to the other extracts. This may be due to the high phenolic content of the extract, which could have contributed to the electron transfer/hydrogen donation (

The acetone extract showed superior scavenging ability for DPPH and nitric oxide radicals, while the methanol extract had higher total antioxidant capacity. Flavonoids and phenols are known to have antiradical and antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Heim et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, the acetone extract could have scavenged best due to its high phenolic content. In addition, the results indicate that 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts can potentially be used as natural sources of antioxidants due to their high free radical scavenging capabilities.
