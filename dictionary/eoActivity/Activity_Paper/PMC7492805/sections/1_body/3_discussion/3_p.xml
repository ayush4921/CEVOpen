<p id="p0135">The acetone extract of 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> had the highest amounts of total phenolic content and flavonoids while the aqueous extract had the highest amount of condensed tannin content. Such results reveal similar patterns in phenolic and flavonoid content of 
 <italic>Vernonia mespilifolia</italic> acetone and aqueous extracts, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Unuofin et al., 2018</xref>). Polarity and solvent influence the amount of phenolic substances derived from plants. The variations in the extraction ability of solvents may therefore be the cause of the variations in the 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> aqueous and acetone extracts.
