 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abifarin et al. (2019)</xref> was followed to determine the free radical scavenging activity of extracts on DPPH radical. A mixture of 0.135 mM DPPH radical in methanol was made and 1 mL of this mixture was combined with 1 mL (0.005–0.08 mg/mL) of each extract. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Absorbance was then measured at 517 nm. The reduction of the absorbance was recorded against the control. Rutin and BHT were used as standards (0.005–0.08 mg/mL). in the dark for 30 min. Thereafter, absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The reduction in absorbance was recorded against the control. Rutin and BHT were used as standards (0.005–0.08 mg/mL). The scavenging ability of the extracts was determined using the equation:
 <disp-formula id="ufd2">DPPH scavenging activity (%) = [(Absorbance of control – Absorbance of the sample)/(Absorbance of control)] × 100</disp-formula>
