<p id="p0055">The ABTS scavenging activity of the plant extracts was determined as described by 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Unuofin et al. (2018)</xref>. The reaction mixture was made by adding equal volumes of 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate. The mixture was left standing at room temperature in the dark for 12 h to release ABTS radicals. The resulting green-coloured solution was then diluted by adding 3 mL of the ABTS solution to 150 mL of methanol to get an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.005 at 734 nm. Once the required absorbance was obtained, 1 mL of the resulting solution was combined with 1 mL of the plant extracts/or standards at varying concentrations (0.005–0.08 mg/mL). Approximately 7 min later, the decrease in absorbance was measured at 734 nm. The percentage inhibition of ABTS radicals by the extracts or standards was determined using the following equation: ABTS Scavenging activity (%) = [(Absorbance of control – Absorbance of the sample)/(Absorbance of control)] ×100.
