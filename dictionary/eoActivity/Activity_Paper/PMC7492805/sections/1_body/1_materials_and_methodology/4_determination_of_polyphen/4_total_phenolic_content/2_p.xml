<p id="p0050">The total phenolic content of acetone, water, ethanol and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> were determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Unuofin et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, 0.5 mL of the plant extracts (1 mg/mL) and standard gallic acid (0.02–0.1 mg/mL) were pipetted into test tubes. Subsequently, 2.5 mL of 10 % (v/v) Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added and the mixture was vortexed. The vortexed solution was left standing at room temperature for 5 min, followed by an addition of 2 mL of 7.5% (w/v) anhydrous sodium carbonate. The mixture was then incubated for 30 min in a water bath at 40 °C for colour development. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm. The phenolic content was then calculated using the gallic acid calibration curve (y = 27.398x + 0.1099, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.984) and presented as milligram of gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/g) using the equation: C = c × V/m.
