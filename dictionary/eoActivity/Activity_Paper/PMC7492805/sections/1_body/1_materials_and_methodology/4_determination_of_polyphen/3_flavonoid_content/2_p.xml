<p id="p0045">The determination of the flavonoid content was done using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method of 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abifarin et al. (2019)</xref> with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of the different solvent extracts at varying concentrations (0.2–1 mg/mL) were added to the respective test tubes. Subsequently, 2 mL of distilled water and 0.15 mL of 5 % sodium nitrite were added to each of the test tubes and the mixture was left standing for 6 min. The quercetin standard reaction mixtures were similarly prepared. Then 0.15 mL of 10 % AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> was pipetted into the reaction mixture which was then left standing for another 5 min. Then 1 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide was added, followed by the addition of distilled water to make up a 5 mL solution. Absorbance was read at a wavelength of 420 nm. Flavonoid content was determined from the quercetin calibration curve equation: y = 1.1968x + 0.1572, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9856 and presented as milligram of quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) using the equation: C = c × V/m.
