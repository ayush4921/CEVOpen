<p id="p0035">Four samples of 100 g of 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> powder were soaked in 1 L of acetone, distilled water, ethanol and methanol. The resulting mixtures were shaken on an orbital shaker (Stuart Scientific Orbital shaker, UK) for 48 h at room temperature. The crude extracts were then filtered through a pressure filter using the Buchner funnel and Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts were then condensed in a rotary evaporator (Laborator 4000-efficient, Heidolph, Germany), while the aqueous extract was freeze-dried (Vir Tis benchtop K, Vir Tis Co, Gardiner, NY). The extracts were stored at 4 °C in airtight glass bottles.
