 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows that the ABTS scavenging activity of the extracts and standards had an increasing trend as concentrations increased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). At the maximum concentration (0.08 mg/mL), the highest % mean inhibition was produced by rutin, BHT and ethanol extract (100 %) followed by methanol (97.52 %), acetone (96.71 %) and aqueous extract (69.36 %). The concentration required to scavenge 50 % of the radicals (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was in the following order: rutin &gt; BHT &gt; ethanol extract &gt; methanol extract &gt; acetone extract &gt; aqueous extract (
