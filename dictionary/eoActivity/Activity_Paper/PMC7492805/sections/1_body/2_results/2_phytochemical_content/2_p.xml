<p id="p0100">Condensed tannin, flavonoid and total phenolic content in 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The polyphenol content of acetone, aqueous, ethanol and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> were significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The aqueous extract had the most condensed tannin content (99.395 ± 1.490 mg CE/g) while the acetone extract had the lowest (77.339 ± 1.068 mg CE/g). The acetone extract had the highest flavonoid content (53.253 ± 0.638 mg QE/g), while the aqueous extract had the lowest content (3.398 ± 0.241 mg QE/g). Total phenolic content (21.798 ± 0.028 mg GAE/g) was highest in the acetone extract, while the aqueous extract had the lowest total phenolic content (14.109 ± 0.092 mg GAE/g).
