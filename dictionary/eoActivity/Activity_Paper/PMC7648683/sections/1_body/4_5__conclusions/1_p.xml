<p>In this study, two alkaloids, 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine, were isolated from 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic>, and their anticancer activities were evaluated. Promising antiproliferative activity was established for 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine against A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer and MV4-11 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. 6-Hydroxycrinamine and lycorine promote cell cycle arrest in A2780 cells without inducing apoptosis.
