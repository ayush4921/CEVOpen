<p>Due to the promising antiproliferative activity of the 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> bulb extract and in an attempt to identify its active ingredient, we determined the antiproliferative effects of both 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine against the same cancer cell lines. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 6-Hydroxycrinamine is active against A2780 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and MV4-11 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cells. Lycorine showed better activity against both A2780 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and MV4-11 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cells when compared with the bulb extract and 6-hydroxycrinamine (
