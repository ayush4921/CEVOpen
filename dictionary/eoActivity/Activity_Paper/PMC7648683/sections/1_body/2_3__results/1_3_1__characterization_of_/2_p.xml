 <sup>+</sup> in the positive-mode HR-TOF-ESI-MS (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1">Figure S1</xref>), indicating a molecular formula of C
 <sub>17</sub>H
 <sub>19</sub>NO
 <sub>5</sub> for compound 1. A close analysis of the spectral data of compound 1 revealed that its 
 <sup>1</sup>H- (

 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3">S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4">S4</xref>) were identical with those of previously reported for 6-hydroxycrinamine (see in the following), a compound isolated from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Crinum bulbispermum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was also reported to be present in the leaves of 
 <italic>Crinum yemense</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the structure of compound 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was further confirmed by 2D-NMR, particularly by the long-range couplings between C and H observed in HMBC.
