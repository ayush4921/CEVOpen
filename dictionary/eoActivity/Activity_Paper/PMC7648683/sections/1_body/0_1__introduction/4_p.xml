<p>Ethiopia, like many other developing countries, heavily relies on the therapeutic benefits of traditional medicine to treat diseases [

 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> bulb powder mixed with hyena feces is applied topically for the treatment of cancer, locally called “neqersa,” in Dek Island in Lake Tana, Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ovarian cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death among women in Ethiopia, with about 2,550 diagnosed cases and 2,000 deaths each year, while leukemia is the leading cancer incident (2,274, 10.7% of new cancer cases) in Ethiopia among men of all ages in 2018 [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, in the present study, we used A2780 and MV4-11 cells to examine the antiproliferative potential of the 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> bulb extract and its two alkaloids, 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine. In addition, we explored the anticancer mechanisms of 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine by using the flow cytometer. To the best of our knowledge, no prior chemical and biological investigation has been reported on
