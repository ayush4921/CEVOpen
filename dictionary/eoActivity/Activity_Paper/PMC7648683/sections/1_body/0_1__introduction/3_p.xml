<p>Natural products have been a rich source of medicine [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The huge structural diversity of natural compounds and their potential bioactivity have meant that several compounds isolated from natural sources can serve as “lead” compounds. For instance, approximately 75% of anticancer agents marketed from 1981 to 2006 were obtained or semisynthesized from plants [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Anticancer drugs such as vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel, as well as semisynthetic agents including docetaxel, camptothecin, topotecan, and irinotecan, are isolated from plants and microbes [

 <italic>Crinum</italic> belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and comprises approximately 130 species throughout the tropics and warm temperate regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Indeed, over 500 different kinds of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) have been found in the family Amaryllidaceae [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several alkaloids of the Amaryllidaceae type present in 
 <italic>Crinum</italic> species are reported to exert antitumor, immunostimulating, analgesic, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects [
