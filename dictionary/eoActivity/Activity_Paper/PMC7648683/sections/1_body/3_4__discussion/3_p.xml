<p>6-Hydroxycrinamine was also reported to be cytotoxic against human pancreatic (PANC1, IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cancer cells [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and HPV-negative cervical carcinoma C33a (IC50 = 18.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cells as well as induced apoptosis without causing DNA damage [
