<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the genus 
 <italic>Crinum</italic> belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family continue to yield alkaloids having interesting biological activities [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, galanthamine is used for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], crinine and 6‐ethoxybuphandrine exhibited anticancer effect [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and cripowellin A, B, C, and D have antiplasmodial activity [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine have been found in the bulb extract of 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic>, a plant which is important in Ethiopian traditional medicine [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is noted that lycorine showed better activity against both A2780 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and MV4-11 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cells when compared with the bulb extract (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, MV4-11, and GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, A2780) and 6-hydroxycrinamine (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, A2780, and GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, MV4-11) cells.
