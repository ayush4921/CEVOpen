<p>Cell cycle analysis and annexin V/propidium iodide double staining in A2780 cells revealed that both compounds increased the percentage of cells in the S-phase at 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml without inducing apoptosis. The observed cell cycle effects of both compounds are similar to the effects of cisplatin on A2780 cells [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A2780 cells exposed to cisplatin accumulated in the G2/M-phase at 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 0.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml drug concentrations. Concomitant decreases in S- and G1-phase populations were also observed, but higher concentrations increased the relative distribution of cells in the S-phase. These events in the S- and G2/M-phase were associated with checkpoint kinases (chk1 and chk2)activation, and resultant phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of cell division cycle 25 A (Cdc25 A). Both 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine did not induce apoptosis. Thus, it is possible that other mechanisms could be involved in the antiproliferative effect of the compounds. In some drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines such as Hey1B, antiproliferative activity was associated with induction of cytostatic effects through increasing rigidity of the actin cytoskeleton [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, we were unable to determine the effect of the compounds on nonmalignant cells due to their unavailability in our laboratory at the time of the study. We therefore strongly recommend further studies aiming at determining the selectivity index of 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine.
