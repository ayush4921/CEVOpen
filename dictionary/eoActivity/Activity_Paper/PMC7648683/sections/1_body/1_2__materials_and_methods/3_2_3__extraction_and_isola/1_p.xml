<p>Dried powdered bulbs of 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> (200 g) were macerated in 80% methanol (3 × 2 L, 72 h each). Then, the solution was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure using a rota evaporator, and finally dried by a freeze drier to yield 16.3 g extract. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to select a solvent system with a better resolution of the constituents of the crude drug as well as to monitor the purity of the isolated compounds. Consequently, from series of solvent systems, butanol : acetic acid : water (4 : 1 : 5) was selected as a mobile phase. The solvent was prepared by dissolving butanol, water, and then adding acetic acid. Because the solvent forms two phases, the upper layer was taken and used as a solvent system for the chromatographic separation. The extract was initially dissolved in methanol and directly applied to PTLC plates over silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> plates (aluminium plate, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and the separation was achieved using a mobile phase used for analytical chromatography. After the development, the bands were visualized under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. Two bands named BCA-1 and BCA-2 were separately scrapped off and washed with a mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol (1 : 1), filtered, and concentrated to offer two alkaloids (
