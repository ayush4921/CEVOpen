<p>Resazurin assay was done on MV4-11 cell lines as described previously [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In short, cells were seeded at 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well into 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Tested samples were diluted from 10 mM stock solution to prepare a threefold dilution series in 100 mL of the cell medium, added to cells (in duplicates), and incubated at the corresponding time point at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Resazurin was made up as a stock of 0.1 mg/mL in the cell medium, and the solution was filter-sterilized. The resazurin solution was then added at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well and incubated in the dark at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, for 4 h. The plate was left at room temperature for 10–15 min, and absorbance was measured at 585 nm using an EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK). The concentration of the bulb extract of 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> and isolated compounds required to inhibit 50% of cell growth (GI
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis.
