<p>Apoptotic induction test was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cells were seeded at 8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well using a 6-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After treatment with each compound, the cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were transferred to FACS tubes and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Cell pellets were collected and resuspended in 1 mL of warm PBS and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Supernatant PBS was removed, and cell pellets were diluted to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL with warm PBS and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Supernatant PBS was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Supernatant PBS was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1 × binding buffer. Then, 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of annexin V and 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of propidium iodide were added to each sample with slight vortexing, and cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min. After incubation, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1 × binding buffer was added to each sample and analyzed by the Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using Kaluza v1.2 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
