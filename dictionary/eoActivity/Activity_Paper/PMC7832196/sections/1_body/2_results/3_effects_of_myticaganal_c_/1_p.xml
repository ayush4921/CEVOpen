<p>An investigation of the mortality rates and the response patterns of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> when treated with 0.5 MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC of ampicillin combined with myticaganal C for 12 h involved the identification of four populations [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The synergy of ampicillin with myticaganal C was observed to be dose dependent, with 12 h of incubation, as the rates of dead cells when treated at 0.5 MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC of the synergistic plantâ€“antibiotic mix were 2.4%, 4.7%, and 9.3%, respectively [
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. The response pattern of the bacterial cells to ampicillin with myticaganal C inhibited 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> by both cell membrane damage and granularity disruption.
