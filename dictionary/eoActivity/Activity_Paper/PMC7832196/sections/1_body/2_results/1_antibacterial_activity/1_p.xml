<p>The antibacterial activity of ampicillin (3.125 and 50 μg/well) and myticaganal C (125–4000 μg/well) singly and synergy of these substances against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 were evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth around the hole. The results showed that ampicillin had significant activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with 27.33 ± 0.58 mm inhibition zone. However, the tested organisms did not show any zone of inhibition with any tested concentration of myticaganal C singly. Interestingly, the growth of tested organisms was significantly inhibited synergistically with high inhibition by 50 μg/well of ampicillin combined with any tested concentration of myticaganal C, giving 31.67 ± 0.58 mm inhibition zone [
