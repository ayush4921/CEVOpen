<p>In experiments, ampicillin combined with myticaganal C showed a good inhibition zone against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, better than myticaganal C or ampicillin alone. Dihydrobenzofuran neolignans are secondary metabolites in a plant extract such that they have bioactive activities.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the other hand, antibacterial action of dihydrobenzofuran neolignans against an agent panel of cariogenic bacteria has been reported by Fukui 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Ampicillin is a β-lactam antibiotic that inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis of bacteria.[
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Then, the bacterial cell wall becomes mechanically weak and the cell dies.[
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] After cell wall disruption, lipophilicity of the dihydrobenzofuran neolignans might allow these compounds to diffuse across the cell membrane.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] After passing the cell membrane, the compound could affect bacterial metabolism and organelles causing death to the bacteria. The MIC of ampicillin combined with myticaganal C indicates that myticaganal C reduced the MIC of ampicillin 128-fold to 0.097 μg/mL from the 12.5 μg/mL MIC of ampicillin alone. These results resemble those obtained by Navrátilová 
 <italic>et al</italic>.,[
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who reported on efficacy of a medicinal plant that can increase the antibacterial activity of antibiotics. Similarly, trihydroxyflavone from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> could increase the activity of tetracycline against Gram-negative bacteria.[
