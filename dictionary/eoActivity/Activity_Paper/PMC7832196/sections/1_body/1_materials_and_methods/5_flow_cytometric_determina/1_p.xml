<p>The final concentrations that corresponded to 0.5 MIC (0.049 μg/mL of ampicillin: 8000 μg/mL of myticaganal C), MIC (0.098 μg/mL of ampicillin: 8000 μg/mL of myticaganal C), and 2 MIC (0.196 μg/mL of ampicillin: 8000 μg/mL of myticaganal C) were added to wells containing 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and incubated at 37°C for 0–24 h. After incubation, the cells were washed and re-suspended in 950 μL of phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then incubated with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide in the dark for 15 min. The samples were analyzed on BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The populations of each sample were analyzed on density plot diagrams generated by WinMDI version 2.9 software (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA).
