<p>Two-fold serial dilutions of myticaganal C and ampicillin were performed, until reducing concentration of each substance 128-fold. Columns 1–8 and rows A–H were used to test mixtures of myticaganal C (62.5–8000 μg/mL) and ampicillin (0.0975–12.5 μg/mL), respectively. Columns 9A–9H were used for ampicillin alone (1.56–200 μg/mL). Columns 10A–10H were used to test myticaganal C alone (62.5–8000 μg/mL). 50 μL of bacterial solution was added into each well. Then, the final volume was 190 μL. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C before adding 0.015% resazurin. The plate was then determined for color changes, as described above.</p>
