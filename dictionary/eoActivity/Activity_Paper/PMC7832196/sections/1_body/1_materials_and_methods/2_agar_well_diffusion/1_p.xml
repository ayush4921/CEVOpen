<p>Briefly, the antibacterial activity was tested on Mueller–Hinton agar by agar well diffusion method. After the culture of 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL concentration of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> suspension was swabbed on the plates, wells (6 mm diameter) were punched in each plate using a cork borer. Then, each well was filled with 50 μL of myticaganal C (125–4000 μg/well), or ampicillin (3.125 and 50 μg/well), or mixture of myticaganal C (125–4000 μg/well) with ampicillin (3.125 and 50 μg/well). Inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The antibacterial activity is expressed as mean of the growth inhibition zone in millimeters.
