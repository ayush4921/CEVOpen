<p>It is widely known that active free radicals are produced by normal metabolism which cause oxidative damage to biomacromolecules, which include carbohydrates, membrane lipids, proteins, and DNA [

To lower the oxidative damage of active free radicals, many unnatural antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), with strong antioxidant activity are proverbially applied in food industry. However, recurrent discovery of potential detrimental effects, such as carcinogenesis and liver damage, by using synthetic antioxidants [

In addition, epidemiological studies have also indicated positively associated between the uptake of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants (e.g., phenolic compounds) and diseases prevention, such as aging, atheroscelerosis, and also cancer [
