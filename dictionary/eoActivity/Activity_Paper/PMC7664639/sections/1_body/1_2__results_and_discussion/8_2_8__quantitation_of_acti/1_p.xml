<p>The HPLC chromatograms of each solvent extract and standard solution of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> in normal- and reverse-phase are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05198">Figures S1‒S8</xref>. The concentrations of three active compounds in each solvent extract is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05198-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Total quantities of three active compounds in each extract was ranged from a maximum of 51.43 ± 1.18 mg/g (methanol extract) to a minimum of 15.52 ± 0.26 mg/g (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract) in succeeding order of methanol &gt; ethanol &gt; acetone &gt; ethyl acetate &gt; chloroform &gt; dichloromethane &gt; 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract. Methanol (51.43 ± 1.18 mg/g), and ethanol (42.80 ± 1.17 mg/g) extracts exhibited higher amounts of phenolic compounds compared with other extracts. Furthermore, methanol extract showed approximately two times the quantity of phenolic compounds compared with acetone and ethyl acetate. Malabaricone C was the most abundant among the three phenolic compounds in organic solvent extract, followed by dehydrodiisoeugenol and malabaricone B.
