<p>We investigated the TPC and yields in different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic>. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05198-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows TPC and extraction yields of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and ethanol extracts from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic>. The yields of different solvent extracts from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were ranged from 15.6 ± 1.21% (ethanol extract) to 30.7 ± 1.49% (dichloromethane extract). The dichloromethane extract exhibited the highest yield among all extracts possibly due to its abundant amounts of low polar components. Significant differences were found in TPC among all different solvent extracts, of which methanol extract contained highest amount of TPC (107.83 ± 0.66 mg/g), followed by ethanol (98.01 ± 2.99 mg/g), acetone (70.07 ± 2.28 mg/g), ethyl acetate (32.93 ± 0.85 mg/g), dichloromethane (18.97 ± 1.22 mg/g), chloroform (18.65 ± 0.53 mg/g), and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (16.82 ± 0.62 mg/g). The higher polar methanol and ethanol extracts have the higher yield of TPC due to enriching with phenolic constituents. The low polarity solvent extracts, such as 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and dichloromethane, showed less amount of TPC regardless of their high extraction yields. Extracts of methanol and ethanol showed approximately five to six times the amount of TPC in those using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane, and chloroform. These results suggested that suitable relative polarity of extracting solvents for TPC from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> would be ranged from 0.654 to 0.762.
