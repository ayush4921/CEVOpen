<p>Natural products which possess anti-α-glucosidase activity have received great attention because of their potential use in treating diabetes. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05198-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05198-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> exhibited the most anti-α-glucosidase activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 4.08 ± 0.12 μg/mL), followed by ethanol (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 11.92 ± 0.39 μg/mL), acetone (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 29.07 ± 2.30 μg/mL), ethyl acetate (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 185.36 ± 5.21 μg/mL), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, &gt;200 μg/mL), chloroform (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, &gt;200 μg/mL), and dichloromethane (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, &gt;200 μg/mL). The solvents extracted by methanol and ethanol were more effective than the positive control, quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 14.99 ± 0.81 μg/mL). Among all solvent extracts, methanol extract showed the strongest anti-α-glucosidase activity. These results showed that higher polar solvent extracts of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> possessed stronger α-glucosidase inhibitory effect.
