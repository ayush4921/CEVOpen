<p>With the isolated malabaricone B, malabaricone C, and dehydrodiisoeugenol, we measured antioxidant activities, such as ABTS, DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide radical scavenging activities. Results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05198-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, where malabaricone C (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 8.35 ± 2.20 μg/mL) exhibited the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity, followed by dehydrodiisoeugenol (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 66.02 ± 2.85 μg/mL) and malabaricone B (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, &gt;200 μg/mL). While all of three compounds showed high ABTS radical scavenging activities, dehydrodiisoeugenol exhibited relatively high hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. However, all of three compounds showed no significant effect on superoxide radical scavenging activity. Based on the above result, it could be inferred that the methanol extract contained the largest amount of major phenolic compounds among all extracts and thus possessed the strongest antioxidant activity.
