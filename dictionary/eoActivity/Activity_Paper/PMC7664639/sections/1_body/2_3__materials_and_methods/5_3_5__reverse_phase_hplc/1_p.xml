<p>Reversed-phase separations were performed using a Hypersil octadecyl silica (ODS) column (5 μm; column of dimensions 4.6 × 250 mm) purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). HPLC-photodiode array (PDA) detector chromatographic fingerprints were obtained with an Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC instrument equipped with a 1260 Infinity II quaternary pump, a 1260 Infinity II degasser, a 1260 Infinity II vialsampler, a 1260 Infinity II column thermostat, a 1260 Infinity II diode array detector HS, and a PC with the Agilent Chemstation software, all of them from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany). Gradient separation using 0.1% formic acid in water (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) (solvent A) and isopropyl alcohol (solvent B) as mobile phase was as follows: 0–20 min, linear gradient from 30 to 40% B; 20–25 min, 40% B with isocratic elution; 25–45 min, linear gradient from 40 to 50% B; 45–50 min, 50% B with isocratic elution; 50–55 min, linear gradient from 50 to 98% B; 55-58 min, 98% B with isocratic elution; 58–60 min, back to initial conditions at 30% B; and 60–65 min, at 30% B. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the injection volume was 15 μL. Peaks were detected at 270 nm. Different compounds were identified by retention time. To guarantee peak purity, DAD acquisition from 200–650 nm was conducted to register UV-spectra. For the quantitative analysis of three compounds in the extracts, aliquots of samples were dispersed in 10 mL of an isopropyl alcohol/water (60/40, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) solution by sonication for 5 min. Then, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm, and the supernatant extracts were filtered through 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filters (Zhejiang Sorfa Medical Plastic Co., Ningbo, China). Quantification of three components from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> in each solvent extract was as described above.
