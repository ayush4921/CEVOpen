<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were collected from Wanhua Dist., Taipei City, Taiwan, in May 2020 and identified by Prof. J.-J. Chen. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Faculty of Pharmacy, National YangMing University, Taipei, Taiwan. Samples were collected, air-dried, and ground to powder. Two hundred microliters of various solvents (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, and methanol) were added into 30 g of powder and incubated with shaking by orbital shakers for 24 h at 25 °C. The extracts were filtered through filter paper (Whatman No. 1) and concentrated under reduced pressure at 39 °C. All the extracts were stored at −20 °C until further use.
