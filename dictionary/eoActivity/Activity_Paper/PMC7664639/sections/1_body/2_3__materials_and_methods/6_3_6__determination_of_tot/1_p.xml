<p>Total phenolic contents (TPCs) of different extracts were determined with slight modification of Folin-Ciocalteau’s method [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, 50 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (0.5 N, dilute with deionized water) and 50 μL of each extract were mixed in a 96-well microplate and incubate for 5 min. Then, 100 μL of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added. The mixture was incubated for 45 min in the dark place at room temperature before measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 750 nm after centrifugation for 8 min (1600×
