<p>ABTS radical scavenging activity of each extract was measured as described earlier with slightly changes [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, ABTS solution was prepared by mixing 14 mM ABTS solution and 4.8 mM potassium persulfate (final concentration, 1/1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and leaving the mixture in the dark for about 16 h at room temperature. Ethanol was used to dilute the working solution for the absorbance to reach 0.700 ± 0.02 at 740 nm for measurements. Ten microliters of different concentrations of extract were added to 190 μL of ABTS solution. After reacting at room temperature for 6 min, the antioxidative activity of mixture was determined by calculating the decrease in absorbance measured at 732 nm by the following equation.
