<p>Various solvent extracts of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were investigated with various antioxidant systems and anti-α-glucosidase activity assay. TPC in the extracts of methanol and ethanol showed approximately five to six times the amount of TPC in those using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichoroform, and chloroform, proving that suitable relative polarity of extracting solvents for TPC from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> would be ranged from 0.654 to 0.762. In our study, methanol, ethanol, and acetone extracts exhibited strong DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl scavenging activities, which may be aligned with TPC in the extracts. Methanol extract also possessed the highest antioxidant activity among all the other solvent extracts. Furthermore, methanol extracts also showed strong anti-α-glucosidase activity. The bioactivity assays demonstrated that dehydrodiisoeugenol, malabaricone B, and malabaricone C displayed antioxidant activities, and malabaricone C showed strong anti-α-glucosidase effect.
