In this study 50 (less than adequate), 100 (moderate), and 150 (adequate) mM N were provided from each fertilizer types. Slow release fertilizer used in this study, was invited based on a novel composition at science and technology center of Hamedan province, Iran and registered at Iranian Patent Office, Tehran on Jan. 30, 2017 (patent number 139550140003013815). Details of the novel N fertilizer and its Figure were shown in Table
