<p id="Par8">The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse complex at Urmia University, West of Azarbaijan Province, Iran. Seeds of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> obtained from Pakan Bazr Esfahan, an Iranian private joint stock company, on April. 15, 2019. The seeds were put into a mixture of perlite and peat moss substrates for initial growth. Irrigation operation was performed regularly as needed depending on greenhouse condition. Seedlings were harvested after one month when they were at 3–4 true leaves stage and transplanted in the experimental pots which had one plant grown in a pot (2.5 L) containing a mixture of soil (2-mm sieved) and fine sand for better aeration and leaching, under greenhouse conditions. The density of production system was chosen according to Waidyanatha et al. (2020). The set point for the greenhouse temperature and humidity were 19–21 °C (night–day) and 75% respectively. Fertigation was performed based on 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> nutrition need, shown in Table
