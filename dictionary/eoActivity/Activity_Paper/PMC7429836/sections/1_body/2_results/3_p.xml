<p id="Par26">The results relevant that the different heavy metals content varied depending on the element and fertilizer type. Among heavy metals, Zn had the highest content (maximum 3.1 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>), whereas Cd showed the lowest (maximum 0.21 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) in two types of N fertilizers. The results were in accordance with previous studies

Among these heavy metals, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Fe are considered as nutritionally essential elements, Ni is classified as an element with possible beneficial health effects
