<p id="Par5">Overall, good manufacturing of high quality medicinal plants is depend on precise aware of plant nutrient requirement. The study in Hungary demonstrated that application of 60–80 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup> N, 40–60 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup> phosphorus (P) and 80–100 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup> potassium (K
 <sup>+</sup>) lead to increase of biological yield and phenolic compounds of

 </sup>. The optimum nutrients ratio for plant growth depends on species and environmental conditions

 </sup> and soil pollution with chemical pollutants such as various heavy metals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Several studies demonstrated that soil heavy metals pollution caused to decrease of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> yield under greenhouse condition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Among all nutrients, N, due to cooperation in phytochemical compound’s structures had very critical effect on 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic> yield and medicinal properties

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. So, attention to N supply has key role in chemical and medicinal composition of 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic>. Previous researches illustrated that the various plant growth parameters of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> are generally improved with optimum mixture ratio of NO

 <sup>−</sup> and ammonium (NH

 </sup>. The NO

 <sup>−</sup> dosage can affect not only rhizomata cum radicibus morphological properties, but also the overall rhizomata cum radicibus biomass

 </sup>. The results of Verma et al. (2019) showed that phenolic compounds (caftaric acid, cholorogenic acid, cynarin, echinacoside and chicoric acid) were significantly affected by NO
