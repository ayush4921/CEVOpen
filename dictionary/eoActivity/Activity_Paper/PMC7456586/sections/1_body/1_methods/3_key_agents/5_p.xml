<p id="para0021">With regard to the key agents that are not part of the regional scope, the regulatory agencies stand out. In our case thes most important agencies are the Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) (i.e., the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products) and the Organización Nacional de Trasplantes (i.e., the National Transplant Organisation of Spain). Providing important support for a plan of these characteristics are the scientific societies that bring together, at an international level, researchers working on the generation of scientific evidence related to cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine. Patient associations, especially at the national level, are a fundamental and essential ally in reaching the plan's ultimate target. Given that the plan was created with the ambition of serving as a spearhead for an initiative that could extend beyond Andalusia's geographical boundaries, the transplant coordination understands that certain technical commissions of experts linked to the national health system represent another key agent.</p>
