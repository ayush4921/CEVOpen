<p id="para0028">The expectations generated over the last two decades in the field of stem cell research in particular and the field of regenerative medicine in general as well as the time involved in developing medicines, especially in this area, particularly complex from a scientific, technical and regulatory point of view, together with the growing introduction to the market of devices that allow point-of-care treatments through the rapid isolation of cellular or plasma products from patients in the operating theater, represent the perfect breeding ground for the spread of these types of therapies around the world

Frequently, unproven or unregulated therapies are offered, which means that patients are subjected, often unbeknownst to them, to interventions without necessary guarantees of quality, safety and effectiveness, underestimating the risks these therapies represent to their health
