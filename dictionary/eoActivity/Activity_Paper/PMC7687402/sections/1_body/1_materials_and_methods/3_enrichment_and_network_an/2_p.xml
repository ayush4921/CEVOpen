<p id="p0030">The list of probable targets was queried in the STRING [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] database, and enrichment analysis of protein–protein interaction was performed for biological process, molecular function, and cellular components. Further, the probably modulated pathways were also identified concerning the KEGG pathway database. Cytoscape [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was used to construct the network among the plants, their phytoconstituents, modulated proteins, and regulated pathways. The network was treated as directed, node size as “
 <italic>low values to small sizes</italic>” and map node color from “
 <italic>low values to bright colors</italic>” and the whole network was analyzed based on edge count.
