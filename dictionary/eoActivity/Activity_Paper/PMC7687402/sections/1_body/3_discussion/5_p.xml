<p id="p0070">The present study also attempted to identify the lead hit molecules with positive druglikeness scores which could be responsible to boost immunity. The druglikeness score was assessed using Lipinski’s Rule of Five which evaluates any synthetic or semi-synthetic organic molecule or any secondary metabolite from a medicinal plant to act like a drug for oral bioavailability based on its molecular weight, a number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, and lipophilicity [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The 20 lead hits i.e. cinnamtannin A2, B1, and D1, cassiatannin A, parameritannin A-1, procyanidin B1, and B2, zhankuic acid B, C, A methyl ester, camphoratin A, B, C, D, E, F, and J, antcin A and C, and methyl 4-α-methylergost-8,24 (28)-diene-3,11-dion-26-oate showing positive druglikeness score were also evaluated for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity probabilities in which cinnamtannin A2, B1, D1, and procyanidin B1 and B2 were predicted for high hepatotoxicity. Similarly, the above molecules were also predicted as hERG inhibitors and ames toxic. However, these predictions were based on the comparison of 20 best hits of positive druglikeness bioactives and further confirmations are to be made using suitable wet-lab experiments to confirm these findings.
