<p id="p0020">Based on the Ayurvedic and scientific literature, the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy), India issued an advisory where it recommended the use of 
 <italic>Kadha</italic> (herbal tea/decoction) composed of 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> (Tulsi), 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> (Dalchini), 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> (Kalimirch), 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (Shunthi) and 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (Munakka) for self-care which will develop immunity against severe infection caused by COVID-19. Further, it also recommended the consumption of golden milk; a half teaspoon of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> (turmeric) powder in 150Â ml hot milk once or twice a day [

Hence, in the present study, we proposed to elucidate the probable interaction of the phytoconstituents from individual ingredients of the AYUSH recommended formulation to boost the immunity by gene-set enrichment and network pharmacology approach to support with scientific shreds of evidence.
