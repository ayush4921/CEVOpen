<p id="p0050">Among 221 phytoconstituents, eighty compounds were predicted to possess a positive druglikeness score in which camphoratin D from 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> scored the highest druglikeness score i.e. 1.18 (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3</xref>). Among the 20 best hits from the list of phytoconstituents, all the compounds were predicted to get absorbed from the human intestinal tract. Among them, camphoratin B was predicted to have the highest oral bioavailability and was also predicted for the least toxicity profile like eye irritation, Ames mutagenesis, human either-a-go-go inhibition, and hepatotoxicity compared to the rest of the compounds (
