<p id="p0045">Gene set enrichment analysis identified eighty different pathways to be modulated by the bioactives from the herbal tea and golden tea in which pathways in cancer was majorly regulated with the lowest false discovery rate (5.37E-10) by modulating 17 genes i.e. AR, CASP8, CDK4, CTNNB1, ESR2, HMOX1, HSP90AB1, ITGA6, KLK3, MDM2, MMP2, NFE2L2, NOS2, NQO1, RAC1, RARA, and RHOA. Phytoconstituents were also identified to regulate the proteins which were involved in multiple pathogeneses (infectious and non-infectious diseases) including immunology (

Likewise, GO analysis identified the 29 proteins to be modulated from extracellular region i.e. ADIPOQ, AKR1B10, ALDOA, CAT, CCL2, CD14, CD86, CLU, ESR2, FLT1, FTL, GH1, HBA1, HMOX1, HSP90AB1, HSPA6, ITGA6, KLK2, KLK3, KRT1, MMP2, MMP7, NPPB, PLA2G6, PLAT, PLAU, TIMP1, TIMP2, and TNFRSF1A with the lowest false discovery rate (6.21E-07). Further, protein binding and response to the organic substance were identified as the primary regulated molecular function and biological processes respectively. Similarly, the protein–protein interaction of each modulated protein and hit GO analysis are represented in
