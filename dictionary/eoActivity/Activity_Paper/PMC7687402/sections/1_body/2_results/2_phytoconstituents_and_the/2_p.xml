 <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic>, 91 from 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic>, 40 from 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic>, and 20 from 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> in which 173 compounds were identified to modulate the proteins at Pa&gt;0.7. Among them, (−)-(3S)-1-(3,4-hydroxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptan-3-ol was predicted to have the highest interaction with multiple proteins i.e. 18. Likewise, MMP2 was predicted to be a majorly targeted protein by 58 phytoconstituents. The list of phytoconstituents and the source of each compound are summarized in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary S1</xref>. By these 173 phytoconstituents, a total of 524 interactions were made with multiple proteins. The complete interaction of the multiple phytoconstituents with their targets and regulated pathways is represented in
