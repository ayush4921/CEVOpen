Due to the complex composition of multiple phytoconstituents from all these medicinal plants, the mixture of this combination could modulate multiple proteins and would help to boost immunity which can be explained via network pharmacology and gene-set enrichment analysis. Network pharmacology and gene set enrichment analysis are well-accepted approaches to identify the disease target, lead hit molecules and modulated pathways via &#x0201c;<italic>multiple component-protein interactions</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>].</p><p id="p0060">Boosting immunity involves the modulation of multiple proteins that are involved in the homeostatic regulation. In the present study, the modulation of multiple pathways that are related to infectious/non-infectious diseases and the immune system are identified. A subject suffering from infectious/non-infectious diseases with compromised immune response [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; are at higher risk to be affected by COVID-19. Hence, the combined action of herbal tea and golden milk which has been recommended by the AYUSH is not limited over the boosting of the immunity but also may modulate other pathways which are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases provides beneficial effect to the patients with diabetes and hypertension.</p><p id="p0065">Enrichment analysis of modulated proteins identified the regulation of HIF-1, p53, PI3K-AKT, MAPK, cAMP, Ras, Wnt, NF-kB, IL-17, TNF, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway which are directly involved to boost immunity. The task of HIF-1&#x003b1; has been reported to be dysregulated in viral infection which is involved to boost the immunity by regulating the task of macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes during the hypoxic condition [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; primarily occurs in COVID-19 infection due to improper exchange of O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> in lungs [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, we identified five genes i.e. ALDOA, FLT1, HMOX1, NOS2, and TIMP1 to be modulated related to this pathway. Further, PI3K-AKT functions as a rheostat in orchestrating the differentiation of memory CD8 T cells [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which further regulate the functioning of multiple chemokines and cytokines [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] from multiple pathways like NF-k B, IL-17, and TNF signaling pathway which were found to be modulated in the present study. Hence, the next approach to boost the immunity by suggested <italic>Kadha</italic> could occur via regulation of PI3K-AKT, NF-k&#x003b2;, interleukin, and TNF mediated cytokine regulation. Further, in infectious diseases including viral infection MAPK pathway gets targeted by pathogens. Since this pathway is involved in the synthesis of immunomodulatory cytokines like interleukins and TNF-&#x003b1; via the activation of p38 MAPK pathways, modulation of this pathway could play important coordination with an immune response via the promotion of Th1 and Th2 against extracellular infectious agents [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, the modulation of six proteins i.e. CD14, FLT1, HSPA6, RAC1, RAP1A, TNFRSF1A indicates the regulation of the MAPK pathways. Further, in COVID-19 there is an increase in cell apoptosis and necrosis in lung tissue. As the phytoconstituents were also predicted to modulate the Ras signaling pathway, the suggested herbal tea could also function in multiple cellular tasks including the regulation of cell survival and proliferation [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, we also identified the multiple pathways (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>) which get modulated in the pathogenesis of multiple infectious (bacterial/viral) and non-infectious diseases (diabetes, obesity, hypertension, etc) in which the immune system is compromised. Hence, the intake of this tea would also add a beneficial effect to maintain daily lifestyle and also improve the immunity system. The main ingredient of golden milk i.e. <italic>C.&#x000a0;longa</italic> constitutes curcuminoids as an active biomarker that has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, tulsi (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>) is also reported for its detoxifying property and protection against infections which would help to clear the body from dead tissue after viral infection. Additionally, it is also reported to possess the anti-viral, anti-inflammatory property which would also help in healing the infected tissues in the lungs [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Likewise, other ingredients of herbal tea i.e. <italic>C.&#x000a0;verum</italic> [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], <italic>P.&#x000a0;nigrum</italic> (composes the piperamides) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], <italic>Z.&#x000a0;officinale</italic> [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and <italic>V.&#x000a0;vinifera</italic> [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] are also reported for their potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory property. Since COVID-19 is associated with viral infection and inflammation of lung tissues, the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of the above medicinal plants may add a beneficial effect against COVID-19.</p><p id="p0070">The present study also attempted to identify the lead hit molecules with positive druglikeness scores which could be responsible to boost immunity. The druglikeness score was assessed using Lipinski&#x02019;s Rule of Five which evaluates any synthetic or semi-synthetic organic molecule or any secondary metabolite from a medicinal plant to act like a drug for oral bioavailability based on its molecular weight, a number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, and lipophilicity [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The 20 lead hits i.e. cinnamtannin A2, B1, and D1, cassiatannin A, parameritannin A-1, procyanidin B1, and B2, zhankuic acid B, C, A methyl ester, camphoratin A, B, C, D, E, F, and J, antcin A and C, and methyl 4-&#x003b1;-methylergost-8,24 (28)-diene-3,11-dion-26-oate showing positive druglikeness score were also evaluated for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity probabilities in which cinnamtannin A2, B1, D1, and procyanidin B1 and B2 were predicted for high hepatotoxicity. Similarly, the above molecules were also predicted as hERG inhibitors and ames toxic. However, these predictions were based on the comparison of 20 best hits of positive druglikeness bioactives and further confirmations are to be made using suitable wet-lab experiments to confirm these findings.</p><p id="p0075">Since the Ministry of AYUSH suggested the oral intake of the herbal tea and golden milk, we attempted to identify the probable lead hits to get absorbed from the human intestinal tract in which the majority of the compounds were predicted to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Based on the Rule of Five, we identified camphoratin D to possess the highest drug-likeness score with the molecular weight of 486.30, 6 hydrogen bond acceptors, 3 hydrogen bond donors, and 3.47 MolLogP; upregulated vitamin D3 receptor. Similarly, camphoratin B was predicted to have the highest human oral bioavailability. However, the single-molecule may not be as effective compared to the advised herbal tea as the amount required to boost the immunity may not be sufficient enough. Hence, intake of the multiple compounds in the form of herbal tea as suggested by AYUSH could be more beneficial rather than a single molecule for boosting the immune system as a prophylactic against COVID-19. Additionally, AYUSH has recommended utilizing the herbal tea in which only hydrophilic compounds may get solubilized. However, in the present study, we identified the combined interactions of all the hydrophilic and hydrophobic bioactives (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig S3</xref>; MolLogP value) suggested in this process. Hence, the study suggests identifying if all the bioactives are extracted in the herbal tea or not via appropriate analytical techniques. However, this process is not required in golden milk as the whole powder is dissolved in the milk to drink. As the present study is a preliminary in-silico study, it is very difficult to predict the exact nature of phytoconstituents. Further, more elaborative biologically guided fractionation and identification of the major bioactives and validation by suitable <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> studies are required to confirm the findings which are the future scope of the study. One of the major limitations of the present study is neither <italic>in-vitro</italic> nor <italic>in-vivo</italic> experimental data are provided to confirm immune-modulatory and anti-viral activities. Further, one caveat of this study could be that we did not measure the anti-covid potential of these formulations in experimental studies to validate the findings from above <italic>in-silico</italic> investigations.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0080">The present study evaluated the immunomodulatory effect of the AYUSH recommended <italic>Kadha</italic> (herbal tea) and golden tea simultaneously which could act as a prophylactic against COVID-19.
