<p>In Kenya, the following two varieties are recognized: (1) 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>viscosa,</italic> a thick bush/shrub that grows to 3–4 m with a fruit capsule that is usually white or brown with two large wings and bisexual flowers. The leaves are somewhat larger than 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. This variant is referred to locally as Mkaa pwani (Swahili) and is more confined to the coastal parts of Kenya. (2) 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic> (L.f.) Benth. is a shrub or small tree 1–6 m with pinkish or reddish, two to three winged fruits, and unisexual yellow-green flowers, with a much wider distribution, occurring inland in Kenya [

Because the latter is found in many different parts of Kenya, it has many different common names and it is known in local languages as Hidesa (Boran), Kithongoi/Muthongoi (Kamba), Murema muthua (Kikuyu), Muendu (Luhya), Oking’ (Luo), Olgeturai/Oltuyesi (Maasai), Tobolokwo (Pokot), Tombolokwa (Sabaot), Msidu (Taita), and Tabilikuet (Tugen) [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The wide distribution in Kenya has led to distinctive populations being classified as separate species [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a practice that has further compounded the taxonomy of this taxon. In Kenya, scientific studies have mainly focused on the phytochemistry of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite numerous studies that have provided insights into the pharmacological potential of the plant, no chemical data or biomarkers exist on Kenyan populations to assist with delineation of its biogeographical distribution [
