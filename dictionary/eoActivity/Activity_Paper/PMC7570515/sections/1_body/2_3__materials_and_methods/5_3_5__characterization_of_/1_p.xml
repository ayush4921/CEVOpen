<p>This was carried out at the University of Potsdam (Brandenburg, Germany) and the Central Analytical Facility, Stellenbosch University (Stellenbosch, South Africa). Structures of the purified compounds were determined through 
 <sup>1</sup>H-, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR using Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometers, and HMBC, HSQC, COSY, and NOESY spectroscopy using standard Bruker software. Chemical shifts were measured in ppm in Î´ values relative to the internal standard tetramethyl silane (TMS).
