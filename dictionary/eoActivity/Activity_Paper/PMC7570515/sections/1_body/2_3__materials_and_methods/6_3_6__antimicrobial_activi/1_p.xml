<p>All the pure compounds and extracts from the five populations were tested for antimicrobial activity against the following: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 29213), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231), and un-typed isolate of methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). The microbes were obtained from the Centre for Microbiology Research (CMR), Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The stock solutions of the compounds were prepared by separately dissolving 1 mg of each compound in 1 mL of 10% DMSO to make 1000 µg/mL. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of the chemical isolates from the Gazi coast population of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> was determined using a broth dilution technique. All the compounds and extracts were diluted serially, ranging from 1000 to 0.011 µg/mL in 96 micro well plates. For each dilution, 1 mL of 24-hour and 72-hour cultured bacteria and fungi, respectively, were added, adjusted to McFarland turbidity [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 h for bacteria, and 30 °C for 72 h for fungi. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The lowest dilution for each compound with invisible microbial growth was recorded as MIC. This was confirmed by absence of turbidity after inoculating into agar followed by incubation for 24 and 72 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively [
