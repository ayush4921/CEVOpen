 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plants samples were collected from different natural origins across five localities in Kenya. Four collection sites, i.e., Nanyuki, Machakos, Karura, and Narok were from Kenyan inland regions and were composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. The Gazi collection site is along the Kenyan coast and the plants collected there were composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>. Three samples from different individual plants were taken from each population. Sampling of specimens was conducted in April 2018. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Nairobi University Herbarium after the confirmation of the taxonomic identities by Dr C. Lukhoba (a botanist at the University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya). Details of voucher specimens and geographic collection localities are as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04130-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The plantsâ€™ materials were washed, cut into smaller leaf pieces (size 2 cm), and dried away from direct sunlight, at room temperature for 15 days. This was followed by grinding each sample separately by hand, in a pestle and mortar.
