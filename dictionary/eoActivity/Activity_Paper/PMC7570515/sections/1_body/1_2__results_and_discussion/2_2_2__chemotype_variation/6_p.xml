<p>Both biotic and abiotic factors such as drought, browsing, salinity, heat, and air pollutants lead to heightened production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants [

Although this is speculative, it can be argued that these chemicals facilitate environmental adaptations specially to counter high temperatures and salinity [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The temperatures in the Gazi region can vary from 24 to 30 Â°C and because of a coastal locality, the soils are likely to be more saline. Flavonoids and diterpenoids such as catechin and hautriwaic acid lactone are implicated in stress responses in plants, and thus it is not surprising that these compounds were much higher in the plants from this hot and humid coastal region. This could possibly explain why samples from this area have close chemical similarities to the Nanyuki and Machakos cluster as compared with the plants growing in the Nairobi and Narok locations.
