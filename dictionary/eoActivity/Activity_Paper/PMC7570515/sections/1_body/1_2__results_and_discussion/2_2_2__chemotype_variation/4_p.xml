<p>Extensive natural disparity in phytochemical profiles occurs between and within species of plants as an adaptation measure to different abiotic and biotic environments [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The most important players in the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites include genetics, epigenetics, morphogenetic, ontogenic, and environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The PCA, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, indicates that Nanyuki and Machakos populations of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> are closely related while the plants from the Nairobi and Narok areas are from a similar chemical lineage. The current morphological classification of the genus 
 <italic>Dodonaea</italic> in Kenya shows that the coastal population is believed to be composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>viscosa,</italic> whereas plants from the other locations are composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The data of this study do not offer support for this idea. Instead, our data suggest that chemicals produced by the plants from different areas are related to the geographical and environmental conditions prevailing at the sites where each population was collected [
