<p>The methanolic and ethanolic extracts' chemical analysis of the aerial part of 
 <italic>Thymus leptobotrys</italic> reveals their phenolic compounds abundance. Overall, the methanolic extract has the highest levels of phenolic compounds as well as a more pronounced antioxidant activity using both DPPH and ABTS methods, with values of IC50 = 12.363 ± 0.324 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 930.935 ± 1.513 
 <italic>μ</italic>g extract TE/g, respectively. The decrease in leg edema in adult rats after 6 hours of administrating 600 mg extract/kg shows a strong anti-inflammatory effect for both extracts. The toxicity test indicates an LD50 above 2000 mg/kg for both extracts. These results show the presence of bioactive molecules in the aerial fraction of 
 <italic>Thymus leptobotrys</italic>. Further studies for future use against diseases due to oxidative stress are recommended.
