<p>The antioxidant capacity of methanolic and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> was studied using two different methods: DPPH and ABTS radical absorption capacity (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A low IC50 value indicates significant antioxidant activity. According to the DPPH method, both types of extracts have significant antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), especially the methanolic extract (IC50 = 12.363 ± 0.324 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), compared to the ethanolic extract (IC50 = 20.693 ± 0.182 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). In both cases, the IC50s are higher than that of the Trolox standard (IC50 = 1.810 ± 0.017 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> extracts, according to the ABTS test, shows that the methanolic extract has a powerful antioxidant activity of the order of 930.935 ± 1.513 mg TE/g extract, higher than that found in the ethanolic extract (860.309 ± 0.954 mg TE/g).
