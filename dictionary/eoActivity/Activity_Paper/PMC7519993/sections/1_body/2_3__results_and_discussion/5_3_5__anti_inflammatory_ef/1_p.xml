<p>The anti-inflammatory effect of ethanolic and methanolic extracts is evaluated by the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. Six hours after administration of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> at 600 mg/kg extract, the volume of edema decreased notably compared to the control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Rats treated with methanol and ethanol extracts showed the greatest decrease in inflammation (90.04% and 83.88%, respectively) after 1.5 h of carrageenan injection. This reduction in edema was greater than that of indomethacin 76.77% (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and was maintained throughout the observation period. Based on these results, it can be concluded that 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> extracts act within the first hour on the initial phase of inflammation, just like indomethacin.
