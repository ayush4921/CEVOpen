<p>Oxidative stress causes significant damage that accelerates cellular aging. This aging process leads to serious pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, inflammation, digestive diseases, and metabolic syndrome [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several situations in daily life lead to the production of free radicals responsible for oxidative stress. These include endogenous overproduction of inflammatory oxidative agents, free radical overproduction (tobacco, alcohol, drugs, pollution, and pesticides), and a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of foodborne vitamins and trace elements [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The search for natural antioxidants, mainly carotenoids, polyphenols (flavonoids and phenols acids), and vitamins (mainly vitamins C and E) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] derived from plant materials, is growing rapidly and is based on the characterization of endemic plants. Typically, these natural antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, show evidence of a broad variety of biological effects, such as antiplasmodial, antimicrobial, antiarthritic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects [
