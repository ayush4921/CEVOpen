<p>The total content of condensed tannins is determined by the acidic vanillin method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extract solution is mixed with 3 mL of 4% vanillin-methanol solution and 1.5 mL hydrochloric acid. The mixture is allowed to stand in the dark for 15 min. The absorbance is measured at 500 nm. The calibration curve for catechin is constructed from the concentrations from 30 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The content of condensed tannins is expressed in mg of catechin equivalent (CE) per gram of extract (mg CE/g E).
