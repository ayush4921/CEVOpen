<p>50 g of the powder of the aerial part of 
 <italic>Thymus leptobotrys</italic> is placed in a cartridge and placed in the Soxhlet extractor [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The flask is filled with 300 ml methanol for the methanolic extract and 300 ml ethanol for the ethanolic extract, and the flask is placed on a heater. When heated, the solvent evaporates, condenses in the cooler, falls back into the Soxhlet extractor, solubilizes the active ingredients, and returns to the recovery flask: the operation is repeated several times for 6 hours until the powder is completely depleted. The extract solution is cooled to room temperature, filtered through a filter paper, and then freed of all traces of solvent by means of a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C. The extracts are stored in hermetically sealed brown glass vials at 4°C. The extract yield (%) is calculated as follows:
