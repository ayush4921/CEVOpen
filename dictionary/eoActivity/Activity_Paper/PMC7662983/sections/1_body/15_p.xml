<p>Beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity was also prevented by an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Morus nigra</italic> ‘Chiang Mai’ [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. High amounts of cyanidin, keracyanin, and kuromanin as anthocyanidin and anthocyanins were found in the extract. 
 <italic>M. nigra</italic> promoted neurite outgrowth and improved locomotory coordination of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> co-expressing human amyloid precursor protein and BACE-1 specifically in the brain.
