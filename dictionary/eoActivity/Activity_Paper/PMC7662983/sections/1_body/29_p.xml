<p>A deep analysis of the 
 <italic>Fragaria</italic> genus was presented by Fierascu and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Strawberries possess biological properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, but only a few species represent the subject of the last decade of scientific research. The main components identified in the
