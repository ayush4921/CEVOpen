<p>Gunathilaka and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported the hypoglycemic and antioxidant in vitro activities of the marine red algae 
 <italic>Gracilaria edulis</italic>. A de-polysaccharide methanol extract of 
 <italic>G. edulis</italic> was sequentially partitioned by different solvents. The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest hypoglycemic and antiglycation potential. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction revealed the presence of several candidate anti-diabetic compounds.
