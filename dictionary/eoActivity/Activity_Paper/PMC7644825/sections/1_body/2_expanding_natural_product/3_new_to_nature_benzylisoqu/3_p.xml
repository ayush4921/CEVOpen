 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Pyne et al. (2020)</xref> have reported construction of a novel 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain, containing several tens of modifications principally focusing of increasing precursor supply, capable of producing 4.6 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of (S)-reticuline. The authors took advantage of the improved yields of this strain to search for minor products indicative of NCS promiscuity, the enzymatic gateway to probing the derivative space surrounding the tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) scaffold within norcoclaurine. By screening the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) spectra of supernatants for theoretical THIQ products, the authors identified peaks consistent with THIQs formed by the condensation of dopamine and endogenous yeast carbonyl species derived from L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan and L-leucine (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Pyne et al., 2020</xref>). By cultivating strains with single amino acids as the major nitrogen source, the authors were able to increase the yield of these derivatives but also force production of a more diverse suite of aromatic- and aliphatic-derived substituted THIQs. Interestingly, a peak corresponding to the condensation of dopamine and acetaldehyde that was independent of NCS activity was also observed. This is consistent with an earlier study reporting that inorganic phosphate can catalyze aqueous formation of 1-substituted-THIQs from dopamine and aldehydes (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Pesnot et al., 2011</xref>) and is reminiscent of the pH-dependent chemical coupling of secologanin and serotonin observed by 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenworth et al. (2015)</xref> in their hydroxystrictosidine production study. Importantly, the chemically catalyzed reactions are not enantiospecific, thus highlighting the need for robust controls when assessing product yields of microbially refactored plant pathways. Equivalent substituted THIQs derived from L-isoleucine and L-valine were not observed due to NCS’s previously reported intolerance toward α-substituted aldehydes. In a promising result for future diversification, Pesnot et al. also demonstrated that the (S)-norcoclaurine methylating enzymes, OMT and CNMT, showed activity toward all substituted THIQs.
