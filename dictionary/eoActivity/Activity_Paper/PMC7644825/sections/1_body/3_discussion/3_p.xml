<p>Beyond improving the catalytic activity of enzymes directly catalyzing in alkaloid production, several systems level challenges will also have to be overcome. Substrate toxicity will likely be a major hurdle on the way to producing some variants in yeast. For example, it has been shown that some tryptophan analogs interfere with tryptophan synthesis in yeast and inhibit growth (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Miozzari et al., 1977</xref>), and may also be erroneously incorporated into proteins. These issues could be overcome by reconsidering the halogen entry point into the pathway (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Glenn et al., 2011</xref>) or engineering tryptophan tRNA synthetases to reject halogenated tryptophan. Alternatively, inspiration could be taken from a

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">McMurry and Chang, 2017</xref>). Halogen salts, which are required for enzymatic halogenation, can also inhibit yeast growth. However, a number of non-conventional, halotolerant yeast strains are currently being investigated as chassis for biotechnological applications (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Zaky et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Musa et al., 2018</xref>). Although further characterization and toolbox development is still required, these strains could allow higher salt concentrations to be utilized. Functionality of the heterologously expressed plant enzymes at high salinity also remains an open question. However, we envision that both systems-level optimizations of existing chassis and further characterization of halo-tolerant yeasts could provide routes to improve the absolute yield of halogenated alkaloids, and the yield relative to the non-halogenated product, thus simplifying extraction.
