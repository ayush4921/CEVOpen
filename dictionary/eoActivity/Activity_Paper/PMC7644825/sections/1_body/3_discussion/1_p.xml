<p>Recent advances in the metabolic engineering toolbox have facilitated an explosion in the number of studies reporting microbial synthesis of plant medicinal alkaloids that cannot be chemically synthesized effectively. However, key challenges with both scale up of existing pathway sections and complete refactoring of both MIA and BIA extended pathways remain. Industrially competitive yeast strains able to produce even the naturally occurring plant medicinal alkaloids are still some distance into the future. Strains capable of producing industrial amounts of new-to-nature variants are yet further off. Despite this, these strains already represent an invaluable resource for the further engineering of these pathways for production of alkaloid derivatives. As described in this review, many relevant parts have already been developed, and we envision that the experimental advantages of microbial chasses will facilitate combinatorial testing of these parts to optimize derivative turnover as well as complete pathway refactoring.</p>
