<p>Even as our understanding of how to engineer the promiscuity of these systems improves, the small number of successful studies on this topic have demonstrated the significant effort that is required to successfully produce new-to-nature variants. In addition to this, it is often difficult or expensive to source chemically synthesized intermediate analogs (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt et al., 2007</xref>) and this becomes exponentially more difficult downstream as the compounds become more complex. It will therefore be important to focus initial efforts on platform yeast strains that can produce usable quantities of multiple variants of branch point compounds, such as strictosidine in the MIA pathway and (S)-norcoclaurine in the BIA pathway. Downstream modules can then be expressed in a plug-and-play style that will allow them to be efficiently studied and engineered. Although a daunting task, several studies have reported microbial synthesis of unnatural strictosidine and (S)-norcoclaurine analogs (

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). It should be noted that development of many of the parts required for this has already begun and these should be integrated into novel yeast strains with relative ease (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Moritzer et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we argue that combinatorial effects of these optimizations are now ripe to be studied, hopefully yielding novel platform strains that produce sufficient amounts of specific derivatives to unlock new regions of chemical space.
