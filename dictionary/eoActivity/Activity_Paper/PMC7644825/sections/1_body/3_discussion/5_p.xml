<p>In summary, although still relatively few, the growing number of studies reporting yeast-based microbial synthesis of plant medicinal alkaloids are providing experimentally amenable contexts in which these pathways can be further engineered. This has major implications for furthering our understanding of new-to-nature variants of natural products but will also allow the combinatorial effects of the many previous learnings from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in planta</italic> studies to be rapidly assessed. Although significant challenges still exist, if these challenges can be overcome, it is possible to envisage a new semi-synthetic approach to medicinal chemistry campaigns, specialized for diversifying natural product scaffolds. Such a system would involve microbial synthesis of medicinal alkaloid variants with halogen substitutions at specific points of the scaffold. These compounds can then be tested directly for pharmaceutical activities but also can be subjected to targeted, chemical cross-coupling reactions that can efficiently generate an almost infinite number of substituted variants. Thus, this system would combine natural mechanisms of generating diversity, i.e., using a small suite of organic building blocks combined through a large number of reactions, with synthetic mechanisms of generating diversity, i.e., using a wide range of building blocks combined with a small suite of reliable reactions (
