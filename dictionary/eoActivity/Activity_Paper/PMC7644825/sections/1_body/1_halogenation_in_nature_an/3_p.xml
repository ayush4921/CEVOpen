<p>The potential for enzymatic halogenation emerged with the discovery of widespread halogenation in nature, which pointed toward a rich trove of halogenating enzymes operating under benign conditions (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Today, more than 6,000 naturally occurring organohalogens have been identified in a range of organisms across all three kingdoms of life, with functions including pheromones, hormones, antimicrobials, halogen recyclers, and structural proteins (

Marine species and soil bacteria have provided the richest source of halogenated compounds due to the relative abundance of halogens in these habitats, particularly bromine in the ocean. A concerted effort to identify the enzymes responsible for incorporating inorganic halogen into metabolism has yielded a set of structurally and mechanistically diverse halogenases capable of catalyzing the formation of F-C, Cl-C, Br-C, and I-C bond formations (
