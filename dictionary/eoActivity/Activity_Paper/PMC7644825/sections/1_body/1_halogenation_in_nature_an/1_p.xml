<p>Halogens form group seven of the periodic table and the biologically relevant members are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Although the prevalence of these elements in nature is becoming increasingly understood, they are not often found naturally in plant alkaloids (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Runguphan et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, halogens are highly prevalent in licensed pharmaceuticals, and often have beneficial effects on the ligand binding and their pharmacokinetic properties of human therapeutics (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fejzagić et al., 2019</xref>). This is due to a unique combination of chemical properties—bulkiness alters the sterics of ligand binding, the high electronegativity can alter the charge interactions of ligand binding, their specific orbital architectures support unique intermolecular interactions and their hydrophobicity can improve bioavailability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These properties and their effects on drugs have been recently reviewed (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fejzagić et al., 2019</xref>). As a consequence of these properties, organohalogens make up roughly 25% of licensed drugs (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) and 40% of all new drugs being tested (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fejzagić et al., 2019</xref>). Of these, 57% contain fluorine, 38% contain chlorine, whereas bromine and iodine make up just 5% between them (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fejzagić et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to directly altering pharmacokinetic properties of a compound, halogens can act as “chemical handles” for targeting further drug derivatization (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Runguphan and O’Connor, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Corr et al., 2017</xref>). They provide effective leaving groups that can allow synthetic chemists to more selectively alter the activated carbon without creating non-specific alterations at other points of the structure. This is significant when attempting to further modify complex natural products for drug use (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) because their structural complexity makes specific substitution difficult to achieve, resulting in complex mixtures that can be costly to separate (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Frese and Sewald, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Schnepel and Sewald, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, FDA approval of novel compounds for therapeutic use is conditional on a pure compound being obtainable. Therefore, achieving regio-specific introduction of halogens into natural product scaffolds may also provide the key to building the natural product variant libraries that would allow the relatively unexplored derivative space surrounding natural products to be systematically probed for novel pharmaceutical activities.
