<p>Plants express biosynthetic pathways capable of performing a fascinating plethora of complex chemistry (

Consequently, many of the biologically active compounds utilized commercially, particularly pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavors and fragrances, are plant-derived natural products. Pharmaceutically important classes of plant natural products include the terpenes and terpenoids (

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Pichersky, 2020</xref>), polyketides (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2009</xref>), alkaloids (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Springob and Kutchan, 2009</xref>), as well as other aromatic amino acids derivatives (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Springob and Kutchan, 2009</xref>). Natural products display an impressive range and density of pharmaceutical activities, many of them are FDA-approved, and more than 50% of compounds recently introduced in drug discovery pipelines are natural products or derivatives thereof (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Newman and Cragg, 2016</xref>). However, most bioactive compounds possess complex structures with multiple stereocenters and oxygenated functional groups which complicate, and even preclude, total synthesis as a means of production. For this reason extraction from natural plant resources remains indispensable for sourcing bioactive compounds. For example, vincristine and vinblastine are alkaloids found in the Madagascar periwinkle (
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic>) and listed by the WHO as essential medicines (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation Model Lists of Essential Medicines, 2019</xref>). They are commercially produced by semi-synthesis, in which the biological precursors vindoline and catharanthine are extracted from 
 <italic>C. rosesus</italic> and subsequently chemically coupled 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Courdavault et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, due to the vagaries inherent to agriculture and natural habitats, the low 
 <italic>in planta</italic> accumulation, and the complex mixture of chemically similar compounds found in 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>, vincristine supply for clinical usage can be unstable (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Groot et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, there is considerable interest in producing plant medicinal alkaloids, and other bioactive plant natural products, by refactoring the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms, so-called microbial synthesis (
