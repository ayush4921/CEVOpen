  <p>Deploying synthetic biology to access novel regions of chemical space. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Readily available bulk feedstocks can be fed to yeast strains hosting refactored plant biosynthetic pathways. Natural products can then be extracted from fermentation broth. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Engineering of the plant biosynthetic pathway within the yeast chassis can allow or improve turnover of halogenated substrate analogs. Halogenated natural product scaffolds can be extracted from the fermentation broth. Promiscuous or engineered enzyme variants in engineered plant pathways are colored by red, blue and white arrows in the middle panel. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Introduction of halogenases can yield halogenated products from natural substrates. Promiscuous or engineered enzyme variants in engineered plant pathways are colored by red, blue and white arrows in the middle panel. Halogenase is depicted by a green arrow. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Schematic depicting the halogen derivatives surrounding natural product scaffolds in a hypothetical chemical space in which more similar compounds appear closer together. Halogens can facilitate targeted cross-coupling reactions that allow “hopping” to entirely new and chemically distinct regions of chemical space.
