<p>Some reports attributed the decent antibacterial activities to the high concentration of bicyclic terpenoid nepetalactone, identified as major compounds of various 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that EOs rich in caryophyllene isomers and caryophyllene oxide displayed significant antimicrobial activity, suggesting that the substances possibly participated in this activity [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Da Costa et al. found out that 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> EO, of which 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene is the major component (31.5%), exhibited significant antimicrobial activity, especially against 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 13315) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In agreement with our results, Maia et al. reported that EOs of 
 <italic>Vernonia remotiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>V. brasiliana</italic>, both rich in 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (≈40%), inhibited the growth of several tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ghosh et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] evaluated the activity of essential oils of 
 <italic>Alpinia nigra</italic> (47.7 to 49% of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The lowest MIC was found against 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> (1.56 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL).
