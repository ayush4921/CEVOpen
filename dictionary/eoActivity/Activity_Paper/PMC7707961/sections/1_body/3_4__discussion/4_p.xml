<p>Excessive AMPAR activity and upregulation have been implicated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and various neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and ALS [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although the 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO did not affect the activation of AMPARs, it displayed neuroprotective properties by targeting the receptor's desensitization and deactivation rate. The EO drastically prolonged the state at which the receptor remains in desensitization and deactivation by lowering the rates and consequently reaches a receptor in a nonactive state or a slow current-induced state. The oil showed activity on all tested AMPAR subtypes, yet significantly enhance the desensitization rate in addition to the deactivation rate of the GluA2 subtype comparable to other subtypes. To confirm this finding, we assessed the open state receptors by using 10 mM ligand concentration [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the concentration of the EO was determined through a concentration-dependent curve that defined the plateau level at 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, a further increase in the concentration had no additional effect on desensitization or deactivation. These results inspire a more significant analysis of the 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO neuroprotective properties. Identification of the active components in the oil is essential in order to understand AMPARs function better and synthesize anticonvulsant drugs targeting AMPARs.
