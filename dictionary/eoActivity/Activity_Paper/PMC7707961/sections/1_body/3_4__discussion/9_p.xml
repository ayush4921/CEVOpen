<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> COX inhibitory assay revealed potent inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO as compared with celecoxib, but nonselective towards both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.069 ± 0.001 and 0.074 ± 0.0015 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, which is around 10-fold greater than that of celecoxib (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.55 ± 0.0012 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for COX-1 and 0.6 ± 0.0015 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for COX-2). Jeppesen et al. reported that EO of 
 <italic>N. parmiriensis</italic> displayed COX-1 inhibitory effect with 45, 85, 75, and 91% inhibition at concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, whilst 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO showed 99% of COX-1 inhibitory action at the 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL dose which is superior to that of 
 <italic>N. parmiriensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our findings suggest that the EO of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> due to its potent anti-inflammatory potential, which similar to that COX-inhibitory effect of the drug celecoxib that has several adverse reactions [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], could be considered as an alternative option.
