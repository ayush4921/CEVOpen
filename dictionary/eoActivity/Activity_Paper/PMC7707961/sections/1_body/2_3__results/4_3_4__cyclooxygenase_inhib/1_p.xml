<p>The COX enzymatic inhibition activity of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO was accomplished using Cayman Chemical ELISA kit no. 560131. The calculated inhibition percentage of COX-2 for the tested EO revealed inhibition activity of 98.4% and 99.5% at concentrations of 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Similar results were obtained for the inhibition of COX-1, where the inhibition was 98% and 99% for the two tested concentrations, respectively. The results revealed that the 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO demonstrated a potent but nonselective inhibitory activity towards both COX-2 and COX-1 enzymes.
