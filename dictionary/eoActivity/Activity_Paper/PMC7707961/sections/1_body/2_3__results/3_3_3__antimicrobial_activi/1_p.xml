<p>The well diffusion procedure was employed in order to assess 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO ability to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, MRSA, 
 <italic>S. sonnei, E. faecium, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. floccosum</italic>. The range of concentration of the prepared 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO used ranged from 0.025 to 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The attained results revealed that EO displayed significant antibacterial and antifungal effects against all the tested strains as indicated in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The EO inhibited the growth of the studied bacteria at concentrations of 0.125–6.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL. It inhibited the growth of tested mold (
 <italic>E. floccosum</italic>) at half concertation required for the inhibition of the yeast 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp.
