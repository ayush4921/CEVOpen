<p>The EO effect on COX-1 (ovine) and COX-2 (human recombinant) enzymes was determined employing the COX inhibitor screening assay kit no. 560131 of Cayman Chemical (USA). The yellow product of this enzymatic reaction was assessed using a UV-Visible-spectrophotometer (Janeway, 7300, UK) in a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, A112, Japan) at 415 nm. The inhibitory assays were conducted at EO concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL with a commercial anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib). The cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of the tested product was assessed and calculated from the concentration–inhibition response curve 
 <italic>via</italic> regression analysis to obtain an inhibited percentage of PGE2. The tested EO concentration resulted in 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) in the formation of PGE2 
 <italic>via</italic> COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
