<p>Micro broth dilution assay was utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO. A 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of Mueller–Hinton broth was placed in each well of the microtitration plate, followed by the addition of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a suspension of EO in 2% aqueous DMSO (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) into the first well which was mixed using the micropipette. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L from the first well was transferred to the next well. This process was replicated for the other 9 wells unlike the last well (#11) that was labeled as a negative control for bacterial growth. The remaining solution from the 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L was discharged after mixing, since the EO was not added to well number 12 that was labeled as the positive control. Thereafter, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a bacterial suspension (from 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL bacterial suspension) was added to all wells excluding the negative control well #11. In well number 12, the inoculated bacteria should grow because it does not contain the EO. After 24 incubation at 35°C, the lowest concentration of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO that caused inhibition of the evident bacterial growth was identified as the MIC. 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO was screened twice in each run [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The 2% DMSO solution was used as a positive control for every microbe separately to check the effect on each one (antimicrobial activity for DMSO was considered).
