<p>D. Pang et al. provided the evidence that polyphyllin VII isolated from 
 <italic>Paris polyphylla</italic> var. yunnanensis induces apoptosis and autophagic cell death via ROS-provoked suppression of AKT/mTORC1 signaling cascade. Moreover, polyphyllin VII in combination with temozolomide showed synergistic interaction followed by a decrease of MGMT expression. Therefore, polyphyllin VII can be considered as a valuable drug to attenuate the ability of glioma cells to repair the temozolomide-induced DNA methylation and reduce the resistance to temozolomide.
