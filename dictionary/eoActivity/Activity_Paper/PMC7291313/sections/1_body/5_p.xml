<p>An interesting overview of melatonin protective action against the side effects of chemotherapy is given by Z. Ma et al. Melatonin easily crosses all biological barriers while its concentration within the cells is particularly high in mitochondria. This is important for its ability to resist mitochondrial oxidative-stress damage. In cancer as well as in other aging-related diseases, melatonin can reduce mitochondrial-mediated cell death and thus protect normal cells against the harmful effects of anthracyclines, alkylating agents, platinum compounds, antimetabolites, mitotic inhibitors, and novel targeted therapies.</p>
