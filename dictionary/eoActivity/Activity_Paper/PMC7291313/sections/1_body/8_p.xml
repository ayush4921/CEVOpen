<p>H. P. Vasantha Rupasinghe et al. showed that the application of a bioconversion process using probiotic bacteria 
 <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> can enhance the pharmacological activities of cranberry extracts probably by generating more active metabolites. The proanthocyanidin-rich extract exposed to the bacteria was particularly active against HepG2 cells inducing significantly stronger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis when compared to parental extract which was not exposed to probiotic bacteria.
