<p>E. Hernández-SanMiguel et al. found that Ocoxin® oral solution affects stem cell properties in certain primary glioblastoma cells by inhibiting their self-renewal capacity. Moreover, systemic treatment of animals bearing heterotopic and orthotopic xenografts with Ocoxin® reduced tumor burden. Importantly, Ocoxin® exerted a direct effect on macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting the protumoral features of M2 macrophages.</p>
