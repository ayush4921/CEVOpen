<p>T. Kowalczyk et al. studied protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of aqueous methanolic extracts derived from the aerial parts and roots of in vitro grown 
 <italic>Menyanthes trifoliata</italic> L. plants on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The authors found that both extracts demonstrated protective effects against mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage caused by ROS. Due to the higher content of selected phenolic compounds and betulinic acid in the root extract, it exerted stronger effects than the extract from the aerial part.
