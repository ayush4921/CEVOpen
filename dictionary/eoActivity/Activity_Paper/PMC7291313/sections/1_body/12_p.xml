<p>G. Isani et al. renewed the interest for the traditional Chinese medicinal plant 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. from which famous antimalarial drug artemisinin was isolated. The authors showed that both artemisinin and hydroalcoholic plant extract induced a cytotoxic effect in D-17 canine osteosarcoma cells. Pure artemisinin caused an increase of cells in the S phase, whereas the hydroalcoholic extract induced G2/M arrest. A significant decrease of iron concentration was also observed indicating that ferroptosis as a specific cell death type might contribute to the artemisinin effect. The hydroalcoholic extract was more potent than pure artemisinin demonstrating a possible synergistic effect of its other components with artemisinin.
