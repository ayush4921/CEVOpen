<p id="p0020">Certainly with its specific delicate taste and its importance in traditional medicine in rural communities of Ethiopia, stingless bee honey has greater value than

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ewnetu et al., 2013</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vit et al., 1998</xref>). As a result, stingless bee honey has high local market demand, attaining better prices than the Apis honey and commercialized in different regions of the country. Despite its high demand and medicinal value, the issue of its quality and authenticity remain as important factors in its consumption and marketing due to the scant knowledge about its production system and composition. As a result, the proximate composition property of stingless bee honey is not yet characterized and documented even to set its quality standard both for nutritional and medicinal value. Eventually, the result is helpful for setting stingless bee honey quality standard and its characterization particularly in the identification of Ethiopian stingless bee honey. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the proper physico-chemical characteristics of honey from native stingless bees (
 <italic>Meliponula beccarii</italic>) of Ethiopia and determine some of its quality level in comparison with 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey.
