<p id="p0190">The pH and total acidity parameters showed statistically no significant differences among stingless bee honey sampled from the four districts. The overall pH value ranged between 3.4-3.9 with mean value of 3.7 ± 0.15, which is lower than commonly known standard pH value of 3.42–6.10 for honey from 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tesfaye et al., 2016</xref>), but not significantly different. These pH values are comparatively in line with past study reports for stinging bee honey pH value (3.75 and 4.21) in Nigerian (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nweze et al., 2017</xref>), Brazilian stingless bee honeys (2.93–4.08) (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">do Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>), and pH value for stingless bee honey in Thai which ranges from 3.10 to3.90 (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chuttong et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, the acidic and low pH value of Melipona honey is highly contribute to inhibit the presence and growth of microorganisms (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, this low pH parameter of stingless bee honey has great importance in the process of extraction and storage of the honey so as to enhance its shelf life, texture and stability (

 <italic>Melipona</italic> or 
 <italic>Apis</italic> bees, honey has usually low pH value, which acts effectively as antimicrobial agents against microbes used as potential substitute in reducing some infectious diseases such as coughs and wounds (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Meo et al., 2017</xref>). To this fact, Meliponan honey has higher market demand and traditional medicinal value than 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> honey in Ethiopia.
