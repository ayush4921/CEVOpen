<p id="p0210">The Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a compound made from chemical reaction of some sugars and acids, and it is used as an indicator of honey freshness and good quality (

Even though the honey samples were freshly harvested and processed, the higher HMF recorded in honey from Toke Kutaye district might be due to its long storage or aging in its natural nest. Previous study indicated that aged honey even in its natural nest has high HMF concentration (
