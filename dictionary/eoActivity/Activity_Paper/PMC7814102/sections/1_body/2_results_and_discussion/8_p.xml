 <sup>−1</sup> with mean value of 17.3 ± 0.7 meqkg

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alimentarius, 2001</xref>). But, the variation in acidity value amongst different honey samples can generally be attributed to the floral origin, location, harvest season, management and particularly with the bee species that produced the honey (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Stramm (2011)</xref> also stated that the higher the acidity value indicates the presence of abundant organic acids in the stingless bee honey which can be related to the enzymatic activity of glucose-oxidase on glucose, a content of low pH that contributes for acidic characteristics. Such organic acids are an important component and indicator of good flavor and aroma in most honeys. In other case, the total acidity of honey can also be influenced by the nectar pH and mineral (ash) content derived from the soil composition or the plant species from which the final honey composition made (
