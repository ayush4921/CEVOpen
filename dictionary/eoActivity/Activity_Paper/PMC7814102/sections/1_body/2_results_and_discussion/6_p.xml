<p id="p0185">Water (moisture) content is one of the most pertinent characteristics of honey, since it impacts the thickness, specific weight, ripeness, crystallization and taste of the honey which enhances the shelf life of the product at certain value (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">do Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>). From this study, the value of moisture contents in stingless bee honey samples were recorded from 25.1 - 35.0 % with mean value of 29.6 ± 1.4% (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It was observed that there was no statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05) in the value of moisture contents of stingless bee honey samples collected among the four districts. Nevertheless, the overall mean value of moisture content of the analyzed stingless bee honey sample (29.6 ± 1.4%) was higher than the threshold value of Ethiopian (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">QSAE, 2005</xref>) and international standard (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alimentarius, 2001</xref>) moisture content for 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey which permits a maximum moisture content of 20 % in honey. The moisture contents of honey samples in the present study (25.1–35.0%) are in the range of previously reported moisture content values of stingless bee honeys produced in Venezuela, and Parana State (Brazil) to be 26–42%, and 25–36%, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">do Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Moo-Huchin et al., 2015</xref>). From this it is demonstrated that stingless bee honey in general has higher moisture content than 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey. This may be due to the high hygroscopicity nature of stingless bee (Meliponinae) honey (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">do Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>) indicating that the moisture content in honey in turn can be influenced by intrinsic characteristic of bee species and the material they used to construct for their honey storage. For instance, stingless bees use unique cerumen made up of wax combined with propolis and plant resins to construct their honey pots for honey storage which may contribute to high moisture content as compared to honey combs of 
 <italic>Apis spp</italic>. built from only beeswax content (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kek et al., 2017</xref>). The higher moisture in stingless bee honey is therefore; emphasize as precaution to store stingless bee honey in the refrigerator chambers in order to avoid its degradation or fermentation, thereby to ensure a quality product for the consumers.
