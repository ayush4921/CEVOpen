<p id="p0200">The ash content demonstrates the abundance of mineral content in honey sources, which is mainly influenced by the nectar botanical origin, location, species of the bee and processing and handling. With this respect, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Biluca et al. (2016)</xref> also indicated that the mineral content in honey is depends on nectar composition of major bee forages during the honey. In this study, the honey samples assessed for ash content exhibited no statistical difference among the locations (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The stingless bee honey samples had the ash content reaching from 0.21 to 0.57%, that is consistent with allowable range. The values were almost similar to previous study in Brazil for which the stingless bee honey ash content ranged from 0.19 to 0.33% (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">do Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>). However, the average ash content of stingless bee is relatively higher (0.41 ± 1.1%) than the 
 <italic>Apis</italic> honey (0.14
 <underline>-</underline>0.3%). This might be associated to the origin of 
 <italic>Meliponula beccarii</italic> honey which is uniquely harvested from the ground in the soil where the mineral content is expected richer than in the beehives. Hence, the results of present study suggest that honey produced from native stingless bees (
 <italic>M. beccarii</italic>) in Ethiopia is richer in mineral content and good if standardized for both medicinal and nutritional consumption.
