<p id="p0225">The physico-chemical parameters assessed in twenty pooled samples of stingless bee honey, principally moisture, pH, total acidity, ash content, electrical conductivity, HMF and insoluble matter are demonstrated no significance differences among the four study districts except for the value of proline. The majority of physico-chemical parameters comply with the quality standard limits of Ethiopian honey from that of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> as they share common characteristics of their botanical origin. However, the values of the moisture content and total acidity in this specific honey are higher when compared with the standard limits of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey emphasizing product differentiation and the need for specific regulations for the native species 
 <italic>(Melipona beccarii)</italic> honey. The distinctive low pH and high acidity value of the stingless bee honey may represent its potential medicinal value because these conditions inhibit the microbial growing and favor its shelf life. As a result, stingless bee honey has greater market demand and higher price than the Apis honey in Ethiopia. Although the study demonstrated the first partial characteristics of honey from native stingless bee species in the country, and further study on comprehensive properties including sugar and enzyme contents in the specific honey originate from wider ecological zones is much more recommended to suggest establishing a specific quality standard for stingless bee honey.
