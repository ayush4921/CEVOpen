<p id="para0023">In addition to blood glucose regulation, it has also been demonstrated the positive effects of hydromethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. annuus</italic> L. on other components of MetS, including reduced LDL-C and TG levels as well as hepatoprotective and antilipid peroxidation activities of alloxan-induced diabetic rats (
 <xref rid="bib0094" ref-type="bibr">Onoja et al., 2018</xref>). Since 20-dehydroeucannabinolide (
 <bold>3</bold>) is one of the major components of the extract, potential activity of this molecule in managing dyslipidemia may be proposed. However, additional studies are needed to ascertain the hypolipidemic property of this compound.
