 <italic>Smallanthus macroscyphus</italic> (Heliantheae, Asteraceae), is a perennial herb commonly known as ‘‘wild yacon’’ native from the South American region comprising from southern Bolivia to northwestern Argentina. This species is closely related to 
 <italic>S. sonchifolius</italic> and possibly with similar antidiabetic properties. Polymatin A (
 <bold>2</bold>) is the main sesquiterpene lactone isolated from 
 <italic>S. macroscyphus</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">De Pedro et al., 2003</xref>). This melampolide exerts an effective inhibition of post-prandial blood glucose peak and hypoglycemic activity in STZ-diabetic rats probably by the stimulation of insulin release or due to an insulin-like effect (
 <xref rid="bib0111" ref-type="bibr">Serra-Barcellona et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the close relationship in the polymatin A (
 <bold>2</bold>) and enhydrin (
 <bold>1</bold>) structures, the melampolide 
 <bold>2</bold> could be effective in the management of postprandial hyperglycemia through inhibition of α-glucosidase. However, no studies of these effects were found.
