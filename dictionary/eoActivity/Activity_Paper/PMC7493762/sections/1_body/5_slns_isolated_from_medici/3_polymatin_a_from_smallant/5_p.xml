<p id="para0021">In subchronic studies, polymatin A (
 <bold>2</bold>) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 90 days at daily doses of 7, 14 and 28Â mg/kg b.w. No toxicity signs or deaths were observed. There were no changes in the behavior, body or organ weights, hematological, biochemical or urine parameters of the rats. No histopathological lesions were observed in the examined organs. The results indicate that polymatin A (
