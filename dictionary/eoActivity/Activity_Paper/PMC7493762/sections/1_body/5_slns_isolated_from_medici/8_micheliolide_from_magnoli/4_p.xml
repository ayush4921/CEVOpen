<p id="para0042">Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that micheliolide (
 <bold>13</bold>) alleviates hepatic steatosis in obese db/db mice, and the molecular mechanisms driving the therapeutic effects of this compound might involve PPAR-γ upregulation to consequently inhibit NF-κB mediated inflammation and activate AMPK/mTOR-dependent autophagy (
 <xref rid="bib0141" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to future work evaluate if this effect in hepatic steatosis impacts glucose metabolism. No
