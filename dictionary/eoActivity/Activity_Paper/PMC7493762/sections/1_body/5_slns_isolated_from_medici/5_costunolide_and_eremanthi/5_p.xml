<p id="para0028">On the other hand, the possible inhibition of inflammatory processes has not been studied in eremanthin (
 <bold>4</bold>). However, this compound has a rigid skeleton and an intact 
 <italic>exo</italic>-methylene-γ-lactone group, previously related to anti-inflammatory properties (
 <xref rid="bib0116" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the absence of free hydroxyl groups in 
 <bold>4</bold> could help to improve anti-inflammatory properties since an increasing number of free hydroxyl groups are reported to diminish NF-κB inhibition activity (
 <xref rid="bib0116" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2013</xref>). Taking together these structural characteristics, we suggest that eremathin (
 <bold>4</bold>) is a candidate to be tested for inhibition of inflammatory processes related to metabolic diseases.
