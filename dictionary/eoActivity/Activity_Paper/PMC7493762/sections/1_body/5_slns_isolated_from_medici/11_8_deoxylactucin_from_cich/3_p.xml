 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) is a guaianolide found as a major component of chicory root and it is also common in species of 
 <italic>Lactuca</italic>. It has been demonstrated that 
 <bold>17</bold> possess anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB and as a selective inhibitor of COX-2 (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Cavin et al., 2005</xref>). An important structural characteristic of 
 <bold>17</bold> is the presence of α-methylene-γ-lactone group and α,β-unsaturated cyclopentenone. Compounds that possess these structures, such as Helenalin, can react with sulfhydryl group of Cys38 in NF-kB and prevent DNA binding (

 <xref rid="bib0131" ref-type="bibr">Widen et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, 8-deoxylactucin (
 <bold>17</bold>) could interact with NF-κB by a similar mechanism. No 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity studies on 8-deoxylactucin (
 <bold>17</bold>) have been reported to date.
