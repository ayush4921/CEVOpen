 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, no hypoglycemic effect was observed on STZ-induced diabetic mice after oral administration of alantolactone. However, inflammation and renal abnormalities were suppressed via inhibition of NF-κB gene expression and the high glucose-induced overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage adhesion in renal NRK-52E cells were inhibited. (
