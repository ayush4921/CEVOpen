<p id="para0014">SLns are characterized by the presence of a γ-lactone ring. The lactone ring can be fused to the remaining skeleton in either a 
 <italic>cis</italic> or 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration, being most common the 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration (

 <xref rid="bib0121" ref-type="bibr">Sülsen and Martino, 2018</xref>). Based on their carbocyclic skeleton, SLns are mainly classified in four major groups: germacranolides (10-membered ring), eudesmanolides (6–6 bicyclic compounds), guaianolides and pseudoguaianolides (5–7 bicyclic compounds) and many subtypes of SLns according to their skeletal arrangement (

 <xref rid="bib0096" ref-type="bibr">Padilla-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). In many cases, the γ-lactone ring contains an exocyclic double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group (α-methylene-γ-lactone) but in some cases the exocyclic methylene is reduced or the double bond can be endocyclic (

 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Sülsen et al., 2018</xref>). It has been well documented that biological activity of the most common types of SLns is mainly attributed to formation of covalent union between the α,β-unsaturated group in the 
 <italic>exo</italic>-methylene-γ-lactone and nucleophilic biological targets (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> free cysteine sulfhydryl) resulting in alkylation through Michael-type addition (
 <xref rid="bib0107" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 2006</xref>). This chemical reaction induces steric and chemical changes in enzymes, receptors or transcriptional factors leading to a series of cellular events that culminate in diverse biologic responses. The number of alkylating structural elements present on the molecule define differences between the activity of each SLn. Another structural influences on the biological effects are the molecular size, hydrophobicity, chemical environment and the presence of other functional groups (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, epoxy groups, hydroxyls or hydroxyls esterified with acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, angelate, epoxyangelate, and benzoate) (
