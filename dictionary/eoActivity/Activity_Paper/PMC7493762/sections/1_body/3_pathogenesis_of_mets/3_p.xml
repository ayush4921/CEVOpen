<p id="para0009">Chronic low-grade inflammation in obesity results from the activation of various inflammatory mechanisms through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathways. These pathways represent important modulators of cytokine gene expression downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in insulin target cells (

 <xref rid="bib0104" ref-type="bibr">Rogero and Calder, 2018</xref>). NF-κB is an important transcription factor involved in different processes of the immune and inflammatory responses. It is composed of p50 and p65 subunits and is found in the cytoplasm in complex with inhibitory proteins of the IκB family. Cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can stimulate cell surface receptors including Toll-like receptor (TLR4) to initiate a signaling cascade that converge on the activation of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex (
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). The IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα and induces its degradation, leading to the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB to promote transcription of target genes such as TNF-α, interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (
