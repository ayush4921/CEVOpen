<p id="para0010">On the other hand, JNK are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that mediate cellular responses to a variety of intra- and extracellular stresses (

In the context of obesity, JNK pathways can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines, FFA and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and regulate several nuclear and extra-nuclear substrates, specially the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1) which controls the expression of proinflammatory genes and protein synthesis (

Deregulated activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways results in increased transcription of IL-6 and TNF-α, which reduce the sensitivity of insulin target cells towards insulin. Thus, chronically activated NF-κB and JNK pathways leads to the promotion of insulin resistance (
