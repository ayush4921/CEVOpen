  <xref rid="bibr14-0300060520962344" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 </sup> was used to extract the oil from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves. Approximately 50 g of the powdered 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf was placed into a cellulose thimble and put inside the Soxhlet apparatus. The oil extracting solvent comprised 500 mL of either methanol, ethanol, or ethyl acetate. Oil extraction was performed at the solvent boiling temperature and the extraction time was 5 to 6 hours. The solvent extract was concentrated with a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure to achieve maximum yield of the essential oil. The extracted oil was stored at 4°C in a refrigerator and dried under anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> for further analysis.
