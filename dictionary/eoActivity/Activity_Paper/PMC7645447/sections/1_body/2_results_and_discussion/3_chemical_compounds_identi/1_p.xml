<p>The chemical composition of the leaf oil was further investigated using GC-MS, and representative chromatographs of the ethyl acetate, ethanol, and methanol extracts are presented in

 <xref rid="table4-0300060520962344" ref-type="table">4</xref>. GC-MS analysis resulted in the identification of 43 unique constituents in the leaf oil of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>. The oil was shown to be a complex mixture of numerous compounds, many of which are present in low quantities. The identified compounds comprised more than 95% of the total extracted oils. The percentage peak areas were taken to represent the proportion of each compound relative to the total. The major chemical components of the oil comprised a pyrrolizine, paromomycin, a pyrroline, phytol, 2-dodecene, isoquinoline, 1-eicosanol, and chlorozotocin (

 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oil based on the findings of previous studies are presented in
