<p>The extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf oil prepared using different solvents were qualitatively similar, although they did differ markedly in terms of the relative concentrations of the compounds present. The chemical composition of the essential oils extracted from Ethiopian 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> agreed quite well with that previously reported in the literature,

 </sup> with some differences in the relative quantities of the volatile compounds. Notably, there have previously been major differences reported in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf oils extracted from plants in certain countries.

 </sup> The observed differences in the quality and composition of the extracted oil between studies may be attributable to factors such as genetic, climate, topographical, and seasonal variations. Among the crucial compounds identified in the present study, phytol, azabicyclo-containing compounds, and 2-dodecene have been reported in the essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves in other studies.
