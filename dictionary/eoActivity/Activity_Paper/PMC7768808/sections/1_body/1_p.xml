<p>The difficulty of clearly documenting the impacts of changes in the contribution of nature to quality of life has several interrelated causes. First, many of nature’s contributions to quality of life have complicated causal chains that are not fully understood and that may play out over large spatial or temporal scales (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), making it difficult to fully appreciate these contributions or to value them. Second, for nature’s contributions to be realized, inputs from nature are often combined with human labor and anthropogenic assets, which can make it difficult to disentangle the contributions of nature from those of other inputs (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Third, substitutes exist for some, but not all, of nature’s contributions. For example, shifting demand to crops that are wind- rather than animal-pollinated can partially offset the impact of a decline in pollinators on food supply, investment in water-filtration technology can mitigate a decline in water quality, and aquaculture can offset declines in wild-caught fish. However, adaptation and alternatives typically come at some cost and may not be available for all of nature’s contributions, and the full importance of the contributions of nature may be recognized only when substitutes are exhausted (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Despite these challenges, there is a large and growing literature documenting various aspects of the contributions of nature to people (
