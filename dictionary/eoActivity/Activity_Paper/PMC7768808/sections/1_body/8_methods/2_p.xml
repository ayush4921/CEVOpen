<p>To populate these categories of information for each type of contribution, we searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), largely using Google Scholar. We focused on publications that reviewed multiple empirical studies and surveys of literature. Although we started with literature that self-identifies as relevant to ecosystem services or nature’s contributions to people, this literature does not address the breadth of information we sought to collect, so we used a snowball approach in conjunction with expert knowledge to amass additional evidence. Detailed information for each type of nature’s contribution to people are available as an appendix to the IPBES Global Assessment, Chapter 2.3: Status and Trends–Nature’s Contributions to People (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).
