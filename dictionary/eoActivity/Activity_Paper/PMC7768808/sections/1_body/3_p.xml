<p>In characterizing global trends for these categories of contribution, we expand the logic chain linking nature to quality of life developed in several prior studies (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/>
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Our expansion defines four distinct but related aspects of nature’s contributions to people (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). First, nature plays a role in providing functions that potentially contribute to human wellbeing. These potential contributions are diminished with the loss of biodiversity or ecosystem processes. Second, “realized contributions” occur when people experience the contributions of nature. Third, for some contributions, there is a difference between the realized contributions of nature and “environmental conditions,” with environmental conditions often reflecting external drivers, not the contributions of nature. For example, as pollution of air or water increases, nature may remove more of those pollutants and thus increase the realized contribution of filtration, until a point of saturation is reached. Even as filtration increases, however, environmental quality may decline because of increased pollution loading. Fourth, there is the “impact on quality of life,” which is ultimately the goal of assessing nature’s contributions. Distinguishing between these concepts can help to overcome ongoing confusion over use of terms in the scientific literature that has detracted from progress and led to lack of clarity in communication about nature’s contributions to people (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Clearly distinguishing between potential contributions, realized contributions, environmental conditions, and impact on quality of life helps pinpoint the ways that changes in nature affect people and illuminates remaining knowledge gaps.
