<p id="par0005">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious public health issue which leads to increased time spent in hospital, increased mortality and has associated economic costs. Effective antimicrobial medicines are essential for conducting surgical procedures and many other health care practices. Many of these antimicrobial medicines are also used in livestock farming and for many non-life threatening conditions, thereby increasing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics increasing the chances for the development of antimicrobial resistance over time. In human healthcare, many people use antibiotics to treat viral infections or other conditions which would naturally resolve over time, which also increases the development of AMR.</p>
