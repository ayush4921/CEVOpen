In 32 % of the 252 pneumonia episodes antibiotics were prescribed while in the literature 88â€“98 % antibiotics prescription is reported. Delayed prescription of antibiotics was needed in only 13 % of the patients with presumed bacterial pneumonia. This paper is a great example for other clinics struggling with antibiotics resistance and offers ideas for designing future strategies of reduced antibiotics use.
