<p id="par0060">This special issue furthermore contains five systems biology papers. Systems biology is especially suitable for studying herbal medicines which contain multiple active components working in synergy and also working in various sites in the body to generate a healing response in the body. Systems biology is based on systems thinking, applying methods derived from complexity sciences such as network analysis, and aims to study relationships between variables in the context of the organism [

 <italic>Hedysarum multijugum</italic> maxim. and 
 <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> radix to uncover the mechanisms of the effect of Qi invigorating and blood circulation promoting traditional Chinese medicines to treat pulmonary fibrosis. In this network pharmacology study gene targets were found indicating virus inhibition, inflammatory factor secretion, inhibition of oxidative stress, and apoptosis regulation. Another network pharmacology study reveals eight potential targets (TNF, IL-6, IL-1Î², IL-2, JUN, MAPK1.MAPK8, EGFR) of the Chinese drug Jiu Wei Zhu Huang San against respiratory tract infections (Guo et al.

The main targets that resulted from the network pharmacology analysis were IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor A, epidermal growth factor receptor and caspase-3. Jia et al. (

 <italic>Artemisiae annuae</italic> herba, 
 <italic>Lonicerae japonicae</italic> flos, and 
 <italic>Gardeniae</italic> fructus to treat viral infections. A network pharmacology study revealed 8 key targets of the medicine, and support the hypothesis that the injection can inhibit viral-cell fusion, may have an effect on cytokine storms and protect patients from lung damage. In another network pharmacology study by Zhuang et al. (

Five active compounds (quercetin, luteolin, baicalein, kaempferol, and wogonin) were found to play a central role in the anti-bacterial and anti-viral activity of the drug and three KEGG pathways were mainly involved.
