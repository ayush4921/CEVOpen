<p id="par0045">The above papers indicate that substantial effort is put into discovering more natural and sustainable methods to counter bacterial infections. This approach is also important for the discovery of natural anti-viral agents. One paper by Angamuthu et al. in this special issue addresses the anti-viral effects of plant extracts. The effect of 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L., 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> Nees. and 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> L. leaves against human Herpesvirus-3 were studied, discovering comparable anti-viral activity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. leaves to acyclovir.
