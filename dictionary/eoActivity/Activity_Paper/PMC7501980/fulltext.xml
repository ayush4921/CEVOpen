Alloxan-induced diabetic mice displayed significant decline in body weight compared to normal mice as shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Aqueous and methanol extract of two doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) treated groups mice indicated enhancement in body weight when compared to diabetic mice in control group, however, it was still less than in the normal control group.

No neurological, behavioral and autonomic changes, physical changes like motor activity alertness, convulsions, restlessness, diarrhea, coma, lacrimation and appearance of the animals and no changes in respiratory circulation, eyes, sleep and the like were observed throughout study period. Moreover, the <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves extract did not lead to death in the mice at a dose of 2 g/kg during the study period time. The finding indicated that a single dose of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> extracts of both solvents had no adverse effect, demonstrating that the LD<sub>50</sub> could be greater than 2 g/kg/body weight in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Use of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> in diabetes has been reported in the literature along with several other traditional claims. In order to establish the scientific evidence for the utility of <italic>T. schimperi in</italic> the management of DM, experimental study of the antihyperglycemic effects of the crude 80% methanol and aqueous leaves extracts were performed in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The increase in fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration is an important characteristic feature of DM.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In this work the extract of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves lowered FBG level in diabetic mice. The aqueous and the 80% methanol extract of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves (dose: 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) were administered daily for three weeks to alloxan-induced diabetic mice. In this work, from around the end of the second week to the final week of treatment, significant fall of the BGL of the mice was observed gradually. Therefore, the current study showed that both the aqueous and the methanolic extracts of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves have a significant antidiabetic effect on alloxan-induced diabetic mice in a time and dose dependent manner.</p><p>The result of the study indicated the potential antihyperglycemic effect of the extract. There are many possible explanations related to this finding. The inhibition of human digestive tract pancreatic &#x003b1;-amylase activity describes one of the treatment methods commonly used for the prevention and control of hyperglycemia in type 2 DM patients after food intake by dropping the absorption of glucose released by this enzyme from starch.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus inhibition of this enzyme involved the delaying of postprandial hyperglycemia.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In a study done by Dessalegn et al, <italic>T. schimperi</italic> confirmed the &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitory effect in vitro<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Therefore, this property might be contributed to the antihyperglycemic activity of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves extract, which supports our study.</p><p>In addition, it has been suggested that diabetic complications can be alleviated by the use of antioxidants through reduction of oxidative stress.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Alloxan induce DM by destruction of pancreatic beta cells selectively via disruption of the cell membrane integrity. One of the mechanisms for its cell destruction is by intracellular generation of free radicals and this supported the study on the antioxidant property of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves in vitro and reported as the plant has the claimed activity.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore this property of the studied plant might have a role in controlling hyperglycemia of DM patients. Thus <italic>T. schimperi</italic> may have a role in control of DM.</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>T. schimperi</italic> may prevent the destruction or regenerated leftovers of the already alloxan-destroyed beta cells of pancreas<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> by one of its secondary constituents, polyphenolic, and contribute in significant BGL effect.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Thus, the antidiabetic result of the <italic>T. schimperi</italic> extract may be associated with the existence of different secondary metabolites in plants. One study described the antidiabetic result of thymus plants is due to be due &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory effect and antioxidant (free radical scavenger) activity in vitro of the plant.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The result of our study agrees with this.</p><p>Weight loss in DM patients is due to deficiency of insulin in the DM patient which leads to reduction in the level of protein synthesis due to declined amino acid uptake by tissues and resulting lipolysis in adipose tissues and protein breakdown.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In this study, there is the weight reduction in diabetic control mice. However, after treatments of diabetic mice were with <italic>T. schimperi</italic> extract, the weight loss was normalized. The capability of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> extracts to defend weight loss may be due to the bioactive compounds of <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves, which suppresses the free radicals generated via hyperglycemia. It also controls the muscle loss resulting from poor glycemic control in diabetic mice<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and lead to normalize the level of body weight.</p><p>In the current study acute oral toxicity was tested and found to be safe at a dose of 2000 mg/kg per body weight. In the acute toxicity test of aqueous extract of <italic>T. schimperi,</italic> there were no any physical changes and zero mortality. This finding indicated the strong data of the nontoxic effect of the aqueous extract of <italic>T. schimperi</italic>.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From this study it was shown that in<italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves crude extracts of both solvents (80% methanol and aqueous) showed significant reduction of BGL on diabetic mice and prevented body weight loss of diabetic. Methanolic extract showed a noticeable drop of blood glucose level related to respective doses of aqueous extract. Therefore, based on the results obtained from the antihyperglycemic study it is possible to say that <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves can be used as a substitute supplement for the management of DM. Moreover, additional investigation is needed for explanation of the appropriate mechanisms of action of the leaf extracts and its fractions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all who gave us advice through the development of this research.
