<p>The effect on BGL in alloxan-induced mice after oral administration of the methanol 80% and aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> at different doses displayed a reduction in BGL in a time and dose dependent manner (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Treatments with 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> aqueous extracts of 250 and 500 mg/kg indicated reduction in 22.65 and 33.15% in plasma glucose levels, respectively after four hours of extract administration. In case of 80% methanol extraction at 250 and 500 mg/kg indicated reduction of 30.06 and 38.35% in plasma glucose levels, respectively after four hours of extract administration. The 500 mg/kg of 80% methanol extract indicated a significant reduction in the BGL while both aqueous extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) and other dose of 80% methanol extract (250 mg/kg) showed no significant effect when compared to positive (diabetic) control group at four hours after extract administration. Glibenclamide (0.66 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction of 48.21% in the BGL after four hours of drug administration.
