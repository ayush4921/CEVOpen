<p>The current study was done to evaluate the antihyperglycemic activity of methanol 80% and aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaf in alloxan-induced diabetes mice. In the preparation of crude aqueous extract from the dried leaves of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> a yield 10.7% was obtained. In the case of crude 80% methanol extract preparation, a yield of 13.2% of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> was obtained.
