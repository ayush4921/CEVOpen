<p>Swiss albino mice weighing 20â€“30 g, six to nine weeks old, of both sexes were used with the approval of Research Ethics Committee of the College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University. The animals were obtained from Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), Addis Ababa. All experimental animal protocols were in agreement with the standards set for the care and use of experimental animals by Committee for Purpose and Control of Supervision of Experiments on Animals, and approved by the Department of Pharmacology Research and Ethics Review Committee.

 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Mice were kept in cages of suitable size, lined with easy wood serving as bedding (changed every 24 h), with natural night-daytime exposure and at room temperature. Before and during the experiment, the mice were allowed free access to standard mice pellets, made from ground animal food and tap water regularly. All the animal experiments were conducted at EHRI. Dose choice was dependent on single dose oral acute toxicity test, previous study of the crude aqueous extract,
