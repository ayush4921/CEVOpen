 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves were collected from Suluta, Oromia Region of Ethiopia located at 910ʹ 59.988” N and 3845ʹ 0.000” E and about 18 km north of Addis Ababa (capital city), Ethiopia. Then plant materials were cleaned and validated by a taxonomist at Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) and kept with voucher specimen GM-001 in the herbarium for future reference. Fresh leaves were washed with water from unnecessary materials, dried at room temperature, and size reduced by manual crusher to obtain the appropriate particle size that facilitate the extraction process.
