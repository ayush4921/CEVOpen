<p>Use of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> in diabetes has been reported in the literature along with several other traditional claims. In order to establish the scientific evidence for the utility of 
 <italic>T. schimperi in</italic> the management of DM, experimental study of the antihyperglycemic effects of the crude 80% methanol and aqueous leaves extracts were performed in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The increase in fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration is an important characteristic feature of DM.
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In this work the extract of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves lowered FBG level in diabetic mice. The aqueous and the 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves (dose: 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) were administered daily for three weeks to alloxan-induced diabetic mice. In this work, from around the end of the second week to the final week of treatment, significant fall of the BGL of the mice was observed gradually. Therefore, the current study showed that both the aqueous and the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves have a significant antidiabetic effect on alloxan-induced diabetic mice in a time and dose dependent manner.
