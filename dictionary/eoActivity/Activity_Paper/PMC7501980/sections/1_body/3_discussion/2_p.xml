<p>The result of the study indicated the potential antihyperglycemic effect of the extract. There are many possible explanations related to this finding. The inhibition of human digestive tract pancreatic α-amylase activity describes one of the treatment methods commonly used for the prevention and control of hyperglycemia in type 2 DM patients after food intake by dropping the absorption of glucose released by this enzyme from starch.
