 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Alloxan induce DM by destruction of pancreatic beta cells selectively via disruption of the cell membrane integrity. One of the mechanisms for its cell destruction is by intracellular generation of free radicals and this supported the study on the antioxidant property of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves in vitro and reported as the plant has the claimed activity.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore this property of the studied plant might have a role in controlling hyperglycemia of DM patients. Thus 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> may have a role in control of DM.
