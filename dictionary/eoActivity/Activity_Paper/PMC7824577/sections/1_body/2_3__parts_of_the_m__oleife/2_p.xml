<p>In the case of leaves, which have a high morphological similarity to ferns, according to Oyeyinka et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], they contain the greatest amount of nutrients compared to other parts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic>, especially in terms of protein content (19–29%). In addition, they are excellent as a source of vitamin E, vitamin A (four times more than the content of a carrot), vitamin C (in fresh leaves, the amount is seven times higher than in an orange), and vitamin B. They are also one of the best vegetable sources of minerals since their calcium content is very high for a plant (more than four times the amount of milk) and the iron content is very interesting; it becomes very useful against anemia. It also has high amounts of potassium—three times the amount of a banana—as shown in

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaf powder is higher than that of fresh leaves. This can be interesting, as dried leaves can be stored so their use is guaranteed throughout the year [
