<p>As for the roots, some studies [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have shown that certain root extracts contain analgesics called 
 <italic>Moringin</italic> and 
 <italic>Moringinine</italic> that may play a role in their effectiveness against lumbago at appropriate doses. The roots also have a food use; they can be used as a condiment or in sauces as they have a flavor very similar to horseradish [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, high consumption of roots, seeds, bark, and even leaves can be a health problem [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Depending on the dose and timing of consumption, alkaloids, especially those in the root and bark, can become toxic like spirochin and phytochemical bencil isothiocyanate [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The spirochin alkaloid can cause tachycardia at a dose of 35 mg/kg body weight and cause kidney damage at periodic doses above 46 mg/kg body weight. On the other hand, it is an effective prophylactic and antiseptic against wound infections by gram-positive bacteria, especially 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. Fibers, dyes, and tannins can be obtained from the bark for skin tanning [
