<p>It should be noted that 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves are a very rich source of essential amino acids, which are often lacking in many vegetables [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00031-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the main amino acids found in the dried leaves of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> compared to the amino acids contained in soybeans and beef. It is not usual for a vegetable to contain all these amino acids, and 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> contains them in a good proportion, these being very useful for our body. Therefore, 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves can be of great help to people who do not get protein from milk such as vegans or vegetarians. It even contains arginine and histidine, two amino acids especially important for newborns. Most children in sub-Saharan Africa are protein-deficient and 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> could be an extremely valuable source of food for treating malnutrition in poor countries. 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> has been found to have a higher content of amino acids than soybeans and beef in almost all the amino acids analyzed, except for lysine, methionine, and isoleucine, where beef has a higher content.
