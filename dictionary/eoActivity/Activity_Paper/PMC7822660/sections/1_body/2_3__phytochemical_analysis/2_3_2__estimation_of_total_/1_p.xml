<p>Total phenolic content of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extract and fractions was determined by the standard Folin–Ciocâlteu spectrophotometric method [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of each extract was added to 0.1 mL of Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent (0.5 N) and the contents of the flask were mixed thoroughly. Later, 2.5 mL of sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) was added, mixed, and incubated for 0.5 h. The optical density was measured at 760 nm utilizing UV-visible spectrophotometer. The total phenolic contents were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of the extract. For total flavonoids content, standard aluminium chloride spectrophotometric method according to [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used. In brief, 1 mL of each extract at a concentration of 1 mg/mL was taken. Then, 1 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (10%) was added sequentially. The test solution was vigorously shaken. Absorbance was recorded at 415 nm after 30 minutes of incubation.
