<p>428 grams of air-dried leaves was ground to a coarse powder using an electrical grinding mill and extracted by cold maceration in 1200 mL 80% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), at room temperature and allowed to stand overnight for 3-4 days with occasional shaking to produce crud extract; this process was repeated 3 successive times. Then, the crude extract was filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1 (Wagtech International Ltd., England) and concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor) under reduced pressure at 45 rpm and controlled temperature (40°C). After drying, a total of dry crud extracts, 133 grams, was kept in the refrigerator until use.</p>
