<p>The most prominent toxic effect of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> on zebrafish embryos (with almost all the extracts) was egg coagulation or mortality within few hours of exposure. 100% of treated embryos died within 6 hours of exposure at concentration in microgram range. The most toxic extract was hexane fraction which induced 100% mortality in treated embryos ≤0.7 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL followed by the crude extract where 100% mortality was observed with concentration ≤1.00 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL.
