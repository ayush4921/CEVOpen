<p>The methanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> has been shown to possess the antifertility activity in female rats. Reduction in the number of liters and early abortifacient and anti-implantation activity had also been observed in female rats which were treated with methanolic leaves extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The infertility activity of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extracts has not been investigated in adult zebrafish; however, the teratogenicity and delayed hatching of zebrafish embryos replicate the developmental toxicity phenotype which has been reported in rats.
