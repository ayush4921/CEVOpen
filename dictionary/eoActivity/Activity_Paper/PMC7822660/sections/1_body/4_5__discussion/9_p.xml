<p>The chemical composition analysis shows that 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol occupied 56% and methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid 23% of hexane fraction of leaves of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>. 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol is phytol, an acyclic diterpene alcohol. Phytol induced toxicity, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity in 
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> at concentrations of 2, 4, 8, and 16â€‰mM [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Phytol was reported to regulate the transcription factors PPAR-alpha and retinoid 
 <italic>X</italic> receptor (RXR) [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Phytol was identified as a major compound present in the leaf hexane fraction of 
 <italic>Clinacanthus nutans</italic> and it exerted severe toxicity in zebrafish embryos at microgram concentration [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Phytol has been graded as category 1 toxic compound which can induce acute and chronic toxicity in aquatic organisms (
