<p>It is well documented that there is direct relationship between phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity of herbal extracts [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In one study, the antioxidant (free radical scavenging) activity in 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> has been shown to be directly dependent on content of phenol flavonoid. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> showed 50.72% free radical scavenging activity at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of phenol and it increased to 92.45% at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, another study reported 82% of radical scavenging inhibition activity with 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>l while 80% with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of flower extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> [
