<p>The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity screening performed on zebrafish revealed that 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extracts were toxic towards the embryo's development and survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The survival rate and effect on embryonic development were carried out first after overnight exposure and then every 24 h by optical monitoring. The values obtained thus have proved the dose-dependent effects of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extracts on embryos mortality and survival curves during the 96 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, severe toxicity and teratogenic effects were observed in zebrafish embryos which were treated with either crude extracts or various fraction of 
 <italic>D. viscosa.</italic> The 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extracts turned out to be very toxic to zebrafish embryos at concentration less than micrograms and kill the treated embryos within 12 hours of exposure. The hexane fraction was most toxic with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.589 ± 0.30 µg/mL followed by crude extract with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values 0.684 ± 0.74. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values for butanol and chloroform fractions were 3.139 ± 0.57 and 3.953 ± 0.43 µg/mL. The zebrafish embryos which were treated with sub-lethal concentration (less than LD
 <sub>50</sub> values) exhibited severe embryonic abnormalities. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5</xref> shows the representative micrograph of control and treated embryos showing the teratogenic effect. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, the morphological features of mock treated embryos revealed a straight notochord, round yolk sac and pigmentation on the body and eyes, and normal heart shape and rate. The presence of pectoral fin in mock treated embryos at 72 h [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] verifies that the embryonic development in mock treated embryos is not hampered. The mock treated embryos also hatched normally ≤48 hpf. The zebrafish embryos treated with sub-lethal concentration (0.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) of crude extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> had bent spine, a large cardiac edema, and severe developmental delay as compared with mock treated counterpart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). The treated embryos did not hatch ≤48 hpf. The zebrafish embryos treated with sub-lethal concentration (3.00 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) of chloroform extract were mildly affected; however, the treated embryos had bent spine, large cardiac edema and cardiac looping (both chambers of the heart get connected with each other), and slow heart rate as compared to control embryos. The developmental stage criteria revealed a mild developmental delay in chloroform extract treated embryos; the presence of pectoral fin bud in these embryos showed that they are at 48 hpf of developmental stage. The zebrafish embryos treated with hexane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(e)</xref>) or butanol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(d)</xref>) extract showed severe developmental abnormalities. The treated embryos had bent spine, absence of pigmentation, large yolk sac, and cardiac edema. The embryos were severely developmentally delayed as compared to their mock treated counterpart. The undeveloped heart was observed in both of the extracts treated embryos. These embryos never hatched and also severe apoptosis was observed in these embryos as revealed by acridine orange staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).
