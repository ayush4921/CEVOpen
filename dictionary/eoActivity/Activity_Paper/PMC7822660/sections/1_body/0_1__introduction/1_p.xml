<p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest into the biological activity of traditional plant medicines, and the role of natural products in drug discovery [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Reasons for this include the great need for new molecular models, as this leads to potential new drugs, and for authenticating traditional applications for use in current therapy [

 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic> is an evergreen shrub belonging to the Sapindaceae family that consists of about 150 genera and 200 species [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Initially, it was a native of Australia and later widespread throughout the tropical regions [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> is widely found in the southern province, Hijaz region, and eastern region [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been accounted as one of the famous traditional remedies for wide verities of ailments like rheumatism, fractures, diarrheas, gout, hepatic or splenic pain, smooth muscles disorders (uterine pain), hemorrhoids, snake bites, and sore throat [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The literature review has shown that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> flower exhibits cytotoxic activity against breast cancer in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the anticancer activity of the ethanol extract through induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cell line has been reported [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, dodonaeasides A and B, triterpenoid saponins, were isolated from ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> roots and showed antiproliferative property against human ovarian cancer cell line [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Besides, the literature review revealed other biological activities of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> such as antimicrobial, antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], analgesic, antipyretic [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antifungal [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], gastroprotective [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antimalarial [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and antispasmodic activities [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, phytochemical screening has shown that 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> contains flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, sugars, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to the diverse biological properties 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> possesses, various remedies prepared from it are routinely used by humans to cure many ailments. Some studies have reported that 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> has not produced severe toxicity in experimental animals; however, the toxicity of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> on developing fetus in human, or in other experimental animals, is largely not known. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the developmental toxicity of various extracts prepared from the leaves of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in zebrafish embryos.
