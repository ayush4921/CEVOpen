  <p>The hexane fraction of leaves extract of 
   <italic>D. viscosa</italic> induced severe level of apoptosis in zebrafish embryos at 24â€‰hpf. The level of apoptosis was evaluated in live zebrafish embryos which were treated with hexane fraction of 
   <italic>D. viscosa</italic>. The hexane fraction induced severe embryonic toxicity; hence, the embryos treated with hexane fraction are shown. The live embryos are exposed to acridine orange as described in the methodology section. The images are taken by fluorescence microscope under FITC filter. Not many acridine orange positive (green) cells are observed in control (left image), whereas a lot of acridine positive cells are observed in zebrafish embryos which were treated with hexane fraction.
