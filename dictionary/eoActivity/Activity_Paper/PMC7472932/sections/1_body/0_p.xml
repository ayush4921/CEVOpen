<p>The term “natural product” refers to any naturally occurring substance, but it generally refers to a secondary metabolite (Morikawa, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Sicker et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Secondary metabolites, which are isolated from plants, animals, and microorganisms, are classified as polyketides, isoprenoids, steroids, aromatics, and alkaloids. Research into the discovery and synthesis of novel bio-functional natural products is a challenging, expensive, and time-consuming process (Pagare et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Seca and Pinto, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, research on natural products stimulates the development of novel separation techniques, spectroscopic approaches to structure elucidation, and synthetic methodologies. The chemical diversity and variety of bio-functional properties of natural products thus attracts attention from chemists, biochemists, and biologists (Morikawa, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The Research Topic on “Discovery and Total Synthesis of Bio-Functional Natural Products from Traditional Medicinal Plants” is intended to promote bio-functional natural products as candidates and/or leads for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and food additives. The field of this Research Topic includes natural products chemistry, phytochemistry, pharmacognosy, organic chemistry, food chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, chemical biology, molecular pharmacology, molecular nutritional sciences, and related fields of bio-functional natural products.
