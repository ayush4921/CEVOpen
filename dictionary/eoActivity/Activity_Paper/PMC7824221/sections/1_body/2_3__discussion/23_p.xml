<p>Notably, 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. are the most predominant endophytic effective species against plant pathogenic fungi, consistent with many published studies [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This is attributed to the potential of these species to produce diverse active metabolites and different lytic enzymes, such as amylase, protease, and chitinase, which attack the fungal cell wall [

 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. According to the obtained results, we can conclude that the endophytic strains 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 exhibited the highest activities, and therefore it could be used as bioinoculants and to examine their effects on
