<p>The indirect mechanisms include the enhancement of secondary metabolite secretion via plants, the induction of plant resistance, promotion or enhancement of plant growth, predation, and hyperparasites. In the current study, the tested endophytic bacteria had the potential to perform one or more of the previous mechanisms to improve plant growth and protection. The highest inhibition percentages of phytopathogens were mediated due to treatment with 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 recoding percentages of 48.9 ± 0.03% and 52.6 ± 0.15% for 
 <italic>F. oxysporum,</italic> 46 ± 0.09% and 50 ± 0.2% for 
 <italic>A. alternata,</italic> and 20 ± 0.2% and 24 ± 0.2% for 
 <italic>P. ultimum</italic>, respectively. According to phytopathogenic data, the obtained endophytic bacterial strains can be used to protect plant against most fungal pathogens.
