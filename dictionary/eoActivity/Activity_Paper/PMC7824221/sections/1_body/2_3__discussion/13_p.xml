<p>Our results supposed that the bacterial endophytes obtained in this study potentially regulate plant growth through IAA synthesis. Different species of endophytic microbes can produce variable levels of IAA in a way that differentially affects plant growth. Previously, Dobbelaere et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] observed that the IAA synthesized by various bacterial endophytes enhanced plant growth and, hence, promoted growth of the root area, which subsequently improved the nutrient uptake from the soil. Dawwam et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that bacterial endophytes synthesized various amounts of IAA ranging from 0.36 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 14.77 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and from 0.6 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10.73 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Two endophytic fungi, 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, and non-spore-forming fungus were isolated from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>Asclepias sinaica</italic> and were found to exhibit high IAA productions ranging between 100 and 160 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and displayed a significant increase in the root length of maize plants [
