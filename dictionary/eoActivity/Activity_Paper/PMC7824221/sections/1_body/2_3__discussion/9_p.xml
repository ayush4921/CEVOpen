<p>Endophytic microbes that produce IAA have a significant role in mutualistic interactions between the host plant and endophytes and, hence, regulate the plant growth [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Data analysis showed that the efficacy of endophytic bacteria in producing high IAA concentrations was significantly improved with increasing tryptophan levels. L-tryptophan is a physiological precursor to auxin production in microorganisms and higher plants.
