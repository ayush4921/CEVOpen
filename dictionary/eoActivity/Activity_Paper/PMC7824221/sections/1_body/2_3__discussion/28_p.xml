<p>Endophytic bacterial inoculation increased N and K ions, however, this was not significant compared with the controls. The availability of nutrients such as P, N, and K, due to inoculation by plant growth-promoting bacteria, can be attributed to the efficacy of the synthesis of organic acids that increase nutrient uptake [

The enhanced nutrient uptake can be attributed to the efficacy of bacterial endophytes to synthesize growth regulators at the root interface, which improves root development and increases the adsorption of nutrients and water from the soil [
