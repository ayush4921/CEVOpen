<p>In the current study, 15 bacterial endophytes were obtained from the surface-sterilized healthy leaves of the medicinal plant 
 <italic>P. incisa.</italic> These bacteria are related to two major phyla, proteobacteria represented by 33.3% of the total isolates and firmicutes, represented by 66.6%. In the same regard, Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed that the endophytic strains obtained from leaves of 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> belonged to proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria with a percentage of 36.7%, 32.9%, and 29.7% of the total bacterial isolates, respectively.
