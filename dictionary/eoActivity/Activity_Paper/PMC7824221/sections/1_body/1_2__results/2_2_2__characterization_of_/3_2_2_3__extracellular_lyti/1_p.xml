<p>Data showed that all endophytic strains were able to produce xylanase, cellulase, and catalase, while only four strains were positive for the amylase enzyme. In the same regard, six bacterial strains were positive for protease and five were positive for the chitinase enzyme. Notably, the highest amylase, protease, xylanase, and chitinase production were assigned to the endophytic bacterial strain 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 with clear zones of 12.8 ± 0.2, 17.5 ± 0.3, 16 ± 0.1, and 15 ± 0.2 mm, respectively, followed by the bacterial strains 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 and 
 <italic>Paenibacillus barengoltzii</italic> PI-12. Analysis of variance showed that the endophytic strains PI-8 and PI-10 still possessed the highest enzymatic activities (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) compared with other endophytic strains (
