<p>The obtained results highlighted the potency of isolated bacterial endophytes for ammonia production. This potentiality varied between low to high ammonia production based on the color change of the inoculated growth media after adding Nessler’s reagent. The analysis showed that four endophytic bacterial strains, identified as 
 <italic>Agrobacterium fabrum</italic> PI-1, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter radioresistant</italic> PI-3, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8, and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10, could solubilize inorganic phosphate, forming clear zones ranging between 5.6 ± 0.4 and 9.8 ± 0.8 mm. Endophytic strains of PI-8 and PI-10 had the highest efficacy in ammonia production and phosphate-solubilizing activity (
