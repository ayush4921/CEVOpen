<p>The proteobacterial strains belonged to α, γ, and β and were identified as 
 <italic>Agrobacterium fabrum</italic> (two strains coded PI-1 and PI-2), 
 <italic>Acinetobacter radioresistant</italic> (two strains coded PI-3 and PI-4), and 
 <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> (one strain coded PI-15), respectively, while the firmicutes strains were related to 
 <italic>Brevibacillus brevis</italic> (three strains coded PI-5 to PI-7), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (two strains coded PI-8 and PI-9), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (two strains coded PI-10 and PI-11), and 
 <italic>Paenibacillus barengoltzii</italic> (three strains coded PI-12 to PI-14). According to these identifications, we selected one strain from each species to confirm their identification using 16S rRNA (16S ribosomal RNA) gene fragments sequence analysis.
