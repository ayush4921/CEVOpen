<p>Molecular identification was carried out on the basis of amplification and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene, where genomic DNA was extracted according to the modified method [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and the PCR protocol was achieved according to [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, individual colonies from bacterial growth plate were picked up using a sterile toothpick and resuspended in 50 μL of sterile deionized H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The cell suspension was set in a water bath at 97 °C and heated for 10 min, the cell lysate was forced (15,000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min), and the upper layer containing the DNA was recovered. The content of extracted DNA was calculated by detecting its absorbance at 260 nm using a UV spectrophotometer. A fragment of 16S rDNA was PCR-amplified using the bacterial universal primers 27f (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492r (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). The PCR tube contained 1 × PCR buffer, 0.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2.5 U 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (QIAGEN Inc., Germantown, MD, USA), 0.25 mM dNTP (Deoxynucleoside triphosphate), 0.5 μM primer, and approximately 5 ng of bacterial genomic DNA.
