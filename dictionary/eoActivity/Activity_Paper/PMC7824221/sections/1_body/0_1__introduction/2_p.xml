<p>Endophytes are a group of symbiotic microorganisms vastly spread through all plants, and they colonize the intracellular and intercellular spaces of the host plant without causing any considerable morphological modification or visional infection [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The endospheric microbes produce secondary active metabolites that protect plants from phytopathogens, in addition to exo-enzyme production, which could be aiding plant colonization. Endophytes may enhance plant growth by phytohormone production and support plant growth under adverse biotic and abiotic stress [
