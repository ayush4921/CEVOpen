<p>Plant growth-promoting endophytes (PGPE) inhabit various plant tissues and form a useful relationship that facilitates the nutrient exchange and improves other activities [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Phytohormone production by endophytes is one of the best-studied mechanisms of plant growth promotion, leading to morphological and architectural changes in plant hosts [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Endophytic microbes possess the pivotal ability to solubilize insoluble phosphate and to supply nitrogen to their host plants [

Endophytes colonize various plant tissues without any symptomatic disease and, thus, compete with phytopathogens for the same environmental niches. Therefore, endophytes improve plant growth performance and plant health through various mechanisms and may contribute to protecting the plants against phyto-pathogenesis [
