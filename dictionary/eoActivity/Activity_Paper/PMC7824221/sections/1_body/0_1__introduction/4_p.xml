<p>Endophytic microbes produce many bioactive compounds that have different biological activities that can be plant growth-promoting (PGP) directly or indirectly. Most plants harbor endophytes within their tissue; however, the information available on PGPE and its biological activities is not proportional to the high distribution of endophytes. A superior understanding of the native microbial endophytes in plants may clarify their capabilities and their potential in promoting plant growth and creating a sustainable system for crop production [
