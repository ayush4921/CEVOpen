<p>The present study showed that the medicinal plant of 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic>, which naturally inhabits arid conditions, is an ecological niche for diverse putative bacterial endophytes. The isolated bacterial endophytes were related to 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter, Brevibacillus, Bacillus, Paenibacillus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Burkholderia.</italic> These endophytes displayed various direct and indirect mechanisms for plant growth promotion, including IAA production, extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities, ammonia production, and the solubilization of phosphate, as well as in vitro antagonistic activities against three phytopathogenic fungi.
