<p>Polyphenolic and flavonoid compounds are the chemical structure containing multiple hydroxyl substituents on an aromatic ring. Due to their structure, polyphenol compounds are good electron and proton donors. They are capable to scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress by transferring H-atom from their hydroxyl group(s) to free radicals [

Previous studies revealed that the possession of multiple hydroxyl groups that attached to the aromatic ring manipulated the antioxidant activity as a free radical scavenging and metal ion chelating site; the more they have hydroxyl groups the more they are antioxidant [

 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract contained a polyphenolic content of 104.88 ± 0.8 mg GAE equivalent per gram of extract and flavonoid content of 35.35 ± 1.82 mg QE equivalent per gram of extract. Therefore, the presence of polyphenolic and flavonoid contents in the leaf extract may contribute to its antioxidant activity.
