<p>In this study, hydrogen peroxide, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, was used to induce cell death. Human fibroblasts and keratinocytes were used to determine the sublethal dose of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). We found that human fibroblast was more sensitive to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity than human keratinocytes. The treatment of 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on fibroblast cells led to 50.5 ± 2.45% viability, while keratinocyte exhibited 51.14 ± 3.52% viability upon 2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment. The treatment of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract showed negligible cytotoxicity and minimal cell proliferative capacity on both cell lines all over the range of the extract concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The selected sublethal hydrogen peroxide dose was used to treat each cell line, and the capability of the leaf extract to rescue the hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity was monitored. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment alone (negative control) was used to induce oxidative stress damage in the cell, while 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract treatment alone (positive control) showed minimal cytotoxicity in the cell (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). Upon the treatment of the extract, the cytotoxicity of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage was recovered in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. The treatment of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of the extract could rescue the cytotoxicity more than 27% compared with negative control, and the recovery was found to have no significant difference from the positive control. Together, this suggested that 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract could ameliorate the human fibroblast and keratinocyte oxidative stress induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Next, we further tested whether the protective effect of the leaf extract relates to the intracellular ROS scavenging or else. We stained the cells with a cell-permeant dye, DCFH-DA, and determined the fluorescence intensity (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>). The amount of intracellular ROS was showed in relation with vehicle control treatment, 0.1% DMSO. Oxidative stress injury in human fibroblasts was induced by 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, while oxidative stress injury in human keratinocytes was induced with 2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The relative amount of fluorescence was analyzed in each cell line separately. Compared with vehicle control, the treatment of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract did not increase the intracellular ROS production in both cell lines, while H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> could induce ROS generation about two times more in human keratinocytes and five times more in human fibroblasts. This also correlated with the previous results showing that human fibroblast was more sensitive to oxidative stress injury than keratinocytes, even when they were treated with the lower H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> dose. We found that the treatment of the leaf extract reduced cellular ROS in both cell lines. The decrease of cellular ROS was observed even in the lowest test dose (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and it continued to decrease ROS in a dose-related manner. Upon the supplement of the highest test dose (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of the extract onto H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced ROS generation, the amount of cellular ROS was not significantly different from no oxidative stress damage (the condition of no H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment), suggesting that the leaf extract could scavenge the intracellular ROS in both cell lines, in which its protective effect might correspond with the cellular oxidative stress (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref>).
