<p>The antioxidant property of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract was determined by DPPH scavenging assay compared to a standard, vitamin E derivative (Trolox). The leaf extract exhibited DPPH radical scavenging effect in a dose-dependent manner. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the leaf extract was 4.85 mg/mL or equaled to 98.96 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol Trolox equivalents per gram of extract (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). The ability of DPPH radical scavenging indicated its ability to donate protons to DPPH and subsequently neutralize free radicals. Along with the generation of ROS during inflammation, iron is part of an interplay involving the generation of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions from iron redox cycling reaction (Fenton and Haber-Weiss reaction) [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We showed that the leaf extract possessed an iron chelating property. Relative to the chelating agent, EDTA, 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract had a ferrous ion chelating property with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 21.39 mg/mL or equaled to 22.39 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol EDTA equivalent per gram of extract (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>), suggesting that the leaf extract may lower the metal-induced radical formation and subsequently prevent the cellular oxidative damage in the prolonged inflammation.
