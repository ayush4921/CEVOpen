<p>The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide is present in chronic wound healing as well as several chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In this study, we showed that the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract could alleviate the cytotoxicity from hydrogen peroxide exposure, in vitro. It also had beneficial effects on wound healing process by promoting the migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Due to the easiness and low cost of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> maintenance, this could accommodate the usage of this medicinal plant as a natural antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent, and wound care product. However, further study is needed to investigate the other wound healing mechanism of the leaf extract.
