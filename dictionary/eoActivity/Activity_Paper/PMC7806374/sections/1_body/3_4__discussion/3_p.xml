<p>Nowadays, the usage of plant-based medication is increasing. In this study, we were interested in the effect of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract on the modulation of oxidative stress damage and its related wound healing properties. In ancient times, this medicinal plant was used to reduce the swelling and itching from an insect bite. This suggested its ability to decrease the inflammatory process. Recent studies have revealed the metabolic profile of the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract and its ability to enhance wound healing in vivo [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, it has not been tested in the cell culture model yet, especially its antioxidant properties and its role on cell migratory effect. In this present study, we showed that the leaf extract possessed considerable polyphenolic and flavonoid contents. The leaf extract could rescue cell survival in hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress damage. Following the tests of antioxidant assays, the leaf extract was capable to decrease free radicals and chelate the ferrous ions. Fibroblasts were very sensitive to the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage than keratinocytes. The cytotoxicity of fibroblast may result in the lack of extracellular matrix deposition, hampering wound contraction, and delaying tissue remodeling process. Here, we have first demonstrated that 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract could reduce the oxidative stress damage in both human fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines.
