<p>Severe nonhealing wounds could lead to infection and amputation. The estimated prevalence of global chronic wounds was 2.21 cases per 1,000 population [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The cost of wound management was estimated to be around 28 to 96 billion US dollars annually [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The treatment of a wound appeared to be expensive, especially in chronic, nonhealing wounds which sustain the cost for a longer period. Due to the high economic burden, several countries increase the use of phytomedicine in chronic wounds as they have an affordable price. Although natural products possibly have higher safety concerns than chemical-based therapy, potential property, activity, and validation by scientific methods need to be determined. Previously, natural products such as honey, chamomile, rosemary, and turmeric were used as therapeutic agents for reducing inflammation in wound management [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For instance, chamomile has been used as a wound care product under the trade name “
 <italic>Kamillosan</italic>.” It accelerates tissue epithelization which results in wound drying and also acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The other well-known natural product for wound care is honey. Its medicinal properties are related to the effects of antioxidants and anti-inflammation that restricted the oxidative injury and advanced the wound healing process [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The antioxidant properties of natural products from plants were related to the enrichment of polyphenol constitutes [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to the chemical structure of phenolic compounds, it scavenges free radicals by transferring electrons and H-atoms from their OH-group(s) to the free radicals thereby exhibiting antioxidant property [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Besides scavenging free radicals, phenolic compounds also scavenge nonradical reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide by donating electrons and H-atoms to hydrogen peroxide which can subsequently be converted to water molecules [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a good electron and proton donor, the phenolic compound acts as a chelator of several transition metal ions such as zinc (Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>), iron (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), and copper (Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>) which is beneficial for lowering metal-induced oxidative stress injury. Moreover, previous studies found that the polyphenolic compound reduced the activity of enzymes involved in ROS formation [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Polyphenols also temper the immune response by modulation of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Besides the anti-inflammation and antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds, they have been found to enhance fibroblast migration which promotes the wound repairing process, although the mechanism of action has not been described yet [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
