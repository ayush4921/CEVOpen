<p>Human keratinocyte and fibroblast were seeded on a 24-well plate with a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. The adherent cell layer was scratched with a sterile tip and treated with various concentrations of the leaf extract. The images of the scratched area were captured at 15 hours after scratching and then analyzed with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, US). The percentage of cell migration to cover the scratched area was calculated and presented as a relative number to time zero.
