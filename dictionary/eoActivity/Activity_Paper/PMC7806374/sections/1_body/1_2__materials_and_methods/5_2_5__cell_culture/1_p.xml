<p>Human fibroblast cell line HFb (ATCC® CRL-2429™, USA) was purchased from ATCC, USA. Human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was purchased from Cell Lines Service, Germany. HFb was grown in DMEM with high-glucose complete medium and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. HaCaT was grown in DMEM with high-glucose complete medium and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 5 mL of Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution. The cultures were rinsed with PBS solution before dissociated with 0.125% trypsin-EDTA. The cell suspensions were plated and cultured in a plastic 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After seeding, the cells were allowed for growth for 24 hours before performing further experiments.
