 <sub>4</sub>. Ferrozine is a chromophoric complexing agent that selectively binds with ferrous ions to form a stable water-soluble compound, which has an absorbance at 562 nm. To determine the chelating activity, the leaf extract was added into the reaction and the decrease of absorbance was evaluated. EDTA, a versatile chelating agent, was used as a reference.
