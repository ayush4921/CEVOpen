<p>The free radical scavenging activity was measured by DPPH scavenging assay. DPPH is a stable free radical and a strong purple color which can be measured by a spectrophotometer [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the presence of antioxidant compounds, the DPPH became discolored by receiving an electron or hydrogen atom. To identify the antioxidant property of the leaf extract, the decrease of DPPH absorbance was determined. Briefly, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract was mixed with 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DPPH solution in a 96-well plate and the absorbance was measured at 515 nm. Trolox, a vitamin E derivative, was used as a reference. The antioxidant activity was calculated as the percentage of scavenging activity.
