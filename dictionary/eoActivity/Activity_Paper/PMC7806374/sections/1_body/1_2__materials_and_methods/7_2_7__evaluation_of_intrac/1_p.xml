<p>The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen, CA, USA). In brief, this assay is based on the oxidation of the nonfluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) by intracellular ROS to yield the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Keratinocytes (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (HFb) cells were seeded on a 96-well plate at a density of 25 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well in 10% FBS in DMEM medium and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. After that, cells were treated with the leaf extract for 2 hours before hydrogen peroxide was added and further incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. The medium was then removed and stained with DCFH-DA for 1 hour. The staining medium was then removed and followed by one time washing with 1x PBS buffer, and the fluorescence intensity was immediately analyzed at excitation and emission of 485 and 528 nm. The fluorescence intensity reflected the intracellular ROS formation. The data were represented as fold changes relative to vehicle control, and the generation of ROS was analyzed in each cell separately.
