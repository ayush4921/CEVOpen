<p>The total phenolic content of the leaf extract was determined by the colorimetric method as described by Slinkard and Singleton [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of methanol leaf extract or the reference standard gallic acid was dissolved in 790 
 <italic>μ</italic>L deionized water. The mixture was then mixed with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L Folin-Ciocalteu's phenol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before adding 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L saturated Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and further incubated at room temperature for 50 minutes. The total polyphenol contents were measured at a wavelength of 750 nm and expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of extract.
