<p id="para0048">Another crucial trace element Copper has also been reported to have a key role in growth and differentiation of immune cells (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The intracellular concentration of copper modulates the influenza virus life cycle and a thujaplicin-copper chelate suppresses the multiplication of human influenza virus (

 <xref rid="bib0156" ref-type="bibr">Miyamoto et al., 1998</xref>). Another observation made by 
 <xref rid="bib0231" ref-type="bibr">Turnlund et al. (2004)</xref> was that there was an elevation in activity of SOD, plasma ceruloplasmin ad benzykamine oxidase activity in response to higher doses of copper i.e. 7.8 mg/day in comparison to 1.6 mg/day. It was further elucidated that there was a considerable reduction in circulation of neutrophils, antibiotic titers and serum IL-2R against the Beijing strain influenza infestation. Magnesium also has an imperative participation in scheming immune functions in infected cell
