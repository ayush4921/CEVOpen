<p id="para0013">The natural reservoir for both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats; however, these viruses infect humans through an intermediate host. Palm civets are supposed to be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV while dromedary camels are of MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0258" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Wunderink, 2018</xref>).Unfortunately, the exact zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still elusive. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 88% nucleotide homology with two SARS-like CoV found in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and 96% with RaTG13 virus found in horseshoe bat (

 <xref rid="bib0266" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). Despite the 96% nucleotide similarity, the RBD of both the viruses varies significantly (
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie and Smith, 2020</xref>). However, due to the ecological separation of the bats from the humans and the requirement of some necessary mutations in the virus genome to cross the species barrier, SARS-CoV-2 likely has one or more mammalian intermediate hosts for efficient animal-to-human transmission (
 <xref rid="bib0263" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Holmes, 2020</xref>). Analyses of interactions between RBD in SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors in different hosts indicate that pangolins, snakes, and turtles may be the immediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Recent phylogenetic studies on the genome of Pangolin-CoV found from dead Malayan pangolins, which are illegally imported in China revealed that its genome is about 91% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and around 90% to RaTG13 (Bat-CoV). Besides, five of the six amino acids (contact residues) on RBD, vital for binding to ACE2 receptors on hosts are consistent between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, but only four between Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 and only one out of six between SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest the probability of pangolins as natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib0261" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>).More and more studies with a wider sampling of mammals from China's wildlife markets or that are in close contact with humans like these are needed to resolve intermediate hosts of SARS- CoV-2 (
