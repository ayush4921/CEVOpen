<p id="para0053">Apart from this, a herbal formulation mainly triterpenes or steroid named 'triptolide' derived from thunder god vine also inhibited RAC followed by blocking PAK1 route (
 <xref rid="bib0146" ref-type="bibr">Maruta and Ahn, 2017</xref>). This medicine was previously treating the patients infected with dengue virus in restricting the proliferation of virus in lungs by blocking PAK1 signaling cascade (
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Liou et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, due to its lower water solubility, few years back, its -OH group was phosphorylated to enhance its solubility (
 <xref rid="bib0178" ref-type="bibr">Patil et al., 2015</xref>). Resultantly, phosphotase-receptive pro-drug of triptolide 'Minnelide' is currently under clinical trials to cure COVID-19 infections as well. Another compound ivermectin has been screened from bacteria but with some lethal effects. Interestingly, these ill-effects were removed later by chemically re-designing the compound. Further, it was pragmatically involved to impede various parasitic infections, cancers etc. eventually causing the impairment of PAK1, which encompasses its anti-cancerous properties (
 <xref rid="bib0077" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2009</xref>). As a consequence, it could be a good option to counteract coronaviral infection, however, a recent study found the role of Ivermectin to occlude COVID-19 incidence in Vero cell cultures (
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Caly et al., 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, 'Artemisinin', an anti-malarial component originated from plant herb 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> also showed its active property against malaria and other viral diseases (
 <xref rid="bib0211" ref-type="bibr">Sicard et al., 2011</xref>). This is however, concerned with the host cells rather than pathogen itself. To illustrate, PAK1 upregulation has been observed on the basis of AM-RAS mediated suppression (PAK1-upstream) and RAF in T-cells (PAK1-RAS downstream) (
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Maruta, 2014</xref>). The dihydro derivatives of AM deactivates the virak infection through upregulation of CKD inhibitor p21 respectively (
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Maruta, 2014</xref>). Additionally, reddish peppercorns (ethanol-water extract) was also found active against PAK1 and cyclin D1 in NF1-deprived negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB231). It was also found to suppress MPNST-cell lines where PAK1 was peculiarly initiated (
 <xref rid="bib0083" ref-type="bibr">Hirokawa et al., 2006</xref>). Concurrently, this extract in the form of tea would enable prevention and cure of COVID-19 incidence owing to its contribution in PAK1 blocking. The basic formulations of these peppercorns in boosting immune system and impeding inflammation during viral infections have also been investigated (
 <xref rid="bib0094" ref-type="bibr">Jie et al., 2019</xref>). Above all, a peptide namely FK228, identified from soil microbe has been found to restrict the expansion of RAS (pancreatic/colon cancer) carrying oncogenic mutant (K-RAS) respectively (
 <xref rid="bib0163" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima et al., 1998</xref>). Later, it was also reported to deactivate histone deacetylases and PAK1 in different cancer cell lines. This mainly comprise of breast cancer cell lines as well as NF1-deprived Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST) to restrain their proliferation in xenografts of mice (
 <xref rid="bib0082" ref-type="bibr">Hirokawa et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, possessing all these features it was approved to cure rare cancer disease cutaneous lymphoma and commercialised as 'Isodax' in market. However, research is being conducted with the belief that it could be most probably utilized for COVID-19 therapy. It is need of an hour to clinically test various PAK1-blockers against blocking virus replication to develop anti-COVID-19 therapy for patients suffering worldwide.
