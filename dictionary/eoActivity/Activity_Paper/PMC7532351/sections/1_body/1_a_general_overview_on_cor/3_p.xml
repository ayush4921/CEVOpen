<p id="para0012">Although, SARS-CoV-2 shows greater human-to-human transmission efficiency, its crude fatality rate (0.25% to 5%) is comparatively far less than that of SARS-CoV which is approx. 10%. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has R
 <sub>0</sub> (basic reproduction number) of 4.7 to 6.6. This highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the fact that its spike (S) protein possess 10 to 20 time's greater affinity for ACE2 receptors than SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0264" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, 2020</xref>). S-protein is the surface glycoprotein that assists the virus in the attachment to the host cells through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-protein has several domains, one of the sections termed as ectodomain has two subunits, S1 and S2, which form a crown-like structure around the virus (

Besides, S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin-like cleavage site at the S1–S2 junction, missing in other members of its sister clade. This additional cleavage site might also be responsible for greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 as it also occurs in highly infectious form of influenza virus but lacking in less pathogenic ones (
