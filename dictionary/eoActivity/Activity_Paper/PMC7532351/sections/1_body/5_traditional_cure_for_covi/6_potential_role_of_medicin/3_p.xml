<p id="para0036">A wide spectrum of studies is being conducted to design a formulation against coronavirus with the aid of medicinal plants. The pages of history stand testimony to the fact that diversity of medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Indigofera tinctoria, Evolvulus alsinoides, Vitex trifolia, Pergularia daemi, Gymnema sylvestre, Clerodendrumineme, Abutilon indicum, Clitoria tematea, Leucas Aspera, Sphaeranthus indicus, Allium sativum, Cassia alata</italic> showed an anti-mice coronavirus activity (SARS-CoV) (
 <xref rid="bib0239" ref-type="bibr">Vimalanathan et al., 2009</xref>). Amid them, 
 <italic>V. trifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>S. indicus</italic> plummeted inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB pathway, insinuated for respiratory discomfort in SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0217" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>C. tematea</italic> was recognised as MT (Metalloprotease) inhibitor, ADAM17, which is linked with shredding ACE-2 enzyme, often associated with virus replication (
 <xref rid="bib0136" ref-type="bibr">Maity et al., 2012</xref>). Further, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> have also been found to impede viral replication against SARS-CoV, while 
 <italic>C. ineme</italic> was potentially observed to deactivate viral ribosome machinery, revealing its utility against testing SARS-CoV-2-protein translation and protein synthesis (
 <xref rid="bib0169" ref-type="bibr">Nourazarian et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0103" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, 
 <italic>Strobilanthes cusia</italic> also blocked the RNA synthesis of viral species and mediated papain like proteases activities in order to target HCoV (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). In Asia, mountainous zones are lavishly flourished with plants with medicinal value against various respiratory disorders (
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Amber et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, 
 <italic>Hyoscyamus niger, Verbascum thapsus, Cynara scolymus, Justicia adhatoda</italic> were found to attack the molecules bulging among SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus and found to inhinit Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Gilani et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, it could earmark 
 <italic>orf3</italic> (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel), stimulating other downstream pathways against viral attack. Notably, various herbal plants showed restraining affects against ACE, for example, 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum, Punica granatum, Boerhaavia diffusa, Cassia occidentalis, Coscinium fenestratum, Embeliaribes</italic> etc. (
 <xref rid="bib0086" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0106" ref-type="bibr">Khan and Kumar, 2019</xref>). Research is currently being focussed on these plants to scrutinize their effects on COVID-19. Another tropical species 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>in South Asia depicted sturdy competence against viral infections (
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Yarnell, 2018</xref>). More recently, 
 <xref rid="bib0126" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2020a)</xref>, found that 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> repressed NOD-like receptor Proteins (NLRP3), IL-1β, C-1 (Caspase-1) molecules, comprehensively associated with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Also, 
 <italic>Salacia oblonga</italic> reflected inhibitory effects on angiotensin II having direct link with bronchitis and lung damage (
 <xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, many herbal plants used to treat HIV proteases can also be a suitable candidate for COVID-19. To expedite, 
 <italic>Acacia nilotica, Ocimum sanctum, Eugenia jambolana, Vitex negundo, Euphorbia granulate, Ocimum kikim, Ocimum scharicum, Solanum nigrum</italic> etc. were effective against HIV-reverse transcriptase activityand can be potent for SARS-CoV-2 too (
 <xref rid="bib0154" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Rege and Chowdhary, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0162" ref-type="bibr">NAIR, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0224" ref-type="bibr">Thayil Seema and Thyagarajan, 2016</xref>). Further, 
 <italic>Sambucus ebulus</italic> also attack the enveloped viruses, thereby, should be tested to study its target action against this virus (
 <xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">Ganjhu et al., 2015</xref>).
