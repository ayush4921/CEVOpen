<p id="para0020">The traditional medicines have been in general disregarded in the novel research and expansion of contemporary drugs due to the fact that their translational ability is commonly underrated. These medicines are considered vague in the context of their usage in the non-western medical technologies (

 <xref rid="bib0176" ref-type="bibr">Parasuraman et al., 2014</xref>). It has been frequently indicated that 70-80% of the people belonging to the developing countries are directly dependent on the herbal drug for their primary healthcare in comparison to the modern synthetic drugs (

The exploration for innovative phytochemical with antiviral bioactivity has frequently been substandard and inefficient due to adaptive viral resistance accompanied by viral latency and persistent infections in patients with compromised immunity (
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Sumithira et al., 2012</xref>). Most of the antiviral therapeutics modules are non-specific in their action towards viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2015</xref>). The progression in development of novel antiviral mediators is the foremost concern of the medical research at present. The antiviral bioactivities of plethora of medicinal plants plays a remarkable role in diverse stages of virus growth (
