<p id="para0032">The polysaccharides are a structurally multifaceted class of biomolecules that have diverse physiochemical characteristics which forms the foundation of its varied application in the field of medicine and pharmaceutical sciences (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Olafsdottir and Ingólfsdottir, 2001</xref>). The polysaccharides are isolated from plants sources including tree exudates, roots, cell walls and seeds as well as animal sources including chitin, chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan). In addition to this, several bacterial and fungal sources such as hydrocolloids including xanthan, wellan and gellan are the major sources of natural polysaccharides (

Another significant resource of polysaccharides is algae i.e. mucopolysaccharides and storage polysaccharides have been largely extracted from them. Macroalagae in the form of seed weeds are the major reservoirs of these polysaccharides (
