<p id="para0027">Amongst many groups of substances polyphenols display a wide range of biological activities. Polyphenols are known to increase the immune to cells to foreign infestations and in response permits cellular accumulation of different types of polyphenols through varied receptors. This subsequently triggers signaling pathways and initiate immune responses (

 <sup>pro</sup>) inhibitors in an in-silico study conducted by 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Adem et al. (2020)</xref>. In this study, efficiency of medicinal plants based on bioactive constituent's viz. flavonoids was analyzed against COVID-19 Mpro and was carried by using molecular docking technique. The COVID-19 virus was docked with 80 different flavonoids and the results indicated that compound such as rutin, apiin, hesperidin, diosmin and diacetylcurcumin etc. had an effective inhibitory effect on protease enzyme and they might have a role in lowering the symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
