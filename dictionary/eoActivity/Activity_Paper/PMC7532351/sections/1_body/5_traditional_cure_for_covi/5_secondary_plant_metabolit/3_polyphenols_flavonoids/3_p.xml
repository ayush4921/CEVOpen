<p id="para0028">An imperative class of plant secondary metabolites is flavonoids with antiviral therapeutic potential with more than 5000 different compounds identified and described (
 <xref rid="bib0237" ref-type="bibr">Ververidis et al., 2007</xref>). These secondary metabolites are considered one of the most profusely present polyphenols in the human diet and are generally found as glycosides and acylglycosides in vegetables and fruits. There are wide array of flavonoids present naturally in plants including quercetin, naringin, hesperetin and catechin and they have been analyzed for their activity against plethora of animal viruses such as HSV-1, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 3 and polio-virus type 1 (

The anti-viral activity of flavonoids was reported earlier, against Rous sarcoma, pseudorabies, adenoviruses and Sindbis (Chiang et al., 2003), and also against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Yi et al. 2004). The main mechanism by which they suppress the viral infection is by inhibition of cellular receptor kinases including MAPKs, the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3-K) and as consequence interferes with the cellular signal transduction cascades (
