<p id="para0030">Baicalin, another significant flavones glucuronide extracted from 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> genus has been reported to have antioxidative and anti-apoptotic activity and it has been employed in treatment of diseases like pulmonary atrial hypertension. The anti-SARS-CoV potential of baicalin was initially observed by

 <italic>in-vitro</italic>. The in-silico experimentation with baicalin resulted in stimulation of certain compounds that suppressed the COVID-19 infection as a consequence of ACE2 enzyme activation (

Hesperidin rich citrus peel from the waste were used in the study which underwent hydrodynamic cavitation-based speedy expansion and act as antiviral agent against COVID-19 (
