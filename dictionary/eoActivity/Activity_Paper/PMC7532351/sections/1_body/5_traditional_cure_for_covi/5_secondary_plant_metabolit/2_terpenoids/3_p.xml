<p id="para0026">In a recent report by 
 <xref rid="bib0204" ref-type="bibr">Shaghaghi (2020)</xref> the structure of terpinoid constituents and COVID-19 protease was elucidated from the different databases such as PubChem and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Followed by this, the sophisticated technique of molecular docking was utilized by employing MVD (molegro virtual docker) software. 9 and different terpenes were analyzed for their inhibitory effects. These included thymoquinone extracted from 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>. Molecular dynamic simulations have also shown that thymoquinone can interact with the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain b (SBDb) to stress cells and thus reduce the possibility of infection (

 <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic>, Bilobalide and Ginkgolide A extracted from 
 <italic>Gingko biloba</italic>, citral from 
 <italic>Backhousia citriodora</italic>, menthol from 
 <italic>Mentha</italic>, Noscapine extracted from Papaveraceae family, Forscolin from 
 <italic>Plectranthus barbatus</italic> and Beta Selinene from 
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic>. The fallout of this experiment illustrated the strapping interactions of terpenoids in the two enzymatically secluded regions. The fastening of varied amino acids as they were present in the secluded regions of the active site in all the 9 compounds was observed and plays a significant function in enzymatic catalysis. It was further revealed in the study that terpenoids were able to successfully suppress the virus protease enzyme activity. Another report by Chowdhary et al. (2003), suggested antiretroviral and anticancer activities of Betulinic acid a pentacyclic triterpenoid which was extracted from the bark of white 
 <italic>Betula alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>pubescens</italic> tree. The betulinic acid was observed to cause apoptosis by modulation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascade and subsequently resulted in activation of caspase enzyme, changes in mitochondrial membrane and DNA fragmentation (
