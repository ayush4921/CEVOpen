<p id="para0017">Host's immune responses initiate as soon as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors and releases viral RNA for replication. Both the innate and adaptive immune response could be triggered in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). However, immune responses are different between severely and moderately infected persons. In a blood sample of symptomatic hospitalised patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection before resolution of symptoms, immunological changes such as increase in the number of activated CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ killer T cells, follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and antibodies particularly IgG (
 <bold>Immunoglobulin G)</bold>and IgM 
 <bold>(Immunoglobulin M) were detected</bold> (

On the other hand, in severely infected patients, lymphocytopenia is a common denominator with substantial fall in numbers of natural killer cells, B cells, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, CD8+ killer T cells along with the increase in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein levels. Additionally, in comparison to the non-severe patients, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), monocytechemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP1-alpha) are often reported to be elevated in serum levels of critically ill patients (

 <xref rid="bib0243" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). The elevated ratio of NLR, which is a biomarker of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, points to the devastated inflammatory state of ICU patients (
 <xref rid="bib0198" ref-type="bibr">Salciccioli et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, uncontrolled levels of cytokines and chemokines cause over-active inflammatory responses or cytokine storm. This hyperactive immune response along with impaired adaptive immune response may trigger pulmonary injury, ARDS, viral sepsis and organ failure like complications, and eventually death in some cases (
