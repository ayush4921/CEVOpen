<p>Here we provided an overview of the BIORIMA risk management framework (RMF) in conceptual terms. The RMF has been designed to be applicable to past and current generations of NBMs, while at the same time integrate new scientific insights to address the innovation and regulation needs of future NBM generations. The RMF has adopted a life cycle approach for risk assessment and management not only for patients intentionally exposed to NBM-based MDs and ATMPs in the use phase, but also for workers and healthcare professionals and the environment that may be accidentally exposed to NBMs released in the synthesis, product manufacturing, use and end-of-life stages. The RMF provides a flexible and efficient approach to address different assessment goals depending on user needs in order to find the optimal balance between compiling the data needed for a targeted and accurate risk assessment, for selecting adequate risk control measures and the efforts and cost required to collect these data. This is achieved by means of so-called IATAs designed to guide stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, regulators, scientists, consultants) in identifying the most efficient test cascade to generate the data necessary for risk assessment and management. The RMF addresses the differences in requirements in the chemicals and medical regulatory domains and facilitates cross-fertilisation for exchange of ideas, data and (standard) testing methods and modelling tools between these areas. The next steps are to operationalise the conceptual RMF and deliver it both as a guidance and a software-based DSS for risk assessment and management of NBMs used in MDs and ATMPs. </p>
