<p>Moreover, guidelines are needed also to integrate the outcomes of physicochemical characterisation with (eco)toxicological assessment. Therefore, the RMF provides such guidance in the form of a set of structured IATA, presented as decision trees to guide the selection of in vitro and in vivo tests based on material identity. The outlook is to deliver IATA through a software-based BIORIMA Decision Support System for risk assessment and management of NBMs used in MDs and ATMPs, that will be freely accessible on-line to end-users. </p>
