<p>Healthcare professional can therefore benefit from the implementation of the RMF in terms of increased awareness about potential occupational risks and improved knowledge of adequate prevention and control measures. To develop an effective risk prevention and control strategy it is important to clearly define the target groups of concern for each specific intended use of the NBM (e.g., doctors, dentists, surgeons, nurses) and train them in working with these substances and using the relevant safety measures, especially in view of personal protective equipment, which is only effective if properly used. The known level toxicity of the potentially released NBMs is a key starting point to determine the needed level of controls. Moreover, such a strategy should be based on reliable onsite measurements of emissions/release and exposure. Even though some processes might be evaluated by lab-scale simulations, the complexity and maybe also uniqueness of a specific workplace requires exposure measurements based on a mixture of personal and area sampling using appropriate equipment and including background measurements. These exposure measurements can then provide guidance for the evaluation of risk management measures and their effectiveness, which should consider specific characteristics of the healthcare sector, such as the transfer of NBMs from high security areas to uncontrolled areas or waste management practices where day-by-day exposure to NBMs is possible to occur. The effectiveness of protection measures already in place in hospitals (e.g., for handling of cancer treatment medicine) should be carefully evaluated and similar measures should also be adopted for NBM-based MDs and ATMPs. In other words, a read-across from the handling of other hazardous substances like anti-cancer drugs, biological agents and/or radioactive materials can be beneficial to set the frame for handling of potentially less toxicologically potent NBMs. </p>
