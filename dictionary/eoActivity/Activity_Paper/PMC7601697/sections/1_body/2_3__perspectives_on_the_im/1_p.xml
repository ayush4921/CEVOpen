<p>The BIORIMA RMF has been developed to be flexible and efficient [
 <xref rid="B138-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. It is flexible enough to address different assessment goals depending on user needs. It is efficient in collecting information for risk assessment based on specific user goals (i.e., targeted testing) by means of optimal IATA, instead of fulfilling predefined data requirements. This is intended to ensure an optimal balance between compiling the data needed for a targeted and accurate risk assessment and for selecting adequate risk control measures, and the efforts and cost required to collect these data.
