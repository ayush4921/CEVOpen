<p>It should be recognised that the benefit risk analysis process is required for the market authorisation of a new MD or ATMP, and the process of assessing occupational and environmental risks (e.g., REACH or Environmental Health and Safety regulations) are inherently different and require distinct strategies. This is not only because of the different regulatory regimes, but also because the very concept of ‘risk’ and its perception and acceptability are different in these two areas. The risks for workers and the environment are determined by unintentional exposure to the materials, they are absolute in nature, assessed based on conservative assumptions and any risks above the exposure/hazard risk ratio are considered unacceptable. In contrast, the risks for patient posed by medical applications are always compared to their clinical benefits and can be accepted if the benefits significantly outweigh the safety concerns. These fundamental differences have determined different requirements in the respective regulations that require different testing strategies. However, some of the (standard) testing methods, modelling tools and data can be used across these domains. The implementation of the RMF can facilitate this by identifying areas of cross-fertilisation to promote sharing of ideas, data and tools. In this sense, the RMF can promote and facilitate the communication and collaboration between scientists from different fields.</p>
