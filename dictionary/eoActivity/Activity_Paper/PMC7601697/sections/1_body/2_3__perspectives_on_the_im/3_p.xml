<p>If the assessment of risks for different targets can be considered adequately addressed through distinct regulations, there is a need for a scientific framework and guidance on the best experimental and modelling approaches to do it. For instance, in absence of sufficient environmental monitoring data, the application of material flow modelling could help investigating the expected concentrations of nano-Ag in different environmental compartment based on average production data [
