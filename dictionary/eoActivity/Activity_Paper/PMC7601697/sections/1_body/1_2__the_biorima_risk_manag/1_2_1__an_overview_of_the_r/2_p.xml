<p>The framework starts with the choice of the type of product, i.e., a MD or an ATMP. The framework inputs include information on relevant life cycle stages of such products. Early life cycle stages such as synthesis and product manufacturing are most relevant in an occupational risk assessment, while during the use stage the risk assessment is relevant to both patients and workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists). Following use, end-of life is most relevant to environmental risk assessment. The RMF provides two pillars to structure the risk assessment and management process: one relevant to occupational and environmental risks associated with unintentional exposure (left side), one relevant to the risk-benefit analysis of patients (right side). </p>
