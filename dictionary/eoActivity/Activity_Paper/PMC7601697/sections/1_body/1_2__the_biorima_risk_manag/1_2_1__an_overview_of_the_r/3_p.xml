<p>The regulatory framework to address occupational health and safety and environmental risks of NBMs incorporated in MD and ATMP is built upon the provisions of REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals) regulation, Environmental Health &amp; Safety regulations and the associated guidance documents (e.g., REACH 2006 [

 <xref rid="B13-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] concerning Equipment intended for use in EXplosive ATmospheres, known as ATEX Directive). For workers, both accidental and chronic risks need to be considered. In an accident risk scenario, a potential hazard (e.g., explosion, fire, massive release) can impact a worker over a short period of time (an accident). This is different from the exposure frequency and duration paradigm used to estimate chronic risks and therefore requires a different approach (as described in
