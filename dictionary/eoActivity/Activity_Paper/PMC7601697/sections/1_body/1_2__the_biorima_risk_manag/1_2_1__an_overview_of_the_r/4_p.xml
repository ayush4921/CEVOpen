<p>The right-side pillar of the RMF focuses on the use of a NBM-based MD or ATMP for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, where the efficacy and the safety of these materials/products for the patients constitute the main concern and are assessed and weighed by means of benefit-risk analysis (

 <xref rid="B14-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In order to obtain market authorisation, benefits and risks are investigated through the execution of pre-clinical and clinical assessments, according to the current EU regulations for the commercial approval of MD and ATMP (e.g., Regulation (EU) 1394/2007 [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Regulation (EU) 2017/74 [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Directive 2009/120/EC [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Once on the market, adequate risk control measures must be considered for medical devices (following ISO 14971 [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] provisions), while for ATMP current EU legislation asks for the implementation of a risk management plan and a safety and efficacy follow-up.
