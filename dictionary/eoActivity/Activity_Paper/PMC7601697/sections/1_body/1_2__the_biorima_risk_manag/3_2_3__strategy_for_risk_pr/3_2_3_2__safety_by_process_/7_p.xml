<p>Safe-by-Design for discrete object fabricated products begins with the same paradigm illustrated above for products that are made by materials processing. A significant range of materials must be tested at the raw materials stage to minimise product toxicology downstream. The approach differs at the pilot plant stage where initially material ‘test coupons’ are produced on prototype fabrication unit operations. The latter are small but mimic the automated device used in the full manufacturing plant. Critical in this early stage is to test the biocompatibility of the materials to be used for ‘implantability’ of such devices. Once suitable materials have been chosen, the implantable device geometry and performance characteristic are mathematically modelled, and the first manufacturing devices are engineered. Full-scale manufacturing for fabricated products is achieved by ‘scale out’ rather than ‘scale up’. The imperative is to ensure the unit operations are fully optimised. These are then replicated to create a manufacturing line with banks of identical unit operations accurately producing the product in parallel to a full set of specifications, including NBM hazard reduction. Using nano-enabled SbD replacement hip joints, this generic SbD process development has been described for the first time in the BIORIMA project by Wilkins and colleagues and is illustrated in
