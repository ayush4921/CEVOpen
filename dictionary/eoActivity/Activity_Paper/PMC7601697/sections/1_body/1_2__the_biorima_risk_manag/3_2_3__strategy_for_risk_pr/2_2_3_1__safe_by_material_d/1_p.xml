<p>The elimination or substitution of hazardous constituents by means of safe-by-material design (SbMD) strategies is the first line of defence [

 <xref rid="B106-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The SbMD approach is based on the control of nano-bio reactivity since the early stages of R&amp;D. In a recent review Hjorth et al., 2017 [
 <xref rid="B107-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] clearly demonstrated how the SbMD approach is inspired by safety testing and assessment practices in drug discovery and development (DDD). The authors also outlined the limitations that still delay the creation of ‘design guidelines’ for nanomaterials. The SbMD approach is based on the concept that safety is not an intrinsic property of material but can be built in through the manufacturing chain from raw materials to finished products, by adding SbMD criteria to quality assurance (QA) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) specifications.
