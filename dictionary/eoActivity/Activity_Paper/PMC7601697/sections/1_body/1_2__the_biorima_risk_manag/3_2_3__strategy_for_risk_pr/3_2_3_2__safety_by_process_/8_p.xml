<p>As part of the manufacturing fabrication development, product performance is assessed by simulation and accelerated mechanical testing for in vivo use. In addition, these authors noted that the standards issued by the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) addressed only the risks of bulk materials of devices and not the risk of NBM used in the devices or created during lifetime wear. They have set a benchmark for such standards through CEN Workshop Agreements (CWA), CWA 7253-1:2018 and CWA 17253-2:2018, respectively for NBM wear characterisation and toxicology testing, to be applied to all nano-enabled replacement joint devices.</p>
