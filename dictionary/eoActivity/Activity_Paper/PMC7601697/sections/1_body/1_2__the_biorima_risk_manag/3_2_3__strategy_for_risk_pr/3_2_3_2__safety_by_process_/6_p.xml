<p>To achieve ‘safe-by-design’ of products, additional characterisation and measurements tests and in vitro toxicology tests are added into the raw materials and pilot plant development stages (shown in green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04532-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These can be performed off-line or at-line using high-throughput parallel processing analysers including electron microscopy. On-line analysers are chosen for the pilot scale to enable full process analytical and product quality control. The results are analysed by nano-QSARs data analytics [

 <xref rid="B117-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] and critical characterisation and measurement parameters together with those from the high information content on-line analysers, e.g., Raman, FTIR, mass spectrometers [
 <xref rid="B110-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] to build multivariate statistical process control models. Together these devices are then used to maintain optimised SbD performance throughout the whole manufacturing chain from raw materials to full-scale manufacturing.
