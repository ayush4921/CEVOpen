<p>In many cases it is not possible to substitute a specific substance and/or process and thus the further measures have to be applied during production and use. For risk reduction and control during the production phase, first of all targeted and well-defined technical measures (engineering controls applying closed processes, fume hoods, enclosed glove boxes, etc.,) have to be applied [
 <xref rid="B104-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. These have to be process and material specific and should be supported by on-site measures that may decline or support an initial suspicion of material release. If a measurement does not reveal any release during normal processing (e.g., higher concentration than the background and meeting the legal restrictions) no further acute action is needed. Nevertheless, the technical measures should be conceived as far as possible to also cover accidental scenarios (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot3-materials-13-04532">Section 2.2.3</xref>). Organisational measures include administrative controls like operational procedures such as HEPA (High-efficiency particulate air)-filtered vacuum cleaning, regular wet wiping of surfaces and equipment but also periodical checks on the effectiveness of these procedures and training of the involved personnel. Further risk reduction and control is achieved by (additionally) using personal protective measures, that is equipment like eye protection, gloves and respirators with different adjusted protection levels. Furthermore, discontinuous control measures as well as a continuous exposure monitoring on site (see the next paragraph) with appropriate measurement equipment for identification and quantification might be needed.
