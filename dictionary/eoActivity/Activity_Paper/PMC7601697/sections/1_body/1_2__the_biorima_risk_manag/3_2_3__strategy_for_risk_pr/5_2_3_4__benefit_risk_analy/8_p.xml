<p>According to the ATMP guideline [
 <xref rid="B127-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], after the development of a benefit risk analysis, the applicant should provide a risk management plan (RMP) for obtaining the market authorisation. In the RMP, safety specification, pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisation activities need to be assessed. Safety specifications consists in the identification of risks to be minimised and/or characterised during the post-marketing phase considering risks derived from the product manufacturing, handling, application and clinical follow-up (i.e., risks to patients due to interaction with other medicinal products or maladministration and risks to healthcare professionals). Pharmacovigilance activities consist in the identification, quantification and characterisation of safety hazard and the measurement of effectiveness of risk-management measures, while the risk minimisation plan includes risk minimisation measures such as supplement information about conditioning of the patient, product characteristics, adverse drug reactions, healthcare professional protection measures. Safety and efficacy (S&amp;E) follow-up data need to be provided to support the marketing authorisation application considering the ATMP characteristics and its intended indication, while long-term S&amp;E follow-up activities are only related to ATMP.
