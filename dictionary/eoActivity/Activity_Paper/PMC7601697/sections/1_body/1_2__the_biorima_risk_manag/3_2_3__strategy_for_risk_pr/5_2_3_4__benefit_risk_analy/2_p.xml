<p>When assessing the use of NBMs in ATMP and MD, it is important to underline that they can pose specific regulatory challenges related to their inherently complex nature and their relative novelty in the medical field. These materials involve complex nanostructures that can possibly trigger a wide range of biological responses. The broadly adopted ‘conventional’ approaches for physicochemical and toxicological testing of medicinal products have been accepted also for nanoparticle medicinal products [
