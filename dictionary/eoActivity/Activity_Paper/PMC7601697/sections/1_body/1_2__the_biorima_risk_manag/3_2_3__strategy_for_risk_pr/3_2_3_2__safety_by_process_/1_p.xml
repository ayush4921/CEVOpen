<p>The fundamentals for safety by process design (SbPD) lay in the evolution of engineering principles initially developed in the mid-1990s for the chemical industry for manufacturing nanotitanium dioxide [

 <xref rid="B111-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. A holistic approach is adopted which starts with standard medical product GMP and QA procedures. Safety with respect to nanomaterials is built in right through the manufacturing chain from raw materials to finished products. SbPD seeks to maintain the much safer properties of the previously optimised raw materials by SbMD methods described in
