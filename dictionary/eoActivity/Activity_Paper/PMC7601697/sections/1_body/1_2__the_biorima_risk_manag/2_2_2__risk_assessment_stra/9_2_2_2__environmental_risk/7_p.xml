<p>Using the environmental flow data from the MFA modelling, worst-case PECs that exclude any fate processes in the environment can be directly calculated. These values have also been referred to as ‘release concentrations’ as they do not include processes such as sedimentation or biodegradation that would decrease the environmental concentrations of the NBM. In order to consider these fate processes, EFM models developed for ENM need to be adjusted and parameterised for NBM. Such fate models are for example SimpleBox4Nano [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] or MendNano [
 <xref rid="B97-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Whereas the processes that need to be considered in the fate models for NBM are the same as those for ENM, there is so far almost no data available to parameterise models for NBM. With an increased harmonisation of test protocols and test media [
 <xref rid="B98-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and the use of functional assays [
 <xref rid="B99-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], also data for NBM can be obtained so that fate models can be parameterised.
