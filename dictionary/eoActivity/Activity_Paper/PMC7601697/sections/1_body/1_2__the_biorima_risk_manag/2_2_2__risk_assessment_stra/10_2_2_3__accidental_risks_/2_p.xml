<p>To assess the risks of fire and/or explosion accidents, it is of major importance to reliably characterise the physicochemical properties, reactivity and flammability of NBMs based on established standards (CEN TS 17274:2018 [
 <xref rid="B101-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]). This involves the application of pre-screening tools (e.g., calorimetry) and regulatory tests proposed by the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN/GHS). Fire risks can be more specifically tested through a physical model of fire (e.g., Tewarson Fire calorimeter), while explosion risks for NBMs free forms can be assessed based on ignition sensitivity (e.g., minimum ignition energy, minimum ignition temperature, minimum explosion concentration, limiting oxygen concentration and explosion severity). These tests directly support the implementation of the ATEX Directive, and their results enable the identification of adequate safety measures.
