<p>Exposure assessment also requires the quantification of the bioavailable fraction that passes across the mucosal barriers (i.e., lung and intestinal epithelia). This can be estimated through experimental in vivo or in vitro testing. Moreover, using physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) the results of rodent studies or data obtained from in vitro transport studies can be used to extrapolate a human internal exposure by simulating the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion of NBMs. Typically PBPK models require physiological (tissue volumes, flow rates, metabolism of chemicals, etc.), biochemical and material specific data (i.e., physicochemical properties) [
