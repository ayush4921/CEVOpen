<p>The BIORIMA IATAs follow the structure first recommended by the OECD [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and further developed/applied within the Horizon 2020 project GRACIOUS (“Grouping, Read-Across, CharacterIsation and classificatiOn framework for regUlatory risk assessment of manufactured nanomaterials and Safer design of nano-enabled products”) [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The IATAs take the form of decision trees, structured to collect the information and data needed for human health and ecological risk assessment of NBMs. Each question (or decision node) within the decision tree prompts the user to strategically select the most appropriate testing or alternative methods (or a combination) for hazard assessment. These include in silico (e.g., physiologically-based pharmaco-kinetic (PBPK) models), in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches. The IATA have been developed to utilise, as far as possible, existing data (by utilising data in open-access databases), non-testing approaches (e.g., in silico) and other alternatives to animal testing (e.g., in vitro). This is achieved by employing a tiered testing strategy to address each decision node, in which the complexity of the model employed increases from tier 1 to 3.
