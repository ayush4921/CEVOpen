<p>Since NBMs are synthesised and the MDs and ATMPs are produced in controlled environments, where any released NBM is adequately managed and waste is properly dealt with, it can be excluded that NBMs will reach the natural environment during synthesis and formulation, hence the life cycle stages of concern are the use and end-of-life processing and disposal. In these life cycle stages, predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) need to be estimated for relevant exposure scenarios. The detection of NBMs at trace concentrations in natural samples is in most cases not yet possible as the available analytical tools are not capable of distinguishing the NMs from natural background nanoparticles at the low NBMs concentrations expected in complex environmental matrices [

Therefore, the exposure assessment of these materials relies on environmental exposure modelling by means of material flow analysis (MFA) to predict releases from products, fate in technical systems and final release to the environment, and environmental fate models (EFM) that describe the fate of NBMs in the environment and their distribution within environmental compartments [
