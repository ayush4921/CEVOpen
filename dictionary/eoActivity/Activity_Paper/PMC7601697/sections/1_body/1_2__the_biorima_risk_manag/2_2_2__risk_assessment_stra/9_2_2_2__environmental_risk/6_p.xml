<p>Before existing models for ENMs can be used for NBMs, several adjustments need to be made. In general, these models are also applicable to NBM as most of the parameters are based on the applications of the materials and are not particle-specific properties. A few parameters on fate in technical systems are specific to the type of particles and need to be adjusted to the type of NBM. As NBMs are mostly applied in a hospital setting, waste and wastewater from hospitals need to be included. Healthcare waste is treated differently to municipal waste due to their often-hazardous character. This means that the flows to alternative treatment or hazardous waste incinerators need to be included in the MFA model. NBMs can also be applied inside the body and stay there until the patientâ€™s death, e.g., from their use in implants. Thus, the inclusion of crematoria or burial in cemeteries in the model is necessary. A generic model for the flows of NBM through all life-cycle stages is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04532-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The main release point is the use of the NBM in a hospital setting, with releases to waste treatment and wastewater treatment specific for the use of the investigated NBM. Depending on the type of materials (organic/inorganic) transformation can occur in several compartments such as wastewater treatment or waste incineration.
