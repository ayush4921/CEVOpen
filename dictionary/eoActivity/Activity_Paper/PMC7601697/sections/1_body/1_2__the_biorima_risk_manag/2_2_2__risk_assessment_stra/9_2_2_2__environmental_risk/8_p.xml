<p>The PEC values derived from MFA or EFM models can then be compared to predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from hazard assessments. Hauser et al., 2019 [
 <xref rid="B100-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] conducted a first environmental hazard assessment of organic and inorganic NBMs used for drug delivery based on a meta-analysis of previous ecotoxicity studies. Data are only available for a small subset of NBM, mainly for chitosan, polyacrylonitrile and hydroxyapatite. Mahapatra et al., 2015 [
 <xref rid="B94-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] conducted the first full environmental risk assessment of an NBM, focusing on the use of nano-gold in medicine. Based on PEC values derived from MFA and a probabilistic species sensitivity distribution, it could be shown that there is no overlap between predicted exposure of nano-Au and the concentrations where adverse effects on organisms can be observed.
