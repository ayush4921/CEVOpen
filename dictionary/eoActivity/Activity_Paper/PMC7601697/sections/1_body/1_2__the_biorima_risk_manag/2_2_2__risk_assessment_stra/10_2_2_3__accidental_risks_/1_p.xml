<p>Besides chronic risks, also accidental risks for NBMs life cycle need to be considered. The focus of accidental risk assessment and management is on accidents that can result in fire, explosion or a massive release of NBMs. Smaller accidents with higher likelihood, but lower consequences, are also of interest as they can for instance impact workers handling the materials (i.e., flammability and ATEX risks). Each step of the NBMs life cycle from production, processing and use to the end-of-life is potentially bearing the risk of accidents. However, the consequences will be much higher in the first steps of the life cycle (production, transport and transformation) in which the NBMs are in high concentration and possibly in free form. Therefore, the accidental risks of these materials arising from fire, explosion and massive release phenomena need to be adequately managed based on a framework involving hazard assessment (characterisation of substances, process identification and hazardous activities); accident scenarios identification; risk assessment of the scenarios based on their likelihood and consequences. Then, depending on the acceptability level of the risks, risk management measures are identified.</p>
