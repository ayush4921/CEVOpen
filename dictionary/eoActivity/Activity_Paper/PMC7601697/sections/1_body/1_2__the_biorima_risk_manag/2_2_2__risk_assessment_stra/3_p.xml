<p>Moreover, there are many possible human and environmental exposure scenarios that should be investigated. Therefore, a strategic approach is required to streamline, optimise and properly target the available resources using either an intelligent testing strategy [

Indeed, in order to optimise the selection of the most suitable methods and guide the identification and characterisation of human and ecological risks, the risk assessment strategy proposed in the BIORIMA RMF includes a set of IATA.
