<p>However, at several levels there is high complexity associated with the hazard assessment of NBM, both for human risks as well as for the environment [

In addition, it can be questioned which are the most relevant biomarkers for NBM hazard testing and whether they are currently adequately addressed in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines used for regulatory purposes.
