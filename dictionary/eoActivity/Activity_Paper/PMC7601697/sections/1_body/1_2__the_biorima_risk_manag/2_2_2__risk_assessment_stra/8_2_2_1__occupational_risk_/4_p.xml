<p>There are a variety of approaches to assess the exposure to NBMs for the formulated exposure scenarios, which involve direct measurements or modelling. Site-specific measured data are typically preferred over model estimates and are needed to validate and improve the exposure models. Such data can be generated by portable or stationary monitoring and sampling instruments (e.g., condensation particle counter (CPC), scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or electron microscopes (SEM/TEM)) following different measurement strategies [

To adequately quantify the occupational exposure a multimetric approach (covering different parameters such as particle number, mass and surface-area concentrations, particle mean diameter) using a combination of instruments is recommended [
