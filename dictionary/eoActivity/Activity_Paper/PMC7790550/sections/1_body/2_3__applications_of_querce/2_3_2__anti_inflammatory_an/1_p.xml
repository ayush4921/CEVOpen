<p>Quercetin has been confirmed to be a long-acting anti-inflammatory substance in flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Both in animal and in human models, quercetin can show significant anti-inflammatory potential in different cell types [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The plant extract of quercetin is used as the main component of many potential antiallergic drugs. Compared with Cromolin (the antiallergic drug disodium cromoglycate), its ability to inhibit IL-8 is stronger and can inhibit IL-6 and increase cytosolic calcium levels [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Its anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties have been validated in the treatment of respiratory and food allergies [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In addition to a wide range of biochemical and pharmacological activities, quercetin has been repeatedly shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial and monocyte/macrophage systems
