<p>Many studies have shown that quercetin can exert antitumour effects through various mechanisms, which has been confirmed in various tumour 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Quercetin can significantly prevent the cell cycle, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit blood vessel generation and transfer. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] found that in human leukaemia U937 cells, quercetin induces cell cycle arrest at G2 (late DNA synthesis phase). Suh et al. [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] found that quercetin can also induce G0/G1 (pre-DNA synthesis) phase changes in 232B4 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells and HOS osteosarcoma cells. In addition, Chou et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have proved that quercetin also affects the regulation of p53-related pathways in the tumour cell cycle. Their experiments discovered that quercetin can induce ER stress and promote the release of p53, thereby inhibiting the activities of CDK2, cyclin A, and cyclin B, thereby causing MCF-7 breast cancer cells to stagnate in the S phase. In addition, Hamidullah et al. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] found that in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, a certain dose of quercetin-6-C-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-D-glucopyranoside treatment can lead to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. This phenomenon may be related to the downregulation of cyclins E and D, PNCA, and Cdk-2 protein expression and increased expressions of p21 and p27 (
