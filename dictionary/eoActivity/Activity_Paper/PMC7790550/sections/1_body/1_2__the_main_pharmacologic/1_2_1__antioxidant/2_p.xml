<p>The antioxidant mechanisms of quercetin 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> mainly include the following: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Directly scavenging free radicals: Oh et al. [
    <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] proved that quercetin had a strong antioxidant capacity, and it showed the highest antioxidant activity in all test samples. In addition, Manca et al. [
    <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that quercetin adulterated with liposomes and glycerol nanoparticles could scavenge free radicals and protect human keratinocytes from hydrogen peroxide damage 
    <italic>in vitro</italic>.

   <p>Chelating metal ions: related studies have confirmed that quercetin can induce Cu
    <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
    <sup>2+</sup> to play an antioxidant role through catechol in its structure. Tang et al. [
    <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] fed adult male C57BL/6J mice to form a model of alcoholic liver disease and treated them with quercetin. The results suggested that quercetin could inhibit Fe
    <sup>2+</sup>-induced lipid peroxidation by binding Fe
    <sup>2+</sup> and finally inhibit iron overload and oxidative damage in alcoholic liver disease. Babenkova et al. [
    <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] undertook a chemiluminescence study to demonstrate that Fe
    <sup>2+</sup> in compounds containing dihydroquercetin is inactive, unable to catalyse the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and unable to trigger further generation of hydroxyl free radicals. Therefore, quercetin can play the role of antioxidant stress through various cohorts and Fe
    <sup>2+</sup>.

   <p>Inhibiting lipid peroxidation: Lim et al. [
    <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] confirmed that quercetin could inhibit the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein by observing the changes in the fluorescence intensity of thiobarbital, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides, and oxidised low-density lipoprotein, thus inhibiting the oxidative damage of LDL. Mbikay et al. [
    <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] verified that, at low concentrations, quercetin can increase the expression of LDL-R, reduce the secretion of PCSK9, stimulate the uptake of LDL, and thus inhibit LDL oxidative damage.
