<p>The antioxidation mechanisms of quercetin 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> are mainly such that the antioxidant capacity of quercetin is gradient-dependent and a high concentration of quercetin confers strong antioxidant capacity:

   <p>The antioxidant characteristics of quercetin: these are mainly manifested in the regulation of glutathione levels to enhance antioxidant capacity. When ROS are generated, SOD-2 will quickly capture O
    <sup>2-</sup> and convert it into H
    <sub>2</sub>O
    <sub>2</sub>. GSH-Px catalyses the degradation of H
    <sub>2</sub>O
    <sub>2</sub> to water molecules, which requires glutathione to provide reducing hydrogen [

   <p>Effects on enzyme activities: Odbayar et al. [
    <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that quercetin can increase the expression of some antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione transferase and aldo-keto reductase. The level of expression is proportional to the amount of quercetin.

   <p>Impact on signal transduction pathway: Wang et al. [
    <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that quercetin had a protective effect on granulosa cells by upregulating the expression of some genes related to oxidative stress 
    <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
    <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, Granado-Serrano et al. and Kobori et al. [
    <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
    <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] verified that quercetin upregulates the expression of Nrf2 and nuclear transfer by activating the intracellular p38 MAPK pathway, increasing the level of intracellular GSH, and affecting antioxidant enzyme activities, so that the antioxidant capacity of the cell is improved.
