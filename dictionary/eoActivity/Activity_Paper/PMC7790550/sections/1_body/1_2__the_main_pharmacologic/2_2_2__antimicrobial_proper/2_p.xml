<p>According to current research, the antibacterial mechanism of quercetin mainly includes destroying the cell wall of bacteria and changing the cell permeability, affecting protein synthesis and expression, reducing enzyme activities, and inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] used TEM images to demonstrate that quercetin could damage the cell wall and membrane of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (at 10 × MIC) and demonstrated that treatment of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (at 50 × MIC) with quercetin eventually led to cavitation and death. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that sugarcane bagasse (with 470 mg quercetin/g polyphenol) extract showed bacteriostatic activities against the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. In addition, Plaper et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that quercetin altered the activity of ATP, thereby affecting the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that quercetin can protect rats from catheter-related 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection by inhibiting thrombin activities. The relevant experiments on quercetin in inhibiting bacteria in recent years are summarised in
