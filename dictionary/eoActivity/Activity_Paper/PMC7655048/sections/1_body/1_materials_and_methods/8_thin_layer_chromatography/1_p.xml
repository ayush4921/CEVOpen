<p>The most potent partition (SMP1) was spotted on thin-layer chromatographic plates pre-coated with silica-gel (Merck, silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>). The plates were developed in chromatographic tanks with toluene:ethyl acetate (80:20) as the solvent system which gave about 6–8 visible bands when viewed under ultraviolet (UV) light. The plates were allowed to stay for elution to be achieved. SMP1 was further purified using column chromatography.
