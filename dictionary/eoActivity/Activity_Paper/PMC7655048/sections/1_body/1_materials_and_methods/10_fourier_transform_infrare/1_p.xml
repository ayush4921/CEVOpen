<p>The FTIR of the most potent fraction (SMF1) was carried out using FTIR-8400S spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model, Kyoto, Japan). SMF1 was used in a form of a thin film, held in between two potassium bromide discs. The liquid paste was dropped on each disc, after which they spread into a thin film. The disc was then mounted in the FTIR spectrometer in the range 1.20 × 1013 − 1.20 × 1014 Hz within the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Absorption was written in terms of wave numbers (units; cm
 <sup>−1</sup>).
