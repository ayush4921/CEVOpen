<p>Chemical composition of SMF1 was determined by GC/MS-QP-2010 plus Ultra (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a DB-5 MS fused silica capillary column (30 × 0.25 m internal diameter, film thickness 0.25 µm). An electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV was used. Carrier gas was helium gas, flow rate was 1.2 mL/min. Injector and MS transfer line temperature were set at 260 and 270 °C, respectively. Oven temperature was initially maintained for 2 min, and then increased to 210 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min to 280 °C; hold time was 10 min. Samples were completely dissolved in absolute ethanol and 0.3 µL was injected through auto-sampler in the split mode, split ratio was 1:100. Relative percentage of each constituent was expressed as percentages by peak area normalization. Each component was identified based on its column retention time (RT) relative to computer-based matching of mass spectra with those of standards: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Wiley libraries for GC-MS system.</p>
