<p>GC-MS analysis is a breakthrough in analysing the phytoconstituents and elucidating the structure of compounds as they are very sensitive in detecting compounds as low as 1 ng (Saravanakumar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this study, SMF1 was analysed by GC-MS and the major peak indicates 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester (24.906%) which contain alkyl group as identified in FTIR. The functional group of esters and carboxylic acids were also revealed in the FTIR spectrum. Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester has previously been confirmed in a plant from the same family – 
 <italic>Borreria stachydea</italic> (DC.) Hutch. &amp; Dalziel (Rubiaceae) by Onoja and Odenigbo (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It acts as an antioxidant, antiandrogenic, nematicide, lubricant, haemolytic, hypocholesterolemic, flavour, pesticide and 5-α reductase inhibitor (Rajeswari et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester also possesses anti-inflammatory property (Saeed et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Echavarría et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic was revealed from structure and kinetic study carried out by Aparna et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) to be due to its ability to inhibit PLA
 <sub>2</sub> competitively. 14-Methyl pentadecanoic acid methyl ester (13.351%) detected in this study have also been confirmed in 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> (Burm. f.) Nees (Acanthaceae) (Mohanapriya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) – a plant possessing PLA
 <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity – suggesting the involvement of this compound in mediating the PLA
 <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> leaves. This study further revealed the presence of other compounds which may possess anti-inflammatory properties and other therapeutic importance.
