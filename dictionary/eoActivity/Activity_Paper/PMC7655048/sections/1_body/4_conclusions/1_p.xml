<p>This study confirmed that MESM mediates its anti-inflammatory action 
 <italic>via</italic> the inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub>, thus substantiating its traditional use as anti-snake bite agent. This activity could be attributed to the compounds present in the plant of which hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester and 3-ethylhexane, are the most abundant. Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester, which possesses anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to act by inhibiting PLA
 <sub>2</sub>. The individual constituents can therefore be isolated and subjected to biological activities. Specifically, further research can be directed at examining the pharmacological activities of the constituents in the treatment of snake bites and inflammation-related disorders.
