  <title>Context</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Schumanniophyton magnificum</italic> Harms (Rubiaceae) is used traditionally in Nigeria for the treatment of snake bites. Snake venom contains phospholipase A
   <sub>2</sub> (PLA
   <sub>2</sub>) which plays a key role in causing inflammation and pain.

 <sec>
  <title>Objective</title>
  <p> To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the methanol extract of 
   <italic>Schumanniophyton magnificum</italic> (MESM) leaves through the inhibition of PLA
   <sub>2</sub> and investigate the compounds responsible for the effect.

  <title>Materials and methods</title>
  <p> PLA
   <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of MESM was assessed at concentrations of 0.1–0.8 mg/mL using human red blood cells as substrate. Prednisolone was used as the standard control. MESM was subsequently partitioned using 
   <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous-methanol (90:10 v/v), after which PLA
   <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of the partitions was determined. The best partition was subjected to chromatographic techniques and the fractions obtained were assessed for PLA
   <sub>2</sub> inhibition at 0.4 mg/mL. Compounds in the most active fraction were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy 
   <bold>(</bold>FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p> MESM significantly inhibited PLA
   <sub>2</sub> activity at 0.8 mg/mL (44.253%) compared to prednisolone (35.207%). 
   <italic>n</italic>-Hexane partition (SMP1) proved more active with inhibition of 55.870% observed at 0.1 mg/mL. Fraction 1 (SMF1) showed the highest PLA
   <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of 58.117%. FTIR studies revealed the presence of some functional groups in SMF1, and GC-MS confirmed the presence of 9 compounds which are first reported in this plant. Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester was identified as the major compound (24.906%).
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
  <p> The PLA
   <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of MESM suggests that its compounds may be explored further in monitoring anti-inflammatory genes affected by the venoms.
