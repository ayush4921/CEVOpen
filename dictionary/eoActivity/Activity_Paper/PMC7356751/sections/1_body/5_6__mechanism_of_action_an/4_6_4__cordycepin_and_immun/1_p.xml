<p>Immunomodulation is usually defined as modulation of the immune system, and this can be done by any chemical agent that modifies the immune response or the functioning of the immune system via the stimulation of antibody formation or the inhibition of white blood cell activity [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Cordycepin has been reported to stimulate cytokine release of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as influence PBMCs proliferation and transcription factors in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Moreover, cordycepin was found to regulate human immune cells functions in vitro [

 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. It has also been observed that the antitumor activity of cordycepin is associated with its immunomodulatory effects [

 <italic>C. militaris</italic> are reported to have good immunomodulatory effects by increasing the survival rate of lupus mice and reducing anti-ds-DNA production [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Zhang and Xia [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] observed that 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> behaves like an immunosuppressant in a heterotopic heart allograft model in rats and increases the survival period. The same effect has been reported by other authors too, for example, Zhu and Hu [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], revealed that 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> prolongs the mouse skin allograft survival time. Therefore, cordycepin has been proven a potentially effective immunomodulator, and it is even specifically used to control autoimmune disorders and transplant rejections after an organ transplant [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. An increasing number of studies indicate that cordycepin is a bi-directional modulator with both suppressive as well as influencing effects on the immune system by regulating the adaptive and innate immunity [
