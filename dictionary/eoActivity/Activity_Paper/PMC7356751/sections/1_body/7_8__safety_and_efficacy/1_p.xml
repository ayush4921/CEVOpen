 <italic>Cordyceps</italic>, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine is also called a miracle mushroom because of its exceptional health benefits. Due to its natural occurrence, it is considered pharmacologically safe for human consumption. However, in some cases it has been reported to cause dry mouth, nausea, abdominal distension, throat discomfort, headache and diarrhea as well as allergic reactions [

 <xref rid="B145-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. It is recommended to avoid its consumption in the case of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, there are a few reports indicating that 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> intake can cause lead poisoning in some cases. Considering the potential for toxicity, resistance and its efficiency, potential drug derivatives designed from the natural products for the adenosine deaminase-resistant properties and low-toxicity causing effects of cordycepin, as well as organ-targeted nanoparticles for cordycepin delivery for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> therapy, are also needed [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Further clinical, experimental as well as epidemiological data are required for identification of other molecular targets to see the correlation between 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> and other diseases like cancers and to estimate the validation of optimum dosing for its safety and efficacy [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mechanism of action of cordycepin still needs further detailed scientific studies along with exploration of the various biochemical pathways involved. Thereby, its pharmacological and mechanism of actions will help in scientific scrutiny to answer every aspect of cordycepin [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Aside from some negative reports and clinical data, 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> is still relatively considered safe and non-toxic for human consumption [
