<p>Based on the obtained scoring results, compounds 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, 
 <bold>VIa</bold>, and 
 <bold>Vd</bold> showed the highest binding affinity to the VEGFR-2 active site. Compound 
 <bold>Ve</bold> was the best among the synthesised compounds with docking score (–7.9154 kcal/mol) compared to the reference ligand 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> docking score (–11.1354 kcal/mol), and it formed a direct interaction in the active site, similar to that of 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold>. Also, compounds 
 <bold>VIa</bold> and 
 <bold>Vd</bold> showed a good docking score (–7.4371 kcal/mol) and (–7.3974 kcal/mol), respectively, compared to 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> reveals that the tested compounds 
 <bold>VIa</bold> and 
 <bold>Vd</bold> along with 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> reacted with important amino acids in the active binding site. The carbonyl group of the chalcone moiety in both compounds 
 <bold>Ve</bold> and 
 <bold>Vd</bold> acts as H-bond acceptor and formed a H-bonding with LYS868 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(a,b)</xref>). On the other hand, the reference compound 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> formed several hydrogen bonding with the active side nearby amino acids GLU885, CYS919, ASP1046, and PHE1047 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(c)</xref>).
