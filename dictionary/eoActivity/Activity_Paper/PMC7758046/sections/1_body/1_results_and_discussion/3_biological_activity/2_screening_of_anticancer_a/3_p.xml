 <bold>Vf</bold> bearing 3-fluoropyridine moiety showed weak anti-proliferative activity against non-small cell lung cancer HOP-92, leukaemia K-562, colon cancer HT29, leukaemia SR, and breast cancer MCF7 cancer cell lines, with cell growth promotion (82.34%, 85.84%, 86.42%, 92.99%, 99.38%; cell growth inhibition: 17.66%, 14.16%, 13.85%, 7.01%, and 0.62%, respectively). It also showed moderate activity against leukaemia HL-60(TB) (cell growth promotion 79.28%; cell growth inhibition: 20.72%), leukaemia CCRF-CEM (78.16%; cell growth inhibition: 21.84%), and colon cancer HCT-116 (cell growth promotion 73.87%; cell growth inhibition: 26.13%).
