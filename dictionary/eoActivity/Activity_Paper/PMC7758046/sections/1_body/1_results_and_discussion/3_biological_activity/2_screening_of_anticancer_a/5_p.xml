<p>Furthermore, replacing 3-fluorophenyl moiety with 4-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl moiety compound 
 <bold>Ve</bold> markedly increase growth inhibition towards many cancer cell lines. It showed cell growth promotion for non-small cell lung cancer HOP-92 (55.00%; cell growth inhibition: 45.00%), leukaemia SR (46.22%; cell growth inhibition: 53.78%), breast cancer MCF7 (34.68%; cell growth inhibition: 65.32%), leukaemia HL-60(TB) (28.91%; cell growth inhibition: 71.09%), colon cancer HCT-116 (27.43%; cell growth inhibition: 72.57%), leukaemia CCRF-CEM (22.15%; cell growth inhibition: 77.85%), and leukaemia K-562 (12.37%; cell growth inhibition: 87.63%). From previous results, we can conclude that chalcone derivative bearing 4-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl moiety (
 <bold>Ve</bold>) was the most potent chalcone towards leukaemia CCRF-CEM, leukaemia HL-60(TB), leukaemia K-562, leukaemia SR non-small cell lung cancer HOP-92, colon cancer HCT-116, and breast cancer MCF7 cell lines.
