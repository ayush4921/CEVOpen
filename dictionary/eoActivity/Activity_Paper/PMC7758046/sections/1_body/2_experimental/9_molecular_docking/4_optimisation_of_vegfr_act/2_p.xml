<p>The VEGFR has been prepared for docking experiments by adding hydrogen atoms and their standard geometry. The atom's connections and types were checked with automatic correction for any errors that existed. Selection of the receptor and its potential atoms has been fixed. MOE Alpha Site Finder used all default items to search for the active site in the receptor structure, and then dummy atoms were created from the alpha spheres obtained.</p>
