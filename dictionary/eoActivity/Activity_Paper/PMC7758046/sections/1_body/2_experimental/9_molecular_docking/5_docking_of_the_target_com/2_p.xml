<p>Docking of the tested compounds' conformational database was performed using MOE-Dock software. To ensure a reasonable docking accuracy and to determine the effect of the water molecules, the co-crystallised ligand in the VEGFR (PDB 4ASD) was docked to its corresponding protein (in the absence and in the presence of water) and the RMSD values were determined between the co-crystallised ligand and docked pose. The success rates obtained were highly excellent where the active site of the VEGFR was calculated from the binding of co-crystallised ligand and saved as MOE file. The active site file of the VEGFR was then loaded, and the docking tool was used. The program specifications have been adjusted to the dummy atoms as docking site, triangle matcher as placement methodology, London dG as scoring methodology that have been adjusted to its default values. The MDB file of the ligands to be docked (
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> and target compounds) was loaded, and calculations for docking were run automatically. The poses obtained were studied and the poses which had the best ligandâ€“receptor interactions were selected and stored for calculating energy.
