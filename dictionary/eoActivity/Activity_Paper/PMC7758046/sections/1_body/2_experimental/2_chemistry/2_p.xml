<p>All melting points were uncorrected and measured by Electro thermal IA 9000 series digital melting point apparatus at the Micro-analytical Center, Cairo University (Giza, Egypt). IR spectra had been reported on FT. IR 670-Nicolet spectrophotometer-Nexus (Thermo Scientific, Madison, WT); determination of 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra on a JEOL AS NMR spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan). Mass spectra were measured on Finnigan Mat SSQ 7000 mode EI 70 ev (Thermo Inst. Sys. Inc., Waltham, MA). Thin-layer chromatography was performed using chloroform/methanol (10:1, v/v) on thin-layer chromatographic plates of silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ), and the spots were observed for a few seconds by exposure to UV lamps at 
 <italic>λ</italic>254 nm and used to monitor the reaction time. 1-(4-(Piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)ethan-1-one III was prepared as reported method
