<p>HCT-116 cells were seeded at concentrations of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in a six-well plate, then incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated for 24 h with vehicles (0.1% DMSO) or 10 µM of 
 <bold>Vd</bold> or 
 <bold>Ve</bold> compounds. Using ice-cold, 70% ethanol at 4 °C, cells were harvested and fixed for 12 h after that. Ethanol removal and cold PBS washing of the cells were done. Then incubated in 0.5 mL of PBS containing 1 mg/mL Ranse for 30 min at 37 °C. In the dark, the cells were stained with PI for 30 min. Flow cytometer was then used to detect contents of DNA
