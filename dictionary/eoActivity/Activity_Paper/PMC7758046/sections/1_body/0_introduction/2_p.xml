<p>Cancer is a major global health problem characterised by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Although cancer research resulted in a range of innovative and promising approaches, the medications used as therapies have strong drawbacks and cancer is expected to be the leading cause of death in the future

 </xref>. Angiogenesis is an important physiological process in which the pre-existing vessels form new blood vessels. It is a vital physiological process that happens during inflammation and wound healing
