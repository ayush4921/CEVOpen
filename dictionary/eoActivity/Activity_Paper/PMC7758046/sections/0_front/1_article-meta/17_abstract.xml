 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>New piperazine–chalcone hybrids and related pyrazoline derivatives have been designed and synthesised as potential vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitors. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has selected six compounds to evaluate their antiproliferative activity 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> against 60 human cancer cells lines. Preliminary screening of the examined compounds indicated promising anticancer activity against number of cell lines. The enzyme inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 was evaluated and IC
  <sub>50</sub> of the tested compounds ranged from 0.57 µM to 1.48 µM. The most potent derivatives 
  <bold>Vd</bold> and 
  <bold>Ve</bold> were subjected to further investigations. A cell cycle analysis showed that both compounds mainly arrest HCT-116 cell cycle in the G2/M phase. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay showed that 
  <bold>Vd</bold> and 
  <bold>Ve</bold> induced an approximately 18.7-fold and 21.2-fold total increase in apoptosis compared to the control. Additionally, molecular docking study was performed against VEGFR (PDB ID: 4ASD) using MOE 2015.10 software and 
  <bold>Sorafenib</bold> as a reference ligand.
