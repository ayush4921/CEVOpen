<p>The extraction yield, defined as the mass of extract recovered compared to the initial amount of plant material, is a measure of the solvent's efficiency to extract the chemical constituents of the plant materials. The mean values of the yielded extracts, presented as percentages (%), were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) different among the plant parts and solvents used for extraction. The extraction yields (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show that the highest percentage of yield was obtained in the aqueous ethanol extracts of both the aerial parts and the roots (19.4% w/w and 11.6% w/w, respectively). The results indicate that the aqueous ethanol extracted higher yield than the aqueous methanol. Due to the fact that the extraction yield increased with the increasing polarity of the solvent used in the extraction and that water enhances the polarity of the organic solvents, a higher yield was expected using the aqueous methanol rather than the aqueous ethanol. The present results indicate that the higher extraction yield obtained using the aqueous ethanol may be attributed to the presence of less polar constituents that were more readily extracted using aqueous ethanol than aqueous methanol.
