<p>The phytochemical screening results presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenoids, tannins, phenols, and flavonoids in different abundances in the extracts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> aerial parts and roots. The presence of anthraquinones was not detected in either extract. The phytochemical profile of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> obtained in this study resembled that from previous reports [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The presence of phytochemical constituents such as flavonoids, glycosides, saponins, alkaloids, phenols, tannins, and terpenoids in this plant likely contributes to its biological activity and may provide the basis for its uses in traditional medicine. These phytochemicals have been proven to display a wide range of pharmacological properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antithrombotic as well as antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, alkaloids, phenols, tannins, and flavonoids are known to have a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, the presence of such compounds in the aerial parts and root extracts support the traditional use of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The results of this study show that alkaloids are present in abundance in the root extracts. It is reported that alkaloids derived from plants exhibit antimicrobial and anticancer effects [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, the phytochemical screening results also show the presence of tannins, phenols, and flavonoids in abundance in the root extracts. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds are known for their antioxidant and antidiabetic activities [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings can explain the use of the whole plant of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> for diabetes treatment.
