<p>As demonstrated by Ruiz-Ruiz et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the inhibition zones of 14.0–19.0 mm and &gt;19.0 mm can be classified as active and very active, respectively. Thus, 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> has promising antibacterial activity. Higher inhibitory activity was observed in the Ap-AME against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (26.5 ± 0.20 mm), followed by 
 <italic>Sh. flexneri</italic> (19.4 ± 0.40 mm), 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (17.7 ± 0.49 mm), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (14.2 ± 0.35 mm), and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (13.0 ± 0.00 mm). Ap-AEE also exhibited potent antibacterial activity but with lower inhibition zones when compared to Ap-AME. Meanwhile, both root extracts (R-AEE and R-AME) exhibited activities with inhibition zones ranging from 7.1 ± 0.15 to 14.8 ± 0.35 mm against the tested bacterial strains. These findings are comparable to those that previously revealed antibacterial activities for this plant [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, all 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts showed potent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, Ap-AME was the most effective, with an inhibition zone of 12.6 ± 0.17 mm, followed by Ap-AEE (11.4 ± 0.20 mm), whereas nystatin, the reference antifungal drug, inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> with a 21.7 ± 0.29 mm zone of inhibition. These results disagree with those of EL-Sharabasy and Mohamed [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who reported a negative antifungal effect of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> against both 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>.
