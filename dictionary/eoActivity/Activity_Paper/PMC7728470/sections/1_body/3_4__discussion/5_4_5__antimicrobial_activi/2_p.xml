<p>Based on the antimicrobial assays, the Gram-positive bacterium (i.e., 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>) was the most susceptible microorganisms, with a 26.5 ± 0.20 mm zone of inhibition and an MIC of 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against the Ap-AME extract of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen and one of the leading causes of community-acquired infections throughout the world [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is susceptible to the reference antibiotic chloramphenicol, with an MIC of 8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The obtained findings are consistent with those of Alghanem et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], who reported that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the bacteria most affected by different extracts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>. The Ap-AME extract of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> also showed appreciable activity, with MICs of 512 and 1024 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against the growth of 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, respectively. The considerable antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> may be attributable to its various constituent phytochemicals (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Several reports have noted that the antimicrobial activities observed using plant extracts result from phytochemicals such as tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>, particularly its anti-
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> effect, justifies the use of this plant in traditional medicine for treating respiratory ailments and their symptoms [
