<p>Despite the wide therapeutic potential presented by 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>, studies on the phytochemical profile, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of this plant are still lacking. Consequently, the present study focused on determining the content of total phenolic and flavonoids, evaluating antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of aqueous ethanol and aqueous methanol extracts of the aerial parts and roots of Saudi 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> collected from the Asir region. The present work also aims to provide an overview of this species' chemical and biological properties to develop sufficient background knowledge for continued research into the different extracts of this plant.
