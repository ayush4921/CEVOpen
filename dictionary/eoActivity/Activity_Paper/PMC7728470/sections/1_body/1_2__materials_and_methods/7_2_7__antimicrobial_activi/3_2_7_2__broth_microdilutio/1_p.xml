<p>The MIC for plant extract was determined using the nutrient broth microdilution method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with minor modifications. The method was performed using different concentrations of the plant extract dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. An aliquot of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract solution was added to 95 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of fresh media followed by the addition of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of inoculum (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) prepared in Mueller-Hinton agar into different wells of a 96-well microplate. Chloramphenicol was used as a reference antibiotic. The microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a shaking incubator. Then, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a 0.5% INT solution was added to each well and incubated for a further 30 min at 37°C. The MIC value, defined as the lowest sample concentration that inhibited complete bacteria growth, was determined for each sample.
