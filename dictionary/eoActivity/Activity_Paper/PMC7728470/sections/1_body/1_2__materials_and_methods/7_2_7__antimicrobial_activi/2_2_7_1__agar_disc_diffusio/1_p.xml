<p>The pathogens were inoculated on a nutrient agar plate and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. The disc diffusion method, as described by Balouiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with slight modifications, was adapted to test the effectiveness of the extract on the selected microorganisms. Paper discs (6.0 mm) were saturated with a crude extract solution (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), dried, and then placed onto prepared test plates. Triplicate plates for each treatment were prepared and incubated for 18–24 h at 25°C and 37°C for the fungi and bacterial strains, respectively. The subsequent zones of inhibition were measured, and the mean diameter in millimeters was calculated. Ampicillin (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and nystatin (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were used as positive controls for antibacterial activity and antifungal activity, respectively, and a medium without inoculation was used as a negative control.
