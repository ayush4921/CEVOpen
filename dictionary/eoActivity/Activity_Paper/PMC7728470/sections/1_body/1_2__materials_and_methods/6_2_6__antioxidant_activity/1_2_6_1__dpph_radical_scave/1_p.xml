<p>The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the plant extracts was determined by following a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, 0.5 mL of the plant extracts of various concentrations (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in methanol) and the ascorbic acid standard were mixed with 2.5 mL of a 0.1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH. The reactants were incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using methanol as a blank. The antioxidant activity of the extracts, expressed as inhibition percentage of DPPH free radicals, was calculated using
