<p>The H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity was determined by the method of Ruch et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with minor modifications. A 40 mM solution of hydrogen peroxide (30%) was prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Then, 2 mL of the plant extract (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in distilled water) was added to 2 mL of the hydrogen peroxide (40 mM) solution. After 10 min of incubation at 30°C, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 230 nm against phosphate buffer as a blank. Ascorbic acid in distilled water (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used as a standard. The percentage of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging by both the extracts and the standard was calculated using equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq1">1</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (the concentration of extract or standard that can inhibit 50% of the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was determined from the regression analysis of a plot of scavenging effect (%) against the extract concentration (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL).
