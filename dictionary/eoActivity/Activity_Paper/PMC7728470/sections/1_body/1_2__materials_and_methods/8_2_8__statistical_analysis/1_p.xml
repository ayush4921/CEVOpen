<p>All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs). GraphPad Prism version 8.0 and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA), were used to perform the statistical analyses. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests were employed for comparative studies among the results. A difference was considered statistically significant if 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. The correlations among the TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activities and between the assays were assessed using Pearson's correlation.
