<p>The aerial parts and root materials of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> were collected in April 2018 from three locations around Abha City in the Asir region and were then authenticated using the available relevant scientific records of Saudi Arabia Flora [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and The Plant List [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The voucher specimens were deposited at the College of Science, King Khalid University (Abha, Saudi Arabia) for future reference. The plant is not endangered, so no permission was needed for its collection. The plant materials were washed thoroughly to remove soil particles using tap water, followed by distilled water. They were cut into small pieces and air-dried in shade for two weeks at 25–30°C. The dried sample was then powdered and weighed to obtain 220 g of bark and 650 g of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>. Powdered sample (100 g) was macerated with 1 L of aqueous ethanol (80%) and aqueous methanol (80%) separately at 25–30°C for three days with random shaking. The macerates were filtered and then evaporated to dryness at 40°C using an IKA R10C S99 Rotary Evaporator. The dried crude extracts were weighed and stored at 4°C until analysis. The extract yield was calculated as a percentage.
