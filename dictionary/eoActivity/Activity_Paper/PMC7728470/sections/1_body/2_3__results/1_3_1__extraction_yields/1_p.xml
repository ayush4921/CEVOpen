<p>The extraction yield of the aerial parts and root samples of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The mean percentages of the yielded extracts are significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) different among the plant parts and extractants used and vary from 9.5 ± 0.10% to 19.4 ± 0.44%, with a descending order of aerial parts, aqueous ethanol extract (Ap-AEE) &gt; aerial parts, aqueous methanol extract (Ap-AME) &gt; roots, aqueous ethanol extract (R-AEE) &gt; roots, and aqueous methanol extract (R-AME). The highest percentage of yield was found in Ap-AEE (19.4 ± 0.44% w/w) while the lowest percentage of yield was found in R-AME (9.5 ± 0.10% w/w).
