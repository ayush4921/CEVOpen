<p>The reducing power of ferrous ions in the tested extracts is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Similar to the radical scavenging capacity, all extracts showed an increasing trend in antioxidant capacity with increasing concentrations. A significant difference in the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value between the different extracts and ascorbic acid was also observed. The FRAP capacities of the four extracts were in the order of R-AME &gt; Ap-AME &gt; R-AEE &gt; Ap-AEE. The R-AME extract showed good reducing power capacity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20.82 ± 1.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, which is comparable to that of ascorbic acid (13.27 ± 0.89 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL).
