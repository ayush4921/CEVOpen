<p id="p0165">In this study, 
 <italic>L. acacia</italic> showed the best antimicrobial result for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and it gave an excellent result for wound healing activities in the two concentrations (5 and 10%) comparing with standard silver sulphadiazine (1% w/w) ointment. Furthermore, there is no evidence of data cited about wound healing activities of 
 <italic>L. acacia</italic> aerial parts. In contrast, several studies have reported the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>L. acacia</italic> against a wide range of bacteria, and our finding ultimately agreed with their finding (

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">El-Shafei et al., 2018</xref>). These antibacterial activities may be due to presence of flavanocoumarin, loranthin, catechin, quercetin, rutin, gallic acid and methyl gallate which were previously isolated from 
 <italic>L. acacia</italic> and showed significant activity towards bacteria (
