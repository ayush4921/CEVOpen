<p id="p0150">In the Acute toxicity activity, the extract-treated animals did not show any symptoms and signs of toxic reactions or behavioral changes during the 24 h period. No mortality was found up to the highest dose of 2000 mg/Kg after the completion of 48 h. As per the ranking system used by the European Economic Community (EEC) for acute oral toxicity, the LD
 <sub>50</sub> dose of 2000 mg/kg and above are categorized as unclassified (EC Directive 83/467/EEC, 1983); hence further studies were not conducted with higher doses.
