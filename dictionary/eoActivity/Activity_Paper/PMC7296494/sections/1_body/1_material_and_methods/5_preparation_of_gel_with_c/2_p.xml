<p id="p0035">A measured quantity of carbopol 940 was taken in a beaker and dispersed in 50 ml of distilled water. The beaker was kept aside to allow the swelling of carbopol for half an hour and then stirring was done on a magnetic stirrer at 1200 rpm for 30 min. In another beaker, 5 ml of Propylene glycol was added to 10 ml of water and added weighed quantities of methylparaben and stirred properly. After all, Carbopol dispersed weighed amounts (5 g for 5% and 10 g for 10%) of extracts were added with constant stirring. Finally, the volume made up to 100 ml with distilled water. Triethanolamine was added as drops to the formulation to adjust the pH from 6.5 to 7, which the skin pH also to obtain the gel at required consistency (
