<p id="p0130">Skin tissue samples (3–5cm) from each group of animals were submerged immediately in the appropriate amount of 10% formalin and processed in automatic tissue processing machine (ASP300s, Leica Biosystems, IL, USA) and embedded in paraffin wax and 5 µm thickness section was prepared using rotary microtome (SHUR/Cut 4500, TBS, NC, USA) (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Hamad and Ahmed, 2018</xref>). Two sections of each sample were taken for staining as one was stained by hematoxylin and eosin technique as general staining method and the other was stained by Masson tricrome as unique stain method for connective tissue fibres (
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hamad and Ahmed, 2016</xref>). Hematoxylin and Eosin method was as following: Dewax sections, rehydrate through descending grades of alcohol to water. If needed excess fixation pigments were removed. Stain in hematoxylin (HX082464, MERK, Darmstadl, Germany) for 10 min. Wash thoroughly in running tap water until sections 'blue' for 5–10 min or less. Stain in 1% eosin Y for 10 min. Wash in running tap water for 1–5 min. Dehydrate through alcohols, clear, and mount in DPX (

Masson trichrome technique for connective tissue fibres demonstration (mainly collagen) was performed using the following method: Stain nuclei with Weigert's iron hematoxylin for 10 min, wash with water, stain in an acid fuchsin solution for 5 min, rinse rapidly in water, differentiate in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for approximately 5 min, drain and counterstain with methyl blue, dehydrate, clear and mount sections in DPX (
