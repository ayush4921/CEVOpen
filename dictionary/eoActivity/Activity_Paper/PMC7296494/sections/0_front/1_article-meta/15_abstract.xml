 <p>The emergence of drug-resistant organisms have been increasing globally; therefore, it is a burning need to find an alternative drug to get rid of the diseases caused by resistant strains. This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial and wound healing activities of 
  <italic>Loranthus acacia, Cassia obtusifolia</italic> and 
  <italic>Cymbopogon proximus</italic> plants
  <italic>.</italic> All the plants were collected and extracted — by maceration method. Antimicrobial activities determined using standard ATCC strain for Gram-positive bacteria (
  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
  <italic>Bacillus crew</italic>, Methicillin-resistant 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative bacteria (
  <italic>Shigella sonnnei</italic>, 
  <italic>Salmonella Typhimurium</italic>, 
  <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
  <italic>Klebsiella pnuemoniae</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) following agar well diffusion method. Plants extracts were prepared as gel and investigated for 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing activities in rats. Histological studies were performed on animals’ skin. The results showed that all tested plants have various antimicrobial and wound healing activities. Out of these plants, 
  <italic>L. acacia</italic> exhibited the best result; it revealed a significant result for antimicrobial activities counter to all Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and wound healing activities in comparing with the reference drug. Thus, it is essential to consider 
  <italic>L. acacia</italic> as a prospective source in progress in the synthesis of a new antimicrobial drug for the treatment of infectious diseases.
