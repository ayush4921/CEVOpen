<p>Vitex agnus-castus leaves were washed with tap water and left to dry for 2 days at room temperature in a well-ventilated room using a fan to speed up the drying process, then ground to a fine powder. Maceration method described by 
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Pandey &amp; Tripathi (2014)</xref> was used with little modification, in which 60 g of the leaf powder was transferred to three Erlenmeyer flasks containing 300 ml of the three different solvents: distilled water, methanol (80%), and ethanol (80%) to a final concentration of 20% g/ml. The leaf mixtures were shaken for 72 h at 300 rpm/min/20 °C to extract the active compounds. We used the method previously described in 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Ababutain (2019)</xref> to extract the active compounds as follows: the leaf mixtures were filtered twice, first using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and then using bacterial filters. The filtrates were concentrated in an oven at 80 °C. The residues were re-suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 20%. All flasks were kept at 4 °C for further use.
