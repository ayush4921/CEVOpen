<p>We analyzed the bioactive compounds of all three VA-C leaf extracts (ethanol, methanol and water) with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) model QP2010 SE, with a 5 Sil MS 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane capillary column (0.25-μm df, 30 meter, 0.25 mmID) using the method previously described in 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Ababutain (2019)</xref>. One microliter from each diluted plant extract (100/1,400, V/V in DMSO) was injected individually in the split mode with a split ratio of 1:10. We used the electron impact ionization system at 70 eV ionization energy to determine GC-MS exposure or detection. Pure helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas, at a constant column flow 0.7 ml/min and total flow of 10.4 ml/min. The flow control mode had a linear velocity of 29.6 cm/s. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and the ion-source temperature was set at 250 °C. The column temperature was programed at 50–300 °C, with a hold time of 3 min, and a total run time of 29 min. The chemical compounds were identified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 08) library match and the quantitative data were generated automatically as a percentage (
