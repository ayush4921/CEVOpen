<p>Inoculums of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species were prepared from new cultures in potato dextrose broth (PDB). A Biomerieux DensiCHEK plus meter device was used to adjust the cell suspension turbidity at 1–2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml, which represents 0.5 McFarland standards. Each Petri dish was inoculated individually with 0.5 ml of the previous suspension. Melted potato dextrose agar (PDA) was poured over the inoculums, and the plates were rotated to ensure even distribution of the inoculums then left to harden at room temperate for 5 min. Five wells were made on the inoculated PDA using a 6 mm sterile cork-borer. Each well was filled with 100 µL of the plant extracts. Positive and negative controls were included; nystatin (10 mcg) was used as the positive control and DMSO was used as the negative control. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The anticandidal activity of the plant extracts was estimated in millimeters (mm) using a ruler and measuring the free growth zones around the wells. The experiments were performed in three replicates to ensure the reliability of the results.
