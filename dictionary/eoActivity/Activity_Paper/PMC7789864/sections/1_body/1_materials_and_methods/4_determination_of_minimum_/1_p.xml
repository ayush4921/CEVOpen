<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of VA-C leaf extracts was estimated using the two-fold dilution method (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Omura et al., 1993</xref>) as well as the method previously described in 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Ababutain (2019)</xref>. Briefly, the plant extracts were diluted with PDB media using 96-well microtiter plates in wells 1–10. Standard 
 <italic>Candida</italic> inoculums at a concentration of 1–2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml were transferred to the wells to make a final concentration of 50%. We used growth media with the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> inoculum in well 11 and growth media with plant extracts in well 12, as positive and negative controls, respectively. The turbidity was examined by the naked eye after an overnight incubation period at 37 °C and the lowest concentration of plant extract showing no 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species growth was recorded as MICs. All experiments were performed in three replicates.
