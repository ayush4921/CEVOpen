<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration results were between 12.5 µg/ml and 25 µg/mL and all extracts showed similar activity against all 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species at MIC 25 µg/ml, except 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> which was the most sensitive to the ethanol extract at MIC 12.5 µg/ml. The MFC results were between 25 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml. Most extracts showed similar MFC values against all 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species at MFC 50 µg/mL except 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. The MFC ethanol extract at 25 µg/ml had the highest anticandidal activity against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and the MFC methanol extract at 100 µg/ml was considered to be the lowest anticandidal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The results revealed that both MIC and MFC values for all three solvents were narrow where the differences between values were one to two concentrations only. The MFC/MIC ratio in all the three extracts were only two-fold to four-fold, which means that VA-C leaf extracts are potentially candidacidal (
