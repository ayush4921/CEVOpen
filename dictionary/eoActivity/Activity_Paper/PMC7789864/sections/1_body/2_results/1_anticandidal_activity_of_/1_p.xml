<p>The VA-C extracts were shown to inhibit the growth of all tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species and the inhibition activity depended on the solvent type and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. The results showed that 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> was the most inhibited by all the extracts followed by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. ciferrii</italic> (all 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The effects of the ethanol extract against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. ciferrii</italic> were significantly higher compared to water and methanol extracts at 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.047, respectively (
