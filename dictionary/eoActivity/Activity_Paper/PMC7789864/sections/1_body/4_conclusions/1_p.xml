<p>Our results showed that VA-C leaf extract is rich in bioactive compounds with broad spectrum activity that inhibited all the tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species despite different species. Accordingly, VA-C leaf extracts may inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species in general, compared to antifungals that affect a specific species or a strain of species and require an accurate diagnosis of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> isolation to choose the appropriate antifungal. The inhibitory activity of the ethanol solvent was better than methanol and water, which may indicate the importance of choosing the appropriate solvent to extract phytochemicals with high inhibiting effectiveness and in higher quantities. Moreover, our results showed that the extract had a candidacidal effect on test 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species at low concentrations, which may reduce the side effects of the extract. VA-C leaf extracts are advantageous, and a promising component that can be used to develop an alternative anticandidal agent. Further studies are required to assess the toxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity of VA-C extracts and prove their safety for human use.
