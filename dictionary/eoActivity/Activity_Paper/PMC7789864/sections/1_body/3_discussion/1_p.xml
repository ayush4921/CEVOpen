<p>Antibiotic resistance is becoming more common among a larger number of microorganisms, including 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, leading to a heightened interest in finding alternative treatments. The secondary metabolites of plants have made them useful for treating a variety of diseases, flavoring foods and products, preserving food, in pesticides, in perfumes and cosmetics, and more recently to inhibit the microbial growth. VA-C leaf extracts have been reported to cause mild and reversible side effects such as headache, acne, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, erythematous rash, pruritus, and menstrual disorders. However, no drug interactions have been associated with VA-C leaf extracts (

 <italic>Candida</italic> species: 
 <italic>C. ciferrii</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (
