<p>Selection of antibiotics for the treatment of infections is highly influenced by the mechanism of action. Antibiotics classified into either by killing the microbe (microbicidal) or inhibiting its growth (microbistatic) (

Antibiotics with inhibitory effects are usually prescribed to patients who do not have problems with their immune system, while antibiotics with a fatal effect are prescribed for patients with low immunity or severe infections (

 <italic>Candida</italic> species are generally opportunistic and affect the group of people with low immunity so antibiotics that are prescribed are generally more effective if they are of the fatal type. Therefore, the inhibitory efficiency of the VA-C extract was estimate using the ratio between MFC and MIC. Our results showed that the ratio of MFC/MIC between two-fold to four-fold have a candidacidal effect (
