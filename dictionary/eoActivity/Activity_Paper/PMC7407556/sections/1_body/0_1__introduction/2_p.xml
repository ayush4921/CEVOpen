 <italic>Cudrania tricuspidata</italic> (CT) is a member of the 
 <italic>Moraceae</italic> family and is distributed in Korea and East Asia. Different parts of CT including its roots, stems, leaves, and fruit have been widely used for medicinal purposes to treat conditions, such as tumors, liver damage, jaundice, chronic gastritis, rheumatism, as well as external and internal hemorrhage [

 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Over the past two decades, almost all parts of CT have been pharmaceutically assessed and extensively investigated phytochemically. The pharmacological effects of CT are owing to the presence of a large number of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, diterpenoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. In particular, phenolic compounds such as cudratricusxanthones, cudraxanthones, and 1,3,7-trihydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propenyl)-5,6-(2,2-dimethylchromeno)xanthone have antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor characteristics. These compounds have already been identified in the roots, stems, leaves, and fruits of CT. It has been demonstrated that different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and fruit) of the CT may exert biological anti-oxidant, anti-bacteria, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-obesity, and anti-tumor properties. In particular, the roots and stems of CT have been widely used in Korea and China to treat various diseases like acute arthritis, pulmonary tuberculosis, mumps, and eczema. In Korea and China, its roots and stems are used as traditional Chinese medicine against tumor progression and metastasis in the last few decades [

The water-soluble organic moieties of medicinal plants play a significant role in the green synthesis of SNPs using bioactive components with significant redox characteristics. Medicinal plant-based SNPs have been thoroughly analyzed, and it has been experimentally acknowledged that they exhibit medicinal treatments as well as biological effects including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor properties [

While interest in CT extracts has gradually increased, owing to its various biological properties, little is known about the green synthesis of SNPs from extracts of the various parts of CT. In this study, we first comprehensively applied, compared, and analyzed the composite extracts of CT roots (CTR), stems (CTS), leaves (CTL), and fruit (CTF) on SNPs and performed multiplex assessment of their physicochemical, photocatalytic, and biological properties. To study the powerful antioxidant and reducing capacity of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts, we investigated the total phenol and flavonoid content, and reducing power and performed free radical ABTS and DPPH scavenging assays. The physicochemical examination of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs was performed by UV-Vis spectra analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). UV-Vis spectra analysis was performed, in order to evaluate the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RB), and Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The biological properties were evaluated to prove antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as antiapoptosis against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 and SK-Hep-1).
