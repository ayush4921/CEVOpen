<p>Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). They were cultured with Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) media (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cell viability assay was performed using CCK-8 (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well for 24 h. Cells were treated with various concentrations (0–100 μg/mL) of CT extracts and CT-SNPs and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Afterward, the CCK-8 solution was treated to the medium at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The optical density was read at a wavelength of 450 nm with the FLUOstar Omega Plate Reader (BMG Labtech).
