<p>CT samples were collected from Miryang, Gyungnam Province, Korea, in December 2018. The botanical identification was prepared by Dr. Young Whan Choi (College of Natural Resources and Bioscience, Pusan National University, Korea), and a voucher specimen (No. MT20180011) was deposited at the laboratory of the Natural Products Research Lab., College of Natural Resources and Bioscience, Pusan National University, Korea. Briefly, the roots, stems, leaves, and fruits of CT were powdered using an electric mixer (HMF-3100S; Hanil Electric, Seoul, Korea), after being dried in a hot-air drying machine (JSR, Seoul, Korea) for 24 h at 60 °C. The dried roots, stems, leaves, and fruits (30 g) of CT were then extracted with distilled water at 100 °C for 4 h, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-14; Buchi Labortechnik, Flawil, Switzerland) to acquire 5.467, 2.000, 8.867, and 2.711 g, respectively. The CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts were dissolved in distilled water, stored as 50 mg/mL stock solutions at 4 °C, and diluted to the chosen concentration using the medium prior to use.</p>
