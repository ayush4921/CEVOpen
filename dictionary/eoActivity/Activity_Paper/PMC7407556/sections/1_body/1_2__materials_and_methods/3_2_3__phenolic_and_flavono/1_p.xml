<p>The total phenolic and flavonoid content of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts was determined using the Folinâ€“Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The total phenolic and flavonoid content was expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g and quercetin equivalent (OE) per g of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts.
