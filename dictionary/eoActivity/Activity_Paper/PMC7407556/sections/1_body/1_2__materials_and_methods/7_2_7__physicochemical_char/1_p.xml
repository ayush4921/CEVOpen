<p>The particle size, zeta-potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF-SNPs were determined at 25 °C by DLS technique using Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF-SNPs were placed in a disposable zeta cell at 25 °C. Distilled water was used as a reference for the dispersing buffer. The results are given as the average particle size, zeta-potential, and PDI acquired from the examination of three different batches, each of them measured three times. The XRD patterns were collected using a X’Pert 3 Powder X-ray Diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) operating at a 30 to 80 s scanning range, 40 kV voltage, and 30 mA current. The FT-IR patterns were collected using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX FT-IR Spectrophotometer (Norwalk, CT, USA) with KBr pellets operating at a range of 400 to 4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. To determine the surface morphology, crystallinity, and chemical composition of CT-SNPs, one drop of the reaction mixture was deposited on the copper grid and then the CT-SNPs were dried completely. The HR-TEM operating at a 200 KV accelerated voltage, as well as the selected area electron diffraction (SAED), fast Fourier transform (FFT), high-angle annular dark field (HAADF), and EDS measurements were conducted on the Thermo Scientific (FEI) Talos F200X G2 TEM instrument (Bremen, Germany). Image J software (TomoJ, SEG3D2, Meshlab) was used to determine the average diameter and size distribution of CT-SNPs.
