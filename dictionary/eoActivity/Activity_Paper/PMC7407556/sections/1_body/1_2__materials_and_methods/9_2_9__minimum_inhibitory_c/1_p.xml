 <italic>Salmonella Enteritidis</italic> (ATCC 13076, 
 <italic>S. Enteritidis</italic>) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, United States). All the bacteria strains were cultured in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) (MHA, Lab M, Bury, UK) at 35 °C for 24 h on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. The MIC assay was assessed in 96-well plates using the standard micro-well dilution method. Briefly, serial dilutions (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, and 0.78 μg/mL) of CT extracts and CT-SNPs were prepared in 100 μL of MHB into 96-well plates, and then the final inoculum was adjusted to 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. After 24 h of incubation at 35 °C, the turbidity of the 96-well plates was determined using a FLUOstar Omega Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 595 nm. The MBC was performed by plating the suspension form each 96-well plate into a MHA plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the bacterial population was observed.
