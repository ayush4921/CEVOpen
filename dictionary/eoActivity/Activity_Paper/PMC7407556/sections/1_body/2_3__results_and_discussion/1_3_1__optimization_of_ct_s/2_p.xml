<p>The order of ABTS values, which indicated the free radical ABTS scavenging capacity, was as follows: CTR &gt; CTS &gt; CTL &gt; CTF (

The total phenol and flavonoid content and free radical scavenging capacity rank orders of CT extracts were quite similar because of similar antioxidant capacities. In addition, the total phenol content of CT extracts easily transferred electrons, and this may be the reason for the redox characteristics of CT extracts with the formation of SNPs. CT extracts showed the strongest overall reducing power activity. It was necessary to determine the potential of the CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts to reduce the silver nitrate solution that leads to the excellent and controlled formation of SNPs. In this study, the addition of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts to an aqueous silver nitrate solution resulted in the formation of CTR-, CTS-, CTL- and CTF-SNPs, respectively. Reduction of Ag

 <sup>0</sup> facilitated by CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts was confirmed by the color change of the solution from light yellow to yellowish-brown and by the absorption peak, λmax, observed between 435 and 443 nm when the SNPs were subjected to a surface plasmon resonance band (

The DLS technique was used to determine the hydrodynamic size distribution, zeta potential, and PDI of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs. The hydrodynamic size distributions were 92.04 ± 2.19 nm, 87.25 ± 3.18 nm, 66.34 ± 4.16 nm, and 75.88 ± 2.66 nm; the zeta potential values were −32.73 ± 1.59 mV, −33.10 ± 0.82 mV, −33.93 ± 0.84 mV, and −28.57 ± 0.62 mV; and the PDI values were 0.25 ± 0.04, 0.22 ± 0.01, 0.25 ± 0.02, and 0.31 ± 0.01 for CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01350-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The zeta potential values indicate that CTR-, CTS-, and CTL-SNPs showed higher stability in aqueous solution than CTF-SNPs. PDI is an important parameter for particle distribution, and therefore, CTR-, CTS-, and CTL-SNPs, which had a narrower distribution than CTF-SNPs, showed good distribution in the present study.
