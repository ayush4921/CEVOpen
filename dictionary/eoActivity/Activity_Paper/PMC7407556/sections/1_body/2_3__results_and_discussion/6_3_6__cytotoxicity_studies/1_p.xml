<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. In addition, the survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is poor mainly due to resistance, reoccurrence, metastasis, and severe side effects [

 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, extensive efforts are needed to identify novel therapeutic agents and inhibit the hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) to develop successful long-term treatments. Several studies demonstrated that cytotoxicity of SNPs is not only size type but also the reducing and capping agents use for the synthesis of SNPs. To test our hypothesis, the hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) were cultured with increasing concentration of CT extracts and CT-SNPs for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, followed by the CCK-8 analysis. Individual CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs showed dose dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cell lines, and this was enhanced by time. As expected, CTR-SNPs showed the highest and efficient cytotoxicity, followed by CTF-SNPs then CTL-SNPs, and finally CTF-SNPs in hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HepG2, SK-Hep-1). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs were calculated to be 37.58 ± 0.23, 42.51 ± 0.37, 83.96 ± 0.32, and 87.29 ± 0.55 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the cytotoxic effect in CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs was higher than in the CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts (
