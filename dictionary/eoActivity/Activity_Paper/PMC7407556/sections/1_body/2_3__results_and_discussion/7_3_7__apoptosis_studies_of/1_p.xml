<p>The water-soluble organic moieties of medicinal plants play an important role in the green synthesis of SNPs using phytochemicals with significant antioxidant properties. Medicinal plant-based SNPs have been thoroughly analyzed, and it has been experimentally acknowledged that they exhibit medicinal properties, as well as biological effects, including antitumor activities [

The effect of CT extract and CT-SNPs on the apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) was determined by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining assays. Annexin V, which targets the phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the apoptotic cell membrane, can be used as a sensitive probe for the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the apoptotic cell membrane. PI is capable of binding non-specific DNA markers, which is accepted by living cells, and can, thereby, be used to distinguish necrotic cells from apoptotic cells [

After 24 h, cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI for early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis analysis. As expected, the apoptotic cells increased by CT-SNPs, and CTR-SNPs produced the strongest effects, followed by CTF-SNPs, CTL-SNPs, and CTF-SNPs. CT extract treatment had comparatively little effect on the apoptotic cells. CTR-SNPs induced a higher percentage of early apoptosis (annexin V+/PI-) and late apoptosis (annexin V+/PI+) than other SNPs in HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells (
