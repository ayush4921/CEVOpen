<p>To examine the well-crystallized silver pattern of the CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs, EDS analysis was performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01350-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The EDS analysis revealed the surface chemical composition of SNPs and the results showed two clear Ag signals pertaining to the elements in CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs. The surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs displayed peaks at 0.24–0.27 keV, and 2.96–2.98 keV, respectively, due to the presence of Ag. The XRD pattern of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs shows four intense peaks at four 2θ values (30–80°) of 38.12–38.39°, 44.37–44.50°, 64.70–64.89°, and 77.80–77.96°, respectively (

The peaks at 38.12–38.39°, 44.37–44.50°, 64.70–64.89°, and 77.80–77.96° can be assigned to the typical (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic crystal structure of Ag (JCPDS NO. 65-2871), respectively. No other peaks for any contaminations were detected. This is in line with the FFT pattern and EDS analysis results. The “green” nanotechnologies of SNPs involve medicinal plants, which act as functionalizing ligands under physiological conditions, creating SNPs that are highly appropriate for biological applications. These studies in FT-IR was analyzed to investigate the presence of bioactive components in CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs. The CT extracts also provide possible functional groups, which attach to the surface of the CT-SNPs, resulting in capping and efficient stabilization. In our study, the FT-IR spectra was examined to obtain further evidence about the presence of bioactive components in the CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs such as the capping layer. The FTIR spectra of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts and corresponding CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs designated extensive resemblance between the extracts and the SNPs. Furthermore, the prominent peaks of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts and their corresponding SNPs are characterized by –OH stretching of alcohols and phenols at 3237.02 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 3238.97 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 3243.28 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 3259.53 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. –CH stretching of amines was also observed at 2968.89 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 2936.75 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 2896.68 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 2836.98 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. N–H or C=C bond of phenols or carbonyl groups were also observed at 1635.65 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1628.42 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1639.36 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 1634.68 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (

These functional groups on CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs show that CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs are stabilized by high –OH stretching or N–H bond possessing bioactive components probably derived from phenols [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on these results, we suggested that the reduction, capsulation, and stabilization of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs was owing to functional groups present in the CT extracts, such as phenolics, flavones, terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, proteins, and alcoholic compounds.
