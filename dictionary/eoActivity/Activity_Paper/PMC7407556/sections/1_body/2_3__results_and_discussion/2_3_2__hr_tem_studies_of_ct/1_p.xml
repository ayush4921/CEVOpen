<p>The surface morphology of SNPs, in general, is an essential parameter in SNP studies as it exhibits different physicochemical properties, depending on the size and shape. Therefore, the size, shape, and distribution of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs was explored using HR-TEM. Typical HR-TEM micrographs display nanoparticles with uniform size; the spherical morphology and distribution size of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs were observed, with 80% of the SNPs presenting a particle size between 20 and 50 nm. Less than 10% of the CT-SNPs were under 20 nm and between 50 and 70 nm (

 <sup>0</sup> and bind the phenol and flavonoid content to the SNPs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01350-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, the SAED pattern of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs acquired on a large area displays sets of sharp diffraction spots and concentric rings, which can be indexed with Ag. The FFT pattern of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs also indicated a face-centered cubic crystal structure, which exhibited bright circular spots [lattice planes of Braggâ€™s reflection (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes;
