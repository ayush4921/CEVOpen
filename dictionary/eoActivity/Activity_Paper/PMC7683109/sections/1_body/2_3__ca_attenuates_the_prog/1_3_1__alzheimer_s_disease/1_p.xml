<p>AD is known as a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder. The symptoms of AD depend on the stage of the disease that is classified into early-stage, mild, moderate, and late-stage according to the degree of cognitive impairment. AD is associated with neurological and motor dysfunction that ultimately results in progressive memory loss [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The exact cause of AD is not well understood, but oxidative damage and excessive ROS production have been characterized at the early stage of AD. Moreover, the main hallmark pathology of AD is the accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins in the brain that these events cause neuronal cell death through a series of toxic pathways [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Despite huge basic and clinical research on AD, there is no effective treatment to stop the progression of clinical symptoms in AD. Additionally, other pathological features such as neuroinflammation, microglial activation, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) dysregulation, synaptic impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, it is necessary to develop multifunctional drugs with fewer side effects to target different aspects of AD pathology [

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this case, it has been reported that CA prevents the accumulation and formation of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in neurons. CA also reduces the accumulation of Tau protein through interaction with the two cysteine residues in tau and prevents neuronal loss (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. CA extract and its polyphenolic derivatives maintain redox homeostasis through free radical scavenging activities. It has been reported that long time consumption of cinnamon downregulated oxidative stress markers in the blood [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Besides, CA significantly improved the lifespan and healthspan in male AD flies [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that the administration of CA (40 mg/kg) improved cognitive performance by increasing phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the prefrontal cortex of rats in the methamphetamine cognitive impairment model [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that TCA possesses an ability to inhibit neuroinflammatory responses by declining the microglial activation and levels of proinflammatory mediators in the mice brain of the AD model [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Besides, TCA improves memory impairment by suppressing microglial activation [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For this reason, TCA considerably reduced nitric oxide (NO) production in microglial cells by accelerating the destabilization of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA through the disruption of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2)-ERK1/2 pathway in a mouse memory impairment model of LPS [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. TCA can also inhibit the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway through the downregulation of iNOS, Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> gene expressions in LPS-induced microglial cells [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, TCA can decrease the iNOS levels and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the hippocampal tissue of the LPS in vivo model [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that TCA has a memory-enhancing effect [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. TCA improved the spatial memory and locomotor activity in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS-) induced memory impairment by stimulating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restoring superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase as the downstream antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus. TCA also decreased the levels of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and caspase-3 as well as A
 <italic>β</italic>1–42 protein accumulation in the brain of mice [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, TCA enhanced memory function through the amelioration of Nrf2, inhibition of neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and reduction of amyloid protein aggregation.
