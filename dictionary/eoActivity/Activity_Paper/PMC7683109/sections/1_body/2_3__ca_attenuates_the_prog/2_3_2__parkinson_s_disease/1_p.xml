<p>PD is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra area of the midbrain [

Mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, loss of supportive molecules, and dysregulated kinase signaling are critical factors that are known to impact the pathogenesis of PD. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that

Therefore, searching for neuroprotective agents, which can stop the underlying pathological condition and prevent further neuronal death, is needed. Among different neuroprotective agents, herbal components have long-term efficacy and safety [
