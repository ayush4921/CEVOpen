<p>To evaluate the protective effect of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> against lipid peroxidation, MDA content was measured in liver homogenate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> alone induced a significant increase in MDA content (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared with the normal control group. The doses of AECe (250 mg/kg) and silymarin (40 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the formation of MDA (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) induced by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> treatment.
