 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has a central role in detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The high incidence of liver damage is caused by drugs, alcohol consumption, and environmental chemicals/xenobiotics, which lead to liver diseases such as hepatitis [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most of the hepatotoxic chemicals produce liver cell damage by inducing an increase in tissue lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and serum levels of many biochemical markers such as transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, triglycerides, and cholesterol [
