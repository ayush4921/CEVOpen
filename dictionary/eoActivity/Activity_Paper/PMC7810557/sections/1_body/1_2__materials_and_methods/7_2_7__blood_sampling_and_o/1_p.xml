<p>Twelve hours after the last dose of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> injection, all animals were anesthetized by light ethyl ether inhalation and sacrificed. Blood samples were collected from the carotid arteries and centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 10 min under cool temperature (4°C) to separate the plasma. The separated plasma was stored at −20°C for further assessments. Besides, the liver was weighed and conserved for the preparation of the liver homogenate (10% w/v) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and stored at −20°C for biochemical analysis.
