<p>The antioxidant activity of all sample molecules is expressed with IC50 values in the results given in Table 7. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the molecules were found to be between 3.81 ± 0.01 and 29.05 ± 0.11 μM. The DPPH test is thought to cause hydrogen atom transfer reaction, which causes formation of the novel radical [37]. Hence, antioxidant compounds can react with DPPH free radicals by giving hydrogen atoms or by electron donation via a free radical attack on these compounds [38,39]. According to this reaction (DPPH• + R-NH → DPPH-H + R-N•) , weaker hydrogen bonds are necessary for higher antioxidant activity in a compound. The strength of these hydrogen bonds (–NH group in the thiosemicarbazone moiety) is proportional to electron density. Consequently, antioxidant activity depends on two things: the first being the capacity/skill of compounds to lose hydrogen atoms, and the second being the stability of the formed radical [36,39,40]. Therefore, the structure of the tested compounds and electronic effects of groups/substituents in structures plays a significant role in antioxidant activity [36,37,41]. It is generally known that there are 3 types of electron effects: mesomeric (or resonance), inductive, and steric hindrance. Substituents on the compounds, which are known as electrondonating groups (OH, NH
 <sub>2</sub>, OCH
 <sub>3</sub>, CH
 <sub>3</sub>, etc.) and electron-withdrawing groups (NO2 , CN, CF
 <sub>3</sub>, F, Cl, Br, etc.), significantly affect antioxidant activity [42]. On the other hand, the position of these groups/substituents in the molecules plays a major role in antioxidant activity as well.
