<p>In compound 5, the 3 n → π* transitions of the thiosemicarbazone moiety (C=S) are at 352 (shoulder), 370, and 390 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 4. While the bands in the spectral region 286 nm (shoulder) can be assigned to the azomethine C=N double bond to the n → π* transitions, the π → π* transitions of C=C on the aromatic structure are seen at 256 nm, as shown in Figure 4. The electronic spectral data of all of the compounds are summarized in Table 6. These values are in agreement with the results that were reported for similar compounds [11,33–35].</p>
