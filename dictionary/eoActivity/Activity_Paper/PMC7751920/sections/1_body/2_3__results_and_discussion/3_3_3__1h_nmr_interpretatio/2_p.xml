<p>In compound 4, the signal of imine (-CH=N) was observed as a singlet at 8.21 ppm. The -N
 <sup>1</sup>H and -N
 <sup>2</sup>H proton signals of the thiosemicarbazone region were observed as a singlet at 10.24 and 12.05 ppm, respectively. The aromatic proton signals of the isatin ring (H1–H5) were detected between 7.79 and 7.26 ppm (Figure 2). The H1 proton showed as a singlet peak at 7.79 ppm. The H3 proton coupled to the H4 and H5 protons and observed doublet of doublets peakes at 7.62–7.60 ( 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.4, 1.8 Hz) ppm. The H4 proton coupled to the H3 and H5 protons and showed triplet peaks at 7.43–7.39 ( 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.1 Hz) ppm. The H5 proton coupled to the H3 and H4 protons and showed doublet of doublets peaks at 7.29–7.26 ( 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.0, 3.0 Hz) ppm. The H6 proton was detected as a singlet peak at 7.97 (s, 2H) ppm. For compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> , the proton signals of the methoxy group (–OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) showed as a singlet at 3.90 and 3.72 ppm. For compound 8, the proton signal of methylene group (–CH
 <sub>2</sub>) was observed as a doublet at 4.82–4.80 (2H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.1 Hz) ppm; the –NH proton signal was detected as a triplet at 9.10–9.07 (1H, t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.1 Hz). Similarly, the methylene group (-CH 
 <sup>2</sup> –N) proton signal was observed as a quartet at 3.82–3.76 (2H, q, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 5.8, 2.4 Hz) ppm; the methylene group (Ar–CH
 <sub>2</sub>) proton signal showed as a triplet at 2.97–2.93 (2H, t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.4 Hz) ppm. The –NH proton signal was detected as a triplet at 8.63–8.60 (1H, t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 5.8 Hz) for compound 
 <bold>9</bold> (see Supplementary information). These results are highly consistent with values for similar compounds. [7,10,25,28].
