<p>In compound 4, the -C=S (C7) signal of the thiosemicarbazone region was observed at 176.4 ppm. The characteristic -C=N (C8) peak of imine was observed at 141.0 ppm. The carbons (C1–C6) of aryl the ring were detected at 143.2, 132.6, 130.1, 125.7, 125.5, and 124.8 ppm, respectively. The aromatic C signals of the terephthalaldehyde region (C9–C10) were observed at 135.9 and 128.4 ppm. The C2 (143.2 ppm) carbon atoms shifted downfield (high values of δ) , which was caused by the presence of the chlorine group. These results are in agreement with the data reported for similar compounds [8–10,28,29].</p>
