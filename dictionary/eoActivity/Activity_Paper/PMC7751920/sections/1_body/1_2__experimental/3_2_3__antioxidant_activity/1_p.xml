<p>The antioxidant activities of the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated based on the studies of Brand-Williams (with slight modification) using DPPH radical scavenging activity analysis [26]. Stock solutions of the compounds in DMSO at a concentration of 250 μM were prepared. The previously prepared DPPH solution was used in 3 mL with a concentration of 100 μM in ethanol. DPPH solution was added to different concentrations of the compound solutions (0.5–10.0 μM) and enough ethanol to bring the volume up to a total of 5 mL. This mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The measurement against the gap was taken at 517 nm, and the radical scavenging activity was expressed as a percentage of inhibition. Percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows [27]:</p>
