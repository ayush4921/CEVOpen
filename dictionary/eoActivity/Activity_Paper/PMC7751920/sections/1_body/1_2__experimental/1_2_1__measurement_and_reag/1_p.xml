<p>All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) or Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). They were used without further purification. A Stuart SMP30 melting point apparatus (Cole-Parmer Instruments Co., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) was used to determine melting points. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Alpha Fourier transform IR (FT–IR) spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA, USA). NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker Avance DPX–400 (400 MHz) spectrophotometer using dimethyl sulfoxide-
