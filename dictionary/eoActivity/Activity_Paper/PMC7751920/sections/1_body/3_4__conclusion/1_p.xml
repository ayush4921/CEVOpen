<p>In this study, Schiff-base–bearing new bis(thiosemicarbazones) have been obtained, with excellent yields of 72%–97%. The structure of all of the compounds was elucidated using spectroscopic methods such as FT–IR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and UV–Vis, as well as elemental analysis. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the synthesized molecules was determined using the DPPH free-radical trapping process. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the newly obtained molecules ranged from 3.81 ± 0.01 to 29.05 ± 0.11 μM. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> had the best satisfactory antioxidant activity against the DPPH radical. Additionally, the structure–activity relationships were studied in relation to the presence, types, and position of substituents. Among all of the test molecules, a compound which possesses electron-attracting groups has higher antioxidant activity against DPPH free radicals than electron-donating groups.
