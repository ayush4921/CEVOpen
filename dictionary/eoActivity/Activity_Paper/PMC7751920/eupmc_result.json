    "Schiff-base-bearing new bis(thiosemicarbazone) derivatives were prepared from terephthalaldehyde and various thiosemicarbazides. FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and UV-Vis spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis were used to elucidate the identification of the synthesized molecules. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds was analysed with the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free-radical-trapping process. The synthesized compounds exhibited lower antioxidant activity than the standard ascorbic acid. IC<sub>50</sub> values of the synthesized molecules measured from 3.81 ± 0.01 to 29.05 ± 0.11 μM. Among the synthesized compounds, compound <b>3</b> had the best antioxidant activity. Moreover, this study explained the structure-activity relationship of the synthesized molecules with different substituents in radical trapping reactions."
