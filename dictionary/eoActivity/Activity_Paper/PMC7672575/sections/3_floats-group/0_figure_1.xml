  <p>The schematic mechanism of replication of SARS-CoV-2 into host cell. Spike (S) protein on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) recognizes the ACE2 receptor on the cellular membrane of host cell. After receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The conformational changes at the S1 and S2 subunits facilitate the virusâ€“cell fusion via the endosomal pathway. The viral genome is released into the cytoplasm and translated through the ribosomal frame, shifting to generate replicas polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. Negative-sense RNA intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs). The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny virions. Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural and accessory proteins. Following gRNA and sgRNA synthesis, the viral proteins and genome RNA are inserted into virions and assembled in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and then transported in the vesicle to the plasma membrane before releasing out via exocytosis pathway [
