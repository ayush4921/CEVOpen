<p>In an attempt to use honey as one of the treatments against COVID-19, antiviral properties of honey need to be exploited. Since ancient times, it is believed that honey is a valuable cure against pathogenic respiratory agents, including viruses that cause cough [

Several studies showed antiviral activity of honey against a wide range of viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, and influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the therapeutic potential of honey against COVID-19 has still not been studied. Although many people believe that the antiviral effect of honey may work against SARS-CoV-2 and/or play an immunomodulatory role in COVID-19 patients, the potential mechanism of action still unclear. Therefore, it is worth clarifying these points scientifically, based on previous reports. In this review, we describe the potential effects of honey as a natural remedy to support our ongoing combat against COVID-19.
