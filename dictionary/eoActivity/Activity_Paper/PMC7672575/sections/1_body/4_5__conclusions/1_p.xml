<p>Overall, there are direct and indirect groups of evidence described in the literature referring to the opportunity of honey as a complementary therapy or preventive natural product amid COVID-19 outbreak. Consuming honey might help in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection either directly based on its potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, or indirectly through boosting immune responses. The direct and indirect medicinal properties of honey against COVID-19 are mainly associated with its content of antioxidant phenolic compounds. However, despite honey benefits, it does not compensate seeking medical consultation and using medications. Further preclinical and clinical investigations are urgently needed to deeply explore the mechanisms of action for honey against COVID-19. A deeper and critical analysis of the pharmacokinetics of phenolic compounds derived from honey should also be performed.</p>
