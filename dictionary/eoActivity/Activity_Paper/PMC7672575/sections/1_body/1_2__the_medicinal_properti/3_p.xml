<p>So far, the full process of absorption, metabolism, and excretion, which might be valid for all phenolic compounds, still requires clarification. Although the mechanisms behind the bioavailability of phenolic compounds have been addressed in few studies, only a few of these studies have specifically focused on those compounds derived from honey [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The utilization of phenolic compounds from honey in the clinical practice is often hampered by their very low bioavailability and absorption [

This reaction can be performed by the lactase phlorizin hydrolase and the cytosolic β-glucosidase called β-endoglucosidase enzymes and are present in the small intestine [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These enzymes are responsible for catalyzing the β-hydrolysis of the sugar in the glycosylated phenolic compounds so they can be absorbed by the small intestine [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Some compounds contain sugars that prohibit the absorption but are deglycosylated by enzymes of microfloras presented in the colon. The final metabolites can either be absorbed or excreted through the feces or kidneys [
