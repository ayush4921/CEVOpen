<p>Published literatures revealed that the glycoprotein (GP) of the RNA Ebola virus (EBOV) could bind to the MD-2 hydrophobic pocket. Thus, it implicates the induction of the MD-2/TLR4 signaling axis and increases the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [

 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Another study showed that EBOV-GP was implicated in the induction of the severity of infection and T lymphocyte death [

Supporting results from other researchers demonstrated that the GPs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the fusion (F) protein of RSV, and the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of dengue virus (DENV) are also involved in the activation of MD-2/TLR4 signaling axis [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], where it infects T lymphocytes through the S protein-mediated membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can replicate the infected T lymphocytes. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has nsps 1â€“16 that results from cleavage of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, as well as three structural glycoproteins, including S, envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This evidence might indicate that acute inflammatory response among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 might at least partly result from activation of the MD-2/TLR4 signaling axis. However, so far, there are no studies reported on the direct interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and TLR4. The molecular mechanisms of the MD-2/TLR4 signaling pathway are presented in
