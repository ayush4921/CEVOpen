<p>Previous reports on patients infected with HIV showed that consumption of honey helps to boost their immunity through the increase of lymphocytes proliferation, and generally improves their haematological and biochemical status (e.g., erythrocytes, haemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, copper, and proteins levels) [
