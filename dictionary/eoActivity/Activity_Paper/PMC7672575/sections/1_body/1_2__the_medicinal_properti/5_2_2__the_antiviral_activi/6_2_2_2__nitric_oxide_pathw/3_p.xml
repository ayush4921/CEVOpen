<p>In another study, researchers used NO donor

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) for MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses [

 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In this study, NO donor SNAP inhibited SARS-CoV replication in a dose-dependent manner from 100 μM to 400 μM, while the possibility that the antiviral effect resulted from general cytotoxicity was excluded and confirmed by MTT assay.
