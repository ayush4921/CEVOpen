<p>Furthermore, it has been proposed that TLR4 activation could be beneficial for the viruses during viral infection, especially for those RNA viruses with a high mutation rate [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This advantage might be attributed by induction of host factors that encourage viral replication or suppress those that impede antiviral response [

On the other hand, TLR4 antagonists have shown suppressive inflammatory effects in several animal models of viral infections, including influenza viruses (have a close mechanism of coronaviruses); these effects have been remarked by the decreased production of cytokines and chemokines, in addition to relieved disease symptoms [
