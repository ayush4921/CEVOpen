<p>Although there are different types of honey from various producer bees, the chemical composition of 100 g of the commonly consumed honeys include approximately 64.9–73.1% carbohydrates, 35.6–41.8% fructose, 25.4–28.1% glucose, 16.9–18% water, 1.8–2.7% maltose, 0.23–1.21% sucrose, and 0.50–1% proteins, vitamins, amino acids, and minerals [

Phenolic compounds are plant secondary metabolites founded in honey with diverse chemical structures including phenolic acids and polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids). Despite the variability in the chemical composition of honeys, the most abundant flavonoids are apigenin, quercetin, luteolin, chrysin, kaempferol, galangin, genistein, pinocembrin, and pinobanksin, while the most abundant phenolic acids are gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid,
