<p>According to the current literature, the severity of COVID-19 infection correlates with lymphocytopenia, and patients who died from COVID-19 had lower lymphocyte counts compared to survivors [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These data suggest that lymphocyte-mediated antiviral activity is poorly effective against COVID-19. Despite lymphocytopenia, evidence for an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1 and IL-6) has been reported in the course of acute respiratory syndrome in COVID-19 infected patients, aggravating the clinical course of the disease [
