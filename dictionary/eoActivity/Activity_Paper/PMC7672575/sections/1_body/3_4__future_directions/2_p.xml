<p>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a common antioxidant that showed antiviral immune responses, especially against the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Although the familiar sources of ascorbic acid are fruit and vegetables, it is also one of the essential vitamins in some honeys [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Currently, there are four registered clinical trials using ascorbic acid as a treatment for patients infected with COVID-19 (NCT04354428, NCT03680274, NCT04344184, and NCT04357782), in addition to another clinical trial that uses it synergistically with hydroxychloroquine for prevention purposes in adults exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04328961) [

 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, and pinocembrin are also essential phenolic compounds present in commonly consumed honeys [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and study of the therapeutic effect of bee propolis against HSV-1 has confirmed their antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Furthermore, the flavonoids isoquercetin, rutin, and quercetin are also constituents identified in honey [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. A study on the influenza A virus (H5N1) has shown that each isoquercetin, rutin, and quercetin, isolated from the 
 <italic>Capparis sinaica</italic> Veil (plant), has antiviral activity by reduction of H5N1 load, respectively [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The antiviral activities of all these compounds in honey are still undiscovered.
