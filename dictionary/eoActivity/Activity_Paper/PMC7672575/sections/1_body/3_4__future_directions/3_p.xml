<p>The described antiviral activity of honey could also be due to the fatty acid 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HAD); it was proposed that 10-HAD induces the adhesion of leukocytes to viruses, resulting in their eradication [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been shown that 10-HAD promotes the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human monocytes and the capability of T helper cell type-1 (Th1) polarization, which refers to a reinforcement in antiviral immunity [

 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], another structure of fatty acids has been reported in both RJ and honey, and it is 3-hydroxy-sebacic acid (SEA) [
