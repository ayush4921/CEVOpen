<p>A study of virtual screening of some natural flavonoids from plant extracts against S protein has shown the high binding affinity of these compounds that is still undiscovered from honey, such as neohesperidin, licoflavonol, piceatannol, cosmosiin, excoecariatoxin, mangostin, phyllaemblicin, and kouitchenside D [
