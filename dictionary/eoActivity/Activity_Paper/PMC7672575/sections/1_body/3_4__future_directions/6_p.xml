<p>Since not all honeys contain similar constituents, future studies should select honey with rich content of these compounds or any other potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Of note, studies have shown that honeys of stingless bees (found in tropical countries) are rich with the majority of those compounds that could have antiviral activities (
