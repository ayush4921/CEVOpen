<p>Antiviral activity of caffeic acid has previously been reported against HSV, poliovirus, and influenza A virus [

 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. CAPE is shown to have antiviral activity against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [

 <xref rid="B111-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Although none of these studies have assessed the antiviral effects of these compounds directly extracted from honey, an in vitro study assessed the role of caffeic acid, galangin, and chrysin in bee propolis against HSV-1 and confirmed their antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. However, the exact mechanisms of these compounds for their antiviral activities, especially against RNA viruses, are still lacking.
