<p>It is worth mentioning that SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> shares 99.02% sequence identity with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and thus it is considered as a proven drug discovery target [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The potential inhibitory effect of chrysin has also been suggested previously by another computational analysis, and not only against the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> but also against the second SARS-CoV-2 protease, papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. It has been reported that SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> is implicated in viral evasion of the innate immune responses by stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from the infected cell proteins [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], thus suggesting that targeting SARS-CoV-2 PL
 <sup>pro</sup> might potentially inhibit viral replication and immune evasion.
