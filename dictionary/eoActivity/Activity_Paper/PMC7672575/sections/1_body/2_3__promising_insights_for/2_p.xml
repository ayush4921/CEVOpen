<p>On April 13, 2020, an exciting preprint was posted on ChemRxiv by Heba Hashem, where the author had conducted an in silico analysis (molecular docking) to assess the potential effects of natural phenolic chemical compounds from honey against SARS-COV-2 [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Heba suggested that caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), galangin, and chrysin have good potential to inhibit the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) enzyme, and thus inhibit viral replication [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The overall concept of this hypothesis is extensively explained in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05017-f007">Figure 7</xref>. However, these findings are still missing a supportive quantitative analysis on how much caffeic acid, CAPE, galangin, and chrysin are required to cause direct inhibitory actions on the SARS-CoV-2 proteases.
