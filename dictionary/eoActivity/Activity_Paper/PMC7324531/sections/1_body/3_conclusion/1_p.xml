<p>In the present study, plant extracts, derived from three different medicinal plant species, were used to synthesize AgNPs. The use of the plant extracts has an advantage over chemical or physical synthesis of AgNPs due to their ability to stabilize AgNPs, their own antibacterial properties, their high level of efficacy, and their low toxicity. Their use represents an eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of AgNPs. The extracts of three new plant resources (
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>) were found to be have excellent potential for the commercial production of AgNPs. The plant-derived AgNPs exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against different clinically important human pathogens. It is safer and more advantageous to biosynthesize metal nanoparticles using the natural reducing agents present in plants and microbes along with the conjugation of AgNPs to natural, antimicrobial molecules produced by microbes or plants. This line of research should be more greatly explored in the biomedical sciences. There is a high level of recently developed, drug-resistant microbes appearing in semi-tropical environments due to climate change, and this represents a significant health issue. Current antibiotics, and the antibiotic concept of fighting pathogens, is rapidly becoming insufficient for combatting new strains of existing pathogens and new disease-causing organisms. High throughput nanobiotechnology curated antimicrobials offer a new approach to treat microbial pathogens that are resistant to current treatment practices and for the treatment of biofilms. The present study demonstrates the potential of using plant-derived AgNPs to inhibit biofilm formation for therapeutic treatments that represent a new method of effectively treating a variety of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microbes.
