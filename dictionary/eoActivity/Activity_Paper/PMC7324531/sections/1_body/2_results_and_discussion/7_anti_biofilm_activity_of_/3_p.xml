<p>Limited research has been conducted on the anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs. The formation of bacterial biofilms is the result of the synthesis and secretion of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by bacterial cells, a prerequisite for biofilm formation (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Landini et al., 2010</xref>). The bacteria respond to environmental cues that induce the synthesis of EPS. As a result, if the formation of EPS can be inhibited or prevented, then biofilm formation will also be restricted. This premise was the basis of our assay on the anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs. 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kalishwaralal et al. (2010)</xref> previously reported the anti-biofilm activity of biosynthesized AgNPs against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> In that study, AgNPs of 100 nm in size exhibited inhibited biofilm formation by 95-98%. 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gurunathan et al. (2014)</xref> also studied anti-biofilm capacity of AgNPs against four human pathogens: 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia.</italic> They reported high levels of anti-biofilm activity by AgNPs of a particle size &lt; 100nm. 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et al. (2013)</xref> also investigated the anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs and clearly demonstrated that the inhibition of EPS synthesis was directly proportional to anti-biofilm activity. 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2010)</xref> studied the antibiofilm activity of AgNPs against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and proposed that biosorption may be the major factor responsible for the inactivation of biofilm formation. 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Goswami et al. (2015)</xref> also reported on biofilm eradication by AgNPs and found that the use of 15 mg/ml of AgNPs resulted in an 89% inhibition of biofilm formation in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 75% in 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> Results of the present research confirm the efficacy of Ag-NPs against biofilms produced by the Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the Gram-positive bacterium, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, at reasonably low concentrations. The current results also revealed that the tested bacteria are highly sensitive to GL-AgNPs, BR-AgNPs, and SA-AgNPs, suggesting that the complex biofilm signaling mechanism could also be associated with cell survival. Recently, research has been conducted on conjugating the antibiotic, rifampicin, with chemically synthesized AgNPs for use in combatting biofilm formation by methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (
