<p>The spectra obtained with Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to classify the functional groups of the phytoconstituents present in the leaf extracts, which were potentially involved in the synthesis and stabilization of the synthesized silver nano-particles. The interaction of AgNPs with the phytoconstituents present in the leaf extracts of all three plant species exhibited intense peaks at 3735.93, 2247.27, 1537.60, 1717.06, and 570.99 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (

 <sup>–1</sup> strongly suggests the binding of silver ions with the hydroxyl (–OH) group stretching from water and the broad spectrum at 2247.27 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> indicates a strong stretching of -C≡N (nitrile) group. The other three bands (∼1717.06, 1537.60, and ∼570.99 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) were due to stretching vibrations of C=O (ketone), C=O (amide), and C–I functional groups. C=O (ketone) and C=O (amide) are generally present in proteins involved in the reduction of metal ions. These data suggest that hydroxyl and carbonyl groups may be responsible for the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. The IR data revealed that the compounds present in the leaf extract were present as a layer over the phyto-synthesized AgNPs and act as a stabilizing agent. Structural mechanism reveals that via Free amine groups or cysteine residues in the saponins, phenolics and quinones present in the leaf extracts have the ability to bind to the AgNPs and stabilize them through the surface-binding of a variety of plant compounds (
