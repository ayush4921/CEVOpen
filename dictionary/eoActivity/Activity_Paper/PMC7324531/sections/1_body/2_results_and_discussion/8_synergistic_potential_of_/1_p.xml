<p>The individual studies of antibacterial and antibiofilm activities on plant extract and synthesized AgNPs from the respective plant extracts have shown they have the reducing capacity to form respective bioactive AgNPs. The main aim of the synergistic activity study was to understand the possible combinatorial potentiality of the AgNPs and plant extract to control the biofilm formation by the pathogenic organisms. As discussed, the plant constituents having a reducing capacity if silver metallic salts are involved and attached to the AgNPs to stabilize the particles. During the synergistic study, the different ratios of synthesized AgNPs and plant extracts were mixed and applied for the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities and measured in terms of the percentage (%) of inhibition against the microorganisms taken for the study. The synergistic results are quite relevant to the results of the individual results, but overall synergistic potentiality was not that accountable what the individual activities were shown by AgNPs. Hence the current results of the synergistic activity are not recommended for practical applications. The results of both AgNPs and respective plant extracts synergistically are depicted in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. The total concentration of the test samples were kept at 100 μg/ml and made the same with AgNPs and plant extracts with different ratios and tested against the test strains. Overall, the synthesized AgNPs alone have greater potential than the addition of respective plant extracts for controlling bacterial growth and biofilm formations. It can be assumed that when the concentration of the raw plant extract was increased, the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity was reduced due to the presence of some microbial growth promoting plant constituents in the extract. On the contrary, when the plant-synthesized AgNPs were applied, the results were highly significant for the purpose of the current study which revealed that the limited bioactive phytoconstituents with silver was highly active for the real world application in controlling the bacterial contaminations. In the antibacterial activity of GL-AgNPs (

 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, while AgNPs showed reduced activities. When increasing concentrations of plant extract were added, the activity was lowered compared to the AgNPs. Therefore, the GL-AgNPs were shown to be highly promising for antibacterial activity rather than for synergistic applications. Likewise, in the case of SA-AgNPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>) and BR-AgNPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>), the individual AgNPs possessed greater potential compared to the synergetic activity. The antibacterial activity was reduced when the concentration of GL-AgNPs was low compared to GL-extracts against all 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. At a concentration of 100 μg/ml of GL-AgNPs, &gt;99% inhibition was observed against all the pathogens, but when the concentration was reduced to a 1:3 ratio, the inhibition was 41, 32.10, and 31.4% against 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Here it is clearly indicated that the GL-extract contains some nutritional factors for the microbes. In the case of SA-AgNPs, the 100% inhibition was found at a ratio of 3: 1 (AgNPs:SA-extracts) against all 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, but the percentage of the inhibition was gradually reduced when the concentration of SA-AgNPs was decreased. Likewise, BR-AgNPs possess the potential to act against test strains with 99.8% inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> by SA-AgNPs solely. A more interesting result was found against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> where 100% inhibition was observed at the concentration of 1: 1 (BR-AgNPs: BR-extracts). At a 3:1 ratio of BR-AgNPs and BR-extracts, 100% inhibition was found against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. From the results, the AgNPs are shown to have a better effect than mixing with respective plant extracts. For all the microorganisms used in the study, the phyto-synthesized AgNPs alone had better results compared with adding respective plant extracts for an antibacterial purpose. As the study was targeted to promote the natural plant product-based synthesis and applications of nanoparticles, the synergetic combination was focused by using plant extracts rather than any commercial antibiotics used against the organisms. Many synergetic applications of the AgNPs, along with current commercial antibiotics with different concentrations, show more antibacterial activities (
