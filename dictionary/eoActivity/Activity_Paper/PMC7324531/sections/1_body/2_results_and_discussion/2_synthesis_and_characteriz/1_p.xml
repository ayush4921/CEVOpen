<p>The growing increase in microbial resistance to both currently available and newly developed antibiotics is a worldwide problem. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers identify and develop new methods to deal with antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens, as well as the ever-growing appearance of new, virulent pathogens (
