<p>The primary objective of the current study was to synthesize small-sized AgNPs using leaf extracts of the medicinal plants, 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, as a reducing, stabilizing, and capping agent. Silver nitrate (1 mM) was added to leaf extracts obtained from these plants and incubated overnight (60Â°C, pH 7.5) to regulate the size of particles. Successful synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by visual observation of a color change of the solution, in which the pale-yellow color of the mixture of leaf extract and AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> turned to a deep brown color. No color change was observed in control mixtures consisting of just leaf extracts and sterile, deionized water. The appearance of a deep brown color indicates the formation of AgNPs (
