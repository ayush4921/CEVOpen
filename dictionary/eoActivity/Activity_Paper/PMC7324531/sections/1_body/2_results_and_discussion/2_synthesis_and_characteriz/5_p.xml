<p>The color of the reaction mixture turned from a pale yellow to a deep brown after an appropriate length of incubation, indicating the formation of AgNPs. It is believed that the change in color of the reaction mixture is due to the presence of specific phytocompounds in the leaf extract, suggesting that the reducing power of the phytoconstituents is responsible for the synthesis of the AgNPs. If so, this represents a novel, eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. The absorption peak characteristic of AgNPs was clearly detected due to the combined vibration of the electrons of AgNPs being in resonance with the specific wavelengths of light. The distinct and single SPR band at 420â€“430 nm confirms the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> to Ag
 <sup>0</sup>. Similar observations have been made in studies on the synthesis of AgNPs (
