<p>Prior to determining the antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs, a detailed characterization of the synthesized AgNPs was conducted using methods described in our previous publications (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2017a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). UV–visible spectroscopy is an established method for the study of metal nanoparticles. We used UV–Vis spectrophotometric analysis to monitor the continuous synthesis of AgNPs. A strong and broad peak within the 420–430 nm range was frequently observed, which is the peak range characteristic for AgNPs (
