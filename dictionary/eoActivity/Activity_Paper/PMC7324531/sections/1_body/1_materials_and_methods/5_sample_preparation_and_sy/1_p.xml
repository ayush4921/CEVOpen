<p>Fresh leaves were collected from healthy plants of. 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> growing in a hilly area of the Simlipal Biosphere Reserve, India. The plant leaves were thoroughly washed and then dried in a hot air oven. The dried leaves were then pulverized and passed through a 20-mesh sieve. Five gram of leaf powder were added to 50 ml of sterilized deionized water and sonicated for 15–20 min. The resulting mixture was filtered through Whatman’s filter paper and maintained at 4°C until further use. Extracts were prepared from each of the species separately. The filtered leaf extracts were used to synthesize the AgNPs by adding 10 ml of extract to 90 ml of 1 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> in an aqueous solution and incubating the resulting solution overnight at 60°C. A similar protocol was used for each of the plant extracts. The synthesis of AgNPs was monitored by UV–Vis spectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer-λ35) in the range of 350–600 nm.
