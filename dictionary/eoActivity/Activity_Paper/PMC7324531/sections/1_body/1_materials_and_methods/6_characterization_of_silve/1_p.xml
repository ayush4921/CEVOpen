<p>The synthesized AgNPs were characterized using methods that have been previously described (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2016a</xref>). The size range and surface charge (Zeta) of dispersed NPs were determined using a Zeta sizer (Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, United Kingdom). Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Brucker) analysis of spectra within the range of 500–4,000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> was conducted to determine the role of the phytoconstituents in NPs synthesis. Surface morphology was confirmed by observation of the synthesized AgNPs with a Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Jeol 6480LV JSM microscope, United States) operating at an acceleration voltage of 15 KV.
