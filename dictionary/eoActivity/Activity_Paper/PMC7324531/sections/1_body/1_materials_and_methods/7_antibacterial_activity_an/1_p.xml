<p>The different species of pathogenic bacteria were cultured in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) to determine the MIC of the synthesized AgNPs. Cell suspensions of each organism were adjusted to attain the required cell numbers per ml by measuring the turbidity of cell suspensions in a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda35, Germany). The antimicrobial assay was conducted in 96-well microtiter plate using a two-fold serial dilution of AgNPs to determine 50% inhibition of microbial growth. Standard broth (MHB) was used according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Clinical, and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2005</xref>). In addition to the synthesized AgNPs, the extracts from the respective plants were also assayed for antimicrobial activity. A standardized concentration of each test organism was obtained by adjusting the turbidity of each suspension culture to an OD = 0.003 at 600 nm (∼100-fold dilution of parent culture). For the assay, 190 μl of the test-adjusted cell suspension of an organism and 10 μl of different concentrations (μg/ml) of the AgNPs were added to wells of a microtiter plate. The same protocol was used to assay the plant extracts and the antibiotic Gentamycin, the latter of which was used as a positive control. To correct for the absorbance of the AgNPs or plant extracts, control wells were used containing 190 μl MH broth (devoid of organisms) and 10 μl of AgNPs or plant extract. The plates were wrapped with parafilm and incubated after a thorough mixing of the components. The MICs of AgNPs were expressed as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and the mean ± standard deviation was calculated.
