<p>Several reports pertaining to the plant-mediated synthesis of AgNPs have been published. These reports have demonstrated the efficiency of plant metabolites in the synthesis of bioactive AgNPs. Although plant-mediated synthesis of AgNPs has been demonstrated, it is important to note that each plant species has its unique composition of bioactive constituents. These plant secondary metabolites include flavonoids, phenolic compounds, glycosides, and sterols, which have been reported to be responsible for the reduction of silver ions to the elemental silver (

Since plant species vary in the composition and quantity of secondary metabolites, a broad range of plant species should be examined for their ability and efficiency to biosynthesize metal nanoparticles. This exploration can be used to overcome biomedical constraints and other production-related problems. Synthesis of AgNPs using phyto-molecules may help to overcome the problems associated with toxic chemical reagents. The plant

Since many cancer drugs exhibit debilitating side effects and have a questionable impact on cancer cells, the use of natural medicines derived from natural sources should be urgently explored.
