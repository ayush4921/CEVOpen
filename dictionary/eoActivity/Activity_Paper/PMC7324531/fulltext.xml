Nanotechnology, however, represents a new approach to fighting and eradicating biofilm-forming microorganisms. In the present study, the sustainable synthesis and characterization of biocompatible silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from leaf extracts of <italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic>, <italic>Glochidion lanceolarium</italic>, and <italic>Bridelia retusa</italic> was explored. Continuous synthesis was observed in a UV&#x02013;vis spectroscopic analysis and the participating phytoconstituents, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, phytosterols, and glycosides, were characterized by Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The size and surface charge of the particles were also measured by dynamic light scattering spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy study was employed to examine the morphology of the nanoparticles. The spectroscopic and microscopic study confirmed the successful synthesis of AgNPs by plant extracts acting as strong reducing agents. The synthesized AgNPs were screened for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against human pathogens <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.

Nanoparticles exhibit a broad range of physicochemical properties that greatly contrast their bulk analogs. Nanoparticles in the size range of 1-100 nm display unique and novel properties (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jeevanandam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zia-ur-Rehman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Teulon et al., 2019</xref>). Nanoscale materials exhibit their unique properties due to their high surface energy, large proportion of surface atoms, low level of imperfection, and spatial confinement (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2009</xref>). Nanoparticles have distinct advantages over bulk materials due to their surface plasmon light scattering, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface-enhanced Rayleigh scattering, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) properties (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2007</xref>). Due to their unique features, nanoscale materials can be used as building blocks for various optoelectronics, electronics, chemical sensing, and biological applications (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ramanavicius et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Silver is recognized for its anti-microbial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2016b</xref>). Silver (Ag) has been used since ancient times for its medicinal properties and now the activity and application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is being explored in medical research. Topical antimicrobial ointments and creams contain silver to prevent microbial infection of burns and open wounds. Silver is also commonly used in medical devices and implants that are manufactured with silver-impregnated polymers. In addition, several silver-containing consumer products, such as colloidal silver gel and silver-embedded fabrics, are now used in sporting equipment (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Song and Kim, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The easiest and most convenient approach for the rapid synthesis of AgNPs, which has been used for decades, is by a chemical synthesis process. The chemical approach to AgNP synthesis, however, involves the use of several toxic reagents. As several metal nanoparticles, such as gold, platinum, and silver, are frequently used in ointments, creams, cosmetics, etc., that interface with human skin, methods of nanoparticle synthesis that have low toxicity and are eco-friendly need to be explored and developed (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Nayak et al., 2015</xref>). Several biological approaches for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles have been proposed, including the use of microorganisms (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Narayanan and Sakthivel, 2010</xref>) and plants (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mittal et al., 2013</xref>). Plant-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is highly attractive as it requires less effort than maintaining and culturing microorganisms. Plants&#x02019; biomolecules are natural and typically exhibit low toxicity to living cells which makes the use of plant metabolites in the synthesis of AgNPs favorable (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mittal et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several reports pertaining to the plant-mediated synthesis of AgNPs have been published. These reports have demonstrated the efficiency of plant metabolites in the synthesis of bioactive AgNPs. Although plant-mediated synthesis of AgNPs has been demonstrated, it is important to note that each plant species has its unique composition of bioactive constituents. These plant secondary metabolites include flavonoids, phenolic compounds, glycosides, and sterols, which have been reported to be responsible for the reduction of silver ions to the elemental silver (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dauthal and Mukhopadhyay, 2016</xref>). Since plant species vary in the composition and quantity of secondary metabolites, a broad range of plant species should be examined for their ability and efficiency to biosynthesize metal nanoparticles. This exploration can be used to overcome biomedical constraints and other production-related problems. Synthesis of AgNPs using phyto-molecules may help to overcome the problems associated with toxic chemical reagents. The plant <italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic> (family Anacardiaceae) is a well-known medicinal plant in India. In the Ayurvedic system of medical treatment, different plant parts are commonly used as a medicine for alimentary tract impairments and certain dermatological problems. <italic>S. anacardium</italic> has a positive effect on blood pressure, cancer, and heart disease, as well as respiration and neurological disorders (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Glochidion lanceolarium</italic> (family Phyllanthaceae) is an important ethnomedical plant used for the treatment of gastrointestinal complaints (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chanda et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Bridelia retusa</italic> (family Phyllanthaceae) exhibits pharmacologically potent antiviral, hypoglycemic, and immunomodulatory activity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ghawate et al., 2015</xref>). The latter plant has also been reported to be effective in wound healing (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Deore et al., 2014</xref>). The anticancer properties of these plants, however, have not been fully explored. Since many cancer drugs exhibit debilitating side effects and have a questionable impact on cancer cells, the use of natural medicines derived from natural sources should be urgently explored.</p><p>The management of public health is a major issue in the modern, industrial world, due to the rising pervasiveness of microbial resistance. Although numerous new antibiotics have been discovered and developed, multidrug-resistant bacteria are still becoming more prevalent and are creating a serious public health risk (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mohanty et al., 2017</xref>).Thus, there is a critical need to develop a new, powerful therapeutic approach to treat and kill Gram-negative, as well as Gram-positive, human pathogens. The biosynthesis and application of metal nanoparticles is now receiving great interest as a viable option due to its moderate success in being used to facilitate drug delivery (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), treat chronic disease (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2008</xref>), and for its ability to treat bacterial infections in wounded tissues (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rai et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Comprehensive studies of antimicrobial resistance have revealed that bacterial infections that resist antibiotics are not due to free bacteria but rather to bacteria existing within a biofilm (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Biofilm-forming bacteria are resistant to conventional antimicrobials due to: (1) the inability of the antimicrobial to penetrate the biofilm, (2) evolution complex drug resistance properties, and (3) biofilm mediated inactivation or modification of antimicrobial enzymes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Elbourne et al., 2019</xref>). Fortunately, nanoparticle-based antimicrobials have been developed and marketed to eradicate both planktonic and biofilm-forming antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Continuous research is being conducted to develop eco-friendly nanotechnologies utilizing natural phytochemicals to produce metal nanoparticle-based antimicrobials for the control of biofilm-forming pathogens.</p><p>In this regard, the objective of the current study was to explore the use of ethno-medicinally important plants, <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and <italic>B. retusa</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2016</xref>), for the synthesis of AgNPs utilizing secondary metabolites present in leaf extracts. The formation of AgNPs were monitored by microscopy and spectroscopy to evaluate the synthesis process, and the phytoconstituents most likely responsible for the synthesis of the AgNPs compounds were characterized using different qualitative tests. The phyto-mediated synthesized AgNPs were also screened for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against the human pathogens, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Gram &#x02013;ve), and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram +ve) in order to assess their potential use in antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Chemicals and Reagents</title><p>The chemicals used during the experiments, such as Mueller Hinton medium and silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>), were purchased from Hi-media (India) and Sigma-Aldrich (India), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS2"><title>Microbial Strains and Plant Specimens</title><p>The bacterial strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MTCC 741), <italic>E. coli</italic> (MTCC 739), and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MTCC 96) were used in the present study.

The plant leaves were thoroughly washed and then dried in a hot air oven. The dried leaves were then pulverized and passed through a 20-mesh sieve. Five gram of leaf powder were added to 50 ml of sterilized deionized water and sonicated for 15&#x02013;20 min. The resulting mixture was filtered through Whatman&#x02019;s filter paper and maintained at 4&#x000b0;C until further use. Extracts were prepared from each of the species separately. The filtered leaf extracts were used to synthesize the AgNPs by adding 10 ml of extract to 90 ml of 1 mM AgNO<sub>3</sub> in an aqueous solution and incubating the resulting solution overnight at 60&#x000b0;C. A similar protocol was used for each of the plant extracts. The synthesis of AgNPs was monitored by UV&#x02013;Vis spectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer-&#x003bb;35) in the range of 350&#x02013;600 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS6"><title>Characterization of Silver Nanoparticles</title><p>The synthesized AgNPs were characterized using methods that have been previously described (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2016a</xref>).

Cell suspensions of each organism were adjusted to attain the required cell numbers per ml by measuring the turbidity of cell suspensions in a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda35, Germany). The antimicrobial assay was conducted in 96-well microtiter plate using a two-fold serial dilution of AgNPs to determine 50% inhibition of microbial growth. Standard broth (MHB) was used according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Clinical, and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2005</xref>). In addition to the synthesized AgNPs, the extracts from the respective plants were also assayed for antimicrobial activity. A standardized concentration of each test organism was obtained by adjusting the turbidity of each suspension culture to an OD = 0.003 at 600 nm (&#x0223c;100-fold dilution of parent culture). For the assay, 190 &#x003bc;l of the test-adjusted cell suspension of an organism and 10 &#x003bc;l of different concentrations (&#x003bc;g/ml) of the AgNPs were added to wells of a microtiter plate.

Individual wells of the plates were filled with 180 &#x003bc;l of Muller Hinton Broth and 10 &#x003bc;l of the test pathogens (OD = 1.0, 600 nm) were added. Subsequently, 10 &#x003bc;l of AgNPs were added and the preparation was thoroughly mixed. A two-fold dilution series of the AgNPs was used to determine the MIC of AgNPs against biofilm formation. The same was used to test the anti-biofilm activity of the plant extracts and to determine their MIC. After completing the preparation of the test plates, they were incubated in a static condition for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Mixtures without bacteria were used to adjust the OD for absorbance by the extract components. After incubation, the contents of the wells of the microtiter plates were discarded and gently washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove free-floating non-adherent bacterial cells from the walls and bottom of the wells. The wells of the microtiter plates were then air dried for 45 min. After drying, adherent &#x0201c;sessile&#x0201d; bacteria in the wells were fixed with 2% w/v sodium acetate and the wells were then flooded with crystal violet stain (0.1%, w/v) and incubated in the dark for 30 min.

It is well known that plants have a large repository of phenolics and flavonoids molecules which have super antioxidant capacity and are considered to be strong free radical scavengers. The DPPH radical scavenging result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed the antioxidant potentials of aqueous leaf extracts of three ethnomedicinally important plants. The percentage (%) DPPH scavenging activity (IC50) was found to be 16.98 &#x000b1; 0.12 &#x003bc;g/ml, 30.71 &#x000b1; 0.22 &#x003bc;g/ml, and 22.66 &#x000b1; 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively.

Silver nitrate (1 mM) was added to leaf extracts obtained from these plants and incubated overnight (60&#x000b0;C, pH 7.5) to regulate the size of particles. Successful synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by visual observation of a color change of the solution, in which the pale-yellow color of the mixture of leaf extract and AgNO<sub>3</sub> turned to a deep brown color. No color change was observed in control mixtures consisting of just leaf extracts and sterile, deionized water. The appearance of a deep brown color indicates the formation of AgNPs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gurunathan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Prior to determining the antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs, a detailed characterization of the synthesized AgNPs was conducted using methods described in our previous publications (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta and Behera, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mohanta et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).

If so, this represents a novel, eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. The absorption peak characteristic of AgNPs was clearly detected due to the combined vibration of the electrons of AgNPs being in resonance with the specific wavelengths of light.

A strong absorption peak at 3735.93 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> strongly suggests the binding of silver ions with the hydroxyl (&#x02013;OH) group stretching from water and the broad spectrum at 2247.27 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> indicates a strong stretching of -C&#x02261;N (nitrile) group. The other three bands (&#x0223c;1717.06, 1537.60, and &#x0223c;570.99 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) were due to stretching vibrations of C=O (ketone), C=O (amide), and C&#x02013;I functional groups.

Although, AgNPs derived from plant extracts of all three plant species inhibited both Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AgNPs derived from <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extract had the strongest antibacterial activity and was active against both types of bacteria. Therefore, we suggest that <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extracts have the potential to be commercially used to synthesize AgNPs &#x0003c; 100 nm. Apart from the antibacterial activity of the derived AgNPs, <italic>S. anacardium</italic> is also an important medicinal plant, containing alkaloids and polyphenols with high medicinal value, which further strengthens its value in the production of bioactive nanoparticles. The individual plant extracts were also separately analyzed for bactericidal activity to compare their activity with the activity of AgNPs synthesized from their respective plant extracts. Results indicated that all of the plant-extract-derived AgNPs have greater antibacterial activity then the use of their respective plant extracts alone, further confirming the values of using plant-derived AgNPs as antibiotic compounds against human bacterial pathogens.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Antibacterial activity of AgNPs synthesized using plant extracts of <bold>(A)</bold>

Earlier studies by <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004)</xref> focused on the interaction of AgNPs with <italic>E.coli</italic> and confirmed that at the first stage of interaction, AgNPs attach to the bacterial cell wall. After stable adherence, AgNPs penetrate the bacterium and induce cell death by rupturing the cell membrane. AgNPs acting as oxidizing agents on the surface of proteins present on the plasma membrane and cellular homeostasis have also been suggested as the mechanism underlying AgNP antibacterial activity. Another suggestion is that AgNPs attach to the cell membrane surface and decrease its permeability and respiration. The current study, although supportive of all the proposed mechanisms, confirms that the bactericidal activity involves the uptake of AgNPs. Notably, plant-synthesized AgNPs have an added advantage over chemically synthesized AgNPs due to the ability of plant metabolites to function as capping and stabilizing agents, as well as exhibiting their own antibacterial activity, which collectively enhances the antibacterial activity of AgNPs.</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS7"><title>Anti-biofilm Activity of AgNPs</title><p>Silver nanoparticles have also been assayed for anti-biofilm activity against biofilm-forming bacteria.

The formation of bacterial biofilms is the result of the synthesis and secretion of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by bacterial cells, a prerequisite for biofilm formation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Landini et al., 2010</xref>). The bacteria respond to environmental cues that induce the synthesis of EPS. As a result, if the formation of EPS can be inhibited or prevented, then biofilm formation will also be restricted. This premise was the basis of our assay on the anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs. <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kalishwaralal et al. (2010)</xref> previously reported the anti-biofilm activity of biosynthesized AgNPs against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> In that study, AgNPs of 100 nm in size exhibited inhibited biofilm formation by 95-98%. <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gurunathan et al.

The current results also revealed that the tested bacteria are highly sensitive to GL-AgNPs, BR-AgNPs, and SA-AgNPs, suggesting that the complex biofilm signaling mechanism could also be associated with cell survival. Recently, research has been conducted on conjugating the antibiotic, rifampicin, with chemically synthesized AgNPs for use in combatting biofilm formation by methicillin resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS8"><title>Synergistic Potential of Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activity</title><p>The individual studies of antibacterial and antibiofilm activities on plant extract and synthesized AgNPs from the respective plant extracts have shown they have the reducing capacity to form respective bioactive AgNPs. The main aim of the synergistic activity study was to understand the possible combinatorial potentiality of the AgNPs and plant extract to control the biofilm formation by the pathogenic organisms. As discussed, the plant constituents having a reducing capacity if silver metallic salts are involved and attached to the AgNPs to stabilize the particles. During the synergistic study, the different ratios of synthesized AgNPs and plant extracts were mixed and applied for the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities and measured in terms of the percentage (%) of inhibition against the microorganisms taken for the study. The synergistic results are quite relevant to the results of the individual results, but overall synergistic potentiality was not that accountable what the individual activities were shown by AgNPs. Hence the current results of the synergistic activity are not recommended for practical applications. The results of both AgNPs and respective plant extracts synergistically are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. The total concentration of the test samples were kept at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml and made the same with AgNPs and plant extracts with different ratios and tested against the test strains. Overall, the synthesized AgNPs alone have greater potential than the addition of respective plant extracts for controlling bacterial growth and biofilm formations. It can be assumed that when the concentration of the raw plant extract was increased, the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity was reduced due to the presence of some microbial growth promoting plant constituents in the extract. On the contrary, when the plant-synthesized AgNPs were applied, the results were highly significant for the purpose of the current study which revealed that the limited bioactive phytoconstituents with silver was highly active for the real world application in controlling the bacterial contaminations. In the antibacterial activity of GL-AgNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>), it showed a greater potential effect against <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>, while AgNPs showed reduced activities. When increasing concentrations of plant extract were added, the activity was lowered compared to the AgNPs. Therefore, the GL-AgNPs were shown to be highly promising for antibacterial activity rather than for synergistic applications. Likewise, in the case of SA-AgNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>) and BR-AgNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>), the individual AgNPs possessed greater potential compared to the synergetic activity. The antibacterial activity was reduced when the concentration of GL-AgNPs was low compared to GL-extracts against all <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>. At a concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of GL-AgNPs, &#x0003e;99% inhibition was observed against all the pathogens, but when the concentration was reduced to a 1:3 ratio, the inhibition was 41, 32.10, and 31.4% against <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Here it is clearly indicated that the GL-extract contains some nutritional factors for the microbes. In the case of SA-AgNPs, the 100% inhibition was found at a ratio of 3: 1 (AgNPs:SA-extracts) against all <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>, but the percentage of the inhibition was gradually reduced when the concentration of SA-AgNPs was decreased. Likewise, BR-AgNPs possess the potential to act against test strains with 99.8% inhibition against <italic>S. aureus</italic> by SA-AgNPs solely. A more interesting result was found against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> where 100% inhibition was observed at the concentration of 1: 1 (BR-AgNPs: BR-extracts). At a 3:1 ratio of BR-AgNPs and BR-extracts, 100% inhibition was found against <italic>E. coli</italic>. From the results, the AgNPs are shown to have a better effect than mixing with respective plant extracts. For all the microorganisms used in the study, the phyto-synthesized AgNPs alone had better results compared with adding respective plant extracts for an antibacterial purpose. As the study was targeted to promote the natural plant product-based synthesis and applications of nanoparticles, the synergetic combination was focused by using plant extracts rather than any commercial antibiotics used against the organisms. Many synergetic applications of the AgNPs, along with current commercial antibiotics with different concentrations, show more antibacterial activities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Rolim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Synergistic antibacterial activity of AgNPs synthesized using plant extracts of <bold>(A)</bold>

The reduced activity with the addition of plant extracts reveals the presence of microbial growth promoting factors in the natural plant extracts, as well as little antagonistic activity. Hence, the phyto-synthesized AgNPs are more promising than the synergistic application for controlling biofilm formations. Against all the three bacteria (<italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>), the respective AgNPs are more effective than the addition of respective plant extracts. The pure plant extracts were least active compared to the respective synthesized AgNPs. The lowest potential inhibition by the plant extracts reflects the presence of biofilm promoting entities. In the current study, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was least inhibited by the SA-extracts (14%) which implies the extracts were supporting the biofilm formations. In other extracts, like GL-extracts and BR-extracts, the inhibition rate was 29.06 and 35.23%, respectively. In the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, the inhibition was &#x0003e;95% in the ratio of 3(AgNPs: plant extracts) whereas &#x0003c;45% inhibition was observed in a 1:3 (AgNPs:plant extracts) ratio, which clearly showed least role of pure plant extracts in eradicating biofilm formation.

(2019)</xref> reported the antibiofilm activity of AgNPs against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> which supports our current results. However, the plant extract also has some potential of antimicrobial activity; these contain some microbial growth factors which help in growing, rather than inhibiting, the microbes. Hence, the AgNPs synthesized by the plant extracts were more promising than the sole plant extract and combination of plant extracts. The upcoming application of nanoparticles is highly promising as the uncontrolled spread of microbial contaminations is now a great threat worldwide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, plant extracts, derived from three different medicinal plant species, were used to synthesize AgNPs. The use of the plant extracts has an advantage over chemical or physical synthesis of AgNPs due to their ability to stabilize AgNPs, their own antibacterial properties, their high level of efficacy, and their low toxicity. Their use represents an eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of AgNPs. The extracts of three new plant resources (<italic>S. anacardium</italic>, <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and <italic>B. retusa</italic>) were found to be have excellent potential for the commercial production of AgNPs. The plant-derived AgNPs exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against different clinically important human pathogens. It is safer and more advantageous to biosynthesize metal nanoparticles using the natural reducing agents present in plants and microbes along with the conjugation of AgNPs to natural, antimicrobial molecules produced by microbes or plants. This line of research should be more greatly explored in the biomedical sciences. There is a high level of recently developed, drug-resistant microbes appearing in semi-tropical environments due to climate change, and this represents a significant health issue. Current antibiotics, and the antibiotic concept of fighting pathogens, is rapidly becoming insufficient for combatting new strains of existing pathogens and new disease-causing organisms. High throughput nanobiotechnology curated antimicrobials offer a new approach to treat microbial pathogens that are resistant to current treatment practices and for the treatment of biofilms. The present study demonstrates the potential of using plant-derived AgNPs to inhibit biofilm formation for therapeutic treatments that represent a new method of effectively treating a variety of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microbes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YM was involved in the collection of plant materials, synthesis of Ag-NPs, antimicrobial and antibiofilm assays, and the preparation of the manuscript.
