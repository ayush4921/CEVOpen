<p id="Par63">Kongo herbal medicine is rich in medicinal plant species. Some have high medicinal value, whereas others seem to have interesting therapeutic potential for certain diseases. It is essential to produce and conserve these important species. Conservation can be achieved ex situ through cultivation in fields, homegardens, or plantations, or in situ by maintaining and protecting their natural ecosystems. Potentially therapeutic herbal medicines should be subjected to phytochemical analysis in order to find more evidence for their true medicinal value. This should enable the Kongo people to take full social and economic advantage of their knowledge.</p>
