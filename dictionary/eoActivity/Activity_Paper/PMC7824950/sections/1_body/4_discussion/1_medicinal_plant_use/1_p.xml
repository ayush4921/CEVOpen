<p id="Par49">The Kongo people possess a rich and diversified ancestral medicinal knowledge, irrespective of their level of education, gender or marital status, or whether they live in cities or in the countryside. Of all 231 medicinal plant species inventoried in our study, 135 were also identified in ethnomedicinal studies from Nzuki et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 170 from Kibungu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and 70 from Nsimundele [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] in the same Kongo-Central Province. The predominance of taxa in the Fabaceae family corroborates observations of Amujoyegbe et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] (Nigeria), Ribeiro et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] (Brazil), and Ong et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (India and Bangladesh). The medicinal use of taxa in this family can probably be explained by the bioactive elements they contain, including tannins, alkaloids, coumarins, steroids, saponosides, flavonoids, and isoflavonoids [
