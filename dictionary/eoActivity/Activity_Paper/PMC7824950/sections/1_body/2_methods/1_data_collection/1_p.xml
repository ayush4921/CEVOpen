<p id="Par25">We distinguished three types of herbal therapists according to their attitude: (1) traditional health practitioners (who heal using plant, animal, or mineral products); (2) herbalists (who know plants and use them for medicinal purposes), and (3) curing healers (who mainly use religious or other rites to heal). We defined them according to the Congolese [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Central African [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] law on herbal medicine. These herbal therapists are reputed to have in-depth knowledge on local plant properties and enjoy a certain notoriety among the public. However, all herbal therapists have their own area of expertise, do not necessarily use the same plants to treat diseases, and are distinguished in the art of curing diseases [
