<p id="Par80">In recent time, herbs and extractions from TCM, as well as derivatives, are gaining acceptance as potentially promising complementary and alternative medicines for various diseases treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. The plant family Labiatae (Lamiaceae) is famous for its outstanding medicinal and aromatic herbs, which is a rich source of essential oils for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. In addition to patchouli, several other herbs such as 
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Elsholtzia ciliata</italic> (Thuab) Hyland., 
 <italic>Leonurus japonicas</italic> Houtt., and 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (L.) Britt. also possess kinds of bioactivities and can be used to treat diseases. Among the diverse herbs in the Labiatae family, 
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic> (
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>), a medicinal plant of Labiatae genus’s Agastache rugosa (Fisch. et Mey.) O. Ktze., has a lot of characteristics that are similar to patchouli. 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, commonly known as “Tuhuoxiang” or “Chuanhuoxiang” in China, is native to Sichuan Province, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province. As an edible plant, it is used as a herbal medicine to treat nausea, vomiting and dispel damp in TCM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> was reported to have prominent pharmacological activities, such as anti-gastritis effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>], anti-photoaging effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>], anti-melanogenesis effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>], anti-microbial effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>], anti-tumor effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], anti-oxidant effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>], and anti-atherogenic effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Although most of its pharmacological effects are similar to that of patchouli, its main chemical components are quite different. In 2013, a total of 88 chromatographic peaks were separated from the volatile oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, and 45 compounds were identified. Among these compounds, isopulegone, pulegone, as well as isomenthone account for a large proportion, while PA and pogostone are the major components of patchouli [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. In addition, the microscopic identification of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> and patchouli also showed some differences. For instance, two cells formed the head of glandular hairy in the leaves of patchouli, while only one formed the head of glandular hairy in the leaves of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. Moreover, the nonglandular hair was mainly constituted by one to three cells in patchouli, while one to four cells constituted the nonglandular hair in 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> [
