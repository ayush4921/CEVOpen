<p id="Par79">Given the widespread interest in and application of TCM throughout the world, reports of adverse reactions and adverse events have been increasing; this has generated significant concern regarding the toxicities associated with TCM and TCM-associated medicinal preparations. Previous experiments carried out in mice revealed that PA was associated with comparatively low toxicity; the lethal dose (

Recently, PO and its major components (PA and pogostone) exerted significant toxicity with respect to the development of zebrafish embryos; among the findings, these agents were associated with an increased incidence of notochord malformation as well as cardiac and yolk edema in zebrafish larvae, with the toxicity of pogostone &gt; PA &gt; PO. The 50% lethal concentrations (
