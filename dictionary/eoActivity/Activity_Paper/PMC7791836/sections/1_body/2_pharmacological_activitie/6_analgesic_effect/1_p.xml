<p id="Par71">Pain is initiated by the activation of various nociceptors via specific stimulus modalities. Pain is a common symptom of many diseases and has an outsized impact on normal life and physiological homeostasis. Patchouli directly inhibited the impact of acetic acid-induced writhing (pain) in mice; these results implied that patchouli exhibits an analgesic effect in vivo [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that PA could simultaneously upregulate MOR expression in the mouse brain and decrease intracellular calcium levels; this was not observed in response to the administration of aspirin. As such, the role of patchouli with respect to its capacity to modulate the activation of both COX-2 and MOR may provide a significant basis for further studies of PA as a new form of analgesic.
