<p id="Par53">To provide novel insights into the pharmacological mechanisms associated with patchouli, we conducted a search of the current literature using keywords including 
 <italic>Pogostemon cablin</italic> Benth., patchouli, patchouli alcohol, patchouli oil, pogostone, patchoulene epoxide, beta-patchoulene, and bioactive compounds. We summarized the recent findings (2015â€“2020) focused on the phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action of patchouli from studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database. Initial search resulted in 171 studies but upon sorting based on the three themes (phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action), our search yielded 62 studies that are featured in this review. Additional publications from years prior to 2015 were also included as they provide both insights and critical explanations .
