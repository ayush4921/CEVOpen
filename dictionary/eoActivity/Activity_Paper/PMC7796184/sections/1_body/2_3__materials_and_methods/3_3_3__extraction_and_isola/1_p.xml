<p>The powdered air-dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. jaubertii</italic> (1.5 kg) were exhaustively extracted with MeOH (7 L Ã— 3) to yield 85 g of a solid extract, which was then suspended in water (500 mL) and successively partitioned with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol to give 30 g, 12 g, and 8 g, respectively. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction was subjected to VLC on silica gel, eluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane containing 10% increments of ethyl acetate to give five fractions of A (1.32 g), B (3.13 g), C (1.88 gm), D (5.6), and E (6.2 g). Subfraction A was subjected to si gel CC, eluted with 100% 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane to give four subfractions of A-1 (100 mg), A-2 (63 mg), A-3 (460 mg), and A-4 (455 mg). Sephadex LH-20 column eluted with MeOH was used to give compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (10mg) from subfraction A-3. Subfraction B was subjected to si gel CC (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane:ethyl acetate 100:0-95:5 was used as eluent) to give four subfractions of B-1 (47 mg), B-2 (130 mg), B-3 (90 mg), and B-4 (450 mg). Sephadex LH-20 column eluted with MeOH followed by solid-phase extraction (RP-C
 <sub>18</sub>) eluted with 95% MeOH in water to 100% MeOH were used to give compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (20 mg) from subfraction B-1. Similarly, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (10 mg) was obtained from subfraction B-3 by using a column of sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. Subfraction B-4 was subjected to sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH followed by Diol CC eluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane: ethyacetate 95:5 to give compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (5 mg). Subfraction C was subjected to si gel CC, eluted with chloroform to give two subfractions of C-1 (18 mg) and C-2 (754 mg). The subfraction C-1 was subjected to sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH to give compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> (5 mg) and 
 <bold>6</bold> (2 mg).
