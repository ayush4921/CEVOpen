<p>The antiproliferative activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract was conducted against three human tumor cell lines: hepatocarcinoma (HepG-2), breast carcinoma (MCF7), and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cell lines using MTT assay according to the reported method [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. All cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) and were cultured on RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL gentamycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and were sub cultured two to three times a week. Cell viability percentage was calculated by the equation: 
 <disp-formula>Cell viability % = Ac/At × 100
  <label>(5)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Ac = Absorbance obtained from of control cells, At = Absorbance obtained from treated cells.
