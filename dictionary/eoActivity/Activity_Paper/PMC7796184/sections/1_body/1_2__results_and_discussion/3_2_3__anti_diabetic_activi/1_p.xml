<p>The reported antidiabetic activity of the triterpenes [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] encouraged us to investigate the antidiabetic potential of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic>. The anti-diabetic activities of the total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> aerial parts were in vitro evaluated through determination of their inhibitory effect on alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase enzymes. The result showed that α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes were inhibited by both extracts in a dose-dependent manner. However, the total alcoholic extract was more active than the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 76.8 to 410.3 µg/mL against α-glucosidase and 192.7 to 498.3 µg/mL against α-amylase, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, both extracts demonstrate lower antidiabetic activity compared to the standard antidiabetic agent, acarbose, which showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 34.71 and 30.57 μg/mL against α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, respectively (
