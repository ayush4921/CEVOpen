<p>Compound (

 <sup>+</sup>. An ester carbonyl (1733 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (1692 and 1645 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) absorptions were observed in its IR spectrum. It showed an absorption band at 235 nm in the UV spectrum indicated the presence of conjugation in the molecule. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral data of 
 <bold>3</bold> were almost identical to that of 
 <bold>2</bold>, suggested the presence of a monounsaturated pentacyclic 3β-acetoxytriterpene of the pseudotaraxasterane skeleton with a methyl group oxidized to aldehyde in 
 <bold>3</bold> versus 
 <bold>2</bold>. The presence of an aldehyde group in the molecule was established from the observed downfield proton signal at δ 9.36 (s, H-30) in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum and the downfield carbon signal at δ 194.11 (C-30) in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>3</bold>. Additionally, the downfield shifted proton at δ 6.71 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 6.8, 2.5 Hz, H-21) and carbon at δ 149.28 (C-21) compared to those of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> confirmed the presence of the aldehyde group at C-20 position. From the above findings, the structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was assigned to be 3β-acetoxytaraxaster-20-en-30-aldehyde [
