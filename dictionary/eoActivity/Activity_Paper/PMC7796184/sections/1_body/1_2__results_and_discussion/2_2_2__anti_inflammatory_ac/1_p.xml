 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> was used traditionally as a remedy for inflammation [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and several plants of genus 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> demonstrated potential anti-inflammatory effect [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, the nature of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane constituents, i.e., triterpenes, which are biologically potential compounds known for their anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic activities [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] were incentive point to conduct these experiments. However, the current study investigates the anti-inflammatory effect of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract of the 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> for the first time. The anti-inflammatory activity of the total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> aerial parts was investigated using HRBC membrane stabilization and histamine release inhibition methods and the results were comparable to diclofenac and indomethacin, respectively. The results obtained (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) revealed that both extracts possesses a dose dependent anti-inflammatory activity. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract had higher anti-inflammatory potential than the alcoholic extract, which might be attributed to the presence of triterpenes in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract. The anti-inflammatory potential by membrane stabilization hypotonic solution-induced hemolysis was found to be higher than that of histamine release inhibition. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract was significantly suppressed histamine release with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 72.9 µg/mL, and showed membrane stabilization activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 60.8 µg/mL. Both membrane stabilization activity and histamine release inhibition contribute to the in-vitro anti-inflammatory activity of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract used in our study.
