<p>The cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> aerial parts was evaluated against three cancer cell lines (HepG-2, MCF7, and PC-3) using cell viability assay. The result (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00203-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed variable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against the three tested cancer cells ranging from 51.8 to 90.8 µg/mL. The hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) cell line was more sensitive (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 51.8 ±3.71 µg/mL) to the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract followed by the prostate carcinoma (PC-3, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 62.2 ± 5.08 µg/mL) cell line and then the breast carcinoma (MCF-7, 90.8 ±5.12 µg/mL), which was the most less sensitive cell line to the extract (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00203-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract showed lesser anti-proliferative activity compared to the reported data [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] of the total alcoholic extract of the same plant sample, which showed lower cytotoxic IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (24.1 µg/mL, 20.0 µg/mL, and 19.1 µg/mL) against the HepG-2, MCF-7, PC-3 cell lines, respectively.
