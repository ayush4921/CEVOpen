<p>Six compounds, pseudo-taraxaterol, pseudo-taraxasterol acetate, 3β-acetoxytaraxaster-20-en-30-aldehyde, calenduladiol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-palmitate, stigmasterol, and α-tocospiro B were isolated using different chromatographic techniques including VLC, silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 columns from 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii n</italic>-hexane extract. The compounds were characterized by the IR, NMR, and MS spectroscopy and by the comparison with literatures. The rare α-tocospiro B was isolated for the first time from family Asteraceae and genus 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic>, however, all other compounds were recorded for the first time from the plant. The in vitro biological investigation of the plant revealed the significant higher activity of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract as an anti-inflammatory agent compared to the total alcoholic extract which showed better antidiabetic and cytotoxic activities. The anti-inflammatory effect of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract could be attributed to the extract constituents including triterpenes, which have been prevalently known for this effect. Further animal-based in vivo anti-inflammatory testing of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract is an essential future plan to confirm the activity.
