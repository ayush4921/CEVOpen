  <p>ROS accumulation was measured by DCFH-DA fluorescent dye. Cells were loaded with 20 
   <italic>µ</italic>M DCFH-DA for 20 min and then washed with PBS and re-incubated with 1 mM H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> and 500 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml of the different wampee extracts. Fluorescence was then measured at regular intervals for 6 h Three independent experiments were performed to obtain the mean fluorescence values and standard deviations.
