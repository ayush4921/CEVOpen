  <p>The cytoprotective effect of the different wampee extracts against H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress: cells were co-treated with wampee extracts (0.5 and 5 mg/ml) and 0.65 mM H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> for 18 h and then the effects of the wampee extracts on H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity (B) and fluorescence images of F-actin images with 200x magnification (A) were operated. 
   <sup>

   </sup> indicates a statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) difference between the H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-treated cells and wampee extract-co-treated cells by Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. The cytotoxicity of HGF cells treated with the same concentration of wampee extracts was grouped alphabetically by one-way ANOVA analysis (
