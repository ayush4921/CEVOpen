  <italic>Clausena lansium</italic> (Lour.) Skeels (wampee) is an outstanding natural plant with medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to compare the cytoprotective effects of four parts of wampee under oxidative stress. The aqueous extracts of leaf, peel, pulp, and seed were tested for the proliferation effects on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells and the protective effects in the hydrogen peroxide-induced HGF model. Furthermore, the total glutathione assay and identification of rutin by high-performance liquid chromatography were carried out to attempt to determine whether the cytoprotective effects were related to the total glutathione (GSH) stability and rutin content. The results showed that all of the extracts had no cytotoxicity to HGF at tested concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml during 24 h, and the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts increased proliferation of HGF at relatively high concentrations. All the extracts except for the seed extract significantly decreased the production of reactive oxygen species, and the peel extracts exhibited the most effective antioxidant effect. The leaf extract had the highest anticytotoxicity and GSH stabilization effect in the HGF challenged with hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the relative content of rutin in peel and leaf extracts was higher than that in pulp and seed. The results of GSH assay and rutin identification suggest that different cellular protective effects among the four parts of wampee are partially related to the GSH stabilization and rutin content. These findings provide a scientific basis for the antioxidant effect-related biological activities of wampee extracts.
