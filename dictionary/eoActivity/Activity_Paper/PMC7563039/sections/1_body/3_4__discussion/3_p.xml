<p>Because the four kinds of wampee extracts had a different cell protective ability against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, we thought that the antioxidant effect could be the reason for the difference; thus, ROS in treated cells was further examined for the four extracts. Among the ROS, the most lethal radical is a hydroxyl radical, which can be produced with transition metal ions such as iron and copper via the Fenton reaction [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. A fluorometric assay with (DCFH-DA) was used to detect hydroxyl radicals in the present study. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(d)</xref>, the peel, pulp, and leaf extracts except for the seed extract decreased the hydroxyl radical production significantly when exposed to 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Especially the peel extract almost quenched the DFC fluorescence early on in the treatment time, while the leaf extract did not exert the highest antioxidant ability to deplete hydroxyl radicals. These results indicate that the hydroxyl radical has a limited role in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, partially due to the limitation of the cytosolic labile ions [
