<p>Zeng et al. demonstrated that flavonoids in the wampee fruit organic extract resulted in the free radical-scavenging and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and other previous study also showed that the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals may be due to the presence of hydrogen-donating flavonoids in extracts [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As a flavonoid belonging to the flavonols, rutin is present plentifully in wampee fruits [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and is a hydrogen-donating antioxidant, which can scavenge free radicals [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, we further explored the rutin component of the four extracts. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, based on the peak area, the rutin in the peel extract represented the highest amount, which confirmed the correlation between the rutin and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, the diversity of phytochemicals in leaf extracts is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Based on our current results, the rutin might be a potential candidate, which plays some roles in the effect of wampee on the cell viability and resistance to H
