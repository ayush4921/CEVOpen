<p>Because previous studies have indicated that intracellular GSH has a central role in removing cellular H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in biological systems [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we investigated whether the different cell protective abilities of wampee extracts against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity positively correlated to the extent of maintaining intracellular glutathione. The differences in the degree of GSH depletion are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. All the extracts antagonized the downregulation of GSH compared to that in the only H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated group, which may resist an increase in the amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the mitochondria and by extension, protect the cells from oxidative stress. Specifically, the leaf extract stabilized the intracellular GSH to the normal level even in the presence of exogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which consistent with that the leaf extract has the greatest ability among the four extracts to help HGF survive against the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity.
