<p>Wound repair is a series of events involving multiple pathophysiological reactions, including inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the antioxidant activity has an important role in the whole healing process. At the beginning of the inflammation stage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released into the surrounding environment by the stimulated neutrophils to protect the body against infection; however, when the ROS are present in an excess amount, for example, in the cases of aging, a stressful environment [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], overproduced ROS may exhaust the endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), further speeding up the cellular aging process [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which consequently results in impairing wound healing and tissue regeneration [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Antioxidant treatment can decrease the ROS accumulation to allow ROS to play a regulatory role in wound healing process effectively. Rutin, which is known as an antioxidant substance of plant origin, has been reported to be as a kind of supplement to promote wound healing [
