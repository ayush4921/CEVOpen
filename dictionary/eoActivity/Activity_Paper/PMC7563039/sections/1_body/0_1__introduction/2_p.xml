<p>During the proliferative stage, fibroblast cells are the main players with the function to secrete growth factors and produce collagen, which is necessary for wound repair. Moreover, ascorbic acid, one of the representative antioxidants, increases collagen synthesis even in elderly fibroblasts [

At the last remodeling stage, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in this phase. Topical antioxidant mixture was reported to downregulate MMP-9 to protect basement membranes [

Although the wound healing process of the oral mucosa is similar to that of skin, oral tissue is often threatened by bacterial infections and chewing stimulation due to the particular characteristics of oral environment. In addition, in the case of gingival graft surgery with significant tissue loss in the donor's palate, it is important to find some ingredients that enhance wound healing in the oral cavity. Based on the correlation between antioxidants and wound healing mentioned above, antioxidants seem to be a useful strategy for wound healing by removing the inflammatory cell-induced ROS [
