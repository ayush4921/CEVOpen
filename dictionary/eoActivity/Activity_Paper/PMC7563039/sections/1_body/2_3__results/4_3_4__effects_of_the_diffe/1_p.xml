<p>Glutathione, which can directly scavenge ROS [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], plays an important role in the cytosolic redox system. Thus, we next determined the effects of four kinds of wampee extracts on the intracellular GSH. The amount of total glutathione in HGF cells was ordered as follows: leaf extract &gt; peel extract &gt; pulp extract &gt; seed extract-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Especially, there was no significant difference between the leaf extract-treated group and normal control group. In addition, compared with the only H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated group, the decrease of glutathione was more mitigated in the other wampee extracts-treated groups. These results imply that the differences in the degree of GSH depletion was related to the protective effects of four extracts on the HGF cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress, especially for leaf extracts.
