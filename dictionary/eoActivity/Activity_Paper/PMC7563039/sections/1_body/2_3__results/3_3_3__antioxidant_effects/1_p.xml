<p>To investigate the antioxidant effects of the different wampee extracts, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced hydroxyl radicals were detected in wampee extract-treated cells by using DCFH, which can be oxidized to a highly fluorescent DCF by hydroxyl radicals [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to HGF's relative strong tolerance to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> shown in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a relative high concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mM) was used in the present study. The HGF cells were treated with the different wampee extracts and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in combination, and the peel extract prevented the increase in DCF fluorescence intensity significantly at 2 h, while the pulp and leaf extracts suppressed the DCF fluorescence intensity at 3 h. And there was no statistical significance in the attenuation of DCF fluorescence intensity in the HGF cells by seed extract (
