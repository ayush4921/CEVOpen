<p>The four different wampee extracts effectively protected the HGF cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, compared with the pulp and peel extract groups, the cytoprotective effect was significantly demonstrated in the seed and leaf extract groups at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, for which about 59% and 98% of the cells were recovered, respectively. At 5 mg/mL, the seed and peel extract treated groups were fully recovered, and about 71% and 95% of the cells were recovered in the pulp and leaf extract group, respectively.
