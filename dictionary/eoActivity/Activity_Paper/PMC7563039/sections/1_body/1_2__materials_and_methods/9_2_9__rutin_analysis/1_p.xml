<p>The identification of rutin in different wampee parts was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC analysis was carried out on an Agilent Technologies 1260 instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Luna C18 column (ø 250 mm × 4.6 mm) and UV detection. Gradient programs were used with the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (water) and solvent B (acetonitrile) as follows: 5% (initial), 5%–30% (30 min), 30%–80% (20 min), and 100% (5 min). At a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, typically 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L portions were injected. The detected wavelength was 254 nm, and the column temperature was maintained at 25°C.
