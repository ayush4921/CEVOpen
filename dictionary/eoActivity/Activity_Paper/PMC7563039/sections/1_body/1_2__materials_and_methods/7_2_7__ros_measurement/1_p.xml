<p>The DCFH-DA is a cell‐permeable dye that becomes fluorescent upon reacting with hydroxyl ROS. ROS was measured as described in our previous paper [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, cells (0.8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) grown on 96-well plates were incubated in culture medium containing 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>M DCFH-DA at 37°C for 20 min, washed once with PBS, and then exposed to 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL wampee extract. The fluorescence of the cells was then measured using a microplate fluorometer (FLUOstar Optima microplate fluorometer, BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) at intervals over the course of 6 h.
