<p>HGF cells were seeded on chamber slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/chamber. Cells were treated with different wampee extracts in combination with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.65 mM) for 18 h before staining. Fluorescence staining for F-actin was carried out using ActinGreen 488 ReadyProbes reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in fixative solution (4% formaldehyde in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with ActinGreen 488 ReadyProbes reagent for 30 minutes. Cells were photographed with a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
