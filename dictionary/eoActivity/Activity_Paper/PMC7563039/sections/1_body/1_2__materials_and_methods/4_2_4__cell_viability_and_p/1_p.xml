<p>The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a seeding density of 0.8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well until confluent and then reincubated in culture media containing the different parts of the wampee extracts at various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). After 24 h, cell viability was assessed with 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-8, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). The treated cells were incubated in 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of WST-8 solution for 1 h, and then, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a plate reader (Sunrise, TECAN, Salzburg, Austria). To examine proliferation, HGF cells were treated with the different extracts of the wampee parts for 48 and 72 h, and the amount of cells was assessed with WST-8.
