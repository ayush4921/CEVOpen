 <p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are essential enzymes that ligate amino acids to tRNAs and translate the genetic code during protein synthesis. Their function in pathogen-derived infectious diseases has been well established, which has led to the development of small molecule therapeutics. The applicability of ARS inhibitors for other human diseases, such as fibrosis, has recently been explored in the clinical setting. There are active studies to find small molecule therapeutics for cancers. Studies on central nervous system (CNS) disorders are burgeoning as well. In this regard, we present a concise analysis of the recent development of ARS inhibitors based on small molecules from the discovery research stage to clinical studies as well as a recent patent analysis from the medicinal chemistry point of view.</p>
