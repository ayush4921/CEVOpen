<p>Cladosporin isolated from 
 <italic>Cladosporium cladosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> was found to have potent antimalarial activity against both liver- and blood-stage 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> by targeting the parasite cytosolic lysyl-tRNA synthetase (
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS) and terminating protein biosynthesis [

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the favorable selectivity and potency shown by cladosporin against 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS over human LysRS spurred medicinal chemistry efforts to further develop it to overcome its metabolic limitations as an oral drug. In this regard, Rusch et al. analyzed cladosporin by incubating it with mouse liver microsomes in vitro and revealed that three major metabolically weak points might cause the metabolic liabilities of cladosporin (

 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The hydroxyl group, tetrahydropyran, and C-4 of isochromenone were potentially the three major metabolically weak points. Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure of cladosporin and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> LysRS (
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS) suggested an H-bond with Glu332 and the π/cation ‘cage’ from adjacent aromatic and charged residues, and the interaction between the lactone ring and Arg559 through water as the major interactions [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on these basic findings, medicinal chemistry efforts were focused on the three metabolically weak points of cladosporin to generate the three major derivatives 
 <bold>A</bold> (
 <bold>12</bold>), 
 <bold>B</bold> (
 <bold>13</bold>), and 
 <bold>C</bold> (
 <bold>14</bold>) as representative examples. Upon screening these libraries using the Transcreener AMP assay system to assess aminoacylation by LysRS [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the unsaturation of the isocoumarin core and transformation of the metabolically unstable tetrahydropyran ring to the cyclohexyl ring yielded a selective LysRS inhibitor with improved metabolic stability at the level of hepatic extraction. In line with a previous report by Rusch et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] focusing on metabolic weak points of cladosporin, Zhou et al. confirmed that the methyl tetrahydropyran moiety of cladosporin could be replaced by a more stable methylcyclohexane, while maintaining potency in the ATP hydrolysis assay (compounds 
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The methyl group in the cyclohexane ring was important for the hydrophobic interaction with Ser344, resulting in increased potency of 4-fold compared to that of compound 
 <bold>15</bold>. The replacement with a lactam group or a conjugated Δ
 <sup>3,4</sup> double bond within the isocoumarin ring was tolerated, but the two phenolic hydroxyl groups were critical for binding to LysRS (
