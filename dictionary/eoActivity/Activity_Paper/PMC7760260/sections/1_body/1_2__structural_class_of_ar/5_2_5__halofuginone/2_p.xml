<p>In a related study, it was presumed that the proline-rich nature of profibrotic proteins such as collagens may be attributed to glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (GluProRS)-mediated translational regulation during cardiac fibrosis. Several studies with indirect evidence support the regulatory role of GluProRS as a target gene for cardiac fibrosis. For example, hypoactive mutations in the ProRS domain of GluProRS lead to hypomyelinating leukodystrophy without causing any known cardiac dysfunction in patients, implying that reduced ProRS enzymatic activity may not adversely affect normal heart function while reducing proline-rich protein synthesis [
