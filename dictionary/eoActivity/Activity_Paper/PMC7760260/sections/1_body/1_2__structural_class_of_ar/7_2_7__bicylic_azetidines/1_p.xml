<p>Lastly, Kato et al. reported bicyclic azetidines such as 
 <bold>31</bold> and 
 <bold>32</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f012">Figure 12</xref>) as potent inhibitors of 
 <italic>Pf</italic> phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9 and 5 nM, respectively, against a multi-drug resistant strain, 
 <italic>Pf</italic> Dd2) for the treatment of malaria [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Lead optimization campaign allowed the improvement of in vitro potencies of 
 <bold>31</bold> against 
 <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.34/2.86 μM for small form [SF, hypnozoite-like]/large form [LF, schizont], respectively), 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> liver-stage (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.31 μM), and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission-stage, gametocyte IV–V (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 663 nM) to EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.933/1.04 μM (for SF/LF), 0.34 μM, and 0.16 μM in 
 <bold>32</bold>, respectively. Issues in 
 <bold>31</bold> such as poor solubility (&lt;1 μM in PBS), high clearance in human and mouse liver microsomes (Cl
 <sub>int</sub> = 142 and 248 μL/min/mg, respectively), and a high volume of distribution in vivo (12 L/kg) were optimized by replacing the hydroxymethyl of 
 <bold>31</bold> to 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylaminomethyl group in 
 <bold>32</bold> to give improved solubility (15 μM in PBS), decreased clearance in human and mouse liver microsomes (Cl
 <sub>int</sub> = 31 and 21 μL/min/mg, respectively), and a better volume of distribution in vivo (24 L/kg), resulting in a longer half-life (32 h) which can be suitable for single-dose oral treatment. In vivo efficacy studies of 
 <bold>32</bold> in multiple stages of malaria models including 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> CD-1 and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> huRBC NSG mouse models showed complete elimination of blood- and liver-stage parasites by a single dose during the study period. This study has served as an example of developing a cure for malaria as well as the potential to give prophylaxis and prevent disease transmission. Additionally, Vinayak et al. reported that bicyclic azetidine 
 <bold>32</bold> is a potent inhibitor of 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> PheRS (
 <italic>Cp</italic> PheRS) for diarrheal disease in young children [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The in vivo efficacy of 
 <bold>32</bold> for cryptosporidiosis was shown in immunosuppressed mouse models. Overall, it is thought that bicyclic azetidines such as 
 <bold>32</bold> possess a unique core skeleton and warrant further examination to exploit their chemical space for applications not only in infectious diseases, but also for other diseases.
