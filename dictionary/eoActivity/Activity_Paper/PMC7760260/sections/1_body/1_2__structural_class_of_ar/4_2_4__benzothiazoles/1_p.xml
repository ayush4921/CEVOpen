<p>Unlike other LysRS inhibitors that target the active site of pathogen-derived LysRS, Kim et al. reported a new class of small molecule inhibitors, including YH16899, that bind to human LysRS without affecting the catalytic activity of LysRS [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Physiologically, it is known that LysRS binds to the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), a target for antimetastatic therapeutics [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], in the plasma membrane and enhances cell migration that causes cancer metastasis. Thus, it is thought that directly inhibiting the interaction between LysRS and 67LR by a small molecule could suppress cancer metastasis and derive a new class of antimetastatic cancer therapy. In this regard, 
 <bold>25</bold> showed specific inhibition of the binding between the LysRS and 67LR pair based on in vitro pull-down and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays and decreased the amount of membranous 67LR using LysRS-overexpressing H226 squamous lung carcinoma cells (

 <bold>25</bold> was demonstrated using three different in vivo mouse models, including (i) a mouse breast cancer model (4T1 cells, 100 mpk [mg per kilogram] and 300 mpk, po, ~60% inhibition of tumor metastasis), (ii) a Tg (MMTV-PyVT) model (100 mpk, po, ~70% reduction of pulmonary nodule formation), and (iii) a cancer cell colonization model (A549 cells expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP), ~50% reduction of tumor metastasis in the brain and bone tumors over 7 weeks). Overall, Kim et al. showed that the proteinâ€“protein interaction of LysRS-67LR is a promising approach for the development of new therapeutics for human diseases.
