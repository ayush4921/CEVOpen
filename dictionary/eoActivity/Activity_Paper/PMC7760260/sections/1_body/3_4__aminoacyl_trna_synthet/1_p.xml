<p>Since FDA approval of the natural product mupirocin (an IleRS inhibitor) to treat bacterial infections, prokaryotic ARS has attracted much attention as one of the most promising targets for developing antimicrobial therapeutics in recent years. Nevertheless, AN2690 (a synthetic small molecule, tavaborole) is the only FDA-approved drug for nail onychomycosis to inhibit fungal LeuRS. In this section, we discuss small molecule therapeutics that are undergoing clinical trials as prokaryotic or eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) inhibitors. A recent review published in 
 <italic>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</italic> (2019) by the Kim group at the Medical Bioconvergence Research Center described the ARS inhibitors that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [

The Cortellis search (2020-10-08) with the keywords “tRNA synthetase inhibitor” and status of “phase 1 clinical”, “phase 2 clinical”, “phase 3 clinical”, and “clinical” revealed that five small molecule therapeutics, including DWN12088, CRS3123, GSK3036656, mupirocin bioadhesive gel, and DWP17011, are being actively evaluated in clinical studies (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01625-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Since mupirocin has already been marketed for bacterial skin infection and information on DWP17011 is fairly limited, clinical trials of the remaining three compounds will be discussed in this section.
