<p>In May 2012, the first-time-in-human (FTIH), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase I clinical study (NCT01551004) was initiated in the US to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of 
 <bold>92</bold> after a single oral dose in healthy adults. Five cohorts of eight subjects received 
 <bold>92</bold> or placebo each in a 3:1 ratio [
 <xref rid="B69-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]; 
 <bold>92</bold> was supplied in 100 and 200 mg capsules, and cohorts A through E received a single oral dose of 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg, respectively. The clinical data reported by Crestone Inc. in 2017 showed that no serious adverse events or immediate allergic reactions were observed during the study [
 <xref rid="B70-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the 
 <bold>92</bold>-treated groups, hemoglobin reduction, headache, and abnormal urine analysis were the most frequent adverse events, which were mild to moderate and dose-independent. The increase in the absorption rate of 
 <bold>92</bold> was less than dose proportional, and the relative bioavailability of the 1200 mg dose group was lower than that of the 800 mg dose group. The phase I study showed the safety and tolerability of 
 <bold>92</bold> within the dose ranges and led to further investigation of CRS3123 for the treatment of CDI.
