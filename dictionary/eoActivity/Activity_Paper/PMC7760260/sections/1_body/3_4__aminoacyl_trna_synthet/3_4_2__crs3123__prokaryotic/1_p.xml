<p>Crestone, under license from Cardiovascular Systems, developed the antibiotic CRS3123 (
 <bold>92</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f021">Figure 21</xref>) (formerly REP3123), a prokaryotic methionyl-tRNA synthetase (pMetRS) inhibitor, for the oral treatment of 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) and 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection (HPI) [
 <xref rid="B64-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Notably, 
 <bold>92</bold> prevents protein synthesis by inhibiting 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>. difficile</italic> MetRS with high specificity (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> = 0.020 nM) and high selectivity (&gt;1000-fold over human MetRS). The in vitro efficacy of 
 <bold>92</bold> was estimated against numerous clinical isolates of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>. difficile</italic> and epidemic strains BI/NAP1/027 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 108), showing MIC values of 0.25â€“1 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. While 
 <bold>92</bold> did not exhibit activity against most Gram-negative bacteria, it had high potency (MIC
 <sub>90</sub> &lt; 1 mg/L) against clinically important Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>, which are resistant to current antimicrobial agents. In a clindamycin-induced hamster model of CDI, 
 <bold>92</bold> demonstrated superior efficacy to vancomycin, reducing the production of toxins and spores from 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> [

 <xref rid="B67-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Consequently, 
 <bold>92</bold> was suggested as a promising candidate for the treatment of CDI with special features, including (i) a novel mode of action with maintaining activity against pre-existing resistances; (ii) high selectivity and potency against a narrow spectrum of 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic>, while not affecting normal intestinal microbiota; and (3) the inhibition of toxin production and spore formation from 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic>, alleviating the severity and spread of the disease [
