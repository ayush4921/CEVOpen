<p>As mentioned before, much research on eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (
 <italic>e</italic>ARSs) has recently been conducted to determine the different roles of human ARSs other than being the “housekeeping” enzyme for protein synthesis in various human diseases [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Human ARSs have also become major targets in the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancers, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and fibrosis. In this section, we discuss patents related to therapeutic development targeting both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ARSs. Since Gadakh et al. at the Rega Institute for Medical Research reported a patent review on ARS inhibitors as antimicrobial agents in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we specifically analyzed patents from 2013 to the present day. From the SciFinder search, eight relevant patents were identified, and we present them in the alphabetical order of ARS targets.
