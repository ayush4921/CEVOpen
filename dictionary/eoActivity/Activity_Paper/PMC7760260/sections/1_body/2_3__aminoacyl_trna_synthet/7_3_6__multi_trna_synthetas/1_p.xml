<p>The Qi group at the University of Florida prepared 23 sulfamide adenosine derivatives as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors for the treatment of proliferative diseases such as cancers, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f020">Figure 20</xref>, a protected adenosyl amine was extended as the protected adenosyl sulfamide, of which the terminal amine was coupled with the different kinds of amino acids to complete the synthesis of the aminoacyl sulfamide adenosine compounds (aa-SA). The cell viability assay of the aa-SAs was performed in prostate cancer cell lines, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.0015–27 μM for LNCaP and 0.0011–16 μM for PC3 were observed.
