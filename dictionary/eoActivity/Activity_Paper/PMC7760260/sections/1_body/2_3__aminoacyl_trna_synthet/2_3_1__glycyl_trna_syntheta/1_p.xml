<p>Professors Schimmel and Yang at the Scripps Research Institute disclosed four different glycylsulfamoyladenosine derivatives (GlySAs,

 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The covalent attachment of NEDD8 (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene 8) to the core cullin protein of cullin-RING ligase E3s (CRLs, e.g., Ubc12), called neddylation, is a crucial process for the ubiquitination of multiple protein substrates mediated by GlyRS. GlyRS is highly expressed in most malignant cancers, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. Selective binding of GlySAs to the catalytic domain of human GlyRS inhibited the attachment of NEDD8, consequently reducing the level of neddylation by more than 50% in various cancer cells. The patent provided the systematic mode of action (MOA) evaluation of GlyRS in the neddylation pathway and the confirmation of GlyRS inhibition with the crystal structure of GlySA (
 <bold>33</bold>) binding to human GlyRS (PDB code: 2ZT8). GlySAs were screened with the NCI 60 cell panel assay at a single dose of 5–10 M, and GlySA (
 <bold>33</bold>) showed a range of growth inhibition values (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.372–3.715 μM) in 58 cancer cell lines. With the lung metastasis model induced by MDA-MB-231 cells, 
 <bold>33</bold> was administered via intravenous injection twice a week at a dose of 4 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). After 10 days of injection of GlyRS inhibitors, 
 <bold>33</bold> reduced lung metastases in the mouse model with 69% efficacy, which was greater than that (4.4 mg/kg, 40% efficacy) of MLN4924. MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), is under development for various types of tumors in a clinical setting [
