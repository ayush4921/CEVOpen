<p>Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. unveiled heterocyclic compounds to inhibit abnormal human prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) activity for the treatment of cancers, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A total of 230 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds with various substitutions were synthesized and categorized into three groups in terms of their biological activities to inhibit the human ProRS enzyme, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f019">Figure 19</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 26 compounds (class A) were 100 nM or less, the values of 89 compounds (class B) ranged from 100 to 500 nM, and the values of 115 compounds (class C) were 500 nM or higher. Compounds in class A shared disubstituted imidazolyl aromatic bicyclic rings, yielding potent human ProRS inhibition.
