<p>The Martin group at the University of Texas at Austin reported 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) inhibitors for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis and sleeping sickness [

 <xref rid="B57-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Two major classes of compounds incorporating tetracyclic tetrahydro-beta-carboline and 4-amino-2-piperidone were prepared to selectively inhibit the MetRS of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The inhibitory activities of three tetracyclic carboline compounds (
 <bold>47</bold>â€“
 <bold>49</bold>) were tested for the 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> MetRS aminoacylation assay, showing submicromolar IC

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f017">Figure 17</xref>. One of the tetracyclic compounds exhibited no off-target activity when screened against a panel of 45 CNS proteins.
