<p>Jirgensons et al. at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis developed 
 <italic>N</italic>-aminoacyl-arylsulfonamide derivatives as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) inhibitors for the treatment of bacterial infections [

 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Arylsulfonyl chlorides were converted to the corresponding arylsulfonamides, in which the terminal amine was coupled with amino acids to provide 52 compounds of 
 <italic>N</italic>-aminoacyl-arylsulfonamides, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>. All compounds were tested for in vitro enzyme inhibition assays against leucyl-, valyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (LeuRS, ValRS, and IleRS, respectively) from 
 <italic>E coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 0.0034 to &gt;50 μM for 
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> LeuRS and from 0.26 to &gt;50 μM for 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>aureus</italic> LeuRS. However, none of the compounds presented any inhibitory activities at concentrations of 50 μM or below against IleRS and ValRS bacterial enzymes from either 
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> or 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>aureus</italic>. Therefore, the scope of substituents on the phenyl ring was investigated further. It was found that the compounds bearing a meta-substituted phenyl ring as well as a leucine moiety presented a significant increase in the inhibition of LeuRS from 
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>aureus</italic> with submicromolar activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f015">Figure 15</xref>) (e.g., IC

 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> LeuRS and 0.33 μM for
