 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> remains an unpopular investment when compared to exotic fruits. 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> predominantly exists in the wild, which may be linked to the inadequate knowledge that currently exists on their propagation. These trees usually remain in the vegetative propagation state for a long duration before flowering and fruiting. The longevity in the maturation of the
