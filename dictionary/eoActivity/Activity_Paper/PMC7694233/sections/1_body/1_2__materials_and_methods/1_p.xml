 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01486" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used in the selection of articles in this review. We explored various online databases, dissertations/thesis, and reports using the library of the North-West University. A thorough search was conducted primarily by using search engines such as Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and PubMeb, some other quick checks were conducted on Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct using the following terms and phrases: “
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic>”, “Transvaal red milkwood”, “nutritional value composition of Transvaal red milkwood”, “ethnomedicinal importance of the 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic>”, “uses of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic>” and “description of Transvaal red milkwood”. For the current review, the search was limited to southern Africa with a literature search period (years) from 1968 to 2020 (August).
