<p id="p0030">Our goal of this study was to fabricate biogenic AgNPs by using sennoside A as a reducing agent in absence and presence of shape directing and controlling cationic aggregates of CTAB. The antioxidant activities of sennoside A, and Ag/sennoside A were determined by using DPPH radical. Bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and yeast strains (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC) were used to the evaluation of antimicrobial activities of as prepared AgNPs against standard gentamicin and fluconazole. These studies would enhance the medicinal significance of the individual components such as sennoside A and metallic silver. We also focused on isolation and characterization of rhein-9-anthrone (4, 5-dihydroxy-10-oxo-9
 <italic>H</italic>-anthracene-2-carboxylate) from acidic hydrolysis of sennoside A, which was the main constituent responsible to prevent the colon infection (
