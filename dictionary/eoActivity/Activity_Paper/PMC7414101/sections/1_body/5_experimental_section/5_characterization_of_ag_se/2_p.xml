<p id="p0055">The UV–visible spectra of extracted sennosides were recorded by using Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer. The shape, size and the size distribution (the surface morphology) of Ag/sennoside A were determined with UV–visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 2100), equipped with energy dispersed X-ray detector (EDX), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential. The specific surface area of these NPs was estimated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Brunauer-Emmett-Teller</xref>; BET) by using Quantachrome Nova 3200e Surface area &amp; pore size analyzer, Instrument. For TEM measurement, silver sol was deposited on a carbon coated copper grid, dried at room temperature under open air. The X-ray photoemission spectroscope (XPS) was used to determine the chemical and electronic state of silver by using XSAM-800 m featuring a monochromatic Mg Kα X-ray source at 21.5 mA with
