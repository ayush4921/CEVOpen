<p id="p0065">The agar diffusion dilution essay method was used for the estimation of antibacterial and antifungal activities of sennoside A, biosynthesiszed Ag/sennoside A NPs and rhein-9-anthrone (
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Abraham et al., 1941</xref>). Two bacterial strains, namely, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli ATCC 25922</italic> and two reference yeast strains (
 <italic>Candida albicans ATCC 10231</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019</italic>) were used for this purpose. In a typical experiment, the sterile disks were loaded with required concentration of test samples and then placed on agar plate containing strain lawns and incubated at 310 K temperature for 24 h. The zones of inhibition for reference, negative control, and test samples were measured from the diameter (mm) of the clear zone. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC
 <sub>50</sub>) was estimated according to the reported method for various AgNPs concentrations. Gentamicin and fluconazole were used as a reference compound for antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively. Three independent experiments were carried out for each target samples.
