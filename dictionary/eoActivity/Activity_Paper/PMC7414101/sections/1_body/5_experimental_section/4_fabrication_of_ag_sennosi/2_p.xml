<p id="p0050">Sennoside A drug was used as a reductant to the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions for the fabrication of AgNPs. In a typical experiment, sennoside A (1.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L) was added drop-wise in a conical flask containing 5 ml aqueous solution of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.01 mol/L; total volume = 40 ml) under constant stirring with a help of a magnetic stirrer at 1500 rpm for 30 min. The appearance of yellow, orange to dark brown colors was indicated the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions into metallic silver (Ag
 <sup>0</sup>). The resulting brown red color was centrifuged for 30 min with 15 000 rpm at 298 K. The obtained solid AgNPs were dried at 353 K and stored in dark condition at room temperature. In the next experiment, same sennoside A solution was added in a mixture of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> and CTAB (0.073 g, 0.02 mmol) to determine the effect of CTAB on the Ag/sennoside A. Optical images of reaction mixture containing sennoside A, Ag
 <sup>+</sup> and CTAB are given in
