 <sub>2</sub> free) was employed as solvent for the preparation of solutions and dilution. Standard HCl and NaOH solutions were used to maintain the pH for the batch kinetic experiments. Silver nitrate solution was kept in dark to minimize the photochemical oxidation. The deionized water was used as solvent throughout the studies.
