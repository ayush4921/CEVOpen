<p id="p0040">The fresh leaves of senna (
 <italic>Cassia angustifolia</italic> Del.) were collected from the garden of our science college (female section, King Abdulaziz University) and authenticated by Dr. Majid, Department of biology, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah. The leaves were washed thoroughly under water widely and finally with double distilled water to remove dust particles and other foreign materials. In a typical experiment, 10 g dried senna leaves were added in a stoppered conical flask containing 200 ml double distilled and heated at 80 
 <sup>0</sup>C constant temperature water bath for 30 min with constant stirring. The extract cooled at room temperature and filtered with a Whatman filter paper to remove the leaves wastes. The resulting fresh extract was used to obtain the solid sennoside A by using rotatory evaporator (EYELA rotatory evaporator N-1300E.V.S series, Tokyo, Japan) under vacuum at 80 
 <sup>0</sup>C temperature. A dark yellow compound was obtained.
