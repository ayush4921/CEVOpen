 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows that the intensity and position of peaks depends on the [Ag
 <sup>+</sup>]. For example, at lower [Ag
 <sup>+</sup>], peak intensity at 266 nm decreases with reaction time, whereas the absorbance of 340 nm peak increases, attaining maximum absorbance and decreases as a function of time, indicating the interaction of sennoside A with Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions and optimum concentration of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions required to form stable AgNPs (

 <sup>+</sup>] (0.5, 1.2, and 2.5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L) are not suitable to the kinetic experiments. At [Ag

It is well known that the yellow color of aqueous silver sols exhibited in intense SPR band in the UV–visible region from 350 to 650 nm. The shape and position of SPR band depends on the experimental conditions such as presence of solvent, nature of reducing agent, capping action of stabilizer and chemisorbed solute molecules (

 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Mulvaney, 1996</xref>). The stability of NPs was determined by keeping the silver sols at 30 °C for different day intervals. The resulting silver sols were perfect transparent for ca. one week. We did not observe the appearance of any type of precipitate or turbidity. The optical properties of AgNPs depend on the nature of stabilizer and capping agent present in the reaction mixture. The SPR band intensity was diminished due to the adsorption of sennoside A onto the surface of metallic silver (
