 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> clearly indicated that the UV–visible spectra of pure sennoside A, Ag/Sennoside A NPs and CTAB capped Ag/Sennoside A NPs were quite different to each other. The intensity and position of SPR band strongly depends on the [Ag
 <sup>+</sup>] and [CTAB]. The absorption peaks of pure sennoside A at 266 and 340 nm were completely disappeared in presence of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>B and 3A), indicating the complete oxidation of sennoside A by Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions and stabilization of Ag
 <sup>0</sup> simultaneously. As a result, sennoside A acted as a reducing as well as capping agent, and leads to the formation of AgNPs. The capping action of oxidized sennoside A cannot be ruled out completely.
