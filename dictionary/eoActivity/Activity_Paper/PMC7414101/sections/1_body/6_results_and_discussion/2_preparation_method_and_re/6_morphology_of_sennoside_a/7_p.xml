<p id="p0135">XPS measurements were performed to identify the chemical and electronic structure of AgNPs. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, the most prominent signals at binding energies of 368.2 eV and 374.3 eV were corresponding to the Ag3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and Ag3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> orbits of unperturbed metallic silver. The lower intensity peak at higher binding energy is attributed to the positively charged Ag atoms at the surface of the NPs (
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The binding energies of Ag3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and Ag 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> peaks are separated of ca. 6.0 eV, indicating the presence of metallic Ag3d state of silver in as prepared NPs (
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Zanna et al., 2010</xref>). These observations are in good agreement with the XRD results (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A).
