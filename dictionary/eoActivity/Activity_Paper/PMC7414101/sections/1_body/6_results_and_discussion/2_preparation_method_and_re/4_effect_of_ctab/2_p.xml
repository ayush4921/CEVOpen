<p id="p0080">Stabilizer has significant impact on the morphology of advanced nano-materials. They increased and decreased the nucleation rate by solubilizing the reactants as well as the products. Therefore, effect of CTAB from 2.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 25.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L was studied on the redox reaction of sennoside A (=1.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L) and Ag

 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L) at 298 K (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The lower (=2.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L) and higher (=25.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L) concentrations of CTAB was not suitable to the formation of stable AgNPs (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) due to the sub and dilution-micellar effect of CTAB aggregates. At 12.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L [CTAB], the absorbance increases of both peaks and 266 nm peak is red shifted to 304 nm (total shift 38 nm). The absorbance at 395 nm initially increases, then decreases with increasing time and stabilized (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Finally, resulting silver sol shows three absorption bands at 304, 358 and 395 nm. Presence of sennoside A peaks along with a surface resonance plasmon band of Ag

 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, clearly indicates that the nucleation and growth was governed by the CTAB aggregates, which might be due to the sub- and post-micellar effect of CTAB with sennoside A. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A indicated that the Ag/sennoside A shows the presence of two absorption peaks at 304 and 358 nm (red shifted from 266 and 340 nm), which originally come from the sennoside A. Thus it is confirmed that Ag

 <sup>2+</sup> -sennoside A system behaves as J- aggregates (
