<p id="p0090">In order to establish the effect of sennoside A concentration on the nucleation and growth process of AgNPs formation, a series of experiments were performed with varying concentrations of reducing agent from 0.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L to 5.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L at fixed [Ag
 <sup>+</sup>] = 0.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L , [CTAB] = 12.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L and temperature = 298 K. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the lower and higher sennoside A concentrations were not suitable to the preparation of perfect transparent and stable silver sols. To determine to role of temperature, the reaction mixture containing sennoside A = 1.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L, [Ag
 <sup>+</sup>] = 0.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L, and [CTAB] = 12.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L was heated at higher temperature from 303 to 323 K at constant temperature water bath. The visual observations indicated that the intensity of resulting yellow-orange silver sols increases with increasing the temperature. The sols were not stable and turbidity was appeared at higher temperature, which might be due to the agglomeration and /or uncontrolled growth of AgNPs.
