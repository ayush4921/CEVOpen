 <xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>, Eq. (2) represents the one-step redox reaction between phenolic –OH and Ag
 <sup>+</sup>, which results to the formation of sennoside A radical and Ag
 <sup>0</sup>. To detect the generation of radical, 5.0 ml acrylonitrile was added in the reaction mixture (Ag
 <sup>+</sup>, sennoside A + CTAB). The white precipitate appeared as the reaction time increases, which confirmed in situ formation of corresponding free radical. In the next step (Eq.4), Ag
 <sup>+</sup> adsorbed on Ag
 <sup>0</sup> and Ag
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> was formed, which under goes dimerization, and leads to the formation of stable Ag
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> nano cluster (

 <sup>+</sup> ions in the resulting silver sols, 5.0 ml of NaCl (0.1 mol/L) and NaBr (0.1 mol/L) solutions were added in a separate reaction flask. No white and yellow precipitates for AgCl and AgBr, respectively, were appeared, indicating the complete reduction (100%) of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions into Ag
 <sup>0</sup> and/or adsorption of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> onto the surface of Ag
 <sup>0</sup> (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Henglein, 1993</xref>). The surface of Ag
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> species is positive and capped with sennoside A via –OH groups of glycoside through electrostatic interactions (
