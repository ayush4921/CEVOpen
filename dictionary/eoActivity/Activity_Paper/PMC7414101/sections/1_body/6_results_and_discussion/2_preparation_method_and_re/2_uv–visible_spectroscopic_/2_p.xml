 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A shows the resulted aqueous extract of sennoside has two absorption peaks at λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 266 and 340 nm. No absorption peak was appeared at 358 nm (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which ruled out the presence of sennoside B and other chemical constituent in our extracted sennoside from 
 <italic>Cassia angustifolia</italic>. Our values of λ
 <sub>max</sub> are in good agreement with the λ
 <sub>max</sub> of standard sennoside A reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Tan, et al., 2015</xref>). The sennoside A concentration was calculated by the reported method with molar extinction coefficient, ε = 9430 L/mol/cm (
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Hietala, et al., 1988</xref>). Interestingly, the peak intensity decreases and red shifted from 266 nm to 288 nm with increasing sennoside A concentrations from 1.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 5.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L at a fixed temperature, whereas the peak intensity increases and red shift was also observed from 340 nm to 374 nm, indicating the J-type aggregation of sennoside A molecules to each other (
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Mas-Montoya and Janssen, 2017</xref>). Such type of behaviors was not observed at higher sennoside concentrations (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). The peak position remains constant with [sennoside A]. The peak position at 266 nm might be due to the π-π* and n-π* transitions of –OH and carbonyl groups in the sennoside A. Our position of peaks are in good agreement with results of other investigators regarding the UV–visible spectra of substituted anthraquinons, which shows intense quinonoide peak in the vicinity of 260 to 290 nm (
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Thomson, 1971</xref>). The FTIR spectrum of sennoside were recorded and the various peak at 3430, 2930, 1610, 1520, 1050 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were observed, which can be attributed to the presence of –OH groups, C-H stretching, C = O group (or OH from –COOH), C = C benzene ring and C-O stretching, respectively (Fig. not given). Thus we may state confidently that our extracted dark yellow solid has sennoside A in the greatest concentration (
