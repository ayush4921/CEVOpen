<p id="p0095">The effects of NaOH (varying from 1.0 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> mol/L to 5.0 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> mol/L) was also studied with constant concentrations of oxidizing agent (0.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mol/L), reducing agent (1.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L), CTAB (12.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). The yellowish-white turbidity was appeared instead of transparent yellow-orange color (characteristic of AgNPs) with in 30 min of reaction time. To determine the effect of dissolved atmospheric molecular oxygen, the pure nitrogen gas was bubbled through the reaction mixture and UV–visible spectra were recorded. No significant spectral changes (shape, position and intensity of SPR band) were observed in the de-aerated resulting silver sols (
