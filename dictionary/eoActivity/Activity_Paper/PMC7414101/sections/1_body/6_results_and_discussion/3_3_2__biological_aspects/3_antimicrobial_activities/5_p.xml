<p id="p0190">The size of the NPs and PDI markedly influence the antimicrobial activities and other biological application of NPs. The small size NPs and lower PDI are usually shows an excellent activity against human pathogens because they can incorporate easily into the cellular wall, associated with amino acids and disturb the physiological function of the bacteria (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2014</xref>). The results of present study (small size = 12 nm, lower PDI = 0.6, and negative zeta potential = − 10 mV) showed that the as prepared AgNPs was effective against the bacteria, and fungi, and was a simple, green, economically viable and environmentally friendly green method for the synthesis of AgNPs. The phytochemical, sennoside A also showed antimicrobial activities and responsible for the capping the AgNPs due to the adsorption through its active site.
