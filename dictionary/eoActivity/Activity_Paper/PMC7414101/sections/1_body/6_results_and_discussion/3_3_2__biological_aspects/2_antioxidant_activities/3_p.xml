<p id="p0170">The natural pigments and polyphonols were responsible for the antioxidant properties due to the presence of phenolic –OH groups. The sennoside A and rhein-9-anthrone were used in medicinal and food industries. Antiradical activities of sennoside A and Ag/sennoside A NPs and rhein-9-anthrone were determined against DPPH radical by using UV–visible spectroscopy. For DPPH radical, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was evaluated from the plot of inhibition percentage versus sennoside A concentration. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49.5, 46.2 and 53.2 μg /L DPPH
