 <p>Sennoside A (dianthrone glycoside) shows laxative properties and used as a folk traditional medicine. Sennoside A capped silver nanoparticles (Ag/sennoside A) were synthesized at room temperature for the first time by using sennoside A as reducing and capping agent. UV–visible spectroscopic data reveals that the absorption peaks of pure sennoside A was appeared at 266, and 340 nm, which red shifted to 304, and 354 nm at higher sennoside A concentration. Upon addition of the Ag
  <sup>+</sup> ions, an additional peak also observed at 398 nm, indicating the formation of spherical sennoside A capped silver nanoparticles (Ag/sennoside A). Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used a stabilizing agent to determine the role of cationic micelles on the nucleation and growth processes of Ag/sennoside A NPs formation. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl nitrogen radical (DPPH

In addition, Rhein-9-anthrone (4,5-dihydroxy-10-oxo-9

The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of rhein-9-anthrone were also determined against DPPH radical, antibacterial and antifungal strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined and discussed.
