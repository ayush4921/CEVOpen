<p>The in vivo antidiarrheal index (ADI) was measured by considering three parameters as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. These are delays in defecation (Dfreq), gut meal travel distance (Gmeq), and purging frequency in the number of wet stools (Pfreq). The 80% methanolic extract showed an antidiarrheal index of 50.28, 69.10, and 80.19 at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, respectively, while standard drug produced a maximum index of 83.86. Moreover, 80% of methanol extract showed a dose-dependent increment in ADI value.
