<p>The present study was conducted as per the OECD guidelines 425 shown methanol extract of 
 <italic>V. amygdalina</italic> did not yield any morbidity during the study period of 14 days at a dose of 2g/kg of body weight. No any neurological, behavioral and autonomic changes and physical changes. Moreover, the 
 <italic>V. amygdalina</italic> leaves extract did not lead to death in the mice at a dose of 2g/kg at study period time. The finding indicated that a single dose of 
 <italic>V. amygdalina</italic> extracts had no adverse effect, demonstrating that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> could be greater than 2g/kg/body weight in mice.
