<p>The 80% methanolic extract of V. amygdalina leaves was found to be effective against castor oil-induced diarrhea in terms of delaying the onset of diarrhea at 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg tested doses as well as reduced the fecal parameters (number and weight of wet and total stools) compared to the negative control. Besides, the data revealed that the percentage of diarrheal inhibitions were 49.02% (p &lt; 0.001), 61.64% (p &lt; 0.001) and 71.45% (p &lt; 0.001) at the doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, respectively. The number of wet feces was markedly reduced with 80% methanolic extract of V. amygdalina at a dose of 400 mg/kg when compared with a negative control. Loperamide 3 mg/kg (positive control) has also shown highest reduction of wet defecations with percentage inhibition of 75.49% (P &lt; 0.001).</p>
