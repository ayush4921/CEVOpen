<p>To settle the antidiarrheal activity of leaves of V. amygdalin the possible mechanism of action was tested on intestinal motility and enteropooling models. In the castor oil-induced gastrointestinal motility model, it was observed that the extract significantly suppresses the movement of the charcoal marker at 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg doses as compared to the negative control. The higher percentage of inhibition (57.74%, p &lt; 0.001), of the marker perceived at maximum dose was almost comparable to the standard drug (60.09%, p &lt; 0.001 at the dose of 3 mg/kg). This finding showed that the extract can influence the peristaltic movement of the intestine thereby indicating the presence of intestinal antimotility activity. Concerning this, several plants have shown antidiarrheal activities by reducing the gastrointestinal motility and its secretions.

 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Pretreatment with 80% methanol extract significantly reduced peristaltic movements as evidenced by the decrease in the distance traveled by a charcoal meal in the GIT, showing that these crude extracts could have antimotility activity due to flavonoid and tannin constituents.
