<p>An acute toxicity study was carried out to determine possible adverse reactions to a single dose or an overdose of the extract.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Generally, the absence of mortality and signs of overt toxicity up to five times the maximum effective dose of the extract suggested that 80% methanol leaves extract has a wider safety margin and LD50 value greater than 2g/kg in mice.
