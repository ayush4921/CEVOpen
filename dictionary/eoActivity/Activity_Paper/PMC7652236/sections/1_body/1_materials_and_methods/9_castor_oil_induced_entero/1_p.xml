<p>Intestinal fluid accumulation was evaluated according to the method described.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thirty mice were fasted for 18 hours and treated as described in the grouping and dosing section just one hour before oral administration of 0.5 mL CO. After 1 hour, the mice were sacrificed, the pyloric and cecum ends of the small intestine were tied and the intestine was removed. The dissected small intestine was weighed and intestinal contents were expelled into a measuring cylinder and then the volume was measured. Weight of the intestine after milking was taken and the difference between full and empty intestines was calculated. Finally, the percentage inhibitions of intestinal secretion were calculated.
