<p>The experimental animals were randomly assigned to five groups, each consisting of six mice. All groups were administered orally their respective treatments by oral gavage. The animals of group I were considered as the negative control and orally administered distilled water 10 mL/kg under all experimental conditions. Group II to IV (test groups) was given extracts of V. amygdalina leaves orally at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses, respectively, during all the three antidiarrheal model tests. Group V was assigned as positive control and treated with the standard drug, Loperamide (3 mg/kg) orally. Loperamide served as a standard drug for all models. Dose selection was made based on the acute oral toxicity test as well as a pilot study and then the OECD15 guideline was followed and under all conditions, the solutions were prepared just before the experiments on the day of the experiments.</p>
