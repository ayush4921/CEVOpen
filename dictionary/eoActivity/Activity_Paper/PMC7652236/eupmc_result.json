    "<h4>Introduction</h4>Diarrhea is a cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children. Patients with diarrhea have been suffering from limited treatment options due to poor drug tolerance, side effect, and multi-drug resistance to almost all the current drug treatments. Therefore, it is important to search for a new therapeutic medicine that can effectively prevent the disease and safe. <i>Vernonia amygdalina</i> is an indigenous medicinal plant used traditionally for the treatment of diarrhea in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was therefore to confirm the antidiarrheal activities of 80% methanol leaves extract using mice models.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The antidiarrheal activities of the 80% methanol leaves extract were investigated using castor oil-induced diarrhea, intestinal motility, and enteropooling models in mice. The negative control received distilled water orally, the test groups received three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the plant materials, and the positive control is given 3 mg/kg Loperamide orally.<h4>Results</h4>In the castor oil-induced diarrheal model, the extract delayed onset of diarrhea and reduced fecal parameters at all tested doses significantly as compared with the negative control. Results from the charcoal meal test revealed that the extract produced a significant anti-motility effect at all tested doses as compared with the negative control. In the enteropooling test, the extract produced a significant decline in the volume and weight of intestinal contents. The observed antidiarrheal activity could be associated with the phytochemicals present in this plant extract. It was also observed that the extracts have shown no acute toxicity at a dose of 2 g/kg.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides the antidiarrheal activity of the crude extract in all three models. Hence, the findings provide scientific support for the traditional use of <i>Vernonia amygdalina</i> leaves as treatment of diarrhea."
