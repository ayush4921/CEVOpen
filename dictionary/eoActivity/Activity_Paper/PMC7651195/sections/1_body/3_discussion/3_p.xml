<p>The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral of the isolated compound was compared to that of harpagide and allobentonicoside, compounds of close structural similarity as obtained in literatures (Jensen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Manguro et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Venditti et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). While harpagide has only one glucose unit attached at C-1 to the iridoid aglycone unit, the allobentonicoside has two glucose units attached at C-1 and C-5 as in harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. However, allobentonicoside has the hydroxyl converted to a carbonyl at C-6 with an unsaturation at C-7. The isolated compound has very similar 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data compared to the allobentonicoside (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure S1</xref>). However, the absence of carbonyl stretching vibration in the infrared spectrum confirms that the compound is not allobentonicoside. The molecular ion peak at

 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>34</sub>O
 <sub>15</sub> [M + Na] further strengthens the claim of two attached glucose units as in allobentonicoside. The de-glucosidated aglycone was presented at

 <sub>26</sub>O
