<p>The isolated compound was subjected to

 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The low GI absorption value insinuates harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside may not be easily absorbed by the intestine. The small intestine is known for its important role in drug metabolism as the large surfaces areas of villi and microvilli determine the rate of drug absorption via the oral route (Pang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The low absorption of the compound may be attributed to its inability to permeate the phospholipid bilayers of the intestinal membrane owing to the lipophobic properties of most glycosides (Chao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This may also be responsible for the predicted impermeability of the compound across the BBB. The prediction of the compound as a substrate of P-gp, suggests it is translocated from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment via transmembrane efflux mediated by P-gp (Kim, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This may be responsible for the low GI absorption of the compound as P-gp has been implicated in reduced bioavailability of its substrate (Constantinides &amp; Wasan, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The predicted inability of the compound to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 insinuates that there will be little or no drug – drug interactions when co-administered with other drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes (Obach et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The predicted LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2000 mg/kg and toxicity class of 4 suggest the compound is safe for administration (Banerjee et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
