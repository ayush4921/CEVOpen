<p>As COVID-19 pandemic feasts, scientists and policy makers are currently making tireless efforts to reduce transmission through regular public health interventions based on testing, isolation of cases and tracing of contacts (Mitjà &amp; Clotet, 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Efforts are also on top gear in the area of vaccines development and clinical trial of drugs based on the general principles of drug repurposing (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Unfortunately, the search for new drugs using bioactive components of medicinal plants against COVID-19 is receiving a little or no attention at this time. This is without taking cognizance of the facts that even the so-called drugs (Chloroquine, Remdesivir, Azithromycin etc.) that are being repurposed against COVID-19 had traceable origin to medicinal plants. Boosting the host immune system has also been reported to be beneficial in ameliorating the effect of the virus and the severe progression of the disease (Rothan &amp; Byrareddy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the potentials of harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, a new iridoid glycoside isolated from
