<p>The notable initial incidence and spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>) can be attributed to its novelty (Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sohrabi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This resulted in the disease being transmitted through hospitals and infected medical staff unknowingly. In addition, vulnerable cases, 60 years and above with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma and other respiratory diseases contributed to the majority of the cases and deaths in China (Zhang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the downward trend of the disease in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figures 1C – 1F</xref>) can be related to her timely amendment of governmental policies which included enforcing restricted personnel movements in the epicentre of the disease (Wuhan city) and other areas of China (Gan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kraemer et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), sharing vital prevention and control information (including wearing of masks, adequate washing and sanitizing of hands, symptoms and means of seek medical assistance), enhanced public health resources, providing improved and functional infectious disease surveillance, early detection systems and multi-sectoral rapid response systems to assist curtail the disease (Zhang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). China’s overall initiative and strategies in response to COVID-19 can be attributed to the lessons and experiences of the SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 (Zhang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Contrarily, limited medical resources and the delayed response in implementing policies restricting movements of people may have resulted in the surge of cases and deaths across Europe and other countries with high confirmed cases and deaths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figures 1E and 1F</xref>). In other words, countries reacted slowly in implementing measures and policies to reduce the chance of contact between infected and vulnerable people. While the low recorded COVID-19 cases and related deaths across Africa can be linked with few vulnerable populations because Africa's life expectancy at birth is 61 years (World Health Organisation, 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, a global health emergency that involves continuous collaborative surveillance, information sharing, researching and implementing evidence-based public health and clinical practices and formulating effective control strategies cannot be overemphasised. Furthermore, in-depth studies aimed at assessing the vulnerability of young people with underlying medical conditions and amongst different blood groups is important. These measures would be instrumental in the implementation of targeted intervention policies and resources.
