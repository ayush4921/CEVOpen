<p>The DFT calculated result for the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and the calculated vibrational frequencies obtained showed good agreement with experimental (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR chemical shifts, with a small deviation of 0.01 and 0.11â€‰ppm for H-4 and H-9 (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), respectively. Others displayed slightly increased deviations from the experimental values, though these deviations are in accordance with previously calculated DFT 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR calculations (De Souza et al.,
