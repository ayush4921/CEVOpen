 <italic>Clerodendrum volubile</italic> is a leafy vegetable mostly utilized as food ingredients in Southern Nigeria (Erukainure, Sanni, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Erukainure et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Regarded as magic leaves, C. 
 <italic>volubile</italic> is used in folk medicine for treating ulcers, arthritis, rheumatism, dropsy, and diabetes (Burkill, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Its antioxidant activities have been reported in diabetic rats, and cancerous cells which correlates with their antidiabetic and anticancer activities (Erukainure, Ashraf, et al., 2018; Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The flowers as well as protocatechuic acid and pectolinarigenin isolated from the leaves have been reported for their ability to modulate phagocytic oxidative burst in isolated neutrophils and macrophages which demonstrates their immunomodulatory activities (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erukainure, Mesaik, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erukainure et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The dichloromethane (DCM) fraction of the leaves have been reported for its cytotoxic effect on human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (Erukainure, Narainpersad, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The leaves are rich in phenolics contents which has been correlated with its reported biological activities (Erukainure, Narainpersad, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Oboh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
