<p>The antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of medicinal plants have been reported (Erukainure, Mesaik, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vijayan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This has been attributed to their ability to modulate inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic activities of monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages (Erukainure, Mesaik, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Harun et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), with their phytochemical constituents playing an influential role. 
 <italic>Clerodendrum volubile</italic> is among medicinal plants reported for their immunomodulatory activities (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erukainure, Zaruwa, et al.,
