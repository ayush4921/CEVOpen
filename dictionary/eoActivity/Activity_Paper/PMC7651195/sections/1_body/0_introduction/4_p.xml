<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study reports for the isolation and characterization of a new iridoid glycoside, harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. volubile</italic>. Based on previous reports on the immunomodulatory properties of the leaf extract, it is hypothesized that the isolated compound may contribute to the modulation of the immune system in favor of suppressing CRS. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating the antioxidative burst potentials of the compound on polymorpho-nuclear neutrophils (PMNs), as well as its antiproliferative effect on T-cells. The ability of the compound to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated using combined 
 <italic>in silico</italic> tools. This study also reports global epidemiology study of COVID-19 from January – August 2020.
