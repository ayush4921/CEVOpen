<p>The spatiotemporal distribution of confirmed monthly COVID-19 cases and deaths from January to March 2020 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. The maps suggest the impacts of the disease (cases and deaths) were initially felt in China in January 2020 before it spread to other countries where noticeable spikes in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported in subsequent months. This suggests the epicentre of COVID-19 shifted from China to Europe (affecting mainly Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Turkey and Austria) at the end of March 2020. Other countries that reported high confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in March 2020 were the USA, Iran, Canada, South Korea, Brazil and Chile. However, African countries reported fewer cases and deaths of COVID-19 compared to countries in other continents from January to March 2020. While low confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 are continuously reported across Africa, US and Europe (especially Spain, France and UK) are still characterized by high confirmed COVID-19 cases and death. Other countries currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths are Russia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Iran, Iraq and most South American Countries (especially Brazil, Columbia, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Chile). This suggests, South America is currently the new epicentre of COVID-19 (Roser et al.,
