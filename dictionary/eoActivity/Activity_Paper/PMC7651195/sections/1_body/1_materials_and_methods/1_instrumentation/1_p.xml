<p>The 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded at temperature 300 K on Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer in MeOD. δ (ppm) values were used for reporting chemical shifts. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum was recorded for 128 scan using pulse sequence with an acquisition time 1.58 sec, relaxation delay of 1.5 sec, spectra width of 10,330 Hz and Intrinsic digital resolution of 0.3152 Hz with tetramethylsilane, TMS as internal standard. Hitachi UV-3200 spectrophotometer was used in obtaining UV spectra. A pre-coated silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> plates (E. Merck, 0.25 mm) was used for thin layer chromatography (TLC), which was detected under UV light (254 nm) after spraying with ceric sulphate reagent. JEOL JMS-HX-110 mass spectrometer was used for recording EI-MS.
