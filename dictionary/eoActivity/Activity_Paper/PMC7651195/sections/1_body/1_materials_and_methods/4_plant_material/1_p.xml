 <italic>Clerodendrum volubile</italic> leaves were obtained from local farmers at Ifon, Ondo State, Nigeria. The leaves were assigned a voucher number, UBH
 <sub>C284</sub> after identification and authentication by Dr. Henry Akinbosun at the Herbarium, Department of Botany, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. The leaves were air-dried to minimize loss of volatiles and light-sensitive compounds (Thamkaew et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) before blending to fine powder and stored in a zip-lock bag at room temperature until further analysis (2â€‰days).
