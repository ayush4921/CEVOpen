<p>The blended sample was subjected to methanol (MeOH) extraction at room temperature. The solvent choice was based on the polarity of MeOH and reports as an optimal solvent for high content of phytochemical constituents (Truong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The extract was concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> using a rotary evaporator. About 100 g of the extract was dissolved in MeOH/Distilled water (1:3), and thereafter subjected to gradient polarity based chemical fractionation using, n-hexane (Hex), n-dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and butanol (BuOH). All the fractions were collected, concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> and stored in glass vials at −20˚C. The EtOAc fraction was parked into a silica gel – loaded column chromatography for further fractionation. The column was subjected to solvent elution starting with 100% hexane, and thereafter mixtures of Hex and EtOAc (9:1) in increasing order of polarity up to 100% EtOAc. Each elute was collected in glass vials and its purity was confirmed by subjection to thin-layer chromatography on pre-coated silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> sheets. They were sprayed with ceric sulfate reagent, dried under hot-air (60 °C), and viewed under UV light (254 nm). Elutes from Hex and EtOAc (8:2) showed a single spot. They were combined and concentrated in a fume compound, before subjection to NMR analysis for structural elucidation and identification. The compound was identified as harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside.
