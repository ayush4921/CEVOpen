<p>Non-Biological Complex Drugs (NBCDs) are complex non-biological drugs that comprise large high molecular weight molecules and, often, nanoparticular structures (including liposomes and block-copolymer micelles). They differ from typical small chemical molecules generally used as pharmaceutical active product ingredients and also from biotechnology-derived medicinal products (large proteins) since, for NBCDs, the entire complex is the active pharmaceutical ingredient and its properties cannot be fully characterized by physicochemical analysis. Moreover, the manufacturing process is fundamental in creating the correct originator product, as well as for the generic versions. But as in the case for biotechnology-derived medicinal products, the “product is also the process,” as it is the case for biosimilar medicinal products. NBCDs can also be characterized as complex drug products that are not biologicals (
