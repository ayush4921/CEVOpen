<p>It is somewhat controversial to include drug nanocrystals in this category. In fact, in nanocrystals the size reduction delivers a very well-known increase in surface area that drives the dissolution behavior, solubility, and its dissolution rate. This is currently well-covered by the existing regulatory framework. In fact, strategies usually followed for oral delivery pharmaceutical formulations (i.e., through analysis of dissolution profiles and comparisons between originator and generic formulations), using the F2 dissolution parameter to prequalify formulations for further bioequivalence clinical trials, can suffice for most of these products. As such, in our view, for oral delivery systems, the use of formulations with nanocrystal analogs can be easily dealt with through relevant and well-established regulatory pathways, already designed for evaluating generic oral medicinal products (
