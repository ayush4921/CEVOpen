<p>Critical issues arise, therefore, when trying to demonstrate equivalence between the follow-on product and the innovator product. The need for data on safety and efficacy, relevant for the therapeutic indication, means that, if “follow-on” products are accepted without supporting clinical proof of safety and efficacy (or an adequate surrogate path), their equivalence with the originator/innovator product cannot be appropriately defined. When the process of manufacturing impacts so heavily on the performance of the final product, with major consequences on its safety and efficacy, there is room for disputing the traditional generic pathway for marketing approval, bringing unacceptable uncertainty into the benefit-risk assessment (

For comparison, in the case of biotechnology drugs, the biosimilars approach, implemented in Europe after 2004, introduced an appropriate regulatory model. In the biosimilars pathway different “follow-on” categories are evaluated according to their specificities, taking into consideration their specific physicochemical and biological properties, evaluating how they impact separately on the clinical safety and efficacy determinants (
