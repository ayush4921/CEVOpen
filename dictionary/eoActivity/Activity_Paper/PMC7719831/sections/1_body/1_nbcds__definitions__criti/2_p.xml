<p>In summary, NBCDs typically consist of a multitude of closely related structures, the entire complex being the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Its properties cannot be fully characterized by physicochemical analysis alone and the well-controlled robust manufacturing process is fundamental to reproduce the biofate of the innovator's medicinal product. In this category we currently include glatiramoids, iron oxide carbohydrate nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymeric micelles.</p>
