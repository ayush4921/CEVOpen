<p>“The product is the process” is the leading principle when discussing “follow-on” products of biotechnology-based products. In fact, when introducing the concept of biosimilars, as well as follow-on versions of complex systems such as NBCDs, this is the main critical factor. This means that it is the manufacturing process that ultimately defines the inherent properties and attributes of the final medicinal product, and therefore conditions of use. Trying to establish similarity while not recognizing the inherent complexity of these systems is a major error.</p>
