<p>An adequate level of clinical evidence needs to be generated if any interchangeability decision is to be taken. It cannot be generated solely based on the adoption of the common INN (in this case a misleading form of making similar what is in reality a different product). In fact, not all liposomal doxorubicin formulations can be interchanged as the same happens for iron oxide IV formulations or other macromolecular constructs of a specific API (under the same INN). In the case of NBCDs, using only an INN-based approach will increase risks for the patient.</p>
