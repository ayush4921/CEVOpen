<p>When looking at therapeutic equivalence and/or clinical comparability, data from specific clinical trials comparing the innovators and follow-on/ similar products still seems to be the most prudent path. This avoids the trap of unanticipated severe side events or lack of desired efficacy that, in most cases, cannot be fully discounted, when regulatory decisions are based solely on preclinical data or simple physico-chemical characterization. Therefore, we should always exclude any generic-like path in regulatory assessments during the pre-marketing evaluation of NBCDs.</p>
