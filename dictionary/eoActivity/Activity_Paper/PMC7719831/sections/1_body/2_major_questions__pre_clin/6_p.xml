<p>In the same line, for issues relevant to the evaluation of clinically available data, the current regulatory guidance identifies gaps on knowledge and/or technologies that need to be addressed when looking into specific product/formulation to deal with: (i) insufficient knowledge on the impact of quality attributes and modifications on the activity of the products; (ii) insufficient design of studies, in order to attain the statistical power for detection of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> small differences; (iii) the need for advanced/sophisticated physicochemical analytical techniques (e.g., microscopy, imaging, etc.) for â€œNBCD development; and (iv) the need for using additional predictive approaches, e.g., modeling, to help to understand the impact of attribute variability on the efficacy and safety of a (similar) NBCD vs. the originator.
