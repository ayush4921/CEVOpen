<p>Among the attributes needing characterization, as they may affect the clinical performance of the similar product, the FDA guidance document refers to: (i) Characterization of the material structure and its function; (ii) Complexity of the material structure; (iii) Understanding of the impact of physicochemical properties of the material on biological effects (e.g., the effect of particle size on pharmacokinetic parameters); (iv) Understanding the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> release mechanism based on the physicochemical properties; (v) Predictability of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> release based on established 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release methods; (vi) Physical and chemical stability; (vii) Maturity of the nanotechnology (including manufacturing and analytical methods); (viii) Potential impact of manufacturing changes, including in-process controls, and the robustness of the control strategy on critical quality attributes of the drug product; (ix) Physical state of the material upon administration; (x) Route of administration; and (xi) Dissolution, bioavailability, distribution, biodegradation, accumulation, and their predictability based on physicochemical parameters and animal studies.
