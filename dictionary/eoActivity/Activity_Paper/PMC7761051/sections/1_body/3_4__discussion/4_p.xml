<p>On the basis of our findings, the picture is emerging that MT- and ST-CPDs have distinguishing structural features that can be detected via ML. These features can at least in part be associated with NN relationships. In other words, many MT-CPDs are more similar to other MT-CPDs than corresponding ST-CPDs and vice versa. Investigating whether these structural relationships might depend on the presence or absence of general structural signatures of compound promiscuity or of structural features that are confined to given compound classes and target combinations provides interesting opportunities for future research resulting from our analysis.</p>
