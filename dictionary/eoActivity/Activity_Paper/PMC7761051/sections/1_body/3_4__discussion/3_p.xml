<p>Given the premise of diagnostic ML, models were built on the basis of chemical structure to systematically distinguish between MT- and corresponding ST-CPDs under varying conditions using specifically modified datasets. Notably, for such diagnostic ML analysis, there is no external or experimental validation scheme that might be applicable. The ML calculations were complemented by NN analysis and revealed that diagnostic models were generally predictive and that NN relationships between MT- and ST-CPDs had a strong influence on the predictions. </p>
