<p>The term compound promiscuity is often used with opposing connotations including the presence of non-specific, artificial, or otherwise undesired binding effects on the one hand, and the ability to engage in specific interactions with multiple targets on the other [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The latter ability has been rationalized as a form of “selectively nonselective” interactions [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], at least for closely related targets such as protein kinases [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, multi-target activity of small molecules is not limited to targets from the same family, but extends to distantly or virtually unrelated targets [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Promiscuous compounds with specific multi-target activity are essential for eliciting polypharmacological effects in vivo, which are often of critical importance for the treatment of multi-factorial diseases [

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. By contrast, compounds with multi-target activity are problematic for chemical biology and target validation because small molecule probes for interrogating biological functions of individual targets should be as specific as possible [
