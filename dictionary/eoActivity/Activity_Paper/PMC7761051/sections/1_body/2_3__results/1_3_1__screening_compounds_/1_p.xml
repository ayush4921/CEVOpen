<p>The data curation procedures described above led to the elimination of ~10% of the pre-selected compounds that might potentially cause assay artifacts (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The biochemical assay subset comprised ~1/3 of the assays, targets, compounds, and interactions contained in the mixed set (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A total of 2858 and 1242 MT-CPDs with PD ≥ 5 together with 15,839 and 6629 corresponding ST-CPDs were sampled for ML from mixed and biochemical assays, respectively (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Applying the lower threshold PD ≥ 3 for MT-CPDs led to the identification of 3468 and 11,793 MT- and corresponding ST-CPDs from biochemical assays and hence further increased the size of the dataset.
