<p>Results of the predictions on datasets from mixed assays are reported in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f005">Figure 5</xref>b. Reassuringly, the results essentially displayed the same trends as discussed above. Overall, prediction accuracy was slightly reduced for the more heterogeneous mixed datasets, but RF and SVM models also approached 80% prediction accuracy on the full set. These models performed better than KNN classifiers, which were also predictive in this case. The largest difference was again observed on the basis of MCC values (0.41 for KNN, 0.51 for RF, 0.49 for SVM). Control calculations with the randomly reduced sets displayed only a minor reduction in model performance, as observed before. By contrast, following NN-based compound removal, the relative reduction in performance was larger than determined for compounds from biochemical assays, especially for KNN classification where MCC values were reduced from 0.41 (full set) to 0.24. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f006">Figure 6</xref>b compares ROC curves for predictions of reduced datasets from mixed assays. In this case, random compound removal yielded AUC values of 0.79 (SVM) and 0.81 (RF) that were reduced by NN removal to 0.72 and 0.71, respectively. Taken together, these findings also revealed a marked influence of NN effects on the predictions, as observed for datasets from biochemical assay.
