<p>The analysis of NN relationships among MT- and corresponding ST-CPDs was complemented by the systematic detection of structural analogs (sharing the same core structure) in the different datasets. For compounds from biochemical assays applying the PD ≥ 5 threshold for MT-CPDs, 59% of the MT- and 40% of the ST-CPDs were found to have structural analogs. When the PD ≥ 3 threshold was applied the proportions slightly increased to 64% of the MT- and 52% of the ST-CPDs. For compounds from mixed assays applying the PD ≥ 5 threshold, structural analogs were identified for 62% of the MT- and 56% of the ST-CPDs. Thus, analog relationships were similarly distributed in the datasets. However, structural analogs were detected for ~10–20% more MT- than ST-CPDs, consistent with the stronger tendency of MT-CPDs to form NN relationships with other MT-CPDs than observed for ST-CPDs, as discussed above. Notably, for approximate half of the compounds from all sets, no structural analogs were detected, indicating that the compounds were overall structurally diverse, as typically expected for collections of biological screening compounds.</p>
