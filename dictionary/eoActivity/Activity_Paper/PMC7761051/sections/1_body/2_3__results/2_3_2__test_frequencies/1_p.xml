<p>Prior to balancing of these datasets for ML calculations, we examined the test frequencies of the sampled compounds. The distributions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f001">Figure 1</xref>. MT- and ST-CPDs from biochemical assays had comparable test frequencies for both PD thresholds with a median value of ~90 assays per compound. Median test frequency values were slightly higher for ST-CPDs (91 for PD ≥ 5 and 90 for PD ≥ 3) than for MT-CPDs (79 for PD ≥ 5 and 82 for PD ≥ 3). Compounds from mixed assays were evaluated in even larger number of assays, with a median test frequency of 228 and 206 assays per ST- and MT-CPD, respectively. Hence, selected compounds were extensively tested, with comparably large numbers of assays for ST- and MT-CPDs. Accordingly, these datasets provided a sound basis for sampling of compounds to balance training and test sets for ML analysis.
