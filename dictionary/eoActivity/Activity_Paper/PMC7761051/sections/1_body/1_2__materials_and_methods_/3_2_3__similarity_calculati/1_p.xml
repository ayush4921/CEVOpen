<p>For compound comparison, Tanimoto similarity [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was calculated on the basis of the Morgan fingerprint with a radius of 2 (folded into 2048-bit vector) [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] from RDKit. This fingerprint systematically captures molecule-specific atom environments for a given bond radius. Distributions of NN similarity values were represented in two-dimensional kernel density estimation (KDE) plots [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
