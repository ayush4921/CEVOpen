<p>In addition, predictions were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [
 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which compare the TP rate ([0,1], 
 <italic>y</italic>-axis) to the FP rate ([0,1], 
 <italic>x</italic>-axis) at different classification thresholds. The diagonal corresponds to random class label prediction and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.5. Increasing AUC values &gt; 0.50 indicate increasing prediction accuracy, AUC = 1.0 resulting from a perfect prediction.
