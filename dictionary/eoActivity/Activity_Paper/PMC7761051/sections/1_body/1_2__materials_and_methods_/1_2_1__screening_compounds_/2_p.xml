<p>Importantly, for the assessment of compounds with multi-target activity, potentially false positive activity annotations should be avoided as much as possible. To exclude questionable activity annotations, screening compounds were disregarded that yielded one or more alerts in computational filters for pan assay interference compounds (PAINS) [

 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports the number of detected compounds with potential interference character. From the original pool of 1,455,765 screening compounds, 151,387 were removed, yielding a final selection of 1,304,387 unique compounds.
