<p>Compounds with single- or multi-target activity were extracted from PubChem BioAssay [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] using in-house scripts supported by Open Eye chemistry toolkits [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Initially, all assays with designated targets having PubChem Gene Identifiers were downloaded. Assays against anti-targets or others with reported inconsistent results or designated cytotoxic compounds were omitted. In addition, assays with unusually high hit rates above 2% were removed, which excluded a number of confirmatory assays and very small screens with only few tested compounds from further consideration. Furthermore, assays originating from other databases, such as ChEMBL, were disregarded.
