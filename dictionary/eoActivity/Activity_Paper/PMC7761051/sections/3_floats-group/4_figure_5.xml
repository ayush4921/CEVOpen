 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of prediction accuracies. In (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold>), prediction accuracies are shown for data sets from biochemical and mixed assays, respectively. Box plots report the distribution of balanced accuracy values for 10 independent SVM (blue), KNN (orange), and RF (green) trials using different training and test sets. From the top to the bottom, results are shown for all ST- and MT-CPDs (All CPDs), reduced data sets after random removal of 50% of the compounds (Random removal), and corresponding data sets after removal of 50% of NNs (NN removal).
