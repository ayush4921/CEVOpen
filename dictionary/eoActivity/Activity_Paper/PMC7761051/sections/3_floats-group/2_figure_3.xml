  <p>Nearest neighbor relationships for single- and multi-target compounds from mixed assays. KDE plots report the distribution of closest similarity relationships according to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f002">Figure 2</xref>. In (
   <bold>a</bold>), the similarity value distributions are reported for the original data set. In (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>c</bold>), NN calculations were carried out after random removal of 50% of the MT- and ST-CPDs and removal of 50% of the NNs from MT- and ST-CPDs, respectively.
