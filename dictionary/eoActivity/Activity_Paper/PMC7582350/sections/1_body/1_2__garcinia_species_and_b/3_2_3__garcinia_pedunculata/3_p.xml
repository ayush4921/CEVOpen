<p>Phytochemical studies have shown that the dry fruits contain hydroxylcitric acid, benzophenones, garcinol, pedunculol, and isogarcinol (cambogin), the first having been reported as possessing antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the second and third with anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiparasitic activities [

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Dry fruits have been selected for different actions and have shown anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and antioxidant pharmacological activities in vitro [

 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Phytochemical analyses have revealed the presence of phytochemicals such as pedunculol (

 <bold>28</bold>), cambogin (
 <bold>29</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and (Î±)-hydroxylcitric acid (
 <bold>30</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Hexane and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>Garcinia pedunculata</italic> showed antioxidant activity, helping in the elimination of free radicals and showing strong antimutagenicity, the hexane extract being more reactive than that of the chloroform extract [
