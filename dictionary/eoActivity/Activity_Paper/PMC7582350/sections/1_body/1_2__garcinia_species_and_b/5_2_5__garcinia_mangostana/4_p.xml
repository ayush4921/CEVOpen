<p>Some studies have shown the antihyperglycemic power and antidiabetic activity of mangosteen. Mangosteen pericarp extract has shown efficacy in the reduction of cholesterol levels and lipidic peroxidation, besides improving the kidney structure and function in fastening diabetic rats [

 <xref rid="B157-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. The hypoglycemic power is due to the inhibition of the activity of α-glucosidase and α-amylase: the enzymes responsible for the digestion of carbohydrates [
