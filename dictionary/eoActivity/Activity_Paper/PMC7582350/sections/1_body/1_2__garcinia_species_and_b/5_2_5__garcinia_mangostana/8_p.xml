<p>A study on rats fed daily with an aqueous extract of mangosteen pericarp (100 and 200 mg/kg, 38 days) showed that they exhibited significant improvements in memory loss. The extract, rich in xanthones, was also capable of restoring acetylcholinesterase activity in the dysfunction induced by lead in red blood cells and brain tissue. The presence of the xanthones α- and γ-mangostin (
