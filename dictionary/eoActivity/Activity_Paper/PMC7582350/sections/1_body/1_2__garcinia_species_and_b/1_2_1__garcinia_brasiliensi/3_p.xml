<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic> leaves at concentrations of 30 and 300 mg/kg demonstrated anti-inflammatory action in rats and antinociceptive action in mice, corroborating the traditional use of species of 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic> against inflammation of the urinary tract and inflammatory pains such as arthrosis. The biflavonoids procyanidin (
 <bold>8</bold>), fukugetin (
 <bold>9</bold>), amentoflavone (
 <bold>10</bold>), and podocarpusflavone A (
 <bold>11</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic>, represent a therapeutic strategy to control diseases related to oxidative stress, controlling inflammation and reducing the harmful effects of reactive species of oxygen (ROSs). Furthermore, biflavonoids have exhibited potent inhibition of the oxidative hemolysis and lipidic peroxidation induced by 2,2â€²-azobis amidinopropane (AAPH) in human erythrocytes, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of the compounds present in
