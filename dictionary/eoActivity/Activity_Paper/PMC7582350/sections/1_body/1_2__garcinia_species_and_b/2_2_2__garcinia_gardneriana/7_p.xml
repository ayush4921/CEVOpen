 <bold>24</bold>), and Gb-2a-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucose (
 <bold>26</bold>) were submitted to an in vitro trial in order to evaluate their modulatory effects on aromatase, utilized for cancer treatment. The results showed that all biflavonoids were able to inhibit the enzyme, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values varying from 1.35 to 7.67 Î¼M. This demonstrates that these biflavonoids are a relevant source of new aromatase inhibitors, with focus on the development of new anticancer agents. This reinforces that the species is an important source of bioactive compounds, with applications concentrated mainly in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancers [
