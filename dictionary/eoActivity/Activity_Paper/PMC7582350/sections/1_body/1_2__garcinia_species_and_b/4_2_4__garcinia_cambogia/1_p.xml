 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The fruit contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA; 
 <bold>30</bold>) and is a popular ingredient utilized for weight reduction [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Semwal [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] presented a revision of the species, citing the presence of organic acids, such as HCA, in the fruits, as well as the xanthones oxy-guttiferone-I (
 <bold>40</bold>), -K (
 <bold>41</bold>), -K2 (
 <bold>42</bold>), and -M(
 <bold>43</bold>), and the benzophenones guttiferone-I (
 <bold>44</bold>), -J (45), -K (
 <bold>46</bold>), -N(
 <bold>47</bold>), and -M (
 <bold>48</bold>). Guttiferone-K (
 <bold>46</bold>) and guttiferone-M (
 <bold>48</bold>) are inhibitors of topoisomerase II [
