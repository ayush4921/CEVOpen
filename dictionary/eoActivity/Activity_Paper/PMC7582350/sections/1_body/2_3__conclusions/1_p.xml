<p>Plant species of the genus 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic> are a relevant source of bioactive compounds. This review compiled the bioactive compounds found in five species of the genus 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic>, as well as the effects of several types of extracts of different plant parts. Plants from genus 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic> exhibits healing properties with anti-inflammatory effects, for the treatment of such ailments as skin disorders, wounds, pain, and infections, as well as presenting antinociceptive, antioxidant, antitumoral, antifungal, anticancer, antihistaminic, antiulcerogenic, antimicrobial, antiviral, vasodilatory, hypolipemic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective properties. It was possible to observe that, across all the species mentioned in the present review, most of the studies carried out were in vitro experiments. Some tests have already been started in in vivo models; however, these are recent studies evaluating the effectiveness of the plant in treating diseases in animal models. These studies are promising and open up new perspectives on the use of the compounds present in these species, offering new perspectives on the possibility of developing new drugs. For this to be effective, it is necessary to initiate plant-use tests in humans, in order to analyze their effectiveness in treating diseases. Therefore, considering the high number of compounds found in plants of the genus and their beneficial effects, additional studies are required to support the development of new products with therapeutic properties for the prevention and treatment of various diseases; most importantly, non-transmissible chronic diseases. Therefore, these plants provide a promising potential source of natural biomolecules for pharmaceutical and medicinal applications.
