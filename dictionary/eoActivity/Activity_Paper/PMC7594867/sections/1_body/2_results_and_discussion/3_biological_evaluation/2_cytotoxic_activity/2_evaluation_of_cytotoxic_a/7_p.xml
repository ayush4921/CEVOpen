<p>The 4-fluorophenyl urea derivatives 
 <bold>18a–c</bold> showed moderate to potent cytotoxic activities against the three cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.19–10.76 μM). Among these derivatives compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> was the most active against MCF-7 cells. Moreover, compound 
 <bold>18c</bold> exhibited higher cytotoxic activities towards MCF-7 and A2780 cell lines compared to the hexyl 
 <bold>16c</bold> and methoxyphenyl 
 <bold>17c</bold> analogues,
