<p>In the current study, compounds

 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold>, the most active in cytotoxic assay (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were selected to evaluate for their inhibitory activity against CDK-2 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>. The assay was performed using Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-Glo
 <sup>TM</sup> kinase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the previous report
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>45</sup>
 </xref>. Briefly, the ability of CDK-2 to convert ATP to ADP was used as a measure of the kinase activity. The inhibition in activity of the kinase was determined after treatment with the test compounds relative to the control (DMSO, 5%). Staurosporine was used as positive control. The results of this assay are presented as IC
 <sub>50</sub> in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.
