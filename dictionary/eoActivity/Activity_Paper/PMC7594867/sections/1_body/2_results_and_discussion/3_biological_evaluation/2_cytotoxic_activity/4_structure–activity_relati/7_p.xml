<p>Replacement of urea oxygen in compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> by sulphur yielded compound 
 <bold>20a</bold> with higher cytotoxicity against A2780 cells but lower cytotoxic activities towards HT29 cells. Substitution on ring A of compound 
 <bold>20a</bold> with the 4-CH
 <sub>3</sub>/Cl groups resulted in weaker cytotoxic activities against the three cancer cell lines,
