<p>The bulkier size of compounds 
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> compared to compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> could account even partially to their higher affinities and higher inhibitory activities towards CDK-2. In addition, the higher binding affinities of compounds 
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> compared to compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> could be due to higher number and/or stronger hydrogen bonding interactions compared to compound 
 <bold>18b</bold>. Moreover, each of the two compounds (
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold>) exhibited one electrostatic interaction of pi-anion type which was absent with compound 
 <bold>18b</bold>. these findings could account even partially for the higher inhibitory activity of compounds 
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> compared to compound 
 <bold>18b</bold>.
