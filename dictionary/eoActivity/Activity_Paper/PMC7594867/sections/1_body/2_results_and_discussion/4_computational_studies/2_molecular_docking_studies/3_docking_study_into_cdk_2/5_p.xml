<p>Compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> exhibited three conventional hydrogen bonds with Leu83 (2 HBs) and Gln131 with bond length in the range of 1.80–2.93 Å, 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The pyrrolidine ring in compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> also formed one carbon hydrogen bond with Asp145. Compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> also showed one pi-anion interaction with Asp145 and a cluster of hydrophobic interactions with Val18, Ala31, Val64, Phe80, Leu134, and Ala144, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>. These binding mode and interactions of compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> with CDK-2 could account for its high inhibitory activity against CDK-2.
