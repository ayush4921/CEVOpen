<p>Initially, the validation of the docking procedures into the active site of CDK-2 was performed. The native ligand, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (LZ9) was re-docked into the active site of CDK-2. The results revealed superposition of the re-docked ligand 
 <bold>3</bold> over the position of the co-crystallized ligand with RMSD of 0.75 Å (

 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> revealed nice fitting into CDK-2 with binding free energy in the range of −9.16 to −9.77 kcal/mol. The binding affinities of the three compounds towards CDK-2 was also higher than that of the native ligand LZ9,
