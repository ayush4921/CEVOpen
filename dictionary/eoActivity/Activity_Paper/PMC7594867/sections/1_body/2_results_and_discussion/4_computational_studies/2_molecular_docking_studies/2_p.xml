<p>To identify the potential mechanism of action and understand the results of the CDK-2 inhibitory assay (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), a molecular docking study was performed into the active site of CDK-2 protein. The study was performed to evaluate the binding free energies (affinities) and inhibition constants of the new compounds into CDK-2. The crystal structure of CDK-2 protein (pdb: 2VTP)
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
