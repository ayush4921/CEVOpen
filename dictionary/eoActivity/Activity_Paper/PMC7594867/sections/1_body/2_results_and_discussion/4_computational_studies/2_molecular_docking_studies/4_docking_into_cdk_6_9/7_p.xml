<p>The tested compounds 
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> exhibited higher binding affinities (ΔG
 <sub>b</sub> = −9.81 to −10.40 kcal/mol) towards CDK-9 compared to the native ligand, CAN508 (ΔG
 <sub>b</sub> = −6.29 kcal/mol). The high affinities of the new compounds could be attributed to their bulkier size compared to CAN508 which allow them to occupy larger volume of the active site in CDK-9.
