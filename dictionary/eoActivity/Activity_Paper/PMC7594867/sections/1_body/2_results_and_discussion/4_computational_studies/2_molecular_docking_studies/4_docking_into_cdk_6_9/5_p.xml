<p>The results of the docking study into CDK-6 revealed good fitting of the three compounds with binding free energy in the range of −9.84 to −10.52 kcal/mol compared to −11.54 for palbociclib. Among the three pyrrolizines, the 4-fluorophenyl urea 
 <bold>19a</bold> displayed the highest affinity towards CDKs-6, while compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> showed the lowest binding free energy, Table 6.
