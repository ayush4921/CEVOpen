<p>In the current work, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening of the compound library was performed using the 3â€‰D pharmacophore model of the multi-CDKI 
 <bold>3</bold>. The virtual screening was done using Pharmit (

 </xref>. First, the pdb file of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (LZ9) bound to CDK-2 (pdb: 2VTP) was selected in the user interface. After loading the protein file, the program identified all the pharmacophoric features in the ligand (LZ9) based on the recorded ligand-protein interactions. This features included the aromatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, and positively/negatively charged moieties,

 <bold>3</bold> which participate in the interactions with amino acids in the active site of CDK-2 were selected to generate the pharmacophoric model. These features included the aromatic phenyl, pyrazole ring (hydrophobic), and imidazole N

 <sub>A2</sub>),
