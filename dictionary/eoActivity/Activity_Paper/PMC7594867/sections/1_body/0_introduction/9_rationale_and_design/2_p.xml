<p>Previously, we reported compound 
 <bold>10</bold> among a series of pyrrolizine-5-carboxamide derivatives with potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>23</sup>
 </xref>. Although compound 
 <bold>10</bold> was able to activate caspase 3/7 in MCF-7 cells, but the exact mechanism of action of this compound was not investigated. Recently, we reported different pyrrolizine derivatives with weak to moderate inhibitory activities against 20 oncogenic kinases

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>25</sup>
 </xref>. Among these kinases, CDK-2 was the most affected one by all the tested compounds.
