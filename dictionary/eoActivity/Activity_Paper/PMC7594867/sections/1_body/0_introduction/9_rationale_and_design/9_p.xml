<p>Based on the above results, the SAR study of scaffold A was achieved through the following modifications in compound 
 <bold>10</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>): (i) replacement of the 4-chlorophenyl moiety by naphthalen-1-yl moiety; (ii) replacement of the urea moiety in the naphthalenyl derivatives by thiourea; (iii) replacement of the chloro group in compound 
 <bold>10</bold> with electron donating (R
 <sub>2</sub> = 4-OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) or the electron withdrawing (R
 <sub>2</sub> = 4-F) groups to study the impact of electronic effect of these substituents on cytotoxicity of the new compounds; (iv) replacement of the 4-chlorophenyl in compound 
 <bold>10</bold> moiety by the aliphatic hexyl group to compare the impact of the aliphatic versus aromatic (phenyl/naphthalenyl) moieties on cytotoxic activity of the new compounds; (v) substitution on ring A with electron donating (R
 <sub>1</sub> = 4-CH
 <sub>3</sub>) or with electron withdrawing (R
 <sub>1</sub> = 4-Cl) to study the impact of these substituents on activity.
