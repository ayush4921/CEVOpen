<p>Moreover, the pharmacophore-based virtual screening was used widely in different steps of the drug discovery process. This technique depends on the generation of a 3D pharmacophore model based on a set of active ligands, a targetâ€“ligand complex or the apo target. The generated pharmacophore can then be used in screening virtual libraries of molecules to select/optimise the lead compounds
