<p>Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany. All solvents were analytical grade and were used without purification. Melting points (m.p.) were determined by IA 9100MK digital melting point apparatus. TLC was used to check the purity of the new compounds. the IR spectra were recorded by BRUKER TENSOR 37 spectrophotometer using KBr disc. The IR spectra were expressed in wavenumber (cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, 
 <sup>13 </sup>C-NMR, and DEPT C
 <sup>135</sup> spectra were recorded in the Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, KSA using BRUKER AVANCE III at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. The 
 <italic>J</italic> constant was given in Hz. Shimadzu GCMS QP5050A spectrometer (EI, 70 eV, regional centre for mycology and biotechnology, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt) was used to perform the mass analyses of the new compounds. The quantitative elemental analyses were done in the microanalytical centre, Cairo University. Compounds
