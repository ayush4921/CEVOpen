<p id="Par11">This study was conducted at the Experimental Field, College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, during two 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> growing seasons in 2014 and 2015. The plant material applied was 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch, which is planted widely in the semiarid and saline regions of Northwest China. The records for the study area show that in this region, the mean annual precipitation is 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 °C. Moreover, the average annual sunshine hours range from 2800 to 3000 h, and the frost-free period is approximately 185 days. The physical and chemical properties of the basic soil were determined and analyzed before the experiment, and the results showed that the soil profiles could meet the requirements of the test. Soil profiles in the experimental plots consist of initial Si, total soluble salt, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, available nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium.
