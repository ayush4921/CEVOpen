 </sup>. Approximately 100 mg of finely ground plant sample was placed in a nickel crucible, and NaOH was added to each crucible at a high burning temperature for 15 min. The high temperature, however, oxidized all the organic matter present and solubilized the Si in the muffle furnace when kept for approximately 2 h. Discoloration development was achieved by adding 35 ml of 20% acetic acid to 10 ml of ammonium molybdate solution, 5 ml of 20% tartaric acid, 1 ml of reducing solution and 20% acetic acid in a volume of 50 ml. After mixing, the optical density was read at 630 nm with a spectrophotometer.
