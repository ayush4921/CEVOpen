<p id="Par13">Soils from the licorice planting base were collected from the farmer’s field and mixed with organic fertilizer after sieving. Plastic flowerpots 30 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height were filled with 20 kg of soil each on April 7, 2014. The 12 flowerpots were arranged on a plot and replicated three times in each of the two growing seasons. An alley of 35 cm was created to permit convenient management of the flowerpots. To create good transplant conditions for licorice, soils in the flowerpots were irrigated 4 times, 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening, at regular time intervals from April 10 to 12. Quantitatively, 2000 ml of water was used to irrigate the soil before transplanting. Eight (8) licorice seedlings that were healthy and of the same size were selected for transplantation into flowerpots on April 13.</p>
