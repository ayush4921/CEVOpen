<p id="Par16">Sucrose phosphate synthase was assayed in a mixed solution contained 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mM), EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mM), β-hydrophobic base ethanol (10 mM), 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone and 2% ethylene glycol, and the 0.3 ml of sample. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 ℃. And 200 µl of 30% (w/v) KOH added to stop the reactions at 0 and 30 min. Putting the tubes incubated for a further 10 min at 95 ℃ to destroy any unreacted hexose phosphates. After cooling, adding mixture of anthrone reagent (in H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>), the absorbance was measured at wavelength 620 nm following a procedure modified from Orathai et al
