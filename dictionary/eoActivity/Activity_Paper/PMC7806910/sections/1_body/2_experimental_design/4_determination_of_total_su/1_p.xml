 </sup>. The powder sample (0.0500 g) was extracted in an ultrasonic bath with 80% ethanol for 90 min at 40 °C and then diluted to a 10 ml volumetric flask, and the supernatant was the sample extract. Forty microliters of extract contained 0.5 ml of 5% phenol solution; then, 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 490 nm was measured.
