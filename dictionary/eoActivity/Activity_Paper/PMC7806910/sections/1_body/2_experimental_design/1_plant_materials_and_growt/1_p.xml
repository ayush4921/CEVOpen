<p id="Par12">The experiment was randomly arranged and consisted of three salt treatments (3, 6 and 9 g NaCl/kg dry soil such as 21, 42 and 63 ds/m (NaCl)) and four Si concentration treatments (Si source using K
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>3</sub> as a treatment factor, with amounts of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 g SiO
 <sub>2</sub>/kg dry soil such as 0, 1.4, 2.8, and 4.2 ds/m (SiO
 <sub>2</sub>)). There were twelve treatments (3 salt treatments × 4 Si concentrations) with three replications. The salt treatments are denoted as Na
 <sub>1</sub>, Na
 <sub>2</sub> and Na
 <sub>3</sub>, while the Si concentrations are denoted as Si
 <sub>0</sub>, Si
 <sub>1</sub>, Si
 <sub>2</sub> and Si
 <sub>3</sub>. In the experiment, the K
 <sup>+</sup> concentration introduced by K
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>3</sub> was used to maintain the consistency of the K
 <sup>+</sup> concentration and prevent the difference in seed osmotic pressure due to the difference in K
 <sup>+</sup> concentration, while the nutrient effect on the plant by Cl
 <sup>−</sup> was negligible when the Cl
 <sup>−</sup> concentration was low

 </sup>. The soil was first put into the flowerpot after thorough mixing with NaCl, KCl and K
 <sub>2</sub>SiO
 <sub>3</sub>. The annual licorice seedlings were transplanted into flowerpots in a general trend with a consistent management practice in April 2014. Each flowerpot consisted of eight (8) strains of licorice seedlings. After transplanting, the licorice was quantitatively irrigated once (1) every seven (7) days. The pot experiment was conducted in open air to enable plants to adapt to local climatic conditions. After growing for 105 days, from mid-July to mid-October, 3 sampling frequencies (vegetative growing, flowering, maturity) were carried out. Plants were collected as samples to determine growth parameters and physiological and biochemical characteristics. From mid-July to mid-October, 3 sampling frequencies were carried out. All treatments for salt and Si were supplemented in April in the subsequent year. Si
 <sub>0</sub> was used as a control to measure the indexes.
