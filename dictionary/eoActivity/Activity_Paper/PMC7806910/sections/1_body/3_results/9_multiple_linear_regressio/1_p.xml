<p id="Par37">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, the abscissa coordinates represent the content of Si at different times. The determination times were July 20, August 20, October 20, 2014, and July 20, August 30, and October 10, 2015, and the Si contents (%) were 1.23, 1.98, 2.29, 2.64, 3.56 and 4.29, respectively. From August 2014 to July 2015, the accumulation of Si in licorice roots remained basically unchanged and increased rapidly starting in August 2015, which was basically synchronized with the accumulation of dry weight per plant in the figure. Multiple linear regression analysis of Si content and dry weight per licorice root plant was carried out, and the regression equation was obtained. When the concentration of Si was 4.00946%, the dry weight per plant of licorice root reached the maximum, which was 10.92946 g.
