<p id="Par30">The dry matter content, Si content and carbon and nitrogen metabolites in the roots of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> were analyzed by SPSS path analysis. The independent variables were set as follows: Y
 <sub>1</sub>: dry matter mass per plant (g), X
 <sub>1</sub>: Si content in root, X
 <sub>2</sub>: total sugar and X
 <sub>3</sub>: total nitrogen. The stepwise regression equation and partial correlation coefficient are as follows: Y
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.328X
 <sub>1</sub> + 0.029X
 <sub>2</sub> + 2.742X
 <sub>3</sub> + 1.062, F = 39.434. The direct and indirect effects of the above factors on yield were obtained by path analysis with dry matter per plant of licorice, as shown in Tables
