 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Si significantly increased the content of total nitrogen in roots under salt stress. And the content of total nitrogen showed an increasing trend, which increased gradually with stress time. The content of total nitrogen was significantly increased in Si
 <sub>2</sub> or Si
 <sub>3</sub>. Adding Si under salt stress resulted in maximum increases recorded in both years about 27.18% to 38.74%, compared with the control.
