<p id="Par25">The results show that Si can increase GS and NR enzyme activity in 2 years, as shown in Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The NR and GS activities were significantly increased in leaves after adding Si under salt stress. The maximum activity was recorded at 2.8 ds/m Si treatment, and the GS and NR activities were increased by 163.34% and 42.02%, respectively, compared with those of the control. The increase in added Si under salt stress was more severe for GS activity than NR activity. Under salt stress, the activities of GS and NR were significantly increased in leaves after adding Si in both years. The activities of these enzymes showed an upward trend with increasing duration of salt treatment and Si content.
