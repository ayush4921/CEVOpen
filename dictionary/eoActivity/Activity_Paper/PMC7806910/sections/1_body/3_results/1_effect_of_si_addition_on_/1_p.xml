<p id="Par23">In this experiment, we found significant increases in SS and SPS activities between + Si treatments. The significant effect was concentration-dependent (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The activities of SS and SPS in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> leaves were significantly decreased after NaCl was added compared to those in plants grown with Na
 <sub>1</sub> (CK). However, SS activity was significantly intensified with Si
 <sub>2</sub> over the experimental period compared to plants grown without Si (Si
 <sub>0</sub>) in both years. SPS activity was significantly intensified also with Si
 <sub>2</sub> in both years, mostly after treatment, compared to plants grown without Si.
