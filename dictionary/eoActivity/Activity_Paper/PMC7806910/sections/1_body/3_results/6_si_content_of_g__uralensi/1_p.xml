 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, under the different treatments, the contents of Si in the roots, stems and leaves were different, but the content of Si reached a maximum with the Si
 <sub>3</sub> treatment and was significantly larger than that with the Si
 <sub>0</sub> treatment. Additionally, the accumulation of Si in the root was smaller, and the content of Si was highest in the leaves.
