<p id="Par29">As Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> indicates, we performed a correlative analysis between 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> dry weight of the root and the enzyme activity in C and N metabolism as well as C and N metabolites; the result showed a strong innate connection between the 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> dry weight of the root and each index. The largest influences are conferred by root Si content and leaf total nitrogen of 
 <italic>G. uralensis.</italic> According to the correlation coefficient, the different metabolites showed apparent positive correlations with related enzyme activity.
