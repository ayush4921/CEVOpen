<p id="Par38">Under salt stress, the enzymes of C and N metabolism were significantly altered, and these harmful effects decreased plant growth. C and N metabolism are basic metabolic processes in the growth and development of plants that ensure the normal growth and development of crops and the yield and quality

 </sup>. When salt stress were 21 and 42 ds/m, the activity of the carbon metabolizing enzymes SPS and SS in the leaves of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> significantly increased in Si
 <sub>1</sub> and Si
 <sub>2</sub>. The activities of SPS and SS enzymes were stronger in Si
 <sub>2</sub> and Si
 <sub>3</sub> under high salt stress. Thus, it can be seen that Si may act as a signaling factor redirecting the primary metabolism of plants by increased the SS and SPS enzyme activity, allowing synthesis and accumulation of carbon metabolites. Although adding Si had no remarkable influence on the products of metabolism, Si enhanced the content of total sugar under NaCl stress when its concentration was 42 ds/m. it may enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress under salt deficiency. Therefore, adding Si regulated processes including C and N metabolism of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> under stress, which would significantly increase enzyme activity, alleviate stress damage, and increase the synthesis and accumulation of metabolite production. The synthesis and accumulation of metabolite production reflecting the tolerance of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> to osmotic stress. Our investigation reveals an important role of Si in C and N metabolism under salt stress. Therefore, by adding a suitable concentration of Si and allowing pertinent regulation of enzymatic reactions and C, N metabolism promotes the coordination of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> development and all metabolic activities and increases yield and quality.
