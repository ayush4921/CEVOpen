<p id="Par40">Si is beneficial mostly for higher plants, especially under stressful environments, and the addition of Si to the growth medium resulted in significantly higher Si accumulation in plant tissues observed a significant decrease in Si content of tomato roots under salt stress, indicating that salt stress significantly affected the accumulation of Si

 </sup>. The experiment was conducted to determine Si accumulation in different parts of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> primarily to determine the distribution of Si in plants. In the present study, the concentrations of Si in plants were higher than those without Si treatment under the same NaCl stress. The study also found that the content of Si in the leaves was far greater than that in the roots. These results indicated that leaves and roots differ in their abilities to accumulate Si. Also, the beneficial effects provided by Si are closely correlated with the Si accumulation level in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> plants. The content of Si was higher in shoot, probably due to Si-enhanced biomass production. Therefore, we conclude that 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> is taken up Si in below-ground parts, and most part is translocated to the shoot. The beneficial effects provided by Si are closely correlated with the Si accumulation level in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> plants, which may be an adaptive mechanism for 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> to moderate salt stress by taking up and transporting more Si, further promoting plant growth under salt stress.
