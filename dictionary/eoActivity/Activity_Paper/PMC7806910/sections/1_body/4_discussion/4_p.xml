 </sup>. The results of this study indicate that the quality and yield of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> were significantly increased. The dry weight of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> roots was increased by 12.8â€“64.07% by adding Si under different concentrations of NaCl stress. Si can diminish the inhibitory effect of salt stress on plant growth. Additionally, correlative analysis between 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> dry weight of roots and the enzyme activity in C and N metabolism as well as C and N metabolites shows that the root Si content has the biggest influence on the dry weight of roots. These results indicated that Si can increase enzyme activities and provoke the accumulation of metabolites in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> plants. All these results indicate that Si is indispensable and important for 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> under salt stress, and is taken up by the roots, transported via the xylem in the transpiration stream and distributed within plant tissues. In leaf sheaths and leaf blades silicic acid polymerizes into amorphous silica, which is deposited into the cell wall, cell lumen, intracellular spaces and trichomes increasing tissue strength, which might improve the structure of plant leaves to alleviate damage to the photosynthetic system under NaCl stress in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic>. Further research on the possible mechanisms of Si uptake and transport in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> is extremely important to utilize Si-induced beneficial effects, which need further research in the future.
