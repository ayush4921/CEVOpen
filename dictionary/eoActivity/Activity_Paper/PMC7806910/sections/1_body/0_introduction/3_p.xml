<p id="Par9">It is well known that C and N metabolism are very sensitive to environmental stress and closely related to nearly every biochemical pathway, as these elements are essential for plant growth and development

GS, NR, SS and SPS are the key enzymes catalyzing metabolites such as sugars, and proteins play important roles in C and N metabolic processes. Furthermore, salt stress significantly decreases the key enzyme activities, which are involved in the regulation of metabolism
