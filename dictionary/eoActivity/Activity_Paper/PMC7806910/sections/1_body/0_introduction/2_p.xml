<p id="Par8">Recently, the progresses and mechanisms of Si in alleviating various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants have been systematically reviewed by several researchers. Hence, an alternative strategy of Si supplementation to overcome the negative effects of salinity in plants can be considered as a valuable approach

 </sup>. Although our understanding of the role of Si in abiotic stress resistance is still limited, there have been many important advances in its ability to alleviate salt and water stress, metal toxicity, and other adverse effects on plants

 </sup> demonstrate that Si can enhance the survivability of crops under stress, such as grains, fruits, and vegetable crops. Zhang et al. confirmed the possible utility of Si in medicinal plants under salt stress and that the application of Si to medicinal plants can alleviate salinity stress
