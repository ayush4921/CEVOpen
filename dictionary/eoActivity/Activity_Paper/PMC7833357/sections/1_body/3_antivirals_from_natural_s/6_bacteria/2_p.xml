<p id="p0195">Therapeutic agents from natural resources, particularly bacteria are considered pivotal alternatives of commercially available synthetic drugs. Advancements in genomic technology (identify secondary metabolite gene clusters) and analytical techniques (isolation and purification of compounds) have led the drug discovery approaches to identify novel compounds with antiviral ability. Few noteworthy antiviral drugs isolated so far include surfactins from
