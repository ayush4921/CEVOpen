<p id="p0170">A sulphated polysaccharide from 
 <italic>Agaricus brasiliensis</italic> against HSV-1 and 2, two proteins namely neutral protein bound polysaccharide, acidic protein bound polysaccharide, and triterpenes and laccases of 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> exhibited anti-HIV-1 protease activity and anti-HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity (
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). GFAHP, a protein from 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> inhibited replication of HSV-1(

 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. ZJ-2008003, extracted from 
 <italic>Sarcophyton</italic> sp. produced tetrahydroaltersolanols C-F and dihydrosolanol A and alterporriols N-R. Tetrahydroaltersolanol C and alterporriol Q showed antiviral activities against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. 11a-Dehydroxyisoterreulactone A from 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> possessed weak antiviral activity against HSV-1 virus. Aspergilli peptides D and E showed inhibitory activities towards HSV-1. Asperterrestide A displayed antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 Influenza virus. 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. derived from 
 <italic>Muricellaabnormalis</italic>, on fermentation yielded 22-O-(
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-L-valyl)-21-epiaflaquinolone B. It exhibited antiviral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus. Isobutyrolactone II, obtained from another strain of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. expressed strong antiviral activity towards HSV-1(
