The DAAs constitute a combination of simeprevir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, sofosbuvir, and dasabuvir. The proper intake of food along with the drugs had a great effect (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral potentialities against various groups of viruses. Bioactive agents from natural resources have established a great foundation for designing new therapeutic drugs. It is certainly essential to understand the nature, source of origin, and role of identified active agents as therapeutics. Considering this, the present comprehensive review overviews the effectiveness of antiviral components present in various natural sources (plants, fungi, and prokaryotes) in order to identify potential antiviral agents for developing alternative therapy in future.
