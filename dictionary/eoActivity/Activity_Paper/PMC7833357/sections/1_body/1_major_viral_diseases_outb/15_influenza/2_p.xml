<p id="p0115">Influenza viruses are significant due to its unavailing presence in the past centuries. The virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Three forms namely A, B, and C infect human. Influenza A and B viruses cause relatively high morbidity and mortality compared to the C type. These are enveloped viruses that encompass segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA. The gene structure contains surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). Based on the types of HA and NA, a total of 16 HA (H1–16) and 9 NA (N1–9) subtypes are identified in birds. Recent outbreaks in humans contain subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 that are reported to be endemic. The zoonotic spread from birds and swine includes H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. These have the capabilities to mutate into new forms and produce severe pathological effects (

The diagnostic method comprises influenza-specific RNA by RT-PCR. Treatment includes NA and HA inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies (
