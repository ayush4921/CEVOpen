<p id="p0120">MERS-CoV is a zoonotic viral respiratory disease that has infected people with a high mortality rate of nearly 50% in the Middle East (first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012). The disease is alleged to be contracted from infected camels. Coronaviruses possess enveloped single stranded RNA that is spherical in shape with glycoprotein projections. The genome shows presence of two ORFs namely ORF 1a and 1b coding for non-structural proteins. Structural proteins encode the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Symptoms include mild respiratory disease to severe acute respiratory disease and death. Severe illness can lead to the respiratory failure and may weaken the immune systems, especially with those with renal diseases, cancer, lung diseases, and diabetes. RT-PCR assay has been used as a diagnostic tool to detect the virus. At present, no vaccine or precise treatment is available (
