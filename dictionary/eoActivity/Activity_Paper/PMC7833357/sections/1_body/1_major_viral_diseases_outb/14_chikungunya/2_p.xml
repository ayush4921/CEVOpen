<p id="p0110">Chikungunya, an epidemic threat in the recent years is a mosquito-borne disease in the tropical regions. It is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a pathogen of the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> and the family Togaviridae. These are otherwise known as arboviruses as they are arthropod-borne viruses. CHIKV is similar to other alphaviruses including Sindbis viruses and Ross River viruses. Three distinct genotypes including Asian, West African, and East Central South African have been observed so far. CHIKV holds a positive sense single stranded RNA of ~12 kb genome length. The genome analysis revealed that the viral comprise two ORFs. The 5′ORF encodes the nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 non-structural proteins, and the 3′ORF encodes capsid (C), envelope (E1 and E2), and two peptides (E3 and 6K) (

The symptoms include fever, arthralgia, rarely causing cardiac, ophthalmic, and neurological disorders. Diagnostic assays include ELISA, IgM antibody levels, and PCR. Treatment includes anti-rheumatic drugs but no vaccines have been discovered yet.
