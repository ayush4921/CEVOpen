<p id="p0075">Human papilloma virus disease is a sexually transmitted infection which causes cervical cancer and genital warts. Among various types of HPV, type 16 and 18 are responsible for causing cervical cancer and HPV 6 and 11 cause genital warts. It mostly affects woman and is transmitted through skin to skin contact and infects vagina or anal intercourse. Cervical cancer can be detected by papanicolaou testing; hence changes in squamous epithelium cells should be noted. The changes observed on the abnormal cells are referred as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Depending on the depth of the abnormal cells, it can be classified into 3 types (CIN-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3). CIN-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3 show mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia, respectively.
