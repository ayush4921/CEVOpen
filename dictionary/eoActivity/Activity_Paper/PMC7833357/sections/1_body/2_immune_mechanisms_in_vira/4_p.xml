<p id="p0140">The complement system of the innate immunity includes several factors and cell surface proteins that invoke immune response to the pathogens (
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Carroll, 2004</xref>). Three pathways of complement system are i) classical pathway (viral antigens bound with IgM and IgG interact with C1q and activates 2 serine proteases C1r and C1s, that further cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b to form the C3 convertase-C4bC2a) ii) alternate pathway (triggered by the hydrolysis of C3 that binds to protease factor B. This is cleaved by Factor D to form Bb in order to end the formation of C3 convertase-C4bC2a), and iii) lectin pathway (antigenic substances initiate mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the ficolins. It forms a complex with MBL-associated serine proteases and cleaves C4 and C2 proteins to form C3 convertase-C4bC2a). These pathways regulate and activate complement factors and unite to form the major C3 component involved in virus pathogenesis (

The innate, complement, and the adaptive immune responses are interlinked and are activated by the varying mechanisms, depending on the type of infecting viral particles leading to reduced pathogenesis, regulate inflammatory conditions, and modulating adaptive responses (
