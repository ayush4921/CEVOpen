<p>Pharmacovigilance for herbal medicines: Modern times rely more on the systematically studied modern medicines as they must adhere to stringent national and international regulations also. On the other hand, traditional systems of medicine suffer from a lack of or inadequate regulatory guidelines. In addition, herbal medicines are widely perceived to be safe due to their natural origins. However, as reviewed above, several herbal medicines exhibit adverse effects on their own or due to adverse herbâ€“drug interactions with concomitant medicines. Apart from these inherent risks of herbal medicines, several adverse effects associated with them may be due to improper labeling, unknown composition, a lack of standardization, inferior quality, contamination, adulteration, improper use and even quackery.</p>
