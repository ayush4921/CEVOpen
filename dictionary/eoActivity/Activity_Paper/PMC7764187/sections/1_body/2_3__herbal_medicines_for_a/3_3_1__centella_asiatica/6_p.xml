<p>Triterpenoids are the major active component of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, which consists of many chemical constituents such as asiatic acid, mecadessic acid, asiaticoside, scentellin, asiaticin and centellicin [

The exact constituent responsible for cognition enhancing effects of the herb remains to be established. However, studies suggest that perhaps triterpene saponins present in the leaf improve cognitive function by influencing central neurotransmitters.
