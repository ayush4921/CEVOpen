<p>Preclinical studies: Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg doses given orally for 14 days has been reported to dose-dependently improve cognitive functions in normal rats [
 <xref rid="B52-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Pretreatment with the extract for 21 days significantly reversed streptozotocin induced cognitive impairment [
 <xref rid="B51-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors attributed the beneficial effect of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> to antioxidant activity as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde, increase in glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase levels. A study by Rao et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] demonstrated that 15 days treatment with 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> at a dose of 200 mg/kg from day 15 to 30 postpartum stimulated learning and memory in rats, which lasted for at least 6 months postpartum. They also observed an increase in dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA3 neurons, which may be one reason for improvement in brain function. Another study showed improved cognitive outcome in elderly subjects following prescribed dose of 500 mg/b.i.d dried 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> for a 6-month period [
 <xref rid="B54-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Dhanasekaran et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] found that an 8 month treatment with 2.5 mg/kg of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> significantly decreased amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 levels in the hippocampus of PSAPP transgenic mice expressing “Swedish” amyloid precursor protein and M146L presenilin 1 mutations, which result in spontaneous amyloid beta plaque formation. A reduction in Congo red stained fibrillar amyloid plaques was detected on the long-term treatment with 5.0 mg/kg dose.
