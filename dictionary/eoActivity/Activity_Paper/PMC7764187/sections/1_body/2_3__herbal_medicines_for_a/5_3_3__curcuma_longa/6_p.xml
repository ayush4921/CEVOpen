<p>Curcumin has been shown to reduce both in-vivo and in-vitro Aβ plaque deposition [

 <xref rid="B107-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Curcumin treatment for six months significantly decreased the elevated levels of oxidized protein and proinflammatory interleukin-1β in the transgenic APPSw mouse brain (Tg2576) [
 <xref rid="B106-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Plaque formation and the concentration of insoluble and soluble Aβ were also lowered by curcumin in the same study. Pretreatment with curcumin (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg, p.o for 21 days) ameliorated memory impairment in the sporadic AD model in mice [

 <xref rid="B109-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Significant cognitive improvement was documented at low (160 ppm) and high (1000 ppm) doses of curcumin after administration for the 6-month period in the double transgenic AD model (APP/PS1) [

 <xref rid="B111-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Curcumin can inhibit Aβ aggregation or promote its disaggregation at low concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.81–1 μM). Monomeric Aβ formed fewer aggregates in the presence of curcumin, whereas increasing doses of curcumin promoted disassembly of preformed Aβ aggregates. Structurally, curcumin is similar to Congo red and can prevent oligomer formation after binding to plaques and recognize secondary structure in fibrillar and oligomeric Aβ. Low dose curcumin significantly lowered the soluble Aβ levels, insoluble amyloid and plaque burden by nearly 40% [
 <xref rid="B106-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Additionally, curcumin treatment for 7 days caused reduction in plaques burden and reversed structural changes in dystrophic dendrites in APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD [
