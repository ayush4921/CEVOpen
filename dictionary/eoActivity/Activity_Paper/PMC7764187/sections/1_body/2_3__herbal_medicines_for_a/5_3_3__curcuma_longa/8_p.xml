<p>Curcumin suppressed the microgliosis in neuronal layers, but it failed to reduce within plaques microgliosis and even significantly increased microgliosis immediately adjacent to plaques, raising the possibility that it may stimulate microglial phagocytosis of amyloid. Other possible mechanisms for curcumin induced neuroprotective effects include inhibition of IL-1-induced increase in alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (α
 <sub>1</sub>ACT) and NFκB-mediated transcription of apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Both α
