<p>Preclinical studies: Pretreatment with 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg prevented hypoxia induced memory impairment in rats by maintaining the monoamines levels in the brain [

The ethanolic leaf extract at a dose of 250 mg/kg, p.o for 14 days provided protection against cognitive impairment induced by ICV–colchicine. It restored colchicine induced changes in the brain norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine levels [

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> against memory impairment in experimental models of dementia [

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> was shown to mitigate hyperphosphorylation and Aβ pathology also in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced AD in rats [
