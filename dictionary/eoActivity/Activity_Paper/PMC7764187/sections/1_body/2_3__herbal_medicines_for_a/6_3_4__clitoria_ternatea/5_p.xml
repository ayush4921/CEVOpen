<p>Rai et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] described the learning and memory enhancing effect of the 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> root extract during the growth spurt period in rats. They intubated 7-day old neonatal rats and administered 50 and 100 mg/kg of the aqueous root extract of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> for 30 days. The extract improved retention in the passive avoidance task and spatial performance in the T-maze test. The behavioral changes were reported to be long lasting as indicated by a 30 days post-treatment evaluation. A previous study also showed that the aqueous root extract (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o for 30 days) enhanced dendritic arborization of amygdala neurons in rats [

 <xref rid="B139-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] may be one of the reasons for nootropic activity of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> root. In addition, Rai [
 <xref rid="B143-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] reported that the 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> root extract exhibited the neurogenesis-promoting sequel on the anterior subventricular zone of neural stem cells. More recently, Damodaran et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] documented the neuroprotective effect of the 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> root extract in reversing chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced neural damage and memory impairment at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg. In another study, Mehla and colleagues showed anti-AD effects of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> in ICV-STZ induced AD-like conditions in rats [
 <xref rid="B145-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. These observations suggest that 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> extract exerts its beneficial effect by preventing the progression of cognitive deterioration in AD. However, the potential of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> extract still needs to be systematically evaluated for human use.
