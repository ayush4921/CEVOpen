<p>Preclinical studies: The nootropic activity of methanolic extract of aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> (100 mg/kg, p.o) has been reported by using elevated plus maze and the object recognition test in rats [
 <xref rid="B139-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Taranalli and Cheeramkuzhy evaluated the ethanolic extracts of roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> at the dose of 300 and 500 mg/kg, p.o in amnesia induced by submaximal electroshock [
 <xref rid="B140-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. They also estimated the ACh level in the whole brain and different parts of it. The aerial parts extract resulted in improved memory retention and increased brain ACh content, which was more at 300 mg/kg as compared to the 500 mg/kg dose. The root extract exhibited similar but more marked effects, which were almost equal at both doses.
