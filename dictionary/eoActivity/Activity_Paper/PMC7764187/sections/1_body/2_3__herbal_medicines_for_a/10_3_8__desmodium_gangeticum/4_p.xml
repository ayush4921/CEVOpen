<p>Preclinical studies: Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. gangeticum</italic> when administered orally at the dose of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg for 7 days improved memory in mice [

 <xref rid="B199-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Scopolamine and ageing induced amnesias were also prevented in rats by pretreatment with the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. gangeticum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B198-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Moreover, treatment of mice with the chloroform extract (400 mg/kg) and alkaloidal fraction (50 mg/kg) of 
 <italic>D. gangeticum</italic> for 6 days alleviated the scopolamine-induced amnesia [
 <xref rid="B200-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and AChE inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>D. gangeticum</italic> has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B199-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>,
 <xref rid="B201-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>,
 <xref rid="B202-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. These pharmacological properties indicate the potential of 
 <italic>D. gangeticum</italic> in the management of AD related cognitive impairment. Yet, not much clinical evidence is available to this effect. Toxicity studies are also required to establish the safety of this potentially useful herb.
