<p>Cognitive functions that are mainly affected in AD patients include memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial functioning and attention. Several hypotheses have been proposed for establishing the cause of AD. Cholinergic hypothesis, which is the oldest theory, describes acetylcholine (ACh) deficiency as the causative factor [

 <xref rid="B8-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The β-amyloid hypothesis, most cogent hypothesis [

 <xref rid="B10-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] provides the basis for development of new therapeutic strategies for AD treatment [
 <xref rid="B13-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The histopathological hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in the brain [
 <xref rid="B14-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other associated factors that may also contribute to neurodegeneration in AD are elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage and neuroinflammation (

 <xref rid="B15-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have also reported that antioxidants protect against Aβ induced neuronal toxicity [

 <xref rid="B17-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fuzhisan (FZS), a herbal drug, demonstrated a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting Aβ (25–35)-induced activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, calcium influx, calpain activation and tau hyperphosphorylation [
