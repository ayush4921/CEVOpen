<p>PGM complexes have generated widespread interest in drug discovery owing to their diverse biological activities and the ability to interact with biomolecules. The emergence of resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains has spurred the research of these chemical entities as potential, alternative antimalarial regimens to search for candidates with unique modes of action unknown to the malaria parasite. PGM complexes show promise in this regard as demonstrated by their potent antiplasmodial effects against both chemosensitive and drug resistant strains of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite. Incorporation of PGM centres into bioactive ligands enhances their antiplasmodial activity, often with minimal toxicity towards mammalian cells. Remarkably, some PGM complexes do not seem to exhibit cross-resistance in in vitro biological assessment assays, a feat that can be attributed to the presence of metallic centres. While the antiplasmodial activity of most PGM complexes is well-documented in the literature, we also note that there is a great explorative scope regarding the antimalarial activity of organometallic osmium complexes as well as cyclometallated platinum compounds. Like many antimalarial compounds, PGM complexes also possess the ability to disrupt the heme detoxification pathway of the malaria parasite as a mode of action, although this property may be primarily dependent on the nature of the coordinating ligand. The affinity of PGMs for coordinating biomolecules is also illustrated by the Ru(III)Cp* complexes that interact with DNA to induce plasmodial efficacy. The suggested mode of DNA-binding involving stacking interactions with the AT-rich regions unique to plasmodial DNA could allow more specificity for targeting 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> over the human host, paving a way for the design of PGM complexes with enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity to human cells. Application of PGM-based compounds, specifically iridium and rhodium complexes, as NAD
 <sup>+</sup>/NADH hydrogen transfer catalysts highlights the practicality of this approach not only as a novel mechanistic modality in malaria, but also as a viable avenue for lowering the effects of toxicity of antimalarial PGM metallodrugs while retaining the desired therapeutic benefit.
