<p>Platinum is the pioneering metal in the interest of PGM complexes as biological agents for targeting diseases. The activity of platinum complexes goes as far back as the 1960s with the epochal discovery of the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II), commonly known as cisplatin, by Rosenberg and co-workers [

 <bold>79</bold>), shown in
