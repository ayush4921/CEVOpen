<p>Extensive studies have been directed towards evaluating the inhibitory activity of PGM-derived organometallic complexes as potential antimalarial agents against a myriad of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. The same could be said for anticancer research, which has by far received much greater attention than antimalarial research. To this end, there has been a hive of activity among bioorganometallic chemists not only to demonstrate the biological activity of such complexes with cell-based assays, but also in an attempt to elucidate their possible modes of action by which they may exhibit activity. This is a crucial step in the early stages of the drug development pipeline and raises the chances of a drug candidate making it through the clinical assessment phases. For instance, the mode of action of anticancer complexes such as cisplatin and related analogues has been established through thorough mechanistic investigations [

In this section, we draw attention to the literature reports of this sparsely-researched field and the available data on the investigation of possible mechanistic modalities of organometallic PGM complexes and potential opportunities for further exploration of such targets. Mechanistic insights into the antimalarial organometallic complexes have primarily focused on three targets, namely, hemozoin inhibition (a mainstay for quinoline antimalarials); interaction with nucleic acids, particularly DNA; and intracellular catalysis. These are discussed below.
