<p>NMR experiments were conducted to corroborate the findings of the study using the pLDH model for NAD
 <sup>+</sup>/NADH monitoring. In this instance, NADH and a hydride source are incubated with catalytic amounts of the complex in a deuterated solvent and the disappearance or appearance of signals of NADH and NAD
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively, is monitored over time. The NMR spectra acquired after four hours of incubation showed new signals corresponding to NAD
 <sup>+</sup> with no indication of any NADH signals present, thus confirming the successful conversion of NAD
 <sup>+</sup> to NADH under the employed conditions. Furthermore, when parasites of the K1 resistant strain treated with complexes were co-incubated with increasing amounts of sodium formate, higher antiplasmodial activity was observed in a manner proportional to formate concentration. Collectively, these results provide clear evidence that the tested PGM complexes may indeed act as intracellular catalysts, capable of interfering with crucial biochemical processes, such as the NAD
 <sup>+</sup>/NADH transfer hydrogenation, in order to induce the antiparasitic effects as one of the modes of action, among others. The mechanism of catalysis is proposed to follow that explained in similar studies reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. These findings show that the strategy of disrupting biochemical processes in malaria parasites via intracellular catalysis is a viable avenue for the search for innovative antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action. Notwithstanding, investigation of these complexes in intact plasmodial parasitic cells remains to be explored. More research is thus required to further elaborate the intracellular catalytic activity of these chemical entities and decisively link this property to their antiplasmodial activity more precisely.
