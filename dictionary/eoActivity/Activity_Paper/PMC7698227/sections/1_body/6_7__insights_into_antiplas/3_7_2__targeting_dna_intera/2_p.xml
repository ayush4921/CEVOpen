<p>The Ru(III)Cp* complexes 
 <bold>49</bold>–
 <bold>51</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f012">Figure 12</xref>) reported by Patel and associates were also investigated for DNA interaction using HS-DNA, as previously discussed [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Ruthenium(III) complexes are touted for their impressive DNA binding affinity as possible chemotherapeutic agents, and this has been extensively studied in cancer research of bioorganometallic complexes [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The binding affinity of the complexes, quantified in terms of binding constants, agreed with their observed in vitro antiplasmodial activity assessed in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical isolates. This relationship is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f024">Figure 24</xref>A, showing a plot of DNA binding constants as a function of the antiplasmodial activity. As can be seen in the figure, compounds’ low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values translate to high DNA binding affinity in a nearly linear relationship. The bathochromic spectral shifts (Δλ = 2–4 nm) observed in the UV/vis DNA titration curves, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f024">Figure 24</xref>B for complex 
 <bold>49c</bold>, suggested stacking interactions of the complexes with DNA base pairs, i.e., DNA intercalation, which was confirmed by DNA viscosity measurements and in silico docking simulations.
