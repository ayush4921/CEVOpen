<p>Agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) experiments suggested the complexes were also capable of inducing cleavage of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA by hydrolytic or oxidative processes. Additionally, the computational docking simulation studies with selected candidates revealed that the complexes elicit preferential binding to AT-rich regions of the model DNA structure used as a receptor via van der Waals interactions. This finding demonstrates the practicality of targeting plasmodial DNA over the DNA of the human host for the generation of organometallic chemotypes with good selectivity towards the malaria parasites. To further illustrate this point, the authors tested the complexes for general toxicity effects in a brine shrimp model, an inexpensive first-line measure for screening the lethality of antiparasitic compounds, which could be attributed to the complexes having selective binding affinity for plasmodial DNA. The complexes exhibited higher inhibitory potency in the
