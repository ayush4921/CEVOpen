<p>Despite the demonstrable biological potential of osmium complexes, antimalarial investigation of osmium complexes is limited in the literature. To date, only one study investigating the antimalarial activity of osmium complexes is known. In this report, Nordlander and colleagues evaluated Os(II) analogues (
 <bold>73</bold>–
 <bold>75</bold>) of Ru(II)Cl(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) complexes 
 <bold>37</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f009">Figure 9</xref>) in vitro on sensitive (NF54 and D10) and resistant (Dd2) 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains for antiplasmodial activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f019">Figure 19</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The activity of the complexes 
 <bold>73</bold>–
 <bold>75</bold> was comparable to the Ru(II) analogues 
 <bold>37</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold> on all tested strains. In a few cases, the Os(II) complexes were more potent than their Ru(II) counterparts, signifying the attractive antimalarial potential of osmium-based compounds. Given these observations, it is apparent that osmium complexes are worthy of further consideration in the context of their antimalarial activity.
