<p>Likewise, the introduction of PGM moieties into known pharmacological scaffolds, possessing antiplasmodial activity, has been shown to enhance the biological activity of these organic compounds. This approach offers an opportunity to restore the activity of antimalarial drugs, already suffering full-blown clinical resistance, while displaying increased activity toward resistant

Most reviews covering the biological activity of PGM complexes, including malaria, have predominantly focused on inorganic complexes, i.e., compounds with coordinate bonds between the metal and a heteroatom. In this reference work, we highlight the antimalarial activity of organometallic PGM complexes comprising at least one metal-carbon covalent bond, as well as their plausible/proposed mechanisms of action, which have been documented in the literature. With respect to current trends in research activities on PGM complexes, we have emphasized recent developments within this field published over the past five years.
