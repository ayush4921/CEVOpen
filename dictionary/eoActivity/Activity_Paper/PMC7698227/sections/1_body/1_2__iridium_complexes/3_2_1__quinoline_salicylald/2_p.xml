<p>In another study, the Smith and Nordlander groups evaluated the antimalarial activity of IrCp* complexes, based on the chloroquine nucleus, with 
 <italic>N^O^P</italic>-coordination via salicylaldimine and 1,3,5-triaza-phosphaadamantane (PTA) ligands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f003">Figure 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The incorporation of the water-soluble PTA ligand was inspired by the medicinal attributes of this moiety, which was observed within ruthenium(II)-arene PTA (RAPTA) complexes, reported by the Dyson group, which showed antiproliferative efficacy against several cancer cell-lines [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The multiple basic nitrogen atoms within the PTA unit increases the overall basicity of the resultant complex, providing multiple sites for protonation once in the DV of the parasite, which is a feature crucial for the activity of antimalarial drugs, particularly 4-aminoquinolines [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The PTA complexes, isolated as hydrochloride salts, displayed antiplasmodial activity against CQS NF54 and CQR K1 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 0.11 and 1.7 μM [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The benzyl-PTA congeners (
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>16</bold>) were slightly more efficacious than their non-benzylated counterparts (
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>13</bold>), against both parasite strains. Furthermore, selected complexes (
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>15</bold>) were screened for their in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. These complexes displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward the CHO cell-line, and thus greater selectivity toward the malaria parasite, with selectivity indices greater than or equal to 10. The increased potency of the benzyl-PTA complexes (
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>16</bold>) may be rationalized by their enhanced lipophilicity, owing to the presence of the benzyl unit. Mechanistic studies further suggested that the complexes acted via the inhibition of hemozoin synthesis, which is a pathway unique to the malaria parasite and a crucial detoxification mechanism.
