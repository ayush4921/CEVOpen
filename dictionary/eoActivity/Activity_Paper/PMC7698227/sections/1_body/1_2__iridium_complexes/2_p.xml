<p>The incorporation of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) ligand is favoured over the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl (Cp) congener, owing to its increased lipophilicity and higher stability [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This enhanced stability is ascribed to the combined effects of steric shielding of the metallic centre and the greater electron density within the Cp* ligand [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For chloroquine-derived organometallic iridium complexes, the enhanced lipophilicity of the Cp* ligand is hypothesized to confer an overall improvement in the lipophilicity of the resultant compound, leading to increased retention within the active site of the parasite, i.e., digestive vacuole (DV), making this entity attractive to thwart the development of drug resistance [
