<p>Apart from the derivatization of chloroquine, appending IrCp* moieties to other known drug scaffolds has proven to be a successful strategy to enhance the biological activity of the parental organic compound, while imparting potentially new and beneficial pharmacological properties. Most notably, complexation with the IrCp* moiety has been shown to restore the potency of antimalarial drugs that have experienced total clinical resistance. Chellan and colleagues demonstrated this upon their exploration of 
 <italic>N^N</italic>-chelated iridium analogues of the clinical antimalarial drug, sulfadoxine (
 <bold>21</bold>), which is facing full resistance by 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f005">Figure 5</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This group synthesized a series of 
 <italic>N,N′</italic>-chelate pyridylimino- (
 <bold>22</bold>) or quinolylimino- (
 <bold>23</bold>) IrCp* complexes, functionalized with sulfadoxine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f005">Figure 5</xref>), and evaluated their antiplasmodial activity against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. The complexes inhibited the growth of CQS (3D7 and late stage NF54 gametocytes) and CQR (Dd2) strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the sub- and low micromolar range, with no significant toxicity towards non-pathogenic human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Annulation of the IrCp* moiety with phenyl and biphenyl units was desirable for activity, as shown by the increased efficacy of the complexes endowed with these rings, a fact that could be attributed to increased lipophilicity. This is further corroborated by the superior activity of the bulkier isoquinolyl complexes (
 <bold>23a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>) compared with their pyridyl congeners (
 <bold>22a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>). Most significantly, the parental drug sulfadoxine did not show any toxicity toward the investigated 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains, at the highest tested concentration, thus illustrating the practicality of incorporating an IrCp* moiety into drug scaffolds as a viable approach for restoring the activity of clinical drugs facing resistance.
