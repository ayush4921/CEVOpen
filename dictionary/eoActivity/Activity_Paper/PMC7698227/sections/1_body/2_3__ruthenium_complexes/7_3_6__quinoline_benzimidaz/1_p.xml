<p>A study by Stringer et al. included quinolinyl RAPTAs 
 <bold>52</bold>–
 <bold>53</bold> showing inhibitory activity on the growth of CQS NF54 and CQR K1 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains at half-maximal concentrations in the ranges of 0.10–0.40 and 1.6–4.5 μM, respectively (

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Generally, incorporation of the PTA moiety by coordination to the metallic centre of the Ru(II)(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) unit augmented the activity of the complexes against the sensitive strain for the same reasons discussed earlier for the Ir(III)Cp* congeners. High selectivity indices of &gt;10 were observed for the malaria parasites over the mammalian cells for selected promising complexes tested on CHO cells. Antiplasmodial activity of neutral Ru(II)(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) derivatives 
 <bold>54a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f013">Figure 13</xref>), of the 2-phenylbenzimidazole PGM complexes, was also reported in the same range as their Ir(III)Cp* congeners 
 <bold>25a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f006">Figure 6</xref>) discussed earlier [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Likewise, the activity of these complexes was superior to the uncomplexed ligands 
 <bold>24a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f006">Figure 6</xref>), emphasizing the significance of the presence of the organometallic Ru(II)(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) unit.
