<p>Patel et al. conjugated Ru(III)Cp* to a selection of planar polycyclic heteroaromatic ligands with structural conformations desirable for DNA binding, in order to target resistant clinical isolates of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite, as well as fungal (
 <italic>S. bombe</italic>) and bacterial pathogens (
 <italic>S. Aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The first cohort of complexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f012">Figure 12</xref>) was assembled from a modified 4-arylquinoline moiety grafted with heteroaryl ring units, i.e., 2-pyridine and 2-thiophene, at C2 to produce 
 <italic>N^N</italic>- and 
 <italic>N^S</italic>-coordinated Ru(III)Cp* complexes (
 <bold>49a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> and 
 <bold>50a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>), respectively [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. All the complexes showed activities below 1.0 mg/mL with higher potency being observed for the 
 <italic>N^N</italic>-chelated pyridyl congeners (
 <bold>49a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>) over the thiophenyl counterparts (
 <bold>50a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>). On the other hand, the antiplasmodial effects of the corresponding uncomplexed ligands were inferior (around 1.6 mg/mL), once again stressing the medicinal benefits of incorporating metallic complexes into bioactive scaffolds as a viable avenue to improve their antimalarial activity. Preliminary toxicity assessments of the compounds in brine shrimp indicated strong cytotoxicity of complexes, which could be interpreted as a promising indication of their antiproliferative potential as anticancer agents.
