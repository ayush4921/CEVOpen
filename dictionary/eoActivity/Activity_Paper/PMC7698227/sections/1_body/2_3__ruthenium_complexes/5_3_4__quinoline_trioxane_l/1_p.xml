<p>In 2016, Martinez and colleagues ingeniously amalgamated two antimalarial pharmacophoric entities, 4-aminoquinoline present in chloroquine (CQ) and 1,2,4-triaoxane of artemisinin (
 <bold>46</bold>), together with ruthenocene, culminating in a novel ruthenium-based antimalarial agent (
 <bold>47</bold>) endowed with three moieties that are vital for antimalarial activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f011">Figure 11</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The resulting organo-ruthenium aminoquinoline-trioxane hybrid (
 <bold>47</bold>) was highly potent against CQR K1 (16.96 ± 2.93 nM) and Dd2 (51.16 ± 10.39 nM) strains, with &gt;7-fold improvement in activity relative to CQ. Interestingly, this compound showed high selectivity for the parasitic strains over the healthy human MRC5 cells translating into marked selectivity indices of 92 and 30 for the K1 and Dd2 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains, respectively. The impressive efficacy of 
 <bold>47</bold> was comparable to that of the other potent organometallic antimalarial compounds, such as ferroquine, ruthenoquine, and trioxaferroquine, poised to overcome clinical resistance by CQR 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. Preliminary SAR interrogation of the hybrid revealed that the 4-aminoquinoline nucleus is critical for activity as the non-quinoline ruthenocene-trioxane analogue 
 <bold>48</bold> exhibited inferior activity to hybrid 
 <bold>47</bold>. Moreover, the plain trioxane substrate (
 <bold>46</bold>) had even more diminished activity, thus underscoring the pharmacological importance of the ruthenocene unit.
