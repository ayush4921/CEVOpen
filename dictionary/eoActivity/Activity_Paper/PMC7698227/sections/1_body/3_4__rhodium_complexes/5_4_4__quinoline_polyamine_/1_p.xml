<p>Bimetallic polyamine quinolinyl Rh(I)COD complexes (
 <bold>70</bold>–
 <bold>71</bold>) assembled by 
 <italic>N^O</italic>-coordination via the terminal salicylaldimine motif were demonstrated to possess inhibitory effects towards the growth of sensitive and resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains (

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>71a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>, with shorter ethyl linkers, displayed higher selectivity for the resistant parasite strain over the sensitive strain, while the mononuclear complexes, 
 <bold>70a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>, endowed with a propylamine spacer, had lower resistance indices. Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>71a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> demonstrated a higher binding affinity for synthetic hemozoin than chloroquine by almost two-fold and, in all cases, the complexes were more effective than their respective metal-free ligands. This further validates the strategy of incorporating organometallic complexes into known drug scaffolds as a viable approach to modulate their activity.
