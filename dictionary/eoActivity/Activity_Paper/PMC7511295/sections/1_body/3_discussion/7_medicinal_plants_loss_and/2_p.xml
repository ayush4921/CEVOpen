 <italic>tenuir</italic>, 
 <italic>T. fedtschenkoi, M. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> has caused depletion of these plants in the both pastoral rangelands. These species were popular medicinal plants with relative importance more than 60% for social system. Reduction of photosynthetic ability linked with the loss of leaf area of plants can restrict plant growth in ecosystems
