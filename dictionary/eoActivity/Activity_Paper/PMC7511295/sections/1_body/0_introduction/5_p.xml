In this regard, this study was done to (1) investigate ethnopharmacology of medicinal plants used by local pastorals in southeastern Iran, (2) assess the relationships between ethnopharmacological information of medicinal plants with their ecological importance, and (3) determine medicinal species loss under two different pastoralism types in the region (nomadism and sedentary pastoralism) and their relationship with ethnobotanical indices.
