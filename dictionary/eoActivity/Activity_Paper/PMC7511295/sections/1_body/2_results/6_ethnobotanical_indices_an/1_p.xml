<p id="Par33">The Bayesian networks shows the relationship between the relative loss index and ethnopharmacological indices of medicinal plants in sedentary pastoralism (LS
 <sub>1</sub>) and nomadism (LS
 <sub>2</sub>) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). There are 15 nodes in the network. The probabilities that relative loss of species being high and low were 87.2% and 12.8% in sedentary pastoralism, respectively. The probabilities that relative loss of species being high and low were 71.9% and 28.1% in nomadism, respectively.
