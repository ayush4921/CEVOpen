 <italic>T. fedtschenkoi</italic> (RL = 0.75),

 <italic>Z. tenuir</italic> (RL = 0.68) had the most relative loss index. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There were significant differences between pastoralism types (sedentary pastoralism and nomadism) in the relative loss of medicinal plant species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The relative loss indices of medicinal species were 0.648 ± 0.222 and 0.223 ± 0.212 in sedentary pastoral and nomadic rangelands respectively, indicating more species are removed under the sedentary pastoralism.
