<p id="Par17">Ecological data were collected in three adjacent sites (inside the park, outside the park including both nomad and sedentary pastoral rangelands). Sites were selected in homogeneous areas with similar topography and ecological properties. The vegetation survey was carried out using 180 nested quadrats, which randomly located in the sites to show the loss of plant species under different pastoralism types. As a constant quadrat size may not be appropriate or all plant species with different sizes, sixty 10 × 10 m quadrats were used to sample trees and shrubs and 1 × 1 m sub-quadrats were used to sample semi-shrubs and herbaceous plants in each site. Canopy cover and individual numbers of plant species were recorded in each plot.</p>
