  <title>Background and Aim</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> species are widely distributed microorganisms in nature that are responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning and a common cause of food spoilage. This study aimed to isolate and identify foodborne 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> species from meat and to determine the antimicrobial activities of commercial essential oils and spices powder extracted from certain medicinal plants.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Sixty meat samples were collected in Assiut city and subdivided into raw meat and processed meat. 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp were isolated and identified according to their cultural characters, biochemical reactions, serological typing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antibacterial activity of essential oils and spices powder was measured by using well-diffusion and microbial count techniques.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The prevalence of 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. in the examined raw meat samples and processed meat samples was 13.34%, and 26.67%, respectively. There was a marked decrease in the total 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> species count after treatment of minced beef with essential oils and spices powder compared to the untreated one. Black seed oil was the most potent antibacterial essential oil among the tested oils present in this study.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Essential oils and spices powder of certain medicinal plants (cumin: 
   <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic>, black seeds: 
   <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>, cloves: 
   <italic>Syzygium aromaicum</italic>, cinnamon: 
   <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, and Marjoram: 
   <italic>Origanum majorana</italic>) have a potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. Furthermore, 
   <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> oil exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp.
