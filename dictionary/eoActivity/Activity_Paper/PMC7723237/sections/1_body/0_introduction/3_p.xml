<p>Different types of culture media such as MYP (mannitol–egg yolk–phenol red–polymyxin–agar) and PEMBA (polymyxin–pyruvate–egg yolk–mannitol–bromthymol blue-agar) were used for detection and the selective isolation of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. from food. The selectivity of these media is based on the hydrolysis of egg yolk lecithin and the absence of the use of mannitol by 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. besides the presence of selective compounds like polymyxin.
