<p>Serial concentrations of each tested essential oil were made (% w/v) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (10% aqueous) solvent as follows: 50 and 100 mg/mL and sterilized by filtration by passing through a 0.22-μm membrane filter. DMSO without the essential oil was used as a control. For spices powder, 100 g of the powder was dissolved in 500 mL ethyl alcohol

The residues obtained were weighed and reconstituted by ethyl alcohol and sterilized by filtration by passing through a 0.22-μm membrane filter. The concentrations made from each residue were as follows: 50 and 100 mg/mL. Fifty microlitres of each tested sample was pipette to the wells of the inoculated agar plates aseptically.
