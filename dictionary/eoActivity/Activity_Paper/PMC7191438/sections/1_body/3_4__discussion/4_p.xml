<p>The present study also revealed that RFC and CI values of some reported species are similar. However, there is a distinct difference in species ranking using each index. 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> is placed in the first position according to both RFC and CI index. This could be due to the fact that this species is mentioned by many informants and is the most recognized plant in most study areas. Furthermore, CI value of 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> is also high, suggesting the diversified use of the plant. 
 <italic>V. auriculifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> ranked next to 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic>, according to RFC index. On the other hand, 
 <italic>D. barnimiana</italic> and 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> spp. ranked 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> by CI index. It has been suggested that UV value is a good measure of use diversity, than the number of citations [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In agreement with this, UV value in our study is driven by species with greatest number of use rather than those cited by more informants. The Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.36, between RFC and UV, shows significant negative association between the local importance of each medicinal plant and relative importance of use of plants. This result is in contrast to previous studies that reported a significant positive correlation between RFC and UV [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. On the other hand, there is a significant positive correlation between RFC and CI (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.74, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) implying that their pattern matches across species. The species with larger RFC value usually have higher CI, such as 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> and 
 <italic>Vernonia auriculifera</italic>.
