<p>In this study, in agreement with the studies conducted in Fiche district [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Ghimbi district [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Hawassa city [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] of Ethiopia, the predominant botanical families recorded, listing over 5 plant species each, were Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Lamiaceae. This could be due to the fact that these families are the largest in the flora of Ethiopia and Eritrea [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Moreover, cytotoxicity studies conducted on different Mexican plants reported that the highest number of plant species with both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antineoplasic activities was from these families [
