<p>A traditional healer for the purpose of this study is “a person who is recognized by the community in which s/he lives as competent to provide healthcare by using plants and plant products.” Each traditional healer was approached, briefed about the purpose of the research, and asked for his/her verbal consent in talking about cancer and its treatment. They were assured of the confidentiality of the information they provided. If plants were mentioned for their anticancer purposes, a botanical sample was collected. These specimens were pressed and preserved for later identification at the National Herbarium, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, and a voucher specimen of each plant was deposited in the institute. All botanical names have been transcribed according to the nomenclature system used by the Plant List (
