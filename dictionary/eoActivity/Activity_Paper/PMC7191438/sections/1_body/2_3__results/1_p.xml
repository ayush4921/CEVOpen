<p>The informants consisted of 66 male and 8 female traditional healers and they were divided into three age groups: 20–40, 41–60, and ≥ 61 years. Out of 74 interviewed traditional healers, most of them (
 <italic>N</italic>%) were adults aged between 41 and 60 years. Majority of the respondents (70.2%) gained their knowledge from family members and 82% of all interviewed respondents practiced ethnomedicine for more than 25 years. More than 70% of the respondents were either only at their primary level of education or did not have a formal education at all (

Lumpy growth was the most commonly cited criteria used to diagnose cancer, followed by ulcerative wounds and bleeding (

 <italic>Naqarsa</italic>” in Bale Robe and Goba, “
 <italic>Sissac</italic>” in Gewane, “
 <italic>Xoka</italic> or 
 <italic>Toka</italic>” in Doyo Gena, “
 <italic>Balamo</italic>” in Wondo Genet, “
 <italic>Kums</italic> or 
 <italic>niamt</italic>” in North Bench, and “
 <italic>Kanser</italic>” in Sheko and Sodo Zuria district. Out of the 6 specific cancer types (skin, breast, lung, cervical, throat, and intestinal) claimed to be treated by the respondents, skin cancer was a dominant one followed by breast cancer.
