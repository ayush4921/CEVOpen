<p>In the current study, the highest UVs were recorded for 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> spp. (6), 
 <italic>Albizia schimperiana</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Sida schimperiana</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Brucea antidysenterica</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Cleome brachycarpa</italic> (3), 
 <italic>Leonotis ocymifolia</italic> (3), and 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> (3). The lowest UVs were obtained for 
 <italic>Acokanthera schimperi</italic>, 
 <italic>Acmella caulirhiza</italic>, 
 <italic>Cineraria abyssinica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gnidia involucrata</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A total of 228 use reports have been documented and categorized into seven categories (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Among these, other ailments (46.3%) and skin cancer (26.5%) had the highest use reports. Furthermore, ICF values were also calculated and ranged from 0 to 0.42. The highest ICF values were recorded in other ailments (0.42) and breast cancer (0.32) followed by skin cancer (0.23) category (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The other ailments category comprises of diseases such as stomach ache, malaria, wart, swelling, wounds, evil eye, toothache, bleeding, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, bone fracture, cough, snake bite, herpes simplex, tonsillitis, hypertension, dandruff, fever, and hemorrhoid. The ICF value of the remaining four categories (lung cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and throat cancer) was zero. Quantitative ethnobotanical indexes such as RFC and CI were calculated in this study to analyze the ethnobotanical information. According to RFC values, 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> (0.1), 
 <italic>Vernonia auriculifera</italic> (0.04), 
 <italic>Clematis simensis</italic> (0.04), and 
 <italic>Acmella caulirhiza</italic> (0.04) are the most frequently cited among all reported plants. 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> (0.16), 
 <italic>Dorstenia barnimiana</italic> (0.12), and 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> spp. (0.08) rank 1
 <sup>st</sup>, 2
 <sup>nd</sup>, and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> in position, respectively, according to the CI reference. Our result also shows that the Pearson correlation coefficient of RFC was positively and negatively correlated to CI and UV, respectively (
