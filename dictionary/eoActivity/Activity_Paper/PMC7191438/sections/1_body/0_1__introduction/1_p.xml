<p>Cancer is a complex disease that is very heterogenic and variable at cellular level and also differs from one patient to the other in its behaviour, development, and outcome [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Physical, metabolic, and behavioural variations of cancer cells from normal ones arise through the accumulation of genetic modifications and help them to proliferate rapidly, escape from host immune surveillance, and ultimately invade distant tissues [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Histopathological, genetic, and epigenetic and clinical outcome variations between and within different types of cancers have been the greatest challenge to understand the disease and develop novel therapies [
