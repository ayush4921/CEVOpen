<p>Most of the recently used medicines are initially evaluated on animal models for various purposes. Firstly, it may not be necessary to examine new medicines on humans if preliminary evaluations on animals show that they are not clinically useful. Secondly, studies on animals provide a degree of genetic and environmental manipulation rarely possible in humans. Thirdly, animal studies provide unique insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of the disease and can reveal new targets for the tested medicines. Finally, regulatory authorities concerned with public protection require extensive animal testing to evaluate new medicines for toxicity and to establish safety [
