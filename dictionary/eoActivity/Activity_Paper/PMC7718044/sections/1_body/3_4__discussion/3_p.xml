<p>Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia as well as polyuria, polyphagia, and polydipsia are the most prominent symptoms in diabetic patients observed in experimental animals (rats and mice) administration by STZ or alloxan with diabetes mellitus [

In this regard, the results of the current study showed that in the diabetic rat group, the food consumption, water intake, blood glucose, and TC and TG levels were significantly increased. At the same time, bodyweight, HDL-C, and serum insulin secretions were decreased in comparison with the C group. The current study showed that 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> extract decreased blood glucose levels and elevated serum insulin levels in the D + TL group. However, one of the active substances of 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> was cirsimaritin; an investigation conducted by Lee et al. showed that it is a biologically active compound that prevented apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells caused by STZ. In this study, the increase of the insulin levels in all groups treated with the plant extract may be caused by the regeneration of the pancreas by cirsimaritin compound [
