<p>Regarding oxidative stress inhibitory activity, it was noticed that the GSH-Px was significantly increased in the D + TL group. In addition, it significantly increased the GSH-Px and SOD activities, while decreased the PON and ARE activities in the D group. At the same time, the PON1 enzyme is involved in the PON enzyme family which is a component of HDL-C. The primary role of PON1 is to protect lipoproteins from the oxidative process. For such a reason, the antioxidant effect of PON1 is usually related with the ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide and other free radicals. Also, ARE enzyme level is an essential indicator for the PON1 activity. Many conditions can increase oxidative stress such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart diseases [
