<p>The result of the current study showed that the food and water consumption, blood glucose, and serum TC and TG levels were significantly increased in the D group, while the bodyweight of this group significantly decreased compared with the C group rats. However, there were no differences between the C + TL and C groups, while the food and water intake decreased in the D + TL group in comparison with the D group; otherwise, food and water intake decreased in the C + TL group compared with the D + TL group as presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Moreover, the serum TG levels were significantly decreased in the C + TL group and also food and water consumption, blood glucose, and TC and TG levels were significantly decreased in the D + TL group compared with the D group. Also, in the D group, the blood glucose and serum TG and TC levels were elevated, while the serum insulin and HDL-C levels were significantly decreased in comparison with the C group. Furthermore, high levels of insulin and low levels of blood glucose, TG, and TC were significantly detected in the D + TL group in comparison with the D group. The levels of serum HDL-C did not change between the D and D + TL groups as shown in
