<p>Stock solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in methanol were prepared from 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> extract and Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Each one of these stock solutions was diluted with methanol to prepare 12 of the working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. A freshly prepared DPPH solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) (0.002% w/v) was mixed with methanol and with each of the abovementioned working solutions at a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. Besides, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in a 1 : 1 ratio, while Trolox which is a vitamin E analog and considered strong antioxidant reagent was used as a positive control. All of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period, the optical density of these solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 517 nm. The antioxidant activity of Trolox and 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> extract was estimated using the following formula:
