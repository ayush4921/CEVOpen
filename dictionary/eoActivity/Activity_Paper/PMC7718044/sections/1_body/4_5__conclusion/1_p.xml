<p>The findings of the current study concluded that 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> extract can be used as an antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and powerful antioxidant agent as a treatment of diabetes or as a supportive therapy. A literature survey on 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> extract has shown that no biomedical analysis has previously been established on the serum insulin, TC, TG, HDL-C, SOD, GSH-Px, PON, ARE, and MDA potentials. Further, toxicological and clinical experiments are required to evaluate this plant species and its possible applications in the pharmaceutical fields.
