 <p>From the medicinal orchid 
  <italic>Dendrobium chryseum</italic> Rolfe, which is used in traditional and folk Chinese medicine, the protocorms were raised in Murashige and Skoog (MS) media in three strengths, full strength (FMS), half strength (1/2 MS), and quarter strength (1/4 MS), with or without the phytohormones 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and coconut water (CW). The comparative cytotoxic activities of the wild and 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>-raised protocorms were evaluated in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human glioblastoma (U251) cell lines by MTT assay. In 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>, the methanol extracts of 
  <italic>D. chryseum</italic> showed significant cytotoxic activities. Significant growth inhibition (%) and potent IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were demonstrated in HeLa cell lines (49.79% (210.5 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>-raised 
  <italic>Dendrobium chryseum</italic> (DCT) versus 46.97% (226.5 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for wild 
  <italic>Dendrobium chryseum</italic> (DCW)). Similarly, activities against U251 cell lines exhibited also significant inhibition (28.76% (612.54 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCW and 17.15% (1059.92 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCT). The cytotoxic activities of both, wild and tissue-cultured samples, were superior in HeLa cells. In U251 cells, the wild sample was more active than the tissue-cultured one with a moderate cytotoxic effect. Hence, protocorm culture may therefore be a promising future tool for producing pharmacologically bioactive compounds in medicinal orchids. Such sustainable technology approach will minimize the pressure on the natural population of threatened but commercially important medicinal orchids.
