<p>Previous studies revealed that orchids can be a potent source of anticancer agents. For instance, 
 <italic>D. nobile</italic> showed cytotoxicity against human lung carcinoma, human ovary adenocarcinoma, and human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. signatum</italic> exhibited cytotoxic activities against human MDA-23 1, HepG2, and HT-29 cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. chrysanthum</italic> inhibited the proliferation of leukemia HL-60 cells [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic> and 
 <italic>D. moniliforme</italic> showed cytotoxic activities against HeLa and U251 cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bulbophyllum kwangtungense</italic> showed antitumor activities against HeLa and K562 human tumor cell lines [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] while 
 <italic>Bulbophyllum odoratissimum</italic> was found to have cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines, such as human leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60, human hepatoma BEL-7402, human lung adenocarcinoma A549, and human stomach cancer cell line SGC-7901 [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Prior to this study, no comparative investigation of the cytotoxic activity of plants grown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> versus wild plants has been reported.
