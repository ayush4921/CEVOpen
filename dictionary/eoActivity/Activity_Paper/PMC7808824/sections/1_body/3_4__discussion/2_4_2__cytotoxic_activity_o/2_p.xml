<p>A comparison of the cytotoxic activity of both wild and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> grown plant samples of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> on HeLa cells revealed that tissue-cultured protocorms (
 <italic>in vitro</italic> samples) were slightly more active than wild plants. Both, however, showed a significant percentage of growth inhibition and highly potent IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in a dose-dependent manner. Upon microscopic investigation, initially cultured HeLa cancer cells before the treatment regimen were elongated and spindle-shaped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Soon after the treatment with the plant extract, treated cells soon reorganised to form condensed round bodies, potentially characterizing the incurring event of apoptosis (cell death) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). This cytological study revealed that 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> extracts play a pivotal role in inhibiting the growth of HeLa cancer cells, whereas, against the U251 cell line, the activity of the wild sample was comparatively better than the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-raised protocorms. Nevertheless, also for this cellular glioblastoma model system, significant percentage of cancer cell proliferation inhibition and corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were demonstrated.
