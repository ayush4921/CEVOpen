<p>The cytotoxic activities of DCW and DCT were analyzed for their potential roles as antineoplastic agents. The wild samples originated from stem tissue and the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> samples from protocorms. The methanol extracts of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>, for both wild and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-grown samples, showed significant cytotoxic activities (Figures
