 <italic>cis</italic>-platin had as expected superior potency against HeLa cells with a low IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. However, 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>-derived samples showed high potency as well through effective inhibition of the growth of HeLa cells. Significant dose-dependent growth inhibition percentages and low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were exhibited: 49.79% (210.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCT and 46.97% (226.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCW while the cytotoxic activities of wild and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> samples were nearly the same, being slightly better in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-grown samples (Figures
