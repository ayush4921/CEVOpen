<p>In particular, orchid species have been cultured with various techniques to synthesize bioactive molecules 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> was cultured 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to produce protocorms for the assessment of potential cytotoxic activity and comparison of such activities with its wild counterparts. Protocorm formation is the peculiar stage in orchids in which an embryo transforms and develops into a specific spherical structure with unique characteristics. Protocorms undergo growth and differentiation stages during their development into mature plants [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Protocorms contain highly proliferating tissues which accumulate high contents of secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is the first investigation of the medicinal properties in protocorms of this threatened species 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>, especially for its potential as a source for antineoplastic agents. The objectives of the present study were to establish protocorm culture for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Subsequently, isolated extract material thereof was examined for its effect between substances originated from protocorms compared to wild plant material in terms of cell proliferation against two representative cancer cell lines: human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human glioblastoma (U251), respectively.
