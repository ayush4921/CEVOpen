<p>Protocorms developed from the immature seeds on the different strengths of MS media. All the cultures were maintained for 4 months for the protocorm proliferation which were used for subsequent extraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The protocorm biomass was separated from the best proliferating medium, and the fresh weight was measured after surface drying. Dry weights were taken after the protocorms were dried at room temperature until mass balance.
