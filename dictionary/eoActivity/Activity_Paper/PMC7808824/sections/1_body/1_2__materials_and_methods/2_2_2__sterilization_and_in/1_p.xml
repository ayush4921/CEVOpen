<p>The procedure for the inoculation of seeds of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> for protocorm formation is already described and reported by us and is followed in the present experiment as well [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Immature capsules of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> were first washed under running water added by 2-3 drops of Tween-20 for half an hour to remove dust particles and then rinsed off with distilled water for 10 min. Before inoculation, the explants were surface-sterilized by immersing them first in a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite and then 70% ethyl alcohol for 2 min each. Finally, they were rinsed off with sterile distilled water at least three times. The surface-sterilized capsules were transferred into Petri dishes and dried on a filter paper in a laminar airflow cabinet. Next, the sterile capsules were cut longitudinally into two equal halves using a sterile surgical blade exposing the seeds within (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in three strengths FMS, 1/2MS, and 1/4MS with or without phytohormones (BAP and NAA; on 0.5 mg/L NAA and 1, 1.5, or 2 mg/L BAP) and 10% CW. All cultures were kept in a culture room and maintained at 25 ± 2°C under a photoperiod of 16 h light.
