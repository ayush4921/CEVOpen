<p>The stems of wild plants and protocorms of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> were washed in tap water and allowed to completely air-dry in shade. The dried plant materials, the stems and the protocorms, were separately ground into a fine powder and mixed with a solvent in a weight/volume ratio of 1 : 10. Specifically, 20 g of dried powder was dissolved in 200 mL of methanol (Fisher Scientific, ≥99% purity) and placed in a sonicator for extraction. Then, the concentrated plant extract was placed in a rotary evaporator until the solvent was dry and the resultant crude extracts of plant materials were stored in a refrigerator at 4°C for later use.
