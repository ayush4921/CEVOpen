 <italic>Dacryodes edulis</italic> (Burseraceae) is a fruit tree widely spread in Cameroon. Its fruits are edible; meanwhile, the bark, leaves, stems, and roots are used as local medicine against some diseases such as anemia, dysentery, malaria, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The literature reports that extracts of fruits and leaves of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> displayed antioxidant activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Phytochemical analysis performed on the aqueous extract of the stem bark and the fruitcake of this plant revealed the presence of secondary metabolites such as phenols, flavonoids, flavonols, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These compounds were reported to display antiproliferative activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, no scientific study reporting the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiproliferative effects of this plant was performed before. The present study therefore aimed at evaluating the ability of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves to inhibit cell proliferation induced by estradiol in ovariectomized rats. This effect was investigated on the uterus and vagina as both tissues are primary estrogen targets that rapidly respond to estradiol stimulation following a 3-day treatment in rats [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses of this extract were performed to highlight bioactive compounds having antiestrogenic and antiproliferative activities. Uterine levels of total cholesterol and estradiol were assessed to illustrate the probable mechanism of action of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves.
