 <italic>(i) Effects on the uterine wet weight.</italic> Compared with the SHAM control group, the relative uterine wet weight of ovariectomized animals decreased by 63.75% (

 <sub>2</sub>V) inversed this effect of ovariectomy as it increased the uterine wet weight by 212.88% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared with the OVX control. The coadministration of estradiol valerate with tamoxifen decreased the uterus relative weight by 32% (

 <sub>2</sub>V group. At tested doses, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves also inhibited the trophic effect of E
 <sub>2</sub>V by reducing the relative uterine wet weight compared with the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group.
