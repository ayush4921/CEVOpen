 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows that ovariectomy decreased the vagina epithelial height by 85.21% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared with the SHAM control. Estradiol valerate inversed the effect of ovariectomy as it increased the vagina epithelial height by 185.29% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared with the OVX control. Tamoxifen inhibited the effect of estradiol valerate as it reduced the vagina epithelial height by 90.62% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), in comparison with the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves induced the similar effect as it also decreased the vagina epithelial height at tested doses (25 mg/kg (92.45% induction, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), 50 mg/kg (89% induction, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), 100 mg/kg (95.32% induction, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 200 mg/kg (91.34% induction, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001)), compared with the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group.
