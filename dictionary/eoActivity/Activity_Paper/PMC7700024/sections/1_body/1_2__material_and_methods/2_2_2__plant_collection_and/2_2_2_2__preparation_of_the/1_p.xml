 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Powdered leaves (300 g) of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> were macerated in 3 L of distilled water for 48 h at room temperature. The supernatant was then filtered with Whatman paper no. 4 and dried in an oven at 40°C for two days. Twenty-nine grams (yield: 9.67%) of the aqueous extract was obtained and stored in an air-tight container at −20°C until use.
