<p>Uterine estradiol levels were assessed by the ELISA test using a reagent kit (Mouse/Rat Estradiol ELISA) purchased from Calbiotech (El Cajon, California, USA). The absorbance of calibrators and specimen was determined using an ELISA microplate reader, the Multiskan ascent plate reader, purchased from MTX Lab Systems, Inc. (Bradenton, USA). The concentration (mIU/mL) was evaluated by means of a calibration curve established from the calibrators supplied with the kits.</p>
