<p>Flavonol content was determined according to the method of Almaraz-Abarca et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In test tubes containing 1280 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water, 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extract (2 mg/ml), 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of aluminium chloride (20%), and 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium acetate (5%) were added. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The absorbance was measured after 30 minutes at 415 nm. The flavonol content was calculated as milligram quercetin equivalent/gram extract (mgQE/gE) using the equation obtained from the calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.1872 x; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9734).
