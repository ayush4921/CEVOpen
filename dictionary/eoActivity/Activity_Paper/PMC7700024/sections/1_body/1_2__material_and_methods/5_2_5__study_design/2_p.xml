<p>Animals were treated with the suboptimal dose of estradiol valerate (0.75 mg/kg) in reference to a previous work reporting the antiestrogenic effects of a medicinal plant [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The dose of tamoxifen (10 mg/kg) was chosen in reference to a previous study reporting the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen on breast cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Treatments were given orally for 3 consecutive days, and the animals were sacrificed thereafter under anesthesia (10 mg/kg diazepam and 50 mg/kg ketamine). The uterus and vagina were collected, free from fat tissues and weighed (only the uterus). The left horn of the uterus was homogenized and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 5°C. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −20°C for biochemical analysis. The right horn of the uterus and the entire vagina were fixed in 10% formalin for histological analysis.
