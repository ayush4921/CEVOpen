 <italic>jungli tulsi</italic> can be easily monitored during the reaction from the change in colour of reaction mixture. Silver nanoparticles bear the characteristic yellow to brown colour due to colour reaction as presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> which indicated the formation of nanoparticles. This formation indicates that the Ag(I) converted into Ag (0) having the size of nanorange [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Studies have indicated that biomolecules like proteins, carbohydrates, flavonoids and phenols not only play a role in the capping of the nanoparticles, but also play an important role in reducing the ions to the nano size [

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (A, B,C) which have indicated that morphologically the silver nanoparticles are spherical as well as rod like of various sizes (6.13–32.04 nm) and the average size of nanoparticles was calculated to be of 15.76 nm. The SEM image shows agglomeration of individual silver nanoparticles. A closer look at the agglomerated rod shape and spherical structure of silver nanoparticles shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B. Spherical nanoparticles with the range 22.92–41.50 nm were prepared using another species of 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> namely 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> in an earlier work. [

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] the average size of green synthesized silver nanoparticles using leaf extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> was reported to be of 42 nm. Singh et al. have reported green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using sun dried tulsi leaves and its catalytic application for 4-Nitrophenol reduction [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, the average particle size in the present study (15.76 nm) using 
 <italic>Ocimum canum</italic> was found quite smaller than the size of particles synthesized by 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>. Similarly, the morphology is also different from nanoparticles synthesized by similar methods [
