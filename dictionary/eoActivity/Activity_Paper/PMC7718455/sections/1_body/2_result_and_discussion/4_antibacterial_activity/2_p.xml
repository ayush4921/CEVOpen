 <italic>E.coli</italic> was selected to assess antimicrobial activity of silver nano particles. Pure 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> culture was taken. Nutrient broth was prepared and a loop full of inoculum was taken from L.B. Agar plate to inoculate 10 ml of the Nutrient Broth. The broth was allowed to incubate over night. Salmonella Shigella agar was prepared by mixing 6.3 gm in 100 ml distilled water and was heated till boiling. Autoclaved petri plates were taken and S.S. agar was poured in plates and allowed to settle down. 100 μl of the broth was taken and poured on the prepared S.S. agar plate. Spread plate method was used for culture. Gel puncture was used for creating wells. Different concentration dose were prepared using standard 200 ppm solution in acetone which have been prepared by dissolving 02 g of the silver nanoparticle in 1000 ml of acetone. 20 μl nanoparticles sample of 10 ppm, 20 ppm and 30 ppm was loaded in each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 28 °C in incubator. Zone of inhibition was determined after overnight incubation (see
