<p id="p0100">To conclude, this study exhibits one step innovative green approach for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles from 
 <italic>jungle tulsi</italic> leaf extract. The method stand out primarily due to the fact that it is eco-friendly and advantageous over the conventional physical and chemical methods. These particles are anticipated to have extensive applications in various industries. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by the colour change. The silver nanoparticles formed were quite stable in solution. The morphological studies by SEM show that the silver nanoparticles are spherical and rod shaped. The particle size and crystalline nature were determined by XRD. The carbohydrates, flavanoids and poly phenols constituents present in leaf extract act as the surface active stabilizing molecules for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The plant material used is of wide occurrence as a weed and as far as known used for the first time in green synthesis of nanoparticles. It is quite significant that finer particles can be prepared using 
 <italic>Ocimum canum</italic> than the other species of this genus. The method was unique and cost effective. Still more clinical trials are needed to support its therapeutic uses.
