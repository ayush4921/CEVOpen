 <p>Green synthesis of nanoparticles is an important area in the field of nanotechnology, which has cost effective and environment friendly benefit over physical and chemical methods. The present study aims at preparation of silver nanoparticles through green route using leaves of 
  <italic>Ocimum canum</italic> Sims
  <italic>,</italic> a widely distributed medicinal herb. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by SEM and XRD. The spherical and rod like morphological shapes were proven by SEM techniques. Crystallographic structure was confirmed by XRD and average particle size of synthesized silver nanoparticles was calculated which was found to be of 15.72 nm. The antibacterial activity of these prepared silver nanoparticles against pathogenic bacterium 
  <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli</italic>) has shown the highest ZOI of 2.45 cm at 30 ppm.
