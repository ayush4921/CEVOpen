<p>RAW264.7 macrophage cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown in medium containing 50 Âµg/ml oxLDL (Invitrogen). After a 48-h incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with Oil Red O to confirm that the normal RAW264.7 changed into foam cell morphology. Cells were examined under a microscope, and images were obtained.</p>
