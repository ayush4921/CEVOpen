<p>Cells were seeded onto 12-well plates. Soluble proteins were harvested using 2 × SDS lysis buffer (0.12 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 3.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3.1% DTT). The lysates were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; resolving buffer 1.5 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, stacking buffer 0.5 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad). Incubate membrane with diluted antibody (anti-p62 (610833, BD Biosciences), anti-SQSTM1/p62 (5114s, CST), anti-LC3B (2775s, CST), anti-PARP (9542s, CST), anti-Caspase3 (9662s, CST), anti-Caspase9 (9502s, CST), anti-actin (ab6276, Abcam)) in 3% (w/v) skim milk or 5% (w/v) BSA overnight at 4°C. Rabbit and mouse secondary antibodies (1:3000 v/v, GE Healthcare) were treated in 3% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h at 25°C. Immunolabeling was detected using an ECL substrate (BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system (BioRad).</p>
