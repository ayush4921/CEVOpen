<p>HUVECs were transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3B plasmid using lipofectamine RNA iMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for 24 h. The cells were then treated with DMSO, rapamycin, Baf A1, or HDE. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33432 and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Images were obtained using an LSM880 confocal microscope at 400Ã— magnification.
