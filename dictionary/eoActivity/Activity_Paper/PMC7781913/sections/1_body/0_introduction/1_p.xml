Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which blood vessels are gradually blocked due to accumulation of cholesterol and plaque formation inside the blood vessel wall. When vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are damaged by stimuli at the beginning of atherosclerosis, monocytes attach to blood vessel walls, enter under the ECs, then differentiate into macrophages (

Macrophages become “foam cells” that absorb oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and secrete inflammatory cytokines to further increase the inflammatory response. Previous reports suggest that regulation of foam cell formation induced by oxLDL will contribute to prevent atherosclerosis (
