<p>When macrophages absorb oxLDL, they form foam cells and promote atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is essential to inhibit formation of macrophage foam cells to effectively treat atherosclerosis. To investigate the effects of HDE on oxLDL-induced foam cell formation, macrophages were stimulated with oxLDL and stained lipid droplets using Oil Red O. HDE significantly suppressed oxLDL-induced foam cell formation at 30 Âµg/ml con-centration (
