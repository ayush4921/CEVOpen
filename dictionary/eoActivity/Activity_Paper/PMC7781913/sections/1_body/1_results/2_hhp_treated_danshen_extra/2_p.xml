<p>To investigate the effect of HDE on autophagy flux, the levels of LC3B conversion and p62 expression in HUVECs were assessed over time (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Treatment of HUVECs with HDE resulted in LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion and p62 degradation after 24-48 h. This result suggested that HDE induced autophagy that contributed to suppression of HUVECs proliferation. Chloroquine is a lysosome activity inhibitor widely used to suppress autophagy flux. HDE treatment reduced p62 levels, indicating that autophagy was activated. However, the increased p62 levels during chloroquine treatment indicated that autophagy flux inhibition occurred (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also found that chloro-quine increased upregulation of LC3B-II by HDE. To further confirm the HDE-induced autophagy process, autophagic flux was monitored using a tandem-labeled GFP-mRFP-LC3 system. GFP is sensitive to an acidic pH level; when it is fused with lysosomes, green fluorescence is quenched and red fluorescence is remained (

 <sup>+</sup>RFP
 <sup>+</sup>) and their maturation into autolysosomes was expressed by red (GFP
 <sup>−</sup>RFP
 <sup>+</sup>). The autophagy inducer, rapamycin, significantly increased the numbers of both yellow and red puncta. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) inhibits fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes. BafA1 application resulted in accumulation of yellow puncta. Meanwhile, HDE increased red signals, suggesting that HDE treatment increased the autophagy flux (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). HDE did not affect apoptotic signals at a concentration of up to 30 µg/ml at which autophagy was induced.
