In this study, we investigated the anti-atherosclerotic activity of raw danshen root extract prepared using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 550 MPa for 5 min and hot water extraction. This method was useful for elimination of bacteria from cultured danshen plants and for better extraction yield of active principles.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which blood vessels are gradually blocked due to accumulation of cholesterol and plaque formation inside the blood vessel wall. When vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are damaged by stimuli at the beginning of atherosclerosis, monocytes attach to blood vessel walls, enter under the ECs, then differentiate into macrophages (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Macrophages become &#x0201c;foam cells&#x0201d; that absorb oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and secrete inflammatory cytokines to further increase the inflammatory response. Previous reports suggest that regulation of foam cell formation induced by oxLDL will contribute to prevent atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Using a non-thermal high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) method, HHP technology is widely used as a processing technology for food materials (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, ultrahigh pressure treatment is useful for making high quality functional food materials and increasing the extraction efficiency of internal active principles (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Danshen (<italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>) is a popular traditional Chinese medicinal plant that promotes various biological effects (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The plant includes compounds such as diterpene-containing tanshinone I, IIA, and IIB, cryptotanshinone, and phenolic com-pounds (e.g., danshensu, protocatechuic aldehyde, and salvianolic acid B) (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It has been prescribed for vascular diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, and blood circulation) in China and other countries in Asia. However, effects of danshen extract on suppression of foam cell formation and alleviation of atherosclerotic plaque growth have not been examined.</p><p>Autophagy is a mechanism used to decompose and recycle unnecessary organelles in a cell. It is involved in maintenance of cell homeostasis (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Dysfunctional proteins can not be degraded when autophagy does not occur normally, leading to diseases such as cancer and degenerative and metabolic diseases (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Autophagy also plays an important role in regulation of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and malfunctions in macrophage autophagy have been implicated in formation of atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that HHP-treated danshen extract (HDE) has an anti-atherosclerotic effect by reducing foam cell formation through autophagy activation in RAW264.7 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Effects of HHP treatment on the population of microorganisms and extraction of active principles from raw danshen</title><p>Populations of aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and molds were measured to investigate the effects of HHP treatment (550 MPa for 5 min) on microorganisms in raw danshen (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). The numbers of total aerobes in raw danshen (control) were approximately 119 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> (colony forming units) CFU/g. Pressurization inactivated it to nearly 1.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g. Likewise, initial yeast and mold counts for control danshen were about 510 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g, then decreased to nearly 0.18 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g after HHP treatment. These results indicated that HHP treatment effectively eliminated microorganisms on raw danshen in a short time, without color and flavor changes.</p><p>HHP treatment destroys cell wall structures and enhances solvent permeability of the cells (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, HHP treatment of a raw danshen plant facilitates extraction of active principles via increased transfer of intracellular materials to the solvent. Raw danshen and HHP-pretreated danshen were extracted with the conventional boiling water extraction method (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The average extraction yield of HHP-treated danshen (0.97 &#x000b1; 0.17) was about 1.3 times greater than that of raw danshen (0.72 &#x000b1; 0.12) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result indicated that HHP treatment effectively increased extraction yield of active principles from raw danshen.</p></sec><sec><title>HHP-treated danshen extract induced autophagy flux of human umbilical vein endothelial cells</title><p>To assess the potential of HDE for treatment of cardiovascular disease, we first examined effects of HDE in ECs. The effect of HDE on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation was investigated using MTT assay. HDE treatment at 0-100 &#x000b5;g/ml suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value of HDE was 34.6 &#x000b5;g/ml and no cytotoxicity was observed.</p><p>To investigate the effect of HDE on autophagy flux, the levels of LC3B conversion and p62 expression in HUVECs were assessed over time (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Treatment of HUVECs with HDE resulted in LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion and p62 degradation after 24-48 h. This result suggested that HDE induced autophagy that contributed to suppression of HUVECs proliferation. Chloroquine is a lysosome activity inhibitor widely used to suppress autophagy flux. HDE treatment reduced p62 levels, indicating that autophagy was activated. However, the increased p62 levels during chloroquine treatment indicated that autophagy flux inhibition occurred (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also found that chloro-quine increased upregulation of LC3B-II by HDE. To further confirm the HDE-induced autophagy process, autophagic flux was monitored using a tandem-labeled GFP-mRFP-LC3 system. GFP is sensitive to an acidic pH level; when it is fused with lysosomes, green fluorescence is quenched and red fluorescence is remained (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thus, in this assay, autophagosomes were labeled with yellow (GFP<sup>+</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup>) and their maturation into autolysosomes was expressed by red (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup>). The autophagy inducer, rapamycin, significantly increased the numbers of both yellow and red puncta. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) inhibits fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes. BafA1 application resulted in accumulation of yellow puncta. Meanwhile, HDE increased red signals, suggesting that HDE treatment increased the autophagy flux (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Additionally, the effect of HDE on apoptosis pathway was investigated by analyzing of several apoptosis markers including cleaved-PARP, cleaved-Caspase9 and cleaved-Caspase3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). HDE did not affect apoptotic signals at a concentration of up to 30 &#x000b5;g/ml at which autophagy was induced.</p><p>oxLDL induces ECs dysfunction and promotes endothelial lipid accumulation as well as leads to a deficiency of autophagy and accelerates atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The impaired autophagy in oxLDL-treated HUVECs was alleviated by HDE treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Under the same conditions, HDE reduced the fluorescen-ce intensity of DiI-oxLDL by almost 40% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), demon-strating that a lipid degradation was occurred during autophagy induction.</p></sec><sec><title>HDE inhibited foam cell formation in oxLDL-induced RAW264.7 macrophages via induction of autophagic activity</title><p>When macrophages absorb oxLDL, they form foam cells and promote atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is essential to inhibit formation of macrophage foam cells to effectively treat atherosclerosis. To investigate the effects of HDE on oxLDL-induced foam cell formation, macrophages were stimulated with oxLDL and stained lipid droplets using Oil Red O. HDE significantly suppressed oxLDL-induced foam cell formation at 30 &#x000b5;g/ml con-centration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages also plays a critical role in the formation of foam cells. HDE inhibited IL-6 secretion of oxLDL-induced marcrophage measured with an ELISA kit (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Previous study has shown that inhibition of autophagy leads to lipid accumulation in oxLDL-treated macrophage cells (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Our results demonstrated that HDE upregulated the conversion of LC3, while p62 levels were decreased in oxLDL stimulated marcrophage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is highly associated with lysosome activity (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, the effect of HDE on lysosome activity was examined using the lysosomotropic fluorescent dye, acridine orange, which stains acidic organelles in a pH-dependent manner. In the presence of oxLDL, HDE increased fluorescence intensity in RAW264.7 cells to about 1.5 times than that of the control. These results are consistent with the above results that HDE exhibits the autophagy induction activity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HDE attenuated formation of atherosclerotic plaque in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>To examine the role of HDE-induced autophagy on atherosclerotic plaque formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD). Mice were randomly divided into three groups and each was injected via the intraperitoneal route with vehicle or rapamycin (10 mg/kg) or HDE (50 mg/kg) every 2 d for 8 weeks. There were no differences in body weight among groups. This result indicated the non-toxic effects of HDE on mouse viability (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p>Triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins trigger atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Notably, HDE-treated mice (8.4 mg/g Liver) showed about 1.45 times less concentration of liver TG than that of the control (12.2 mg/g Liver) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the anti-atherogenic effects of HDE in the aorta, we isolated whole aortas of the <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and detected aortic atherosclerotic lesions stained with Oil Red O. Supplementation with HDE (15.3%) reduced atherosclerotic plaque burden by about 10% in the total aortas compared with HCD-fed control group (26.9%) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The relative lesions of the aortic sinus were reduced by approximately 1.5-fold in HDE-injected mice compared to vehicle (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p>We also stained aortic sinus sections with LC3 to examine whether HDE induced autophagy in atherosclerotic lesions. The LC3 staining results indicated that autophagy levels were increased in the HDE group, compared with the vehicle group (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results indicated that HDE had inhibitory effects on atherosclerotic plaque formation through increased autophagy activity in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study found that HHP under conditions of 550 MPa for 5 minutes efficiently killed microorganisms and increased extraction efficiency of raw danshen (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Typically, prokaryotes are more resistant to HHP than eukaryotes (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and our results are consistent with this finding. HHP technology can be used to safely sterilize food, efficiently extract active ingredients, and be widely applied in medicinal plant industry.</p><p>We also investigated the effects of HDE on autophagy induction activity to relieve atherosclerosis. When ECs function normally, autophagy in this cell type is involved in vascular lipid homeostasis (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) that can protect blood vessels against atherosclerotic lesion formation. However, endothelial dysfunction contributes to atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and mouse models of atherosclerosis reveal that deficiencies in endothelial autophagy stimulate plaque formation (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Thus, autophagy induction in ECs is a critical point in vascular-related disease. We found that HDE treatment (30 &#x000b5;g/ml) inhibited cell proliferation and induced autophagy in HUVECs, without toxic effects (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-E</xref>). However, because danshen is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), HDE may trigger apoptosis at high concentrations. In addition, HDE reduced DiI-oxLDL contents, suggesting that HDE exhibited lipid degradation via autophagy induction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Cryptotashinone (MW 296.4), one of the active principles of danshen, has autophagic and anti-atherosclerotic activities (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, we assumed that cryptotashinone could be responsible for biological activities of HDE.</p><p>This study revealed that HDE prevented foam cell formation by inhibiting macrophage oxLDL absorption and simultaneously increasing lysosomal activity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally, we found that administration of HDE reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in the <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse model (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This result indicated, for the first time, that danshen suppressed atherosclerosis via an autophagy-inducing mechanism.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that HHP was an effective method for raw danshen processing. The HHP treated raw danshen extract, HDE, suppressed foam cell formation via enhancement of autophagy activity. We also found anti-atherosclerotic activity of HDE at the <italic>in vivo</italic> level. Taken together, these results suggested that HDE could be developed as a potential naturally-derived alternative medicinal substance to ameliorate atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of danshen using HHP treatment</title><p>Raw danshen was obtained from a local agricultural products market (Incheon, Korea).

(A) MTT assay was performed to analyze the effect of HDE on cell proliferation. HDE decreased cell proliferation in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner (0-100 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l) for 72 h. (B) Autophagy was monitored on western blots of protein lysates of HUVECs following 30 &#x000b5;g/ml HDE treatments at 12, 24, and 48 h. (C) Cells were pretreated with chloroquine (25 &#x000b5;M) (or were not pretreated) for 1 h, before incubation in the presence or absence of 30 &#x000b5;g/ml HDE for 48 h. (D) HUVECs were transiently transfected with GFP-mRFP-LC3 and treated with rapamycin (10 &#x000b5;M) for 12 h, BafA1 (10 nM) for 3 h, or HDE (30 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 48 h, and then examined for changes in green and red fluorescence using a confocal microscope (Scale bar: 10 &#x000b5;m). The numbers of red puncta (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup>) versus yellow puncta (GFP<sup>+</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup>) per cell in each condition were quantified. (E) Effects of HDE on apoptosis at 24 h. (F,G) HUVECs were incubated with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml oxLDL or DiI-labeled oxLDL in the absence or presence of 30 &#x000b5;g/ml HDE. After 48h, impaired autophagy was rescued by HDE and the amount of oxLDL contents was quan-tified by DiI intensity (scale bar: 20 &#x000b5;m). Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM values.
