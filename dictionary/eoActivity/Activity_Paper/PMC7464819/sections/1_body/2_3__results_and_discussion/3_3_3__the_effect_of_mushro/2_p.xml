<p>The water extracts of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were able to inhibit protein glycation, exhibiting 113 and 83 mg AG/g fraction. As observed for the antioxidant activity, which was higher in the ethanol-insoluble fractions, higher levels of antiglycation activity was observed in the ethanol-insoluble fractions with respect to the water-soluble fractions, corresponding to 177 and 555 mg AG/g fraction for 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, respectively. There is no information on the antiglycation activity of these mushroom species. In previous studies, the antiglycation activities of a crude water-soluble fraction extracted from the sclerotia of 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and 
 <italic>Lignosus rhinocerus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were found to be 23 and 133 mg AG/g fraction. Compared to these latter studies, the antiglycation activities of the ethanol-insoluble fractions of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were found to be much higher. However, even higher antiglycation activity was observed for a polysaccharide purified from the fruiting body of 
 <italic>Boletus snicus</italic>, which was found to have the same antiglycation activity of aminoguanidine in the BSA/glucose model system, i.e., 1000 mg AG/g [
