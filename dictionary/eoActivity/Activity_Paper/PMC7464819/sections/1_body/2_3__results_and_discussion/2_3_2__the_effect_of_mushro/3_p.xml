<p>The levels of FC-reducing compounds for the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> before irradiation were 24.6 and 16.2 mg GAE/g of fraction, respectively. These values can be considered to be high according to the ranking defined previously in a screening study on 23 species of mushrooms, which reported levels of FC-reducing compounds of the aqueous extract in the range of from 2 to 37 mg GAE/g [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ethanol-insoluble fractions of both mushrooms showed a higher specific content of FC-reducing compounds than those of the respective water-soluble fraction for both mushrooms. This result may suggest that bioactive compounds partitioned mostly into the ethanol-insoluble fraction. UV irradiation decreased the FC-reducing compounds of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> by 20%, while the decrease was lower for 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> (7%).
