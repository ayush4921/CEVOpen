<p>The FRAP values for the water extracts of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> before irradiation were 82 and 208 µmol FeII/g fraction, respectively. As observed for FC and DPPH, higher specific FRAP values were present in the ethanol-insoluble fractions than in the water-soluble fractions for both mushroom species, with values of 222 and 473 µmol FeII/g fraction. This result may be related to the preferential partition of the bioactive compounds in the ethanol-insoluble fractions. A screening of 1943 plant-based foods revealed that the average FRAP value is 115.7 µmol FeII/g [

 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>.
