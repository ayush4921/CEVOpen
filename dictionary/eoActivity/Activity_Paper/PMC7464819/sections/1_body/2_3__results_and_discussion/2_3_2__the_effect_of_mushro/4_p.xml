<p>The DPPH values for the water extracts of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> before irradiation were 56 and 48 Âµmol TE/g fraction. As observed for the FC-reducing compounds, the specific DPPH values for the ethanol-insoluble fractions of both mushrooms were higher than those of the corresponding water-soluble fractions. The genus 
 <italic>Agaricus</italic> has been previously found to have the highest DPPH radical scavenging properties among the most widely appreciated cultivated mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. UV irradiation decreased the DPPH values of all fractions, except for the ethanol-insoluble fraction of 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>.
