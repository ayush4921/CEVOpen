 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, which are among the most cultivated mushroom species in the world, were able generate relevant amounts of vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> through UV irradiation. The concept that this latter technology can address the global need of vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> was highlighted by providing a scenario of possible future application of the vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> enriched mushroom in target foods. 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were also found to possess high antioxidant and antiglycation activities. Irradiation caused a decrease in antioxidant activity in both mushroom species but did not affect antiglycation activity. The ethanol-insoluble fraction of 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> was not affected by UV irradiation. Results from this research open up a new area of investigation. In fact, while the relevance of UV irradiation of mushrooms to address the global need of vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> has attracted a lot of research interest, the identification of the effects of irradiation on the mushroom matrices is still lacking and deserves particular attention.
