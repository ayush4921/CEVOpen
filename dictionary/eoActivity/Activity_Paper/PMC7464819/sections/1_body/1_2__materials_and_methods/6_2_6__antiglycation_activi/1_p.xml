<p>The antiglycation activity was determined on the water-soluble fractions and the ethanol-insoluble fractions redissolved in water, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 100 μL of sample extracts or standard diluted in water, 900 μL of 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 0.02% sodium azide, 300 μL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (50 mg/mL of BSA in phosphate buffer) and 300 μL of fructose solution (1.25 M fructose in phosphate buffer). A BSA solution (blank sample) and control reaction without sample addition were prepared in parallel. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days in the dark and then analyzed for fluorescence on a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Milan, Italy) with an excitation/emission wavelength pair of 350/420 nm and 5 nm slit width, read against phosphate buffer. Aminoguanidine was used as a positive control. For each sample extract, 3–4 dilutions were assessed in duplicate. Dose–response curves were built reporting % inhibition of BSA glycation as a function of sample or standard concentration. The results were expressed as milligrams of aminoguanidine equivalents (AG) per gram of dry fractions.
