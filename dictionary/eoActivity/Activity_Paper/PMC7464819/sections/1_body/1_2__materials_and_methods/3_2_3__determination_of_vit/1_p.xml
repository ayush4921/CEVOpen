<p>Vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> and ergosterol were extracted in triplicate from non-irradiated and irradiated mushroom powders after saponification as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To check the recovery, preliminary samples of mushroom powder were added with 0.1 mL of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> (400 mg/L in methanol). The observed recovery was always higher than 90%. Then, samples were analyzed without vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> in order to check the possible presence of vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> photoproducts with elution times close to that of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> and ergosterol were identified by a previously published procedure [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A Shimadzu HPLC system (Kyoto, Japan), including an LC-20 AD pump and an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector operated by Labsolution Software, was used. The column was a C18 Sunfire (4.6 mm × 250 mm × 5 mm, Waters, Milan, Italy) and the mobile phase was methanol:water (95:5,

 <italic>v</italic>), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. The retention times for vitamin D
 <sub>2,</sub> vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> and ergosterol were 19.5, 20.5 and 23 min, respectively. The content of vitamin D
 <sub>2,</sub> vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> and ergosterol were calculated on the basis of the calibration curve of pure compounds.
