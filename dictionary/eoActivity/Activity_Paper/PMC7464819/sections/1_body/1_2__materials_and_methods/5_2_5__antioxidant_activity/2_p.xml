<p>The free radical scavenging capacity of the water-soluble fractions and the ethanol-insoluble fractions redissolved in water was evaluated using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6 trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical (DPPH) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) was used as a reference antioxidant and the results were expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of dry fractions.
