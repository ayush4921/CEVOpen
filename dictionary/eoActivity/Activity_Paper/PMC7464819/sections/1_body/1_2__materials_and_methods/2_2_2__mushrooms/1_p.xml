 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were purchased from the market. The irradiation treatment was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, about 10 kg of body fruits were used for each mushroom type, cut into 4 mm slices, spread on an oven rack in a single layer and air-dried at 37 °C for 48 h. During the first 24 h of air-drying, the mushrooms were irradiated using two fluorescent lamps installed at 30 cm above the mushroom layer. In accordance to most of the previous studies so far performed [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a UV-B source was chosen for the irradiation. The lamps delivered a UV-B (280–315 nm) irradiance of 0.4 W/m
 <sup>2</sup>. At the end of the process, about 1 kg of dried mushroom was obtained from each mushroom type and the product was grinded to a fine powder using a Thermomix TM 31 (Vorwerk Contempora S.r.l., Milan, Italy). Control 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> powders were obtained by processing mushrooms with the same drying and grinding procedure without UV irradiation.
