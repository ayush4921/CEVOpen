    "The nutritional and antinutrient composition of <i>Heteromorpha arborescens</i> (Spreng.) Cham. & Schltdl. leaves was reported in this study. Proximate analysis revealed the presence of 8.5% total ash, 4.92% crude fat, 8.41% moisture, 15.74% crude protein, 21.48% crude fiber, 40.95% carbohydrates, and 271.04 kcal/100 g energy value. Mineral analysis showed that <i>H. arborescens</i> leaves are very rich in K, Ca, and Fe. Considerable amounts of Mg, Mn, Na, P, Cu, and Zn were also present. Vitamin analysis showed that the plant has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E. The antinutrients evaluated were phytate, oxalate, saponin, and alkaloids, all of which were below toxic levels except for saponin which was observed at moderately high level. The results credibly indicate that <i>H. arborescens</i> leaves are nutrient-rich and can contribute effectively to the daily nutrient requirements alongside its therapeutic properties."
