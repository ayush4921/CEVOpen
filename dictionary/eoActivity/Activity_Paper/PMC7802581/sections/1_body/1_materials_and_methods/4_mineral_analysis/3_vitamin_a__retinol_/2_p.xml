<p>Vitamin A content of the leaves was determined as described by Famewo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). 1.0 g of the pulverized sample was soaked in 20 ml of petroleum ether for 1 hr. The mixture was filtered and evaporated to dryness, and 0.2 ml solution of chloroform‐acetic anhydride was then added to the residue. Thereafter, 2 ml of TCA‐chloroform (1:1 v/v) was added to the solution, and absorbance was measured at 620 nm using UV‐3000PC. The standard (Retinol) was prepared in the same manner with gradient concentration ranging from 0.2 mg/ml ‐ 1.0 mg/ml. The vitamin A content of the sample was determined as retinol equivalent in mg/g, from the standard curve from the equation:
