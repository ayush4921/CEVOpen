<p>Crude fibre of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was determined as described by Unuofin et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Briefly, 2 g of the pulverized sample was treated with 100 ml of 1.25% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4,</sub> and the solution was boiled for 30 min and filtered under pressure, and the residue was washed with boiling water. This residue was further treated and boiled with 100 ml of 1.25% NaOH solution. The final residue was then dried at 100°C and cooled in a desiccator and weighed (
