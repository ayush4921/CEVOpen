<p>Phytate content was determined as previously described by Talabi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Briefly, 2 g of the sample was soaked in 100 ml of 2% HCL for 3 hr and filtered with Whatman no 1 filter paper. 25 ml of the filtrate was thereafter transferred into another conical flask and to it; 5 ml of 0.3% ammonium thiocyanate solution plus 53.3 ml of distilled water was added. The solution was titrated against standard iron III chloride solution (0.001 95 g of iron per mL) until a reddish brown color which persisted for 5 min was obtained. Phytate content was calculated as: Phytate (%) = Titer value × 0.001 95 × 1.19 × 100.
