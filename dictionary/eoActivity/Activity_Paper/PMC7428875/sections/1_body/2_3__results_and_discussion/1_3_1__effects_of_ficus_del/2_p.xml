<p>The same trend of inhibition of AGEs formation was demonstrated in 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties where at a concentration of 0.50â€‰mg/mL, FDK showed the highest fold of inhibition at 9.66 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) followed by FDB (9.00, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDI (8.24,

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and FDD; 6.73 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively, compared to the control at 14 days of incubation. Meanwhile, at 28 days of incubation, the highest inhibition of AGEs formation was found in FDI (5.14), FDK (5.09), FDB (4.93), FDM (4.88), FDA (4.68), FDT (4.55), and FDD (4.55) by the fold of inhibition, respectively, compared with the control. All varieties showed significant inhibition of AGEs formation with
