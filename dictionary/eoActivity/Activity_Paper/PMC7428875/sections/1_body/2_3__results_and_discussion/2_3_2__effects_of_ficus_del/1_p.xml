<p>The effects of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties on glycation-induced protein oxidation were done by measuring the inhibition of protein carbonyl formation and thiol groups. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2</xref> shows that the inhibition of protein carbonyl formation was significantly increased after 28 days of incubation. Quercetin is a positive control and showed a 3.04-fold of inhibition (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) at a concentration of 0.50â€‰mg/mL. FDT was found to possess the highest fold of inhibition at 1.76 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) followed by FDK (1.74; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDI (1.53; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDB (1.48; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDA (1.41; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDD (1.38; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and FDM (1.36; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively, when compared with the control at 28 days of incubation.
