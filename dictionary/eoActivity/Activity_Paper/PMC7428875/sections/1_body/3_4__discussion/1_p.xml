<p>The present research demonstrates the effects of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> methanolic extracts from seven varieties on various parameters involved in glycation and protein oxidation. Glycation is a process of nonenzymatic reaction between reducing sugars (fructose or glucose) and amino groups of protein to form a Schiff base complex. The Schiff base formation is not stable and rearranged to produce irreversible Amadori products before being involved in further reactions to produce highly reactive carbonyl compounds. The dicarbonyls intermediates can react with amino, sulfhydryl, and guanidine functional groups resulting in browning, denaturation, and cross-linking of the targeted proteins [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Besides, the dicarbonyl compounds can combine with lysine and arginine functional groups to form nonfluorescent advanced glycation end products such as 
 <italic>N</italic>-carboxymethyllysine (CML) [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. AGEs are complex materials that can be classified as fluorescent (pentosidine, crosslines, and imidazolones) and nonfluorescent (pyrraline, 
 <italic>N</italic>-carboxymethyllysine, and 
 <italic>N</italic>-carboxyethyllysine) cross-linking [
