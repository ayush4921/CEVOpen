<p>The correlation analysis of TPC, DPPH, reducing power, and antiglycation activity was conducted using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Pearson's correlation coefficient was positively high when 0.6 ≤ 
 <italic>r</italic> ≤ 1 and negatively high when −0.6 ≤ 
 <italic>r</italic> ≤ −1. The results showed that a strong positive correlation between TPC and DPPH was found in FDK (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1), FDI (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1), FDA (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1), and FDD (0.7) where FDK and FDI showed high phenolic content with high DPPH scavenging activity. Meanwhile, the FDA and FDD showed low TPC and antioxidant activity levels. FDT showed a weak correlation at 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.36 with average levels of TPC and DPPH scavenging activity. There was a negative correlation between total phenolic content and DPPH scavenging effects of FDB and FDM with 
 <italic>r</italic> = −1. Even though FDB had high levels of phenolic content and DPPH activity, FDM had a low level of TPC with low DPPH scavenging activity.
