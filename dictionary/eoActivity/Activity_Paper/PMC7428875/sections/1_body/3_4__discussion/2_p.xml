<p>Quercetin is a flavonoid plant pigment, a potent hydroxyl radical, and superoxide anion scavenger. It is an established quencher for reactive oxygen species generated by any physical or chemical action that suppressed the rise in fluorescence of AGE formation [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. During the inhibition of AGE formation, quercetin showed stronger inhibitory effects compared to aminoguanidine [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Quercetin was reported to inhibit the initial state of glycation by the low levels of HbA1c found in quercetin-treated hemoglobin samples and inhibited the post-Amadori glycation in human serum albumin-glucose and human serum albumin-methylglyoxal assays [
