<p>It was proposed that the inhibition of glycated end product formation is associated with the ability of the antioxidant properties of the plant extracts to scavenge free radicals that were formed during the Maillard reaction in the glycation process [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the protein glycation and oxidation process may interact synergistically in the progress of diabetic complications [
