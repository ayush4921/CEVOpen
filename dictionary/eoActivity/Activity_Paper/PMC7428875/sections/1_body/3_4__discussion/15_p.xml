<p>A comparison of TPC and antiglycation activity (1.25 mg/mL extract) at 28 days of incubation revealed a positive correlation in some of the extracts. The highest correlation was found in FDM (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1.0) followed by FDD (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.99). Both FDM and FDD showed low phenolic content (compared to other varieties) with moderate antiglycation properties (32.95% and 66.74%, respectively). Even though a weak correlation was seen in FDK (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.38) and FDT (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.23), they possessed high TPC levels with good inhibition of glycation activity at 65.91% and 64.1% accordingly. Meanwhile, negative correlations were observed in the FDA (
 <italic>r</italic> = −1.0), FDB (
 <italic>r</italic> = −1.0), quercetin (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.97), and FDI (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.37). Apart from that, FDB was observed to have the highest phenolic content and glycation inhibitory activity among the extracts. The antioxidative properties of the phenolic compounds may be a major factor contributing to the prevention of AGE formation in plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] have reported that polyphenolic compounds in the medicinal plants play a protective role against sugar-induced protein glycation and oxidation. In the present study, 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts contained phenolic compounds and possessed a reducing power as well as DPPH radical scavenging activity. 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts may reduce the accumulation of advanced glycation end products by scavenging free radicals formed by autooxidation of sugars and/or oxidative degradation of Amadori products.
