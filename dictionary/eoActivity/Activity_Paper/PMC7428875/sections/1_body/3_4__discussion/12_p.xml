<p>The antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds in plants is primarily due to their redox characteristics, which enable them to serve as reducing agents, singlet oxygen quenchers, hydrogen donators, and metal chelators [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The highest phenolic content of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts was found in FDB (299.78 ± 5.85 mg GAE/g) followed by FDI (190.30 ± 3.08 mg GAE/g), FDK (180.47 ± 3.25 mg GAE/g), FDT (163.28 ± 7.83 mg GAE/g), FDD (103.84 ± 5.93 mg GAE/g), FDM (78.44 ± 2.88 mg GAE/g), and FDA (70.90 ± 3.32 mg GAE/g). Quercetin was used as a standard reference and exhibited 1297.94 ± 17.66 mg GAE/g. This study was coherent with the findings by Abdullah et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] where TPC was found to be higher in FDT compared to FDD. A study by Mohd et al. [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] demonstrated the TPC values of the extracts to be in the following order: FDD &gt; FDI &gt; FDK &gt; FDT &gt; FDB &gt; FDM &gt; FDA. This pattern is very similar to the present findings with one exception; in this study, FDB showed the highest activity and FDD was in fifth place. The total phenolic content of methanolic FDA (fruit) was found to be 245.2 mg GAE/g [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Misbah et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] reported that for the phenolic content of the fruit, the FDA was higher compared to FDK. The previous results were in contrast with the present findings; it is noted that they were using a different part of the 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> plant and with a different extraction solution.
