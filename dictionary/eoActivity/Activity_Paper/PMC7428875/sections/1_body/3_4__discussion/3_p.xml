<p>In this study, the inhibition of AGE formation was demonstrated to be the highest in FDI with 82.30% followed by FDK (81.50%), FDB (78.92%), FDM (78.15%), FDA (74.99%), FDT (72.93%), and FDD (72.83%) at the concentration of 5.0 mg/mL after 28 days of incubation. The results showed the inhibition of AGEs formation with FDI (5.14), FDK (5.09), FDB (4.93), FDM (4.88), FDA (4.68), FDT (4.55), and FDD (4.55) by fold, respectively, compared with the control. All varieties of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts inhibited significantly the AGE formation with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Inhibition of AGE formation in quercetin (5.0 mg/mL) was found significantly at 92.59% and 92.63% at 14 and 28 days which evoked 12.27- (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 5.78- (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) fold of inhibition, respectively, compared to the control of the same day. The results clearly showed that 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts (0.078–0.125 mg/mL) significantly reduced the formation of AGEs in the BSA-fructose system throughout the study.
