<p>The free radical scavenging activity is reflective of the donation ability of hydrogen atoms or electrons in biological structures and configuration of the antioxidant compounds of the extracts. DPPH is a stable free radical compound and has been extensively applied to study the ability of free radical scavenging in natural products [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] which converts the purple color of DPPH radical to yellow DPPH-H at 517 nm. In other words, DPPH free radical scavenging activity refers to the amount of antioxidants needed to inhibit the DPPH radical concentration by half in 15 minutes (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values indicated the highest antioxidant capacity of the extract. As DPPH radical is a stable compound, it is not affected by any side reactions, for instance, enzyme inhibition and metal chelation activity [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Among the 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts, FDB showed the highest scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 66.81 ± 4.32 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) followed by FDK (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 76.80 ± 4.64 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), FDI (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 78.96 ± 6.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), FDT (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 103.95 ± 9.44 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), FDD (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 179.68 ± 6.81 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), FDA (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 203.92 ± 0.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and FDM (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 288.04 ± 11.43 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 1.3 ± 0.74 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 4.98 ± 1.58 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) were used as a standard reference in this study. Previous studies revealed that a fruit sample of aqueous extract, water fraction, and ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>kunstleri</italic> showed a DPPH radical scavenging activity ranges from IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 111.20–678.18 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 148.02–499.93 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The cultivated and wild leaves extracts of 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> have strong DPPH scavenging activity as compared to its stem extract [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Abdullah et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have reported that a good percentage of antioxidant activity of DPPH was found in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>trengganuensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>deltoidea</italic>. Thus, the results of DPPH radical scavenging activity for methanolic 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts in this study showed a significant effect, as with previous studies.
