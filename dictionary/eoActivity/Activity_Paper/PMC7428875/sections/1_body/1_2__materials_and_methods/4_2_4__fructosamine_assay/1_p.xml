<p>The fructosamine level was determined using a nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay by Ardestani and Yazdanparast [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An amount of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of glycated samples was incubated with 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.5 mM NBT in 100 mM carbonate buffer (pH 10.4) at 37°C. The absorbance was recorded at 530 nm using a Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). The level of fructosamine was determined using a different absorption time point at 10 and 15 minutes of 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-fructose (1-DMF) standard curve at a concentration of 0.31–5.0 mM.
