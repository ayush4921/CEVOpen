<p>Radical scavenging activity of the extracts against stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) was determined using the method by Shimada et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of crude extracts (1 mg/mL) was dissolved in a solution of DMSO : ethanol (5% :95%). Then, the samples were added with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DPPH (0.2 mM) dissolved in ethanol and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. The absorbance of the mixture was determined at 517 nm using a Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). Ascorbic acid and quercetin were used as a positive control. The ability of the samples to scavenge DPPH radicals was determined as IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
