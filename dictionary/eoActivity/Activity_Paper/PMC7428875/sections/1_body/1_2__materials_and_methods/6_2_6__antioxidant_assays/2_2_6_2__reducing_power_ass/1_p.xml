<p>The reducing power assay was determined according to the Oyaizu method with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A total of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of samples (1.0 mg/mL) was dissolved in DMSO : H
 <sub>2</sub>O (5% : 95%). 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6) and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 1% (w/v) of potassium ferricyanide were mixed into the vials and incubated at 50°C for 20 minutes. After incubation, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 10% TCA was added to the sample solution and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then, 62.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of supernatant was mixed with 62.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L deionized water and 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.1% (w/v) ferric chloride. The absorbance was read at 700 nm using a Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). Ascorbic acid and quercetin were used as a positive control in the experiment.
