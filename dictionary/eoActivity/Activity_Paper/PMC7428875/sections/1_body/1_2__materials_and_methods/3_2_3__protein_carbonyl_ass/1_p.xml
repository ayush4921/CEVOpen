<p>The protein carbonyl content assay was conducted using a standard protocol by Levine and colleagues with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A total of 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) (10 mM in 2.5 M HCl) was added with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of glycated samples and incubated for 60 minutes in the dark. After incubation, 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 20% (w/v) TCA was added to the solution for protein precipitation and left at 4°C for 5 minutes. After that, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the protein pellet was rinsed with a mixture of ethanol/ethyl acetate (1 : 1) three times and finally resuspended in 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance was captured at 370 nm using Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). The results were expressed as a percentage of inhibition (%).
