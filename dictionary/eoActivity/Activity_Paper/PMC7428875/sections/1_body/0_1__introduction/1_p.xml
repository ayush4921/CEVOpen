<p>Diabetes mellitus is a common disease characterized by hyperglycemia that resulted in insulin deficiency or insulin resistance in the human body. Increased glucose levels in the blood lead to the development of advanced glycation end products (AGEs); these can result in many complications of diabetes. During protein glycation, amino groups of protein react with aldehydic or keto groups of reducing sugars to form Schiff bases before rearranging to form Amadori products. The products are stable compounds and undergo a series of irreversible reactions to form highly reactive substances such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, dicarbonyl compounds, and 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG). Finally, these reactive carbonyls combine with the amino, sulfhydryl, and guanidine functional group of intracellular and extracellular proteins to form stable AGEs. This series of reactions produces irreversible AGEs products such as crosslinks, aromatic heterocycles, and oxidized compounds [
