 <italic>(3) Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP)</italic>. The working reagent was prepared by mixing acetate buffer (25 mL, 30 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (2.5 mL, 10 mM), and iron chloride (2.5 mL, mM) and incubated at 37°C (15 minutes). Concentrations between 50 mg/L and 500 mg/L of ascorbic acid produced a calibration curve [
