 <bold>Lymphocyte culture preparation</bold>. For the culturing of human peripheral lymphocytes, RPMI 1640 (HIMEDIA) that was supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and fetal calf serum was used. Phytohemagglutinin (HIMEDIA) used mediated the cell proliferation. The culture was filtered (cellulose acetate 0.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>m pore, Sartorios) and incubated for 72 hours after the addition of plasma (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL). This culture was then activated by adding lipopolysaccharide (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) and incubated for 24 hours. After activation, Combretin A, Combretin B, and diclofenac were added in different concentrations (100, 200, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and incubated for 24 hours. These are then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 6000 rpm for sedimentation. The supernatant was removed, and cell lysis buffer was added (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) and again centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes [
