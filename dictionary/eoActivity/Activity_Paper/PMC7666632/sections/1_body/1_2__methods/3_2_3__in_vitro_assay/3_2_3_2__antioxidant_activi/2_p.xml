 <italic>(2) ABTS•+ Decolorization Assay</italic>. ABTS (7 mM) in a volume of 9.5 mL was taken and mixed with 245 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of potassium persulfate (100 mM) that is supplemented to 10 mL with distilled water to form a working solution. This solution is left for 18 hours in dark at room temperature; after that, potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) was introduced until an absorbance (734 nm) of about 0.70 ± 0.02 was obtained. The tested compounds were diluted in methanol to obtain concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL. 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a sample was mixed with 2.99 mL of working solution and recorded at 734 nm [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The control was prepared by adding 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of methanol in place of the sample. The percentage of antioxidant activity was determined using the following formula:
