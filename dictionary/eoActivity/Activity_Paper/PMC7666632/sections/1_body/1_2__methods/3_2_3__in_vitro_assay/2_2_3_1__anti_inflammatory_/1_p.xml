 <italic>(1) Inhibition of Protein Denaturation</italic>. For the evaluation of anti-inflammatory properties, the protocol described by Padmanabhan and Jangle [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was used with some modifications. One milliliter of test compounds or diclofenac sodium in different concentrations (100, 200, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was added to 1 mL aqueous solution of 5% bovine serum that was then incubated for 15 minutes at 27°C. Distilled water and BSA mixture were used as control. For protein denaturation, the whole mixture was placed at 70°C for about 10 minutes. When the mixture is cooled down to room temperature, the activity of each mixture was measured at 660 nm. All tests were performed in triplicate. The following formula was used to study percent inhibition:
