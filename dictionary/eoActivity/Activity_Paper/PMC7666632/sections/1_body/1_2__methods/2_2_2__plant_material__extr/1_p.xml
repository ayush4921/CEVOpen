<p>The plant material, referenced to the national herbarium of Cameroon with number 30309/H.N.C. in the name of 
 <italic>Combretum fragrans</italic> (Combretaceae), was used to isolate the pure compounds tested in this study. The fresh leaves of this plant were harvested in the city of Maroua located in the far north region (Cameroon) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These leaves were macerated in methanol; the extract obtained was successively fractionated in hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH. AcOEt fraction was subjected to conventional separation methods, and the isolated compounds (Combretin A and Combretin B) were described by usual spectroscopic methods [
