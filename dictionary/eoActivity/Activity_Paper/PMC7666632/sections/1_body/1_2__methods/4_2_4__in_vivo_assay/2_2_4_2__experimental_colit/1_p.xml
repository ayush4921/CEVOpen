<p>For the induction of experimental colitis, 4% DSS was used. Briefly, after an habituation period of one week, mice (42) were randomly divided into 7 groups (6 mice/group): untreated (no DSS), 4% DSS+2.5% DMSO/2.5% tween, 4% DSS+prednisolone (4 mg/kg), 4% DSS+Combretin A (25 mg/kg), 4% DSS+Combretin A (50 mg/kg), 4% DSS+Combretin B (25 mg/kg), and 4% DSS+Combretin B (50 mg/kg). The untreated group received distilled water without DSS. For other groups, water bottles were filled with 4% DSS. Combretin A, Combretin B, prednisolone, and distilled water were administered orally from the 5
 <sup>th</sup> day after the onset of colitis induction by DSS.
