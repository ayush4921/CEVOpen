<p>In order to carry out scientific studies on inflammatory bowel disease, several animal models have been developed such as models transferred by adoption, chemically induced models, genetically modified models, and spontaneous models [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The DSS-induced colitis model (Dextran Sodium Sulfate), which is a very simple and reproducible model, is commonly used to assess the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and also to test new treatments potentially effective against ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, concerning this model, 1 to 5% of DSS is added to the drinking water which is given to the animals for several days; after a few days, animals develop symptoms such as diarrhea, loss of body weight, ulcers, bleeding, and mucosal lesions that are characteristics of human ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These symptoms can be relieved with many drug treatments; however, these different modern treatments have many side effects and increased tolerance in patients with ulcerative colitis [
