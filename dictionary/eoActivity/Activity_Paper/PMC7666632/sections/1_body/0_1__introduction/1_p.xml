<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases, mainly represented by ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are chronic pathologies of the cell-mediated digestive tract which are accompanied by significant recurrent and chronic inflammation [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. People with inflammatory bowel disease present a significant dysfunction of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and COX plays a very important role in the development and maintenance of ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In mammals, COX has two isoforms, COX-1 which is constitutive and COX-2 which is induced by the inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory lesions trigger innate immune responses resulting in the production of chemokines and cytokines (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>) by intestinal epithelium cells and the macrophages that will be responsible for the development of the adaptive immune system [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, in the absence of treatment, intestinal lesions can occur following an exaggeration of the inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that several natural compounds which have the capacity to inhibit the production of cytokines and the activity of COX-2 have an important therapeutic efficacy against inflammatory bowel diseases [
