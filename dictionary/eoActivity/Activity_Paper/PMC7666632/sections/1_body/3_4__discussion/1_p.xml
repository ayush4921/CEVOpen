<p>In the present study, the results indicate that Combretin A and B possess good anti-inflammatory properties; however, Combretin B showed the best anti-inflammatory activity on several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models such as inhibition of protein denaturation, inhibition of 5-LOX, and COX inhibition. Several anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac, phenylbutazone, salicylic acid, and many more have shown an important ability to dose-dependently inhibit heat-induced protein denaturation [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The denaturation mechanism is involved in the alteration of electrostatic force, hydrogen, hydrophobic, and disulfide bonds [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, commonly used for the management of inflammatory conditions, have the ability to bind to plasma albumin, preventing or inhibiting thermal denaturation of albumin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, in this study, diclofenac, used as a reference substance, significantly inhibited the denaturation of proteins. Known as a truly complex physiopathological response, inflammation involves a large production of free radicals derived from neutrophils, nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), prostaglandins, and cytokines during its process [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases involves the overproduction of substances such as prostaglandin I2, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane A2, and leukotrienes from arachidonic acid through two metabolic pathways, the COX (cyclooxygenase) pathway and the 5-LOX (5-lipoxygenase) pathway [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Substances capable of inhibiting the activities of COX and 5-LOX resulting in a significant reduction in the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins produce a large spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity and can be considered as having an excellent pharmacological safety profile in the clinic [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of COX which rapidly and reversibly and/or irreversibly seizes the active site of COX and acts as a competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid oxygenation [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The inhibitory activity of Combretin A and B on protein denaturation, the cyclooxygenase pathway, and 5-lipoxygenase show that these two compounds are capable of significantly inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which confers to these two compounds anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, our previous work has shown that Combretin A and B are able to inhibit carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and to inhibit the production of ROS, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
