<p>Antioxidant substances as well as free radical scavengers are very often used to mitigate certain inflammatory pathologies; since, during the inflammatory process, there is a large production of free radicals that have the power to maintain the skin process [

 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex reduction in a ferrous form (ABTS test), the ion reduction reaction compounds with the formation of a ferric tripyridyltriazine complex (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-TPTZ) (FRAP test), and the radical reduction reaction DPPH [

During the development of the inflammatory process, macrophages are activated with overproduction of NO from nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which will be responsible for an increase in vasodilation, vascular permeability, endothelial and tissue lesions, and development of inflammation. In addition to its important proinflammatory role in the development of chronic inflammation, NO is a diffusible free radical, considered a pleiotropic inhibitor in neuronal signaling, regulation of cell-mediated toxicity, relaxation of smooth muscle, platelet inhibition, and as an effector molecule in biological systems such as antimicrobial and antitumor activities, neuronal messages, or vasodilation [

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the direct NO scavenging process may be responsible for NO deletion by both compounds.
