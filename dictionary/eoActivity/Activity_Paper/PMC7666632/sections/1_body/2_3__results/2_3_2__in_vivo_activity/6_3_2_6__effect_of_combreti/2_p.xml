<p>Histological examination of the colonic sections under light microscopy revealed that the untreated DSS mice exhibited typical inflammatory changes in the colonic architecture; the damage was assessed from histopathological scores for the colon (range 0 to 9). Compared with the normal control, the negative control mice showed a significant increase in the histopathological score of the disease (
