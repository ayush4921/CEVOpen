 <italic>(1) Inhibition of Protein Denaturation</italic>. Based on the results of this study, Combretin A and B effectively inhibited protein denaturation caused by heat. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table"> Table 1</xref> thus shows a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) inhibition of 63.93% and 87.78%, respectively, for Combretin A and B while diclofenac sodium at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL produced an inhibition of 89.20%.
