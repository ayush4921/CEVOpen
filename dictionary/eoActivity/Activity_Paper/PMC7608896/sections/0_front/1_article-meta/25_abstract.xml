 <p>Plant species of the Poaceae family are not only used as fodder and forage but also contribute substantially to the treatment of various health disorders, particularly in livestock. Consequently, the present study was aimed to document the therapeutic uses of Poaceae practiced by the inhabitants of the Punjab Province for the treatment of various veterinary health disorders. Semi structured interviews, group discussion and field walks were conducted to collect the data. Quantitative indices including cultural significance index (CSI), relative frequency of citations (RFC), fidelity level (FL), relative popularity level (RPL), and Jaccard Index (JI) were used for the data analysis. Traditional uses of 149 species belonging to 60 genera and 16 tribes of 5 sub families of Poaceae were recorded. Whole plants and leaves were the most consistently used parts with 40.94 and 29.53%. The plants were mainly given orally as fodder (59 reports) without processing followed by decoction (35 reports). Most of the species were employed to treat infectious diseases (25.93%), and digestive disorders (14.10%). 
  <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> had the highest CSI, RFC and RPL levels at 8.00, 0.96, 1.00, respectively, followed by 
  <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and 
  <italic>Poa annua</italic>. Likewise, 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>aestivum</italic> and 
  <italic>Saccharum spontaneum</italic> had 100% FL and ROP. Jaccard index ranged from 12.25 to 0.37. Twelve plant species namely 
  <italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic> (anti-inflammatory), 
  <italic>Pennisetum lanatum</italic> (improve bull fertility), 
  <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (glandular secretion), 
  <italic>Sorghum saccharatum</italic> and 
  <italic>Themeda triandra</italic> (malaria), 
  <italic>Aristida funiculate</italic> (anticancer), 
  <italic>Koeleria argentia</italic> (skin allergies), 
  <italic>Tetrapogon villosus</italic> (antibacterial), 
  <italic>Cynodon radiatus</italic> (eyes infection), 
  <italic>Sporobolus nervosa</italic> (Jaundice), 
  <italic>Enneapogon persicus</italic> (antifungal), and 
  <italic>Panicum repens</italic> (dysfunctional cattle organs) were reported for the first time, with novel ethnoveterinary uses. The inhabitants of the study area had a strong association with their surrounding plant diversity and possessed significant knowledge on therapeutic uses of Poaceae to treat various health disorders in animals. Plant species with maximum cultural and medicinal values could be a potential source of novel drugs to cure health disorders in animals and human as well.
