A low degree of similarity index of our study with other studies conducted in same province or in other parts of Pakistan indicated that either a little attention has been paid towards grasses in these studies and zero (0) percent similarity index show that grasses were totally ignored. Therefore, this study represents the first comprehensive report on ethno-veterinary knowledge of indigenous grasses of the whole province of Punjab.
