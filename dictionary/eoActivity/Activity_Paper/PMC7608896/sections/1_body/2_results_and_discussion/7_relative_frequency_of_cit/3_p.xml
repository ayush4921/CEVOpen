 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, such plants must be conserved on priority basis due to the threat of over exploitation and extensive use by the community [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Values of RFC are very dynamic as it changes with area to area and depends on the folk knowledge of the native people. It is well known that species with low RFC values are not necessarily less important [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Their low values may represent the low knowledge of the local people especially the younger ones, who are not aware of the uses of these species.
