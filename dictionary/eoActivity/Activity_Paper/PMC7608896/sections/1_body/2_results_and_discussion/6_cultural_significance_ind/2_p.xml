<p>The highest CSI value was found for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>aestivum</italic> (8.00), which is extensively used in anti-cancer and gastrointestinal disorders in livestock. The other 6 species with CSI were 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> (0.81), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> (7.69), 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dactylon</italic> (7.34), 
 <italic>A</italic>.
 <italic>sativa</italic> (7.33), 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>officinarum</italic> (7.14) and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>mays</italic> (6.77). These species were highly cited and preferentially used by the informants to be used in therapeutic and other purposes but also cultivated and used different kind of management tools. The preference and frequency of use and quality of medicinal use are the factors that determine the cultural importance of plants. The high CSI values of plant species also reflect the fact that more a species is available to the users of a community for medicinal purpose, it becomes more important. For instance, 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>aestivum</italic> is well known herb which is mentioned in Ayurveda herbal system. It has been used in many dietary supplements and is extremely valuable for treating various ailments such as kidney malfunctioning, immune modulator, joint swelling and bacterial infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Furthermore, species reported with high cultural significance are not only important for ethnic groups of Punjab but also for the other ethnic group of the world. Therefore, these species have accumulated a lot of traditional knowledge that has been transmitted through direct experience over the time in next generations. Grasses represented with lowest CSI values were, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>temulentum</italic> (0.13), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>dilatatum</italic> (0.14), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>typhoidum</italic> (0.15), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>punctatum</italic> (0.15), 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sterilis</italic> (0.15), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>atrosanguineum</italic> (0.16), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>strigosa</italic> (0.16), 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>villosus</italic> (0.16), 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>persicus</italic> (0.17), 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>arabicus</italic> (0.17), 
 <italic>D</italic>. aristatum (0.17), 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>fugax</italic> (0.17), and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>mutica</italic> (0.18). The results obtained in our study are in agreement with the study of Wong [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], who observed that plants which are not easily available are less popular in the community, hence have lower CSI value. Nevertheless, Albuquerque et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] proposed a weak correlation between use and availability of plants and further suggested that species with greater cultural significance tend to become vulnerable or rare locally.
