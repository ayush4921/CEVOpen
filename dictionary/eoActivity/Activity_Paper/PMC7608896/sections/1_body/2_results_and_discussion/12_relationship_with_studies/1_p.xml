<p>In comparison of our study with other studies form Pakistan, the JI ranged from 12.25 to 0.37 (
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The highest JI (12.25) was found with previous report from Central Punjab [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], followed by the study conducted in Layyah, Punjab, Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] with 5.61 JI, Swat, KPK, Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] with 3.63 JI and Hafizabad Punjab, Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with 3.63 JI. The lowest JI such as 0.37, 0.46, and 0.47 was recorded from Abbatobad, KPK, Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Hungu, Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0241705.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Similarly, 11 species are common between our study and a study form Layyah, Punjab, Pakistan that reported a total of 78 species [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] with 7 species having similar uses and 5 species having dissimilar uses. 8 species, in our study, were found common to the studies reported from Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan [
