<p>Data were collected from 271 informants (167 females and 104 males) of ages between 20 to 80 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including domestic cattle holders (44.64%), nomads (29.52%), and farm cattle holders (25.83%), and Traditional practitioners (TP) were classified into five groups based on their experience, such TP with less than 3 years of experience (34), 3–5 years (66). 5–10 years (61), 10–15 years (55), and more than 15 years (55). About, 18.08% informants were illiterate while others were educated up to master and PhD level. The plant citations were grouped in three education groups such as Illiterate, middle (primary to secondary), and high (secondary to PhD) and are represented through Venn diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241705.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The total plant species cited by each group were roughly equal to 112, 76 and 46 for the illiterate, middle and high education groups, respectively. About 54 species were only cited by illiterate people, 29 by middle, and 7 by highly educated people. Furthermore, there were common citations between different groups: 25 between illiterate and middle, 12 between illiterate and high, and 6 between middle and high. A total of 21 species were used by all three groups. From this analysis, it is easy to perceive that the level of indigenous knowledge on medicinal uses of the plant species of family Poaceae was more prevalent in illiterate participants and less educated people, while the more educated informants were less conversant on the ethnomedicinal uses of plant species, chiefly of Poaceae taxa. This difference in ethnomedicinal knowledge could be linked to the fact that educated people have highlevel of exposure to modernization and their dependence on allopathic medicines which have already been reported in literature [

 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Because of this, we also collected data on ethno-veterinary uses of Poaceae from different ethnic groups i.e. Punjabi, Gujjar, Butt, Khawaja, Arayeen, and Rana. These groups have diverse culture and languages such as Urdu, Punjabi, Saraiki, Pothare, Balochi, Pashto, Mewatti, Kashmiri, Hindku, and English (25.46, 17.34, 16.24, 8.86, 7.75, 6.64, 5.54, 4.80, 4.06 and 3.32%, respectively (
