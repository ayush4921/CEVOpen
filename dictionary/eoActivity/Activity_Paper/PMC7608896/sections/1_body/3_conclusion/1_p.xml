<p>The present study is the first comprehensive report with emphasis on the use of Poaceae in traditional ethno-veterinary medicine. A total of 149 species with therapeutic uses were reported, which represents new bioresources for pharmacological studies and drug discovery. Our study revealed that ethnobotanical knowledge of Poaceae is less prevailing in the rural areas of Punjab compared to other medicinal plants. Therefore, ethnomedicinal applications of the members of this family should be reported from other parts of the country, which would be helpful in conserving precious medicinal plant knowledge and its application in novel drug discovery.</p>
