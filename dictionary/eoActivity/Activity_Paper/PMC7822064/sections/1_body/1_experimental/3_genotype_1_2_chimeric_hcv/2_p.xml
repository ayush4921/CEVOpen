<p>Naïve Huh-7.5 target cells were plated at a concentration of 2400 cells/well in 25 μL of culture media in 384-well plates (Greinerbio: one, u clear black). After overnight incubation, compounds serially diluted in 10 μl of cell culture media were added. After 2 h of compound treatment, cells were inoculated with 40 μl of genotype 1/2 chimeric HCVcc, which expresses structural proteins of HCV genotype la isolate (TN accession number: EF621489) and non-structural proteins of HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1) with a nano-luciferase reporter. At 72 h post-infection, nano-luciferase activity (Nano: GloTM, Promega, Madison, WI) and cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP; Cell titre: GloTM, Promega, Madison, WI) levels were measured as a marker of HCV replication and cytotoxicity, respectively. EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
