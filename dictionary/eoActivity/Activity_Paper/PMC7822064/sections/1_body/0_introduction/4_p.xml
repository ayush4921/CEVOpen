<p>The entry process of HCV into hepatocytes has been recognised as one of the potential targets for therapeutic intervention to treat or prevent HCV infection. To develop new types of small-molecule inhibitors for HCV, we first sought to screen HCV entry inhibitory molecules using an infectious cell culture system (HCVcc). During the preliminary screening

 </xref>, thiophen urea (TU) derivatives were found to possess useful activity against all major HCV genotypes. Accordingly, we further tested 296 TU derivatives to determine the lead optimisation process. Herein, we present a new class of compounds that exert antiviral activity against HCV.
