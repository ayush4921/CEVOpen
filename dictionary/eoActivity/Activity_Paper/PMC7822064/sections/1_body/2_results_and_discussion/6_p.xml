<p>The docked site of 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> has been reported to participate in CD81 receptor binding and also viral entry

 </xref>. This site is located in the back layer of E2, which is about 11 Å away from the front layer – an area reported to participate in CD81 receptor binding and viral entry. 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> demonstrated weaker docking activity to the back layer of the E2 glycoprotein (data not shown). Overall, the binding pose of 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold>, which favourably interacts with those residues known to participate in CD81 receptor binding and viral entry, indicates that 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> most likely interacts with the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2.
