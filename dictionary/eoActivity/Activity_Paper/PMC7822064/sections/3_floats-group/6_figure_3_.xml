  <p>The molecular docking analysis of 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold>’s interaction with HCV E2. (A) The putative binding site of 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold> in the HCV E2 monomer. The E2 monomer is displayed as an electrostatic surface. 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold> is depicted using an atom-coloured ball-and-stick model. (B) 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold> is docked in the CD81 interacting sites of the E2 monomer, which are a surface on the β sandwich and the CD81 binding loop. Interacting residues from the β sandwich and the CD81 binding loop are coloured in red and blue, respectively. All residues are shown using a stick model and labelled appropriately. 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold> is displayed with an atom-coloured ball-and-stick model. (C) The ligand interaction diagram of 
   <bold>J2H-1701</bold>. Solid magenta arrows indicate hydrogen bonds. All residues are labelled using coloured circles based on their side chains.
