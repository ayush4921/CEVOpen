<p id="p0135">As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a, the extract concentration is inversely proportional to the cell viability. At a very low concentration of 0.04 µg/mL, all extracts showed negligible or no effect at all on the viability of the cell population. Between the concentration ranges of 0.13 µg/mL to 1.23 µg/mL, it was observed that cell viability remained within the range of 79% and 90%. After log 0.091 µg/mL, a sharp decline in cell viability was recorded at 3.7 µg/mL, where after, there is almost no survival of cells. The calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 1.6 µg/mL, 1.9 µg/mL and 1.5 µg/mL for C1 (
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> chloroform extract), C2 (
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> acetone extract) and (C3: 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> ethanolic extract), respectively. When comparing the cytotoxic effect of the studied extracts with the standard (emetine), it was found that 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> extracts demonstrated a less cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells than emetine (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values displayed by the crude extracts show that the plant could be used as a lead substrate in the development of antiproliferative agent against HeLa cancerous cells.
