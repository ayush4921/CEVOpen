<p id="p0130">The Alamar blue assay is one of the most reliable techniques to determine the cytotoxicity effect of an extract on cells. This method uses resazurin, which is a non-toxic cell-permeable compound, to measure the number of viable cells (

 <italic>B. disticha</italic> extracts were assessed against HeLa cancer cells. Although there have been published literature reports supporting the traditional usage of this plant (

 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a shows that the plant extracts was not extremely toxic effect on HeLa cells.
