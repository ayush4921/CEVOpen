<p id="p0070">Bioactive ingredients such as tannins, phenolics, glycosides, flavonoids, and alkaloids present in plants have received a great interest and consideration in recent times due to their several health benefits in the treatment of human ailments (
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Złotek et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, solvent extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> have proven to be a source of bioactive compounds of interest. The highest phenolic content was recorded for chloroform leaf extracts with an estimated value of 0.01 mg/g gallic acid equivalent (GAE), followed by acetone and the least being ethanol extracts with 0.007 and 0.002 mg/g GAE, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(a)). On the other hand, acetone proved to be a better solvent in extracting flavonoids compared to ethanol and chloroform with the following respective values 0.0003, 0.0002, and 0.00011 mg/g QE, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(b)). The findings of 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Moyo et al. (2010)</xref> highlighted that the antioxidant activity of plants could be attributed to the redox function of phenolic compounds that enhance their reducing power radical scavenging capacities. 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al. (2012)</xref> reported that phenolic acids and flavonoids are the most significant classes of bioactive compounds in plants and they serve as natural antioxidants in human diets. Thus, the presence of such compounds in 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> enhances the value and urgency of natural phytochemicals in modern medicine. Most studies on the phytochemistry of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> have focused on analyzing alkaloids; therefore, this finding can provide new insight on the phytochemical information of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic>. As phenolics and flavonoids are known for a variety of biological functions and health benefits in humans, these results seem to support the traditional use of these plants for the benefit of humans.
