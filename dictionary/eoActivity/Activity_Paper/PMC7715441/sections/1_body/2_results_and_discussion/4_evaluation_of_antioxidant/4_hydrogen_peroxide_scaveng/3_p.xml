<p id="p0105">Results illustrated in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> show that acetone extract had the highest scavenging activity compared to other extracts, throughout the concentration range tested. The maximum scavenging activity of 73.2% was recorded at 2.1Â mg/mL, followed by chloroform extract with scavenging activity of 65.6%. With the lowest inhibiting rate of less than 10%, ethanol extract did not display any substantial scavenging activity against hydrogen peroxide radical (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). All the extracts, as well as standard (ascorbic acid), demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of hydrogen peroxide. A similar trend was observed in a study conducted by 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Kumaran and Karunakaran (2007)</xref> when assessing the antioxidant activity of methanol extracts from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> species. However, hydrogen peroxide is not always considered as a highly reactive molecule, but due to its high potential of giving rise to hydroxyl ion, it can be very toxic to cells. Therefore, the noteworthy scavenging activity displayed by all extracts understudy against hydrogen peroxide indicates their potential effectiveness in limiting the chances of hydroxyl ion formation.
