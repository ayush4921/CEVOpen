<p id="p0110">Besides reactive oxygen species, there are also nitrogen species that can induce oxidative stress in implicated in various human diseases (
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">FÃ¶rstermann, 2010</xref>). Nitric oxide reacts with oxygen or superoxide to form reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitrogen dioxide, dinitrogen tetroxide, dinitroazanide, nitrate, nitrite, and peroxynitrite, which are very unstable and highly reactive molecules. The presence of these molecules in the mitochondria can significantly alter normal cellular processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration and oxidative stress (
