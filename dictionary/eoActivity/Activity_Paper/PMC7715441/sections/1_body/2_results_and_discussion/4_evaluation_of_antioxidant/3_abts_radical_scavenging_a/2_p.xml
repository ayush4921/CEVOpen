<p id="p0095">Similar to DPPH, ABTS assay is one of the methods commercially used to assess the antioxidant potential of an extract but the difference is that ABTS assay can be conducted under varying experimental conditions. ABTS assay is specifically used for establishing the presence of hydrogen donating antioxidants (

 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb extracts demonstrated effective scavenging activity against ABTS radical with values ranging between 86 and 87%, and acetone extract showing marginally higher inhibition within the concentration range from 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Based on this observation, it can be deduced that 0.25 mg/mL is the inhibitory concentration limit for acetone extract. On the other hand, ethanol had a maximum inhibition of 86% at 0.25 mg/mL, with a similar trend being observed for chloroform extract. However,
