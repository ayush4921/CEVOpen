<p id="p0080">GCMS was used to identify phytochemical compounds present in the extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb. Based on the literature search, some compounds found in the studied extracts have been reported to display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antimicrobial activities (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">De Freitas et al., 2017</xref>). For example, apocynin, n-hexadecanoic acid, trifluoroacetoxy hexadecane, hexadecane, 9-nonadecene, 2.4-di-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylphenol, cyclohexadecane and ethyl-cyclodocosane were some of the compounds identified by GCMS (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These compounds might be responsible for the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb extracts observed in this study. Anti-inflammatory as well as anti-cancerous compounds identified included, 2-methoxyl-4-vinylphenol, phytol, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (z,z), octadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, heptadecyl triflouroacetate and alloaromadendrene. Major compounds were revealed to be 3,6-Dipropyl-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (40.32%), from acetone extract, apocynin (21.8% and 15.53%), from acetone and ethanol extracts, respectively.
