 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Muijsers et al., 2000</xref>). Since the use of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb is associated with the treatment of neurodegenerative related diseases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor compounds were identified to be undulatine and epibuphanisine. The inhibition of AChE is the major trait targeted by researchers since the enzyme largely contributes to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, studies carried out by 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">van Rijn et al. (2010)</xref>, showed undulatine to have AChE inhibitory activity 10-folds lower than that of galanthamine. It was further discovered that all 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb extracts contained epibuphanisine that is an alkaloid suspected to contain AChE inhibitory activity. A large number of compounds have unknown biological activity, as such, they need further investigation. Nonetheless, the compounds revealed in this study support the notion that 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> contains neuroprotective properties. Hence, these findings necessitate further studies on the AChE inhibitory potential of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic>.
