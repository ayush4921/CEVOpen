<p id="p0040">Total flavonoid screening was evaluated by using the method of aluminium chloride colorimetric described by 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Adedapo et al. (2008)</xref>. An aliquot amount of 0.5 mL of each sample was added to 0.5 mL of 2% (w/v) AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> ethanolic solution and mixed gently. The mixtures were left at room temperature for 90 min and the absorbance was read at 440 nm using a microplate reader against a blank. The presence of flavonoids was confirmed by the appearance of a yellow colour. Quercetin was used as a standard. The flavonoid content was established in milligrams equivalents of quercetin per milligram of each fraction using the standard curve.
