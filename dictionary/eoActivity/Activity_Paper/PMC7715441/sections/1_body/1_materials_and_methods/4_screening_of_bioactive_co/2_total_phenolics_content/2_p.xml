<p id="p0035">The total phenolic content was estimated using the Folin–Ciocalteu protocol as highlighted by 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Otang et al. (2012)</xref> with some minor modifications where gallic acid (0–30 mg/mL) was used as a standard. Subsequently, 100 μL of the sample was mixed with 100 μL of 10% (v/v) Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and 100 μL of 2% (w/v) sodium carbonate. The mixture was stirred vigorously using a vortex and incubated for 60 min at room temperature, after which absorbance was read at 750 nm using an Ultrospec Visible Plate Reader II 96. The concentration of each sample was calculated from the standard curve as gallic acid equivalent per milligram (GAE) of dried plant material.
