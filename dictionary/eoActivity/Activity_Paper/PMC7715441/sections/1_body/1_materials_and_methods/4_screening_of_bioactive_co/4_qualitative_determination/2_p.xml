 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Agarwal (2011)</xref>. The crude extract was mixed with 2 mL of 1% (v/v) HCl and heated gently in a water bath. Mayer’s reagent was prepared by adding 1.36 g mercuric chloride and 5 g potassium iodide in 100 mL distilled water while Wagner’s reagent was prepared by dissolving 2 g of iodine and 6 g of potassium iodide in 100 mL of distilled water. The appropriate volumes of Mayer’s and Wagner’s reagents were then added to the mixture simultaneously. The formation of turbidity precipitate confirmed the existence of alkaloids.
