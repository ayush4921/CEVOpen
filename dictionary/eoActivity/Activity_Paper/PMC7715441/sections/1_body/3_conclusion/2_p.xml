<p id="p0145">The present study has shown that solvent extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb could be prospective sources of antioxidants for the treatment of human diseases induced by oxidative stress as well as an anticancer agent against cervical cancer. The antioxidant and antiproliferative activities demonstrated by these crude extracts could be due to the presence of phenolic, flavonoid, and alkaloid. Thus, it is, therefore, necessary to carry out further study on the isolation of pure compounds from the most potent extract. In addition, further biological activities such as neuroprotective and cytotoxicity effects of the pure compounds from the plant extracts is currently a subject of active research in our laboratory.
