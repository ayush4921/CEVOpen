<p>In the last session of this workshop, a panel discussion entitled “Toward more efficient clinical development applied model based analysis” was presented with the participation of the six speakers along the line of three discussion points as follows: comments from stakeholders, academic researchers, drug developers, and regulators; usefulness and limitation of M&amp;S in drug development to meet unmet needs, such as pediatric patients and intractable diseases; and significance of developing regulatory guidelines on pharmacometrics. Some remaining challenges were identified during the panel discussion of the workshop as follows: further activities toward proper implementation of the new guidelines for M&amp;S through successive communications among stakeholders; and an international harmonization of guidances to foster consistency of applications of M&amp;S for regulatory purpose across regions and facilitate discussions with and among regulatory authorities.</p>
