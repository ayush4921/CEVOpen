 <bold>In recent drug development, applications of pharmacometrics and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) have become of increasing importance. A research group that consists of experts in academia, industry, and regulatory agency has been developing practical guidelines for pharmacometrics and M&amp;S based on latest scientific findings. This paper outlines a public workshop to exchange opinions widely among stakeholders of draft guidelines on exposure‐response analysis and physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model’s analysis, which was held in Japan in July 2019.</bold>
