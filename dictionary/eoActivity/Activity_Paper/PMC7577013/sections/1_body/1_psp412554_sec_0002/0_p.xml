<p>Recent drug developments have paid attention to quantitative modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a tool to examine study designs or optimize the dosing regimen of a drug. In Japan, the increasing number of drug approval applications have recently used results with M&amp;S approach as rationales for establishing the optimized dosing regimen and precautions in the new drug application (NDA) documents. According to a survey on M&amp;S utilization in NDAs of 38 drugs with a new molecular entities submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in fiscal year (FY) 2018, a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was studied in ~ 70% of NDAs, and a PPK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis or exposure‐response (ER) analysis were studied in ~ 60% of NDAs (
