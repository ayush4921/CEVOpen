 </xref> issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) in 2001 had showed basic concepts of application of PPK analysis to evaluate on clinical PKs. With respect to ER analysis and PBPK model analysis, no relevant guidelines have been issued in Japan. Such unavailability of the guidelines and the current situation of M&amp;S utilization in drug developments in Japan have led to increased needs to develop new guidelines for M&amp;S to facilitate appropriate application of M&amp;S for regulatory purpose. The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) funded research group consisting of experts from academia, industry, and regulatory authority started activities in 2014 to develop guidelines for M&amp;S. The AMED research group has engaged in preparing three guidelines for PPK and PPK/PD analyses, and ER analysis, as well as PBPK model analysis. As a first accomplishment of the research, the guideline for PPK and PPK/PD analyses entitled “Guideline for population PK/PD analysis”

This paper is aimed to outline the public workshop that was held on July 2019 to exchange opinions among stakeholders, including drug developers and regulators, as a part of preparation process of the second and third guidelines (i.e., guidelines or ER analysis and guidelines for PBPK model analysis).
