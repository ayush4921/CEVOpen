<p>The guideline for PBPK model analysis summarizes considerations and basic principles in reporting the results of PBPK modeling, so that assessment results obtained by using PBPK modeling in drug development are appropriately reported to the regulatory authority. The objective of this guideline is to maintain the consistency of data presented to the regulatory authority, to facilitate timely decision making in clinical trial consultations and regulatory reviews, etc., and to standardize the content of PBPK modeling reports for appropriate provision of information. After the workshop, a draft document titled “Guideline for PBPK model analysis and analysis reports (draft)” was subjected to the public consultation conducted by the MHLW from September to October 2019, and is aimed to be finalized in 2020.</p>
