<p>The different RTL fractions from the EA layers (EAF1 to EAF8) were collected through TLC analysis (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S1</xref>). When the concentration of each fraction was less than 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, the cell survival rate was greater than 80% and did not inhibit cell growth (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, the concentration of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml was used for the follow-up glucose uptake evaluation.
