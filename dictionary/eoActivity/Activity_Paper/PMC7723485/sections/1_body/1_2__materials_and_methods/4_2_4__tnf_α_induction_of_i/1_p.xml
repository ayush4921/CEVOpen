<p>IR was induced according to a method described previously [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. FL83B cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and incubated at 37°C for 48 h to reach 80% confluences. Serum-free medium containing recombinant mouse TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and different RTL fractions (25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was incubated for 16 h at 37°C to induce IR.
