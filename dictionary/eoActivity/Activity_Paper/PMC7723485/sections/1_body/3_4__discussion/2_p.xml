<p>An investigation of the cytotoxicity of the EA fractions in the cells was necessary before evaluating the cellular glucose uptake activity. In this study, when the concentration of all EA fractions from RTL was greater than 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, it significantly inhibited cell growth in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. However, when the concentration was less than 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml of each fraction, the cell survival rate was more than 80%, which indicates that there was no significant inhibition of cell growth (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S4</xref>). Hence, a concentration of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml was used for each EAF fraction during the subsequent glucose uptake evaluation. Similarly, it was evident in our previous study that the concentration of RTL improved glucose uptake in mouse C2C12 myoblasts [
