<p>In this study, two columns, Sephadex LH-20 gel and MCI gel, were used to separate the bioactive components of the EA layer of RTL. The IR-induced FL83B hepatocytes model was used to screen out the distinguishing substances in the RTL that may improve glucose uptake, and then the active ingredients were identified by HPLC. Our results showed that in the first chromatography column of the EA layer of RTL, the EAF5 fraction significantly increased the glucose uptake of liver cells that induce IR by TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>; thus, EAF5 was selected for the second chromatography column. EAF5-5 demonstrated the best potential activity for improving cellular glucose uptake based on the activity evaluation of the three types of bioactive phenolic acid and flavonoid compounds—syringic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and cirsimaritin—which were identified by HPLC analysis. It has been suggested that phenolic compounds can significantly improve the activity of cellular glucose uptake, at least partially. Our results show that among the three active ingredients, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid is the most effective for increasing glucose uptake, but its effect is not as good as the combined activity of all three compounds and the EAF5-5 fraction.
