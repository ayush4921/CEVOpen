<p>Yoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] demonstrated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid can improve IR and the lipid metabolism of skeletal muscle cells. The administration of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric (100â€‰mg/kg BW) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 30 days can reduce the fasting blood glucose level and HbA1c, as well as increase the insulin level. In addition, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric has been found to have excellent antioxidant ability and can enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) of the kidney and liver [
