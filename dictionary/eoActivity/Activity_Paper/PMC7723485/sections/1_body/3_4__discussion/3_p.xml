<p>Administration of RTL fractions of n-hexane and EA in diabetic rabbits lowered the animals' blood sugar levels [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. RTL fractions of EA can effectively improve the blood sugar level in diabetes through their antioxidant capacity, as EA fractions speculatively contain high amounts of polyphenols and triterpenoids [
