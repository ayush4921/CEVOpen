<p>In this study, three components (syringic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and cirsimaritin) that were isolated from the EAF5-5 fraction were shown to improve cellular glucose uptake, with 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid demonstrating the best effect. However, the increase in cellular glucose update is highest when all three compounds were used. We speculated that the hypoglycemic effect of RTL may be the result of multiple active ingredients. One theory has pointed out that if plants can be used to treat diabetes, then their effects can be multiplied by using them in higher concentrations and in combination with the chemical components that are contained in a variety of medicinal plants to cure diabetes through distinct mechanisms [
