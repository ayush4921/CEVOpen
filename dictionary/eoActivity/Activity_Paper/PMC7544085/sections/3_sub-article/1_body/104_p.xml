<p>This section need to be enriched by socio cultural information about the people of the four communities of Salomon Islands. Are they indigenous communities? Is the same the importance of the medicinal plant use in the four communities? Which is the medical system in each community? What plants are mainly used? In what extend people depend on medicinal plants? Could also be of interest to know about the presence of biomedicine in local systems. I know that this is not the purpose of the manuscript, but a brief description could be of essential to understand the sociocultural context.</p>
