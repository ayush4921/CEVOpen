<p>In lines 65-66, the authors define social learning as “…the ability to transmit information and ideas between generations". However, for the works cited by the authors in the introduction, social learning would involve processes linked to learning information through observation, interaction with other members of the social group or contact with products built by other individuals, not necessarily between generations, but it can occur between individuals belonging to the same generation in a group. In this sense, I believe that this passage can be modified. In addition, social learning strategies do not only involve imitation, as suggested by the text in line 76, which would also need to be relativized.</p>
