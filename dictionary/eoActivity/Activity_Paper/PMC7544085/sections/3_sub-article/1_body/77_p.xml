<p>In the paragraph on lines 76-82, the authors briefly present the possible role of prestige and homophily in explaining social learning patterns. However, the authors indicate different theories for each factor that are not clearly presented, which can confuse the reader about the different theoretical scenarios involved. In this case, it is possible to place prestige and homophily as distinct types of model-based social learning biases, based on the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (see Mesoudi 2015). The indication and brief presentation of the theory of cultural evolution can help in the theoretical understanding to which the factors presented are inserted.</p>
