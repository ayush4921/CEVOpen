<p>In lines 421-423, the authors write the following excerpt â€œ...the probability of an edge forming between two people whose age difference is &lt;10 years is higher for man-woman pairs than for same-gender pairs, indicating that nonsignificance of age prestige may be related to cultural gender roles." I was confused in this part of the text because what seems to be being discussed here is a factor linked to homophily, that is, people with close ages. If it is the case to change this part of the text, some points of the discussion about this finding may also be modified (lines 448 and 480).</p>
