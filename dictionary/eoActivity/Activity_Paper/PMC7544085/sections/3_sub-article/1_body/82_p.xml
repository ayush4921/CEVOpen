<p>In the topic “Fieldwork site”, I missed more explanations about the socioenvironmental characteristics of the groups studied, such as the ecosystems to which they belong, proximity to urban centers, beliefs, the social structure (and its variation between each group), the organization of people in different social roles, geographical distance between these groups. This can even help the reader to understand why certain sociocultural variables were analyzed in this study.</p>
