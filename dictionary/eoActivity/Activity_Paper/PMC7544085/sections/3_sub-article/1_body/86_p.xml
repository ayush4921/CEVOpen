<p>In the topic “Social learning implications”, the authors point out that "Our results address a lack of prior research on the process and patterns of social learning in small-scale societies, especially in learning ecological knowledge [21,76]. Previous research has established that knowledge can be shared in three directions: vertically (from parents or grandparents), obliquely (from other elders), or horizontally (from peers) [76]." However, there are studies that have investigated and discussed the sharing of local ecological knowledge (such as knowledge of medicinal plants) between people and the biases linked to social learning in small-scale societies (see, for example, Henrich &amp; Broesch 2011; Salpeteur et al. 2015; Brito et al. 2019; Santoro et al. 2020). In particular, the work of Henrich &amp; Broesch (2011), also cited by the authors of the manuscript, investigates learning biases (such as prestige, sex and age) involving local ecological knowledge through network analysis. The mentioned works indicate the possible biases that may be behind the processes of transmission of local ecological knowledge. It would be interesting, then, to discuss the findings of the present manuscript on this topic with previous studies that have investigated biases related to knowledge sharing about medicinal plants. If this adjustment is made on this topic, it will also be necessary to adjust the conclusion section on lines 565-566, in which the authors state "Our study is the first test of how prestige and homophily relate to network structure and social learning patterns" and an excerpt from the introduction of the manuscript, on lines 95-97. In this last point about the text of the introduction, the originality and relevance of the research can be rethought.</p>
