  <title>Medicinal plant knowledge sampling adequacy rarefaction curves demonstrate &gt;99% coverage of medicinal plant species cited by study participants.</title>
  <p>Curves show coverage-based rarefaction (solid lines) and extrapolation (dashed lines). 95% confidence intervals (the shaded area associated with each curve) were estimated using 500 bootstrap replicates. Shannon and Simpson diversity account for both richness and evenness of the species cited. Species richness, Shannon diversity, and Gini-Simpson diversity ranged from161-218, 92.2–139.9, and 71.6–108.0, respectively. Key: Shannon diversity index = exponential of Shannon entropy, Gini-Simpson diversity index = inverse Simpson concentration, Key: B = Binaoli village, I = Irobulu village, K = Kolofi village, L = Lagoe village.</p>
