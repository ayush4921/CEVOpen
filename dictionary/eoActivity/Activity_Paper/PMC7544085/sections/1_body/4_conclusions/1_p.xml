<p>Our study is the first test of whether hypotheses based on prestige and homophily predict both network structure and social learning patterns. By using ERGMs, we control for potentially confounding factors such as geographic proximity, network configuration, and stated versus actual knowledge sharing. Our work reveals that prestige and homophily have distinct effects on specific social learning strategies and knowledge types. By testing mechanisms of ecological knowledge sharing and the flow of medicinal plant information through social networks, this research suggests how ecological knowledge systems can be amended or supported to improve biocultural conservation. It also paves the way for quantifying the flow of medicinal knowledge based on cultural context and social networks. In an era of unprecedented global change, understanding social learning and ecological knowledge transmission is essential to support biocultural sustainability and enhance pharmaceutical development.</p>
