<p>One of the major challenges in network analysis is defining network boundaries [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), such as relatives in other villages, colleagues from school or temporary work in urban areas, and deceased persons. Because we could not collect personal information from these people, their effect on prestige and homophily is uncertain. Therefore, our results may not reflect the exchanges with individuals outside the four study villages. However, most people reported as sources of knowledge were older relatives that they had lived with (e.g., parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents), so including these persons in the model would likely confirm our conclusions about the importance of age, kinship, and proximity.
