<p>Although we show that prestige increases popularity of men in this network, we are reluctant to generalize this result for two reasons. First, there are no significant gendered differences in medicinal knowledge a global scale, only continental and national scales [

Other possible biases in data collection include hesitancy to share cultural knowledge with an outsider, or fatigue based on interview length. In addition, our data do quantify the number of plants or remedies learned from each person; additional research is needed to understand which relationships in a network tend to be the source of the largest quantity of information or certain types of information (i.e. remedies for specific illnesses such as infections) [
