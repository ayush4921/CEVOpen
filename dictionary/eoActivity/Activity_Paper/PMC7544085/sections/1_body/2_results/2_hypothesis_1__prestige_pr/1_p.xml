<p>The results of medicinal plant knowledge sharing network ERGMs are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. All configuration variables are significant in all models, except for popularity in M5 (# illnesses known). Consistent with H1a, edge estimates were strongly negative, indicating restricted sharing of medicinal plant knowledge. Edge estimates are also consistently more negative in the models that include edge and node variables (M2-7). For example, in M1 nodes have a 1% chance of being connected (compared to 50% chance in a random network). In M2-7, nodes have a 0.05â€“0.01% chance of being connected, which suggests that edge and node effects in M2-7 explain more detail of how nodes connect, and that nodes are highly unlikely to connect without the influence of homophily or prestige. Consistent with H1b, estimates for popularity are significantly negative in M1 and M2, indicating that people are more likely to learn about medicinal species and uses from someone who at least one other person has also learned from, but that medicinal knowledge is more important than popularity which choosing who to learn from.
