Binaoli and Lagoe have the most clustering. Irobulu has the highest density, the least clustering, and the largest diameter. Irobulu and Lagoe have the highest in degree and centralization, while Irobulu and Binaoli have the highest out degree. AIC confirmed that model complexity improved model fit (M3-7&lt;M2&lt;M1). Model validation indicated no problems (
