<p>Five of the seven non-medicinal homophily variables are significant in all models (
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Estimates are similar across M2-7, which suggests that the likelihood of learning based on homophily remains the same, regardless of how much they know about medicinal plants. Consistent with H4a, direct descendant estimates were consistently and strongly positive, indicating that medicinal plant knowledge is more likely to be taught by parents and grandparents to their descendants (97% chance).
