<p>In contrast to H4g, we find no support for age homophily. In M2-7 the probability of an edge forming between two people whose age difference is &lt;10 years is higher for man-woman pairs than for same-gender pairs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g005">Fig 5</xref>); however, this is not an indication of age homophily, but spousal homophily. Culturally, relationships between men and women are discouraged, especially if they are close in age, unless they are spouses. Therefore, increased sharing of knowledge between spouses (who are close in age) may mask a slight positive effect of age prestige. Consistent with H4h, same-knowledge estimates were consistently negative, indicating that people tend to have similar medicinal plant knowledge to people they learned from (50â€“53% chance). This result confirms that people who say they are learning from a specific person actually share knowledge with that person.
