<p>The goal of ERGMs is to predict the network structure by using network metrics which represent social learning processes that are hypothesized to generate the network. Because ERGMs calculate the conditional log-odds of individual edges, coefficients are interpreted in the same way as a standard logistic regression; positive and negative parameters represent processes that increase or decrease the probability of an edge, respectively. To calculate the conditional probability of an edge given a combination of processes, parameter estimates for the estimates are summed [
