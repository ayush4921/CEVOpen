<p>Interview 1 collected sociocultural and demographic data, including GPS coordinates of the interviewees house (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s018">S1 Table</xref>), and a list of the plants the interviewee uses as medicine. Because free-listing can exclude important information [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], this technique was corroborated and supplemented by participant observation and walk-in-the-woods guided tours [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Participant observation, which followed the residents’ daily activities without interfering with them, clarified information collected in interviews. Walk-in-the-woods guided tours were conducted with residents who volunteered to identify species mentioned in the free lists. Every free-listed plant was photographed and sampled for voucher specimens (

Voucher specimens were deposited in herbaria of the Smithsonian Institution (US), the University of Hawai‘i (HAW), and Solomon Islands (BSIP). Final identification was accomplished by crosschecking published sources that include local names and taxonomic keys [
