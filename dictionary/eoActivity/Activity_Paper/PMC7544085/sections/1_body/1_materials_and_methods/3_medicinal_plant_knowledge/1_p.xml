<p>Five types of medicinal plant knowledge were evaluated: the number of uses cited, species cited, and illnesses cited, as well as the use uniqueness and species uniqueness. The number of illnesses cited, species cited, and uses cited are commonly used in ethnobotanical studies to quantify the amount of knowledge [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. To estimate use and species uniqueness, we used local contribution to beta diversity, which measures the variation in people’s knowledge by comparing their knowledge to all knowledge in the entire village. Scores range from 0–1; higher scores indicate that the person’s knowledge is unusual and unique, and lower scores indicate that the person’s knowledge is common and widely shared [

 <italic>adespatial</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] using Euclidean distance to account for meaningful zeros in binary data (species cited) and count data (uses cited). Sampling adequacy of medicinal plant species was assessed using the 
 <italic>iNEXT</italic> package to calculate rarefaction curves and sample coverage estimates (
