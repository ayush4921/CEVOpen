<p>We characterized the network of medicinal plant knowledge sharing using a name generating procedure. At the end of the second interview, each participant was asked how they learned about medicinal plants. The participant was also asked to cite all the people who ever taught them about medicinal plants in their life, and explain their relationship (e.g., friend, aunt, parent). We analyzed the closed medicinal knowledge sharing network among the 303 participants to characterize the influence of homophily and prestige. The matrix of incoming knowledge sharing was coded 1, irrespective of the number of exchange events involved, or 0 if no exchange was reported. Exchange edges were represented as a 303 × 303 directed matrix represented by the following relationship: “person 
 <italic>i</italic> learned medicinal plant knowledge from person 
 <italic>j</italic>.” Open and closed networks were visualized using the 
 <italic>igraph</italic> R package (
