<p>Testing how homophily and prestige affect sharing of medicinal plant knowledge provides critical insight for conservation of biological and cultural diversity. Both biological diversity and ecological knowledge are essential to provide the benefits humans get from ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem services), such as food production, climate change regulation, recreation, and water purification [
