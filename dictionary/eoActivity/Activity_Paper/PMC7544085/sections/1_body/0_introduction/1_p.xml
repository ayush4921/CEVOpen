<p>Cultural evolution theory suggests that human adaptation depends on social learning, which is the ability to transmit information and ideas between individuals and accumulate knowledge over generations [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To understand these and other cultural adaptations fundamental to nature conservation and the success of our species, we need to understand the evolution of social learning [

Here, we define social learning as knowledge acquired through instruction, observation, and other social interactions, which accumulates skills and information over time that no individual could develop in a single lifetime. In contrast, asocial learning is experiential and involves trial and error [
