<p>A related concept, called centralization or preferential attachment, suggests that nodes who are connected to one other node are more likely to be make new connections with other nodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of edges is not even among nodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the ERGM context, we test for network popularity with a geometrically weighted out degree (GWOD) term, which measures whether people who share knowledge with at least one person are more likely to share knowledge with more than one person [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, we predict that fewer nodes will have high popularity (≥2 edges) and more nodes will have low popularity (≤1 edges) in the observed network than in a random network (Hypothesis 1b, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Because sharing is restricted, certain nodes may not meet the selective criteria for sharing knowledge. Therefore, we also predict that in our network more nodes will have no edges connecting them to another node than in a random network (Hypothesis 1c, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>).
