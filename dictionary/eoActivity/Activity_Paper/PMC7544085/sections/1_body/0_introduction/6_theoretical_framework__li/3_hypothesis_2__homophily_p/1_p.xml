<p>Homophily predicts that you are more likely to learn from someone who is like you in some way. As a result of that similarity, so the person you learn from is also more likely to learn from you. Therefore, we predict that there will be more reciprocal relationships in the observed network than in a random network of the same size (Hypothesis 2a, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). If prestige drives learning patterns, the prediction for reciprocity is inverted because prestigious people don’t need to learn from less prestigious people (Hypothesis 2a,

Homophily predicts a higher chance of node “A” learning from node “B” if they both learned from person “C” or if person “C” learned from both of them, because person “C” must be like both of them, which means “A” and “B” are like each other [
