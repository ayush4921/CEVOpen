<p>Homophily encompasses many forms of similarity, including education, religion, and occupation, and affects many forms of social connection, such as friendship, membership, and sharing possessions [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in the cultural context of Solomon Islands, the most likely sources of homophily are house proximity, marriage, village of residence, descent group, gender, and age [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. If homophily of any of these variables drives learning patterns, we expect to find similarity between people who share knowledge in our observed network (Hypotheses 4a-g, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If prestige drives learning patterns, the prediction for one variable, age, is inverted (Hypothesis 4g, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also predict another form of similarity, medicinal knowledge, not because of homophily but as a result of knowledge sharing (Hypothesis 4h, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This variable is included to control for potential differences between stated and revealed social learning relationships [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although participants could potentially state that they learned from an influential or important person, revealed knowledge sharing is supported by similarity in medicinal plant knowledge [
