<p>Mushrooms are an inexhaustible source of immunomodulating biomolecules, whose effects in the treatment of cancer, infectious or immunological disorders have already been clinically demonstrated (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2015</xref>). Mushrooms contain immunostimulant compounds, such as β-glucans, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid and lip polysaccharide, that makes stronger and boost the immune system activity. Moreover, mushrooms folate plays an important role in DNA synthesis and repair (

At present, there are over 270 recognized fungal species for their various biological activities (such as adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, hypocholesterolemic). As their cultivation has grown for food purposes, mushrooms have become increasingly used as dietary supplements against various diseases and associated health problems (

In last decades, several scientific researches performed in Japan, China, and Korea, and lately in the United States, have proved the mushrooms potential for the prevention and treatment of some chronic diseases, like cancer and hypertension (
