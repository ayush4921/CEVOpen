<p>Wound healing as a normal biological process, that may be divided into 4 phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation) (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). Wound repair involves many cell types populations and molecular mediators, and is consented as a physiological mechanism using the immune system, the complex skin repair process (

Medicinal mushroom extracts and their metabolites have been verified for wound treating, with contribution in different mechanisms, including immune epithelial cells stimulation, extracellular matrix, cytokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and various inﬂammatory intermediates (
