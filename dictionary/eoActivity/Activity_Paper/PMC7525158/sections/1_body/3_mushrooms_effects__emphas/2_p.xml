 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Browder et al. (1990)</xref> extensively studied glucan as a potent macrophage stimulant. The 1→3 β-glucans of mushrooms may recruit macrophages to the wound site as mechanism of wound healing. In fact, β-glucans is thought to mediate effects through activation of macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphocytes. Moreover, it has been reported an immunostimulatory activity and enhance wound healing of β-glucans by increasing macrophage infiltration into the injury sites and stimulating tissue regeneration (
