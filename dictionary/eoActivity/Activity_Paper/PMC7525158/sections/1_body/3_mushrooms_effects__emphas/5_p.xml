 <italic>Antrodia camphorata</italic> extract, rich in total polyphenols and flavonoids, have exhibited noteworthy wound healing effects in rats, leading to an increase in wound constriction and collagen accumulation. In another study, 
 <italic>A. camphorata</italic> extract significantly promoted wound healing 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by observation of less inﬂammatory cells and more collagen synthesis in the injured tissues, and also 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by promoting fibroblast cells proliferation (

 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, rich in polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and lectin, has also been reported effective in controlling wound procedures afterward glaucoma surgery (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Krupodorova et al., 2015</xref>). The edible mushroom lectin from 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> tested on Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of wound healing showed a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and lattice contraction (
