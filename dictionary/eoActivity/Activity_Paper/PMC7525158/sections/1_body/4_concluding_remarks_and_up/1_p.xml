<p>Mushrooms have been eaten for many years due to their flavor, economic and ecological benefits, and therapeutic properties. With the research advances, numerous bioactive compounds obtained from mushrooms have been looked as responsible for their biological and therapeutic properties, with their anti-atherogenic, hepatoprotective, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antioxidant effects being the most remarkable ones. Nonetheless, the wound healing potential of mushrooms have also been increasingly reported, linked to their richness in polysaccharides and phenolic compounds. However, some species can cause extremely serious, sometimes deadly poisonings, being thus of extreme relevance to deepen knowledge on this field. Thus, further studies are needed to assess the mushrooms-derived bioactive compounds potential and their healing properties, as well as of the extracts from which they are derived. Nevertheless, the use of mushroom components and extracts in cosmetics may be considered a niche of attention, due to their remarkable wound healing properties.</p>
