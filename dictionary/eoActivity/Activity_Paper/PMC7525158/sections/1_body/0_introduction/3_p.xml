<p>The main medicinal properties ascribed to mushrooms include antibiotic, antitumor, antiviral, immunostimulant and hypolipidemic activities (

Mushrooms’ medicinal properties are closely linked to its content in bioactive compounds, which mostly included polysaccharides, terpenoids, glucans, phenolic compounds, statins, lectins, among others. Melanin pigments, chitin and chitosan which are found in their cell wall along with extracellular enzymes are other effective molecules (
