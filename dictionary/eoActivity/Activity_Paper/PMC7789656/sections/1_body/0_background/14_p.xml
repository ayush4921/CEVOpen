<p id="Par35">A sample blank contains an equal concentration of the test sample—whether it be an extract, an isolated compound, or a drug used as a control—without the enzyme or substrate. The absorbance (or fluorescence) of the sample blank quantifies the absorbance (or fluorescence) contributed by the colour, autofluorescence and/or turbidity of the sample. Subtracting the sample blank reading from the test well (which contains the enzyme + substrate + test sample) reading provides the value of the absorbance or fluorescence which is due to the enzymatic reaction; i.e. the
