<p id="Par30">In addition to the pigments intrinsic to plants, post-harvest changes can lead to the development of additional coloured products. For example, the action of polyphenol oxidases generates melanins and other brown pigments in harvested plant tissue exposed to oxygen. This process, referred to as enzymatic browning, is particularly common in fruits [
