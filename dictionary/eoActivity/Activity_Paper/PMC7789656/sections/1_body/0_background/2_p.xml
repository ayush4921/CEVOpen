<p id="Par23">Natural products are secondary metabolites produced by living organisms such as plants and microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An abundant and easily accessible source of natural products is the kingdom of plants, a large proportion of which remains to be explored for potential bioactive metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These molecules possess high chemical and structural diversity unrivalled by synthetic compound libraries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], have evolved intrinsic bioactive properties due to their evolutionary biological roles in living organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and are excluded from Lipinski’s rules of five [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, natural products are an attractive source of therapeutic molecules and a significant body of research is devoted to the discovery of drugs from natural product extracts such as plant extracts [
