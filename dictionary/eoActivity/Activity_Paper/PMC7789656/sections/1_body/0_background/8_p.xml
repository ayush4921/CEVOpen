<p id="Par29">Plant extracts are often highly coloured as they contain natural, highly conjugated pigments. The colouration of plant extracts and natural products can cause interference with absorbance measurements in spectrophotometric assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic plant pigments. Chlorophylls absorb light strongly in the 430–480 nm and 640–660 nm range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, chlorophylls are also capable of absorbing light at other wavelengths. Carotenoids encompass a wide range of compounds such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, phytoene and lycopene, and have a wide visible light absorbance spectrum ranging from 400–530 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Betalains, which includes betacyanins and betaxanthins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]; and flavonoids such as anthocyanins and flavanols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] are the other classes of pigments contributing to colour in plants. All these phytochemical classes can interfere with assays which use wavelengths that overlap their absorption spectra.
