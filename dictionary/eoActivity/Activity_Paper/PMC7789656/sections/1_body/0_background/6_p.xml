<p id="Par27">These enzyme assays can be performed in 96-well microplate readers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], or in traditional cuvette-based spectrophotometers or spectrofluorometers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, miniaturisation of assays by adapting them to a 96-well format is beneficial as it reduces the volumes of reagents required, is cost-efficient and enables faster testing suitable for screening large libraries of plants, extracts or natural products [
