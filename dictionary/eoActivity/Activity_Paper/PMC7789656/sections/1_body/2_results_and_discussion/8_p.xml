<p id="Par136">Subtracting two blanks [RD − (BB + SaB) and RD − (SuB + SaB)] generally resulted in lower enzyme activity than for the methods that only subtracted one blank. Note that both the substrate blank and the sample blank contains a certain volume of buffer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Therefore, the absorbance or fluorescence of these blanks was in part, due to the buffer, and only a proportion of the absorbance was due to the substrate or sample. If two blanks were subtracted during blank-correction, as in the case with RD − (BB + SaB) and RD − (SuB + SaB), this

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This approach prevents double-blanking the buffer as only one blank (containing buffer + sample + substrate) is subtracted from the raw data. However, this must be carried out with caution as unexpected results may occur when the substrate interacts with unknown constituents in the sample; especially in crude natural product extracts which contain complex mixtures of compounds and are a notorious, complicated biological matrix. Another drawback to this approach is that the substrate must be added to each sample blank and this would therefore require larger amounts of substrate per assay which adds to the cost of the assay. In method six [RD − (Su + SaB)], the buffer blank was subtracted from the substrate blank to obtain the absorbance or fluorescence contributed by the substrate only (Su = SuB − BB) and this value was subtracted from the raw data along with the sample blank [RD − (Su + SaB)]. This allowed for the correction of interference due to the sample and the substrate, without double-blanking the buffer, and without adding the substrate to each sample blank and any unexpected artefacts which may arise from doing so. Therefore, [RD − (Su + SaB)] was the most appropriate blanking method for all three assays.
