<p id="Par131">Buffer blanks are routinely used for baseline correction and account for the background absorbance or fluorescence of the assay buffer. However, if no substrate blank or sample blanks are included, this method (RD − BB) does not account for interference from the substrate or samples. Therefore, in RD − BB, the background absorbance (or fluorescence) of the substrate and the samples, which caused an additive effect on the test well measurements were uncorrected and resulted in misleadingly high enzyme activity results. This is also illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> which shows the components contributing to the total absorbance (or fluorescence) of a test well, buffer blank, sample blank, and substrate blank. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides an example of how the different blanking methods used in this study changed the blank-corrected absorbance (or fluorescence) of the test well.
