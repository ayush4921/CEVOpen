 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> illustrate the effects of the six blanking methods on the inhibition of α-amylase and lipase. Regardless of the blanking method used, all test samples and positive controls (acarbose for α-amylase, and orlistat for lipase) showed significant inhibition of their respective enzymes. This contrasted with the absorbance-based α-glucosidase assay, where not including a sample blank gave enzyme activity &gt; 100% for the two plant extracts. The reason for this was that the colours of the extracts used in the α-glucosidase assay had high background absorbance values relative to the absorbance of the test wells and therefore contributed a larger error to the final results. Correcting this large error by subtracting the sample blanks caused a larger reduction in the final results. On the other hand, the background fluorescence of the samples in the amylase and lipase assays were much smaller relative to the fluorescence of the test wells, and therefore only contributed a smaller error to the final results.
