<p id="Par129">In all three assays, the positive controls—acarbose for α-glucosidase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and α-amylase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and orlistat for lipase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>)—caused a significant reduction in enzyme activity when compared with the uninhibited control. This is as expected and provided validation of the assay methods and confirmed the suitability of the assays for their intended purpose [
