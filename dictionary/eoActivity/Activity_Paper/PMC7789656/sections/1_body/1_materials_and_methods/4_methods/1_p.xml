 <italic>p</italic>NPG as the substrate was used for the determination of α-glucosidase activity, and fluorescence assays using the substrates BODIPY
 <sup>®</sup>FL-DQ™ starch, and 4-MUO were used for the determination of α-amylase and lipase activity, respectively. Acarbose was the positive control in the α-glucosidase and α-amylase assays while orlistat was the positive control in the lipase assay. The corresponding assay buffer was used as the negative control in each of the assays.
