<p id="Par49">Approximately 50 mg of the powdered leaf samples were further homogenized with 500 µL of 100% ethanol in lysing tubes using an MP Biomedicals™ FastPrep-24™ instrument. Each sample was then extracted for 15 min at 37 °C and 900 rpm using an Eppendorf ThermoMixer
 <sup>®</sup>, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,700 rpm at RT. The supernatant (ethanol extract) was subsequently transferred into a new Eppendorf tube. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µL of Milli-
 <italic>Q</italic> water and allowed to extract for 15 min at 37 °C and 900 rpm using an Eppendorf ThermoMixer
 <sup>®</sup>. The supernatant (water extract) was then combined with the ethanol extract that was previously generated. The combined ethanol/water extract (50:50) was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,700 rpm at RT until a clear supernatant was obtained. The extracts were concentrated by evaporating solvents under reduced pressure using a rotational vacuum concentrator (Martin Christ RVC 2-33 CDplus) operating at 1500 rpm at 30 °C for 6–8 h. The average yields of the concentrated extracts were 0.3 mg for 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> and 0.8 mg for 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic>. The concentrated extracts were stored in darkness at RT with silica gel desiccant until required.
