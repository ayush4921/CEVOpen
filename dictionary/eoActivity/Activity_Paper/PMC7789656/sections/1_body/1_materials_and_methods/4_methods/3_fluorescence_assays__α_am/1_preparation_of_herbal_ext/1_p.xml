<p id="Par71">To prepare the samples for testing, the herbal extract granules of 
 <italic>Gardenia jasminoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic> (for the α-amylase assay), and the granules of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Sophora japonica</italic> (for the lipase assay) were ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, and 20 mg of the ground granules were dissolved in 4 mL of distilled water containing 2% DMSO to obtain 5 mg/mL stock solutions. These were vortexed for 5 min and sonicated for 10 min to aid solubilisation, and then filtered through a Millex-HP 0.45 µm filter (Millipore). The test sample stock solutions thus prepared were diluted in assay buffer I to prepare working solutions as described below.
