<p id="Par108">Comments: Lipase assay buffer I was added to the sample blank wells and control blank wells to make their volumes and concentrations equal to the volumes and concentrations of the test wells. It was not necessary to add the substrate to the substrate blanks in Step 1 because, unlike the samples and controls which were all added at the start of the assay, the substrate was only introduced in Step 3 following pre-incubation. Temperature variation between outer and inner wells and increased evaporation in the outermost wells can give rise to edge effects which contribute to the degradation of assay results [
