 <italic>Sophora japonica</italic> L. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) were selected for the enzyme assays, based on the literature, to determine how their pigmentation and the use of different blanks and blanking methods affect the final assessment of their bioactivity. These medicinal plants have previously been investigated by our research group for their antidiabetic and antiobesity properties. They were chosen for initial testing based on a systematic review conducted on promising bioactive plants which highlighted the above species. These plants were selected for inclusion in this study because their ability to inhibit the respective enzymes have already been established in studies published by others [
