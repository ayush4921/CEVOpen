<p id="Par57">Cargnin, Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found that uliginosin B and three benzopyrans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) isolated from 
 <italic>Hypericum polyanthenum</italic>, a Brazilian native plant, had anti-
 <italic>T-vaginalis</italic> activity that was associated with damage to the cell membrane (&gt;â€‰90% release of lactic dehydrogenase, LDH). Benzopyran HP1 had the best activity against both susceptible and metronidazole-resistant clinical isolates (TV-LACM2), with no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. The authors suggest that benzopyran HP1 with significant antiprotozoal activity and selectivity seems to be a promising candidate for further study.
