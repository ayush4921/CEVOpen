<p id="Par19">Because these pathogens are developing resistance to the widely used drug metronidazole and the disease causes numerous unpleasant adverse side effects (allergy, nausea, vomiting, predisposition to cervical cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, infertility, and a co-factor in the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is an urgent need to develop new effective therapeutic agents against both drug sensitive and resistant trichomonads that might be able to protect against and/or help cure exposed individuals and animals. To help meet this need, this review collates and interprets studies from several countries on reported anti-trichomonad properties of a variety of structurally different food, marine, and medicinal, including herbal, plant compounds, as well marine, plant, and fungal extracts containing multiple bioactive compounds. The results of the described efforts suggest that several formulations (pure compounds and extracts) could replace or enhance additively and synergistically the therapeutic potency of metronidazole of 30 anti-trichomonad compounds shown in TableÂ
