<p id="Par37">A study by Sinha, Prakash [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] reported that manuka honey derived from the 
 <italic>manuka sexta</italic> bees feeding from the manuka tree (
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], is known to have anti-microbial and wound-healing properties, inhibited the growth of the pathogenic protozoa 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.6%v/v and 1.5%v/v, respectively, suggesting that the honey has the potential to ameliorate human giardiasis and trichomoniasis. We do not know the bioactive components of the honey that might be responsible for these beneficial properties.
