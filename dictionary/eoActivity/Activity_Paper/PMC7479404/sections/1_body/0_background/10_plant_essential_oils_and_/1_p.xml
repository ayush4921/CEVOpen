<p id="Par34">There have been reports on the anti-trichomonad properties of plant essential oils and compounds isolated from the oils, as illustrated with the following examples. An Australian study by Moon, Wilkinson [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] describes the inhibition of three protozoan pathogens by 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> essential oils. Concentrations of &lt; 1% of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>L. × intermedia</italic> oils completely eliminated the human pathogens 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> and the fish pathogen 
 <italic>Hex amita inflata</italic>. Cheikh-Ali, Adiko [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] reported that the essential oil from rhizomes of 
 <italic>Aframomum sceptrum</italic> (Zingiberaceace) exhibited remarkable antiprotozoal activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.12 μL/mL and a minimum lethal concentration (MLC) value of 1.72 μL/mL. The major constituents of the oil determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis are β-pinene (12.7%), caryophyllene oxide (10.0%), and cyperene (6.0%). The oil also inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Dai, Peng [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that 
 <italic>A. tsao-ko</italic> essential oil used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach disorders and throat infections and its bioactive compound geraniol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), widely used as a fragrance ingredient, were also effective against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The MLC of the oil for one strain of the pathogen was 44.97 μg/mL and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, 22.49 μg/mL. These values were approximately double with a second protozoal strain. The corresponding value for geraniol, which constitutes 13.69% of the oil, are 342.96 μg/mL and 171.48 μg/mL, respectively. These results show that geraniol showed much lower potency than the oil, suggesting that, in addition to geraniol, some of the 24 compounds identified in the oil by GC-MS must contribute to its potency. Additional studies showed that the oil induced severe morphological changes in the cells. These included partially damaged cytoplasmic membranes, resulting in leakage of cytoplasmic content that presumably led to cell death. Aminou, Alam-Eldin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] discovered that the oil from the seeds of the 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> plant (black seed, black cumin spice) native to Egypt induced cell damage with cytoplasmic and nuclear destruction in the ultrastructure of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> trophozoites, detected by transmission electron microscopy, that is similar to the effect induced by metronidazole, suggesting that the oil might be a useful therapeutic alternative to the synthetic drug. The alcoholic extract was less active than the oil. The authors speculate that the anti-trichomonad effect might be associated with high content of poly-unsaturated linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids in the oil. Akram Khan and Afzal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seeds contain bioactive alkaloids. Another study by Shaikh, Aaqil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] describes the use of a molecular docking method that demonstrated that extracts of plant 
 <italic>Apamarga Kshara</italic>, known to ameliorate cervical erosion in humans, interacted with the amino acid residues of the 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> enzyme carbamate kinase, suggesting that the enzyme might present a biological marker for the inhibition of the trichomoniasis.
