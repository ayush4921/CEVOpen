<p id="Par25">The cited data indicate that the activities of the potato glycoalkaloids are greater than that of their common aglycone, that the activities of the phenolic compounds are also lower than those of the glycoalkaloids, and that, of the six evaluated peels, the organic Russet potato peels showed the greatest anti-trichomonad activity. These positive results imply that the test formulations might be able to protect both humans and animals from trichomonad infections. Moreover, in previous studies we reported that the two potato glycoalkaloids inhibited the growth of cancer cells [

Will inexpensive Russet potato peel powders protect humans, farm animals, and cats against cancer, obesity, and trichomoniasis? Will the consumption of baked and boiled potatoes with the peels benefit human health? We are challenged to find answers to these questions.
