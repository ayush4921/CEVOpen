<p id="Par59">Because mitochondria are target organelles of jasmonates, plant lipids that act as stress phytohormones that help protect plants against stress conditions such as drought and phytopathogens, Ofer, Gold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] wanted to find out if methyl jasmonate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) would induce cell death in the amitochondriate 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (lacking mitochondria). They found that cell death did occur following exposure of the parasite to methyl jasmonate and was associated with an apoptotic-like mechanism without the apparent DNA laddering sub G (1) cell cycle stage peak and caspase-3-activation, similar to the effect observed with metronidazole. Additional studies showed that methyl jasmonate was also cytotoxic to a metronidazole-resistant strain of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (ATCC 50143). The authors suggest that the mitochondria-independent cytotoxicity of methyl jasmonate could enable it to serve as a potential new agent against trichomoniasis. Vilela, Menna-Barreto [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] confirmed, using flow cytometry and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, that methyl jasmonate induced cell death and loss of hydrogenosomal membrane potential in 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>.
