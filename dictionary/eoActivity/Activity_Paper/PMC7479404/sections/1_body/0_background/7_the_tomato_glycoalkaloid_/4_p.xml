<p id="Par29">In related studies Chen, Li [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] showed that five glycoalkaloids, α-chaconine, α-tomatine, α-solanine, α-solamargine, and α-solasonine, inhibited the growth of the malaria-causing protozoan 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> in a 4-day study in mice, suggesting that the last two compounds also merit evaluation against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foetus.</italic> Thorne, Clarke [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] reported that α-chaconine, α-tomatine, and α-solasonine inactivated the herpes simplex virus Type I in cell culture, suggesting that these glycoalkaloids might show anti-viral properties against the coronavirus, human immunodeficiency (HIV), and other pathogenic viruses.
