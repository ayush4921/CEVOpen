<p id="Par27">Because the aglycone tomatidine showed lower activity than the glycoside tomatine, it seems likely that the tetrasaccharide side chain is involved in the molecular mechanism of inactivation of the trichomonad cells, possibly by binding to and disrupting the cell membranes, as described by Blankemeyer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and de Groot and MÃ¼ller-Goymann [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It would be of interest to find out if inexpensive extracts of green tomatoes and tomato leaves with a high-tomatine content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] would also be effective against the human, bovine, and feline trichomonads.
