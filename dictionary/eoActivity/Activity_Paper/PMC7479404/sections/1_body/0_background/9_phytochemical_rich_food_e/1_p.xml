<p id="Par31">Beverages and foods rich in phytochemicals have also been shown to have inhibitory activity towards trichomonads. For example, using a cell assay, Noritake, Liu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] determined the inhibitory activities of black tea, green tea, grape, pomegranate, and jujube extracts and dried jujube against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> G3, 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> D1, and 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> C1. The results show that the black tea extract inactivated the three trichomonads and was most effective against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The extract was also effective against a metronidazole-resistant strain and a cytoadherent strain of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis.</italic> The inhibition correlated with the total extract and individual component [(theaflavin, theaflavin 3-gallate, and theaflavin-3,3â€²-digallate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)] content of the extracts as determined using HPLC. The black tea extract did not affect normal flora bacteria in vitro.
