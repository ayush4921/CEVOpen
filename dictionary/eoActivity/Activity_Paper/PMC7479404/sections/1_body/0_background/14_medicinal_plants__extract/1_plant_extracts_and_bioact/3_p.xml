<p id="Par43">Arthan, Sithiprom [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of compounds isolated from plants grown in Thailand against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The MICs of several β-glycosides at 24 h were in the range of 6.25–12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. The glycosides torvosides A and H (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were more potent than their corresponding deglucosylated torvoside A and H, whereas other β-glycosides were generally as active as their corresponding aglycones. Except for dalcochinin, none of the tested compounds showed cytotoxicity against Vero and cancer cell lines (KB and MCF-7). The native Thai plants provide another natural source of anti-
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> compounds.
