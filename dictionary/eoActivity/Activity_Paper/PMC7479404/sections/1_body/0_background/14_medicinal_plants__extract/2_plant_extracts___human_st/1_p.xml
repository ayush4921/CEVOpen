<p id="Par47">The following studies demonstrate the effectiveness of medicinal plants in alleviating trichomoniasis in women and another study shows the potential of microbiota to increase the therapeutic potential of metronidazole. A randomized study by Moraes, Cunha [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] of the treatment of 60 Brazilian women infected with 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with 24 mg of the herbal plant 
 <italic>Mentha crispa</italic> (Lamiaceae family) or 2000 mg of secnidazole (5-nitroimidazole, structurally related to metronidazole) administered orally in tablet form, found that: (a) there was no statistical difference between the two treatments in the observed cure rates, 90 and 96.6% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.621), respectively; (b) the adverse effects (mostly nausea, metallic taste) were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) in the secnidazole (66.66%) than in the 
 <italic>M. crispa</italic> group (20%), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 001). The cited results show that 
 <italic>M. crispa</italic> seems to offer an alternative and safe treatment for trichomoniasis, and possibly also for giardiasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. It is, therefore, surprising that 
 <italic>M. crispa</italic> has not been adopted for wider clinical evaluation and use in view of its striking beneficial effect at a much lower dose than the synthetic drug.
