<p id="par0160">The liver performs a critical role in inhibiting the accumulation of compounds by converting them into a suitable form for excretion. All compounds undergo xenobiotic metabolism, through several rounds of biochemical transformations. During this process, some of the intermediates show adverse responses [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Usually, the liver is highly prone to injury by intermediate products of drug metabolism. Therefore, a better quantitative understanding of the balance between the xenobiotic detoxification process and hepatic damage could provide better direction for safe levels in both pharmaceutical and toxicological situations [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Particularly, the capability to predict the toxicity profile of lead candidates is necessary to rationalize pharmaceutical drug development [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hepatic injuries modify the transport action and membrane permeability of hepatocytes leading to oozing of enzymes from the cells and subsequently level of various liver function markers in the blood increases [
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, the abnormal rise of hepatic serum enzymatic and non-enzymatic markers coupled with reduction in serum proteins into the circulation suggested severe impairment to hepatic tissue during DCF intoxication.
