<p id="par0155">Inflammation is a common symptom of many chronic diseases. It is a normal protective response to tissue injury caused by physical trauma, noxious chemical or microbial agents [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, aceclofenac, etc.) have shown dose-dependent ability to prevent heat-induced protein denaturation but these are related to several adverse effects like gastric irritation, ulcer, etc. [

 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. At lower concentrations, the activity of EA (IC50 7.64 μg/mL) on protein denaturation inhibition was comparable to the activity of DCF (IC50 5.66 μg/mL). However, Eth and AQ extracts also exhibited noteworthy anti-inflammatory activity at higher concentrations. This could be attributed to the increase in the amount of ellagic acid content in extracts at higher concentration as EA constitutes about 2.3 % of Tb fruit [
