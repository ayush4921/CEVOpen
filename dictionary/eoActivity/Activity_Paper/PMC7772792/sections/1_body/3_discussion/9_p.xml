<p id="par0175">Since active extract has numerous classes of phytochemical moieties and interaction between them have been postulated for producing synergistic effect to elicit their antioxidant, wound healing, haematopoetic, erythropoetic and other biological activities [

 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is likely that a synergistic interplay berween several Terminalia extract components such as tannin and pseudotannins, gallic acid and its esters, chebulic, chebulagic, chebulinic acids and non-chebulic acid, ellagitannins, corilagin, ellagic acid, flavanols, triterpenes etc. takes place for producing diverse biological activities [

 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence observed biological activities in extracts could also be attributed to synergism between various phytoconstituents.
