<p id="par0140">The adverse effects of drugs and synthetic antioxidants have drawn the attention of researchers to explore new sources of natural antioxidants and hepatoprotectants which are more potent to control oxidative stress and avert the initiation of disease propagation [

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, this is the first study that assessed the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective attributes of Tb fruit aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts and EA against DCF induced liver injury in albino Wistar rats.
