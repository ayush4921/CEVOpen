<p id="par0150">FRAP assay was used to determine the potential of extracts and EA to reduce ferric ions. The blue-colored Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> tripyridyltriazine complex gets reduced to colorless Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> form because of the electron-donating ability of extracts and EA [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant analysis, EA showed higher antioxidant efficacy followed by Eth and AQ extracts. Activity of EA was comparable to the standard antioxidant. Comperatively lower activity in fruit extracts could be correlated with lower amount of ellagic acid in extracts as EA constitutes about 2.3 % of the Tb fruit [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, Eth and AQ extracts exhibited relatively lower antioxidant activity as compared to pure EA. Moreover, several other phytochemicals present in Tb fruit such as gallic acid, chebulic acid, corilagin, and ferulic acid, etc. might also be responsible for showing this activity [
