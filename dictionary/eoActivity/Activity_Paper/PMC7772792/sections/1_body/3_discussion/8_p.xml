<p id="par0170">The endogenous antioxidant markers (SOD and CAT) in DFC administered rats were found to be decreased in hepatic tissue. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals into O
 <sub>2</sub> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> which has an important role in scavenging ROS [
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Decreased SOD activity in group II rats might be associated with a reduction in ROS scavenging action, whereas administration of EA and Tb extracts (Eth and AQ) in DFC treated rats caused enhancement in the level of SOD (group IVâ€”VI). CAT also plays an essential role in protecting cells from oxidative damages [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Decreased level of CAT in DFC treated rats diminished the ability of hepatic tissue to defend against oxidative insult. EA and Tb extracts improved the level of CAT in hepatocytes (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Toxicity produced by continued DCF treatment for three weeks and its amelioration by EA and Tb extracts was also reflected in histological sections of the liver slices. Toxicity leads to morphological alterations in hepatic tissue and degree of toxicity directly depicts the degree of liver injury [
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The histopathological examination of DCF treated rat liver exhibited typical alterations in liver slices such as ballooning, degeneration of hepatocytes, hepatocellular necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B) which was consistent with the assay results for biochemical parameters associated with hepatotoxicity in the serum and tissue. Further SLM, EA and Tb extract treatment led to an improvement in morphological features (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C-F). Hence changes observed in histological sections substantiated the biochemical results.
