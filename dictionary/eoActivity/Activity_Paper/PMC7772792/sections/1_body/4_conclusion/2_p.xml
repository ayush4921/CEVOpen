<p id="par0185">Ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> fruit and one of its bioactive compounds ellagic acid have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was observed that long term intake of diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory agent, was liable for causing hepatotoxicity in rats which was characterized by alterations in biomarkers of oxidative stress and liver function in blood and tissue as well as in liver sections. Administration of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> fruit aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts and ellagic acid demonstrated substantial hepatoprotective efficacy against oxidative stress and hepatic damage in rats. Hepatoprotective efficacy of ellagic acid was comparable to silymarin. The study suggested that 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> fruit constituents have enormous medicinal efficacy as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective agents. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing beneficial effects of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> fruit extracts and ellagic acid against diclofenac mediated hepatotoxicity. However, further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of action of various constituents present in 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> which might be helpful in developing the new therapeutic agent of natural origin.
