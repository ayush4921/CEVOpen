<p id="par0080">The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, E.C. 1.15.1.1) was measured by the method of Marklund and Marklund [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The absorbance of a colored complex involving pyrogallol auto-oxidation at 412 nm was measured for 3 min at the interval of 30 s with or without the enzyme protein. One unit of the enzyme activity was expressed as a 50 % inhibition of auto-oxidation of pyrogallol per minute. The catalase (CAT, E.C. 1.11.1.6) activity was measured according to the method of Beers and Sizer [
