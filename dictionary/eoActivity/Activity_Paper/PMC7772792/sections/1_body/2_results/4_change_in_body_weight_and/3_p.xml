<p id="par0120">An inverse correlation was observed between body weight and relative liver weight. Relative liver weight enhanced from 2.35 % in control to 4.31 % in DCF treated rats (p &lt; 0.0001) while treatment with EA and Tb fruit extracts (AQ and Eth) showed a restorative effect on the liver weight of rats. In comparison to Group II rats, the recovery with the administration of EA and Tb fruit extracts was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005).</p>
