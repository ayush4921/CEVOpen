<p id="par0115">DCF treatment led to a remarkable decline (18.54 %) in rat body weight over three weeks duration (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, control rats showed about 17.82 % increase in body weight during the same period. The percentage weight loss of group II rats was significantly higher than those of group I (p &lt; 0.0001) and groups III-V (p &lt; 0.005). Co-administration of EA and Tb fruit extracts (AQ and Eth) with DCF exhibited restorative effect (7–11.5 % recovery) on body weight. Standard drug silymarin showed maximum recovery potential (11.5 %) followed by EA (9.68 %), Eth (9.5 %) and AQ (7%).
