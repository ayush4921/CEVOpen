<p id="par0125">The hepatoprotective potential of Tb fruit extracts and EA was assessed by determining the levels of serum hepatic function markers after 21 days of DCF intoxication in rats (

 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In DCF treated rats (Group II) the level of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, LDH, GGT, creatinine, and uric acid increased considerably in blood with a reduction in total protein as compared to control (Group I). However, supplementation of EA, Tb fruit Eth and AQ extracts and SLM caused a significant reduction in the level of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, LDH, GGT, uric acid and creatinine towards normalcy as compared to DCF treated group II rats (p &lt; 0.005). The highest recovery in the level of serum liver function markers was observed in the standard drug SLM treated group III rats (p &lt; 0.0005). However, the results produced by EA treatment was comparable to SLM treatment. A noteworthy increase in serum total protein was observed with the treatment (
