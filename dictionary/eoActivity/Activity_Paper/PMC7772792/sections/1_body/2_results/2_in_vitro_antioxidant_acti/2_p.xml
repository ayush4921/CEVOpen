<p id="par0100">Tb fruit extracts (Eth and AQ) and EA were found to be significant scavengers (p &lt; 0.05) of the ABTS radical and this activity was comparable to standard solution ascorbic acid (IC50 value 1.46 μg/mL). EA (IC50 1.71 μg/mL) showed higher antioxidant activity as compared to Eth (IC50 11.78 μg/mL) and AQ extracts (IC50 14.44 μg/mL) in ABTS radical scavenging assay. The activities of test extracts were comparatively lower than the activity shown by ascorbic acid.</p>
