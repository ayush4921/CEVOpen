<p id="par0020">Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenolic compound present in Tb fruit in a considerable amount (13−23 mg/g) [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and has been studied widely for its medicinal attributes. However, concentration of overall EA derivatives in fruit is four times higher than that of pure EA [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The antioxidant effects of EA are mediated by its metal chelating capacity, free radical scavenging ability, and induction of cellular antioxidant enzymes activity. EA has also been shown to protect cells from DNA damage caused by free radicals [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Very few studies have investigated the free radical inhibitory activities of EA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Literature is silent about anti-inflammatory effects of EA. Similarly little or no information is available regarding efficacy of EA and Tb as hepatoprotectant in DCF induced toxicity. Silymarin is a natural compound having hepatoprotective and antioxidant action and hence it is used for prevention and treatment of various liver injuries/diseases including chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>]. Moreover, it is routinely used as a standard hepatoprotective compound in research activities related with xenobiotic induced hepatotoxicity. The present study reports antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities of Tb fruit ethyl acetate (Eth) and aqueous (AQ) extracts and EA against diclofenac induced oxidative stress. Silymarine has been used as standard hepatoprotective agent for comparison. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on the evaluation of Tb extracts (Eth and AQ) and EA for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects against DCF induced liver injury in albino Wistar rats.
