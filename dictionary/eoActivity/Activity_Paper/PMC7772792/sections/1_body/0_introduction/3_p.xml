<p id="par0010">During various inflammatory conditions, an excessive formation of phagocytes, production of O
 <sub>2</sub>֯, OH֯ radicals and non‐free radical species (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) takes place [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which can damage the surrounding tissue either by direct oxidation or indirectly with hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and OH radicals. Tissue damage then provokes an inflammatory response by the production of mediators and chemotactic factors [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ROS is also known to activate matrix metalloproteinase (e.g., collagenase) causing increased destruction of tissues e.g. collagen damage is seen in various arthritic reactions [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the natural agents that can mitigate these ROS can be useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.
