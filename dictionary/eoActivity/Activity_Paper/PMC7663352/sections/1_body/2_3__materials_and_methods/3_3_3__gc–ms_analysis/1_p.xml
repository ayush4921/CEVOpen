<p>Diluted EO samples (1:100 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> in heptane) were analyzed by gas-chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) using the Trace 1300 GC coupled to the TSQ DUO triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Walthan, MA, USA) equipped with an electron impact ion source. Samples were injected without derivatization into the DB-5 column, 30-m length, 0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-µm film (Thermo Scientific, Walthan, MA, USA) using the 1:10 split mode. The following parameters were used: ionization energy of 70 eV, mass range between 50 and 550 
 <italic>m/z</italic> and interface temperature of 250 °C. The GC oven temperature was as follows: initial oven temperature of 70 °C and an isotherm for 1 min; subsequently, at 24 °C/min to 180 °C and an isotherm for 2 min, and then reached 280 °C at 50 °C/min where the isotherm was kept for a further 2 min. The carrier gas was helium (He, purity 99.999%) with a constant flow of 1.2 mL/min.
