<p>EOs showing growth inhibition, as clear white zone with diameters equal to or greater than 10 mm with the solid medium diffusion method, were considered to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using a liquid medium. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an EO that resulted in a reduction of &gt;90% in the measured absorbance [
