<p>The tea tree EO was rich in terpinen-4-ol (47.5%) and γ-terpinene (17.2%), in accordance with data reported by Noumi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Star anise and fennel EOs had anethole as their main component, with values of 75.0% and 50.8%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene was particularly abundant in the terpene profile of the bitter orange EO with a percentage of 93.9% [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, the pepper EO extracted in our laboratory showed a percentage of 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene of 21.3% similar to o-cymene, which represented 23.9% [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. EOs eucalyptus and Chinese yin yang had eucalyptol as the most abundant compound—88.3% and 34.5%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For the mixed Chinese yin yang, the results showed that is mainly consisted of EO from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>. The terpene profiles of the turmeric, clove, oregano and palmarosa EOs were found to be similar to those present in the literature data. In particular, turmeric was mainly composed by 29.3% of 
 <italic>ar</italic>-tumerone and 28.8% of α-turmerone [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and clove was made up of eugenol with a percentage of 82.7% [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, the oregano EO had 69.6% carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and palmarosa EO had 82.6% geraniol [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The Japanese yin yang EO contained menthol (35.6%) and 
 <sc>l</sc>-menthone (33.8%), characteristic molecules of the 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> plant from which the EO was already characterized [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Ylang ylang EO showed β-copene (19.5%) and caryophyllene (15.5%) and this chemotype was different from that reported in other studies in the literature [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The differences in terpene composition could be due to the intrinsic characteristics of plant such as age, stage of development, degree of maturity, and genetic variability, from which the EO used in the present study was extracted. Moreover, it is well-documented that environmental conditions (climate, soil, altitude, latitude, etc.) and the method used for the extraction affect the chemical composition of EOs [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Finally, the lavender EO was mainly composed of the monoterpene linalool (23.3%) and of the 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde at 30.3% which was for the first time reported in lavender EO, unlike what has been described in the literature so far [
