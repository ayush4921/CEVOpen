<p>We found that the GC–MS profile was characteristic to each EO. The chemical profile obtained by GC–MS analysis (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05126-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) contains quantitative data of the different plant metabolites present in the EOs that enables their molecular-based classification, which can be explored by means of multivariate statistical techniques. Here principal component analysis (PCA), one of the most widely used techniques, was used to elaborate possible relationships between EOs and their terpenic composition [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. PCA reduces the complexity of original data meanwhile retaining most of the information (variables) to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. Recently PCA has been shown to be very useful when combined with targeted and untargeted analytical fingerprinting techniques and applied to herbal extracts and EOs [
