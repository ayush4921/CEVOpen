<p>Based on the PCA analysis, the 14 EOs studied were grouped into six different clusters, which allowed to distinguish six chemotypes as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05126-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The first group (I) includes eucalyptus and Chinese yin yang, both characterized by a high content of eucalyptol, whereas the second one (II) was made up of bitter orange and pepper, which contains high percentage of D-limonene. Cluster III groups together star anise and fennel, based on the high quantity of anethole. Group IV was clustered by the presence of sesquiterpenes and was composed by cloves, palmarosa, and ylang ylang. Furthermore, it was observed that the EOs of turmeric, lavender, and oregano (Group V) were clustered because of the presence of eucalyptol and o-cymene. In the same way, the similarity between tea tree and Japanese yin yang can be observed (Group VI) due to the high relative percentage of the components eucalyptol and
