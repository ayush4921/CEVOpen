<p>Oxidation is one of the major causes of food degradation, which can occur along the entire food chain. In particular, oxidation is a process that causes unwanted quality changes, organoleptic variation, as well as affect the safety and nutritional value of foodstuffs. It occurs mainly through discoloration, odor generation and off-flavor, or through the formation of potentially toxic substances [

EOs are regarded as GRAS thank to their chemical composition, biological effects and toxicity and are extensively exploited as natural antioxidants to be used in the food sector in contrast to chemical preservatives with known negative effects on human health [
