<p>Problems with chemical preservatives and the growing demand of consumers for natural food additives have turned the attention to plant-derived natural antimicrobials such as EOs. In fact, EOs could represent an alternative to synthetic preservatives against spoilage due to yeasts and molds. The antiyeast effect of the 14 EOs was tested by the solid medium diffusion method. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05126-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the mean diameters of inhibition halos of each EO obtained on the food-spoiling yeast S. cerevisiae. From the results obtained, yeast was resistant to star anise, turmeric, and ylang ylang, as the inhibition halo was completely absent. On the other hand, tea tree, fennel, lavender, pepper and Chinese yin yang showed inhibition halos ranging from 4 to 9 mm. Oregano was the best performing inhibitor of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> growth among all the EOs analyzed by displaying a 35-mm inhibition halo (
