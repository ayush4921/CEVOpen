<p>Oregano was the most active EO against the growth of S. cerevisiae, displaying an MIC of 10 µL/mL (

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Antiyeast activity of oregano EO could be associated with the high relative amount of carvacrol, as evidenced by its terpene composition (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05126-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In fact, carvacrol could be absorbed by the double phospholipidic layer of yeasts and could increase the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Yeast cells, in the presence of carvacrol, have been shown to change the composition of their membrane’s fatty acids as an adaptation mechanism to maintain the correct structure and function of the membrane [
