<p>The histological examination of testicular tissues revealed that CCl
 <sub>4</sub> intoxication of rats significantly damaged the spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1559325820959563">Figure 6B</xref>) as compared to normal control group, as normal testis are composed of multiple seminiferous tubular cells with germinal epithelium (4-6 layers) at various spermatogenic stages with mature spermatozoa in the central lumen. The other cells including sertoli cells and leydig cells are also present in adequate number in normal testis (

 <sub>4</sub> intoxication (
