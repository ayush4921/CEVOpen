 </sup> because most of the herbal preparations have a wide range of health benefits so hepatoprotective and renoprotective aspects were also evaluated. The statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increased in total bilirubin and liver enzymes on intoxication with CCl
 <sub>4</sub> while serum proteins significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased. On the other hands, Significant (P &lt; 0.05) improvement was reported after administration of different doses of hydroethanolic extract of plant and this improvement in liver enzymes and proteins was in dose dependent manner. Although, the concentration of globulin also increases with increased in concentration of extract amount but a significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference was reported on administration of 200 mg per Kg bw extract (

 <sub>4</sub> administration significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affects the kidney function evaluated by measuring blood urea, creatinine and uric acid level as compared to normal animal group while administration of hydroethanolic extract of
