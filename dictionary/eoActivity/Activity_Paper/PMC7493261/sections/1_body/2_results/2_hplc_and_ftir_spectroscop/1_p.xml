<p>In the present study, HPLC-UV was used to analyze the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. grandiflorum</italic> leaves qualitatively. The results revealed the presence of different phenolic compounds might be responsible for strong antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>E. genadiflorum</italic> includes Gallic Acid (Rt = 2.808), Catechin (Rt = 3.257), Chlorogenic acid (Rt = 5.366), HB acid (Rt = 6.893), Caffeic acid (Rt = 7.969), Sinapic acid (Rt = 12.954) and Ferulic acid (Rt = 13.416). The results of HPLC also revealed some peaks with different retention time could not be identified; however, based on their chromatographic behaviors and UV spectra, they may correspond to unknown flavonoids compounds as presented in respective chromatogram (
