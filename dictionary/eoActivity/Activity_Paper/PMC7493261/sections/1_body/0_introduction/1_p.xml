 <italic>E. grandiflorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Epimedium sagittatum</italic> are the most important 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic> species used to enhance sexual performance. Due to aphrodisiac properties induction in Chinese goat, 
 <italic>E. grandiflorum</italic> is commonly known as horny goat weed. Icariin, a flavonol glycoside as active ingredient of this plant induce the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in penis,

 </sup> These beneficial effects of 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic> species are due to the presence of various phytochemical constituents; and about over 260 including alkaloids, flavonoids, proteins, glycosides, bioactive peptides, waxes, amino acids, phyto-hormones are responsible for beneficiary activities, have been isolated. The active compounds of 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic> possess a wide range of pharmacological actions including the regulation of hormones, strengthening yang, to cure osteoporosis, boosting immunological function, hepatoprotective, anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, anti-lipidemic, anti-aging, and anti-depressant activities. Further, various 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been done to screen the pharmacological activities due to effective monomeric compounds or active parts present in 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic>.
