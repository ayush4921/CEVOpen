<p>Moreover, it was also find that Epimedium extracts possess a male-hormone-like effect and the administration of epimedium extract (2.0 mg/kg body weight (bw) for 2 week (14 days) orally daily significantly increased the sexual function, weight of attached genitals and improved the testosterone level in the plasma in rats.

 <italic>E. grandiflorum</italic> 5 g/kg for 8 weeks to guinea pigs significantly improved the body weight, testicular growth, spermatozoa parameters including density, viability in the epididymis and vice-testis and also increased the of the testicles, epididymis, adenohypophysis and seminal vesicles. The improvement in the sexual arousal was also reported on administration of plant extract that might be due to improvement in the reproductive hormones.

 </sup> Our finding are also coherent in the findings of She et al., who on administration of the total flavonoids from 
 <italic>E. brevicornum</italic> (150.0 mg/kg bw for 7 days) to the rats, observed significantly raised the level of reproductive hormones including testosterone, estradiol and luteinizing hormone levels as well as increased the weight of the anterior pituitary gland, epididymis and seminal vesicles in juvenile rats. Such finding revealed the Epimedium plants improving impact on both structural male reproductive system and reproductive endocrine activities.
