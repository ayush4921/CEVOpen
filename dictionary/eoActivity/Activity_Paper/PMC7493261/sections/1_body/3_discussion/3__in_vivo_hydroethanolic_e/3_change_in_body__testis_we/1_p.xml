 </sup> The reproduction is tightly regulated by hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis and Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) from hypothalamus influence the secretion of gonadotrophins; FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. FSH stimulate the spermatogenesis while LH have role in the production and release of testosterone, male reproductive hormone, from the leydig cells essential for spermatogenesis and for reproductive system development like testis and prostate.

 </sup> It also regulate the expression of secondary sexual characteristic in males like increased muscle mass, bone mass, the endocrine system and growth of body-hair.

 </sup> FSH function is to stimulate the process of spermatogenesis while LH play role in stimulating the testosterone synthesis and release. Increased blood flow is influenced by testosterone which in turn stimulates the growth of the target tissues. The current study is in agreement with findings of Khan and Ahmed,

 </sup> who also reported that CCl
 <sub>4</sub> induced testicular toxicity in rats and described that administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> caused the atrophy of testicular tissue, germinal layer degeneration, lowered the serum level of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) and testosterone in male rat.

 </sup> The impairment in reproductive hormones might be due to the direct impact of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> on leydig cells and make them unresponsive to FSH and LH, leads to decreased secretion of testosterone. In addition, it was also reported that many hormonal fluctuations like lower level of serum cortisol, testosterone, FSH, and insulin and impairment of prolactin secretion are associated with liver disorders in males.

 </sup> Moreover, it could be suggested that CYP17A1 enzyme action is inhibited by the action of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> during intoxication phase and in the leydig cells progesterone produced could not be metabolized to androgen which ultimately leads the decreased concentration of testosterone and increased level of progesterone. Hence the decreased level of progesterone and increased level of testosterone in treated animal groups revealed the effects of plants extract are to counter this inhibitory effect of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>.
