 <sub>18</sub> column (250 × 4.6 mm internal diameter), having 5 µm film thickness, accompanying an oven set at 30°C was used in Liquid chromatography. Chromera HPLC system (Perkin Elmer, USA.) attached with Flexer Binary LC pump, UV/Vis LC Detector (Shelton CT, 06484 USA) controlled by software V. 4.2. 6410 used to analyze the data. Two solutions including solvent A consisted of acetonitrile: methanol (70:30) and solvent B composed of double distilled water with 0.5% glacial acetic acid were used as the mobile phase. UV spectra were recorded at 275 nm. Different phytocompounds were identified using 275 nm wavelength by comparing the retention times and spiking samples with standards.
