<p id="p0075">The anti-obesity potential of ethanolic and methanolic leaves and stem crude extracts was appraised in induced female Wistar mice. The phytochemical appraisal of methanolic leaf extract revealed the presence of flavonoids and β-sitosterol. The alcoholic leaf extract significantly inhibit growth of calorie in the test organisms with lethal dosage at 50% (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of body weight less than 5000 mg/kg [

The pancreatic lipase potential of lyophilized juice (LJ) was investigated on plasma triacylglycerol in Swiss albino mice at dosage rate (400–900 mg/kg) for 42 days. LJ significantly reduced lipase and pancreatic amylase growth rate whereas triacylglycerol level is increased. Similarly, body and liver weight, retropertoneal adipose tissue levels were considerably suppressed which led to noticeable decrease in total triglyceride and cholesterol (900 mg/kg b.w) [
