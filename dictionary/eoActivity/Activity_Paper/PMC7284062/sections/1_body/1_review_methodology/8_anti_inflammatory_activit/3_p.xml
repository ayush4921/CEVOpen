<p id="p0060">The inhibition of hyaluronidase, lipoxidase and collagenase potentials of aqueous and ethanolic extracts at concentrations of 50–500 μg/mL, 10–200 μg/mL (hydrogen peroxide, H

 <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell-free systems via high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Diode Array Detector and Ion Trap Mass Detector. Ethanolic extract exhibited significant scavenging activity against the radicals with scavenging concentration at 50% of 132.8 ± 3.9 μg/mL (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), 16.5 ± 0.4 μg/mL (NO
 <sup>·</sup>) and 11.9 ± 1.1 μg/mL (ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>). However, aqueous extract displayed significant inhibitory concentration against superoxide anion (62.7 ± 8.1 μg/mL) when compared with ethanolic extract. Apigenin glycoside was appraised as bioactive metabolite in the extracts [
