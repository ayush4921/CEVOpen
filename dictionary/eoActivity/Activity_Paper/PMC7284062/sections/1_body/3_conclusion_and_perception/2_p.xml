 <italic>S. media</italic> revealed assortment of bioactive metabolites. In Traditional medicine, 
 <italic>S. media</italic> has been used in treatment of obesity, diabetes, dermal infections, inflammation, gastric ulcers and stomach cramps. Major bioactive metabolites such as alkaloids, tannins, phenolic compounds, phenolic acids, saponins, triterpenoids, flavonoids and flavonoids aglycone are appraised to contribute to strong therapeutic potency. Crude extracts and isolated pure compounds from 
 <italic>S. media</italic> displayed pronounced pharmacological activities justifying the different ethnopharmacological and ethnobotanical applications of 
 <italic>S. media</italic>. Researchers have done little in authenticating the therapeutic properties displayed by this plant. However, further appraisals to isolate active bioactive metabolites responsible for the marked pharmacological activities could lead to development of novel therapeutic compounds.
