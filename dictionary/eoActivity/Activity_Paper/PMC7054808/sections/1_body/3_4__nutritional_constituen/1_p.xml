<p>In appraisal of the therapeutic potentials of medicinal herbs, phytochemical, pharmacological, toxicological, and nutritional details are indispensable. In appraisal of the nutritional constituents of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaf, several nutrients assessed include moisture content (9.53 ± 0.06), carbohydrate (298.61 ± 0.40), crude lipid (47.73 ± 0.01), crude fibre (18.23 ± 0.13), and ash (15.73 ± 0.03). The nutritional contents analysed in flower revealed ash (7.00 ± 1.0), crude protein (13.14 ± 0.02), carbohydrate (57.04 ± 0.04), moisture (6.16 ± 0.14), and crude lipid (1.81 ± 0.09). It is observed that storage capacity, easy absorption of food, antimicrobial and anaesthetic properties are connected to the nutritional composition of herbs [
