<p>The reduction in the oxidative stress in the aorta and heart of streptozotoc, hyperglycemic rats was investigated by DPPH free radical scavenging and antioxidant catalase assays. The aqueous leaf extract significantly reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA levels), blood glucose; however, it increases in the antioxidant catalase and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was observed. The reversal of oxidative stress induced by cardiac dysfunction in hyperglycemic condition justified the ethnobiological claim of the plant [

 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaf extract significantly reduces oxidative stress causing diabetes in treated mice. Prominent activities were observed in the kidney and liver. The activity resulted in critical changes in the urea, protein, creatinine, and uric acid level in the blood serum [
