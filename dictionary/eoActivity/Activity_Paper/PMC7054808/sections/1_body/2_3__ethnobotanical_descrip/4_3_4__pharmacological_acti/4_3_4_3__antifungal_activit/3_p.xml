<p>The aqueous and ethanolic leaf and bark extracts of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> was assessed via disc diffusion assay against 
 <italic>M. canis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. fumigatus.</italic> The bark extracts displayed prominent concentration-dependent susceptibility against 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> On the contrary, the aqueous extract showed a strong ZOI of 12 and 16 mm, while ethanolic extracts exhibited 10 and 14 mm. However, tioconazole displayed strong inhibitory activities of 18 mm which are significantly higher than the extracts at equivalent concentration [
