<p>The antioxidant or scavenging activities is important in appraisal of therapeutic potential of medicinal herbs. Plants played significant role in protecting cell against oxidative stress caused by active free radicals [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The free radical scavenging potentials of plants are appraised by antibiotic sensitivity tests (ASTs); 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH); ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP); 2,2â€²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS); hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (HRSA), and metal ion chelating activity (MICA). The methanolic and n-hexane leaves extracts of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> were explored for their scavenging effects via DPPH assay. The methanolic extract displayed pronounced scavenging activities when compared to n-hexane extract. The methanolic extract was fractionated, leading to isolation of three major bioactive compounds (kaempferol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and emodin). The kaempferol fraction displayed pronounced scavenging activity than the butylated hydroxytoluene and emodin fractions [
