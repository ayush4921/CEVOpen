<p id="Par36">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Cells were scrapped and collected by centrifugation at 2000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenised in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer and centrifuged at 1500 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The SOD activity was determined using a SOD assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Michigan, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The activity was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level.
