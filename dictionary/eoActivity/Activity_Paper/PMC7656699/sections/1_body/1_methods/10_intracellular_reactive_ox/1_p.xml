<p id="Par41">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 96-well black plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Then, the medium was removed and the cells were incubated with 10 μM 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. Cells were washed twice with PBS and visualised using the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with Intensilight C-HGFIE Precentered Fiber Illuminator (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Bright-green fluorescence indicates the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) to dichlorofluorescin (DCF) in the presence of ROS. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) at 504 and 538 nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The fluorescence intensity was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level.
