<p id="Par40">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 96-well black plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Cells were stained according to the manufacturer’s protocol of MMP kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Fluorescence intensities were measured using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) at 540 and 590 nm (red fluorescence), and 490 and 525 nm (green fluorescence) as the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level.
