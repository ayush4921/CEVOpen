<p id="Par34">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated in F-12 K medium containing various concentrations of corticosterone (EMD Millipore Corporation, Temecula, CA, USA) for 24 h (Experiment I) or HESAE for 48 h (Experiment II). Neuroprotective effects of HESAE was determined by pre-incubating the cells with a selected range of concentrations determined from Experiment II for 48 h followed by high-dose corticosterone determined from Experiment I for another 24 h. After incubation, MTT solution at 0.5 mg/mL was added into each well and further incubated for 4 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The medium was then removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added into each well. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with 630 nm as background absorbance using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level. A high-dose corticosterone determined based on Experiment I (400 μM) was selected for subsequent assays of oxidative stress.
