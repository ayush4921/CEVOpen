<p id="Par38">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Cells were scrapped and collected by centrifugation at 1500 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenised in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 10,000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The GPx activity was determined using a GPx assay kit (Elabscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 412 nm using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The activity was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level.
