<p id="Par60">Phytochemicals and dietary antioxidants have been reported to protect cells against damage by ROS. Our previous findings showed that HESAE contains a substantial amount of phytochemicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. HESAE was able to attenuate oxidative stress induced by L-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in fibroblasts derived from a patient with Friedreich’s ataxia, which was attributed to the exogenous antioxidants of HESAE. Friedreich’s ataxia constitutes an excellent example of a pathology involving oxidative stress associated with excess iron uptake in cells [

Here, we extended our investigation of HESAE into its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in PC-12 cells that mimics the effects of depression. We are particularly interested in elucidating endogenous antioxidant defence capabilities of HESAE on the maintenance of mitochondrial function.
