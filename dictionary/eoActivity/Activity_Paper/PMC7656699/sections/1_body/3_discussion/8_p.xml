<p id="Par67">Monitoring the relative MMP in living cells can be a direct measurement of mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial electron transport chain creates an electrochemical gradient of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driving ATP synthesis via mitochondrial ATP synthase [

Excessive ROS production induces the rapid depolarisation of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential and subsequently impairs oxidative phosphorylation. Disruption of MMP triggers the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins leading to cell apoptosis [
