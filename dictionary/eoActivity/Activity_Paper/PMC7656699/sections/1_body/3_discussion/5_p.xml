<p id="Par64">On the other hand, pre-treatment with HESAE failed to restore the activity of GPx following exposure to high-dose corticosterone. We hypothesised that the neuroprotective effects of HESAE were mediated through a glutathione-independent mechanism which resulted in compensatory increased in SOD and CAT. CAT serves as a major defence in high level of oxidative stress especially when there is a limited content of glutathione or decreased GPx activity, whereas glutathione redox cycle involving GPx serves as a major defence in low level of oxidative stress [
