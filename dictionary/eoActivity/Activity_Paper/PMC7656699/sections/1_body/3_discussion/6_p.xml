<p id="Par65">Depression is a complex multifactorial disease with many possible causes. Major depressive disorder is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Mitochondria are widely recognised as a source of ROS, and overproduction of ROS leads to compromised antioxidant defence systems and oxidative stress. The interaction between energy metabolism and ROS is evident during the aging process and in the onset and progression of many age-related diseases. Upon exposure to high-dose corticosterone, dysfunction in mitochondrial autophagy machinery and impaired autophagy may increase mitochondrial ROS formation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In this study, we observed that PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone had decreased cell viability, reduced endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, disrupted mitochondrial function, and increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. Pre-treatment of PC-12 cells with HESAE prior to the oxidative stress had prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced intracellular ROS levels and attenuated apoptosis.
