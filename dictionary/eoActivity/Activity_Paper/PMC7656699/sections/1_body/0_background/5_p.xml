<p id="Par29">Studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids regulate mitochondrial function associated with neuroprotection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids was shown to enhance generation of ROS primarily triggered by damaged mitochondria, diminished cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and disrupted antioxidant systems. Furthermore, excessive ROS formation induces oxidative stress, leading to cellular damage and subsequent cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, oxidative stress in and around mitochondria has been postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of mental disorders [
