<p id="Par28">The pathogenesis of depression remains poorly understood. A generally presumed mechanism of the pathogenesis of depression is that the neuroendocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis becomes hyperactive. Normally, the HPA axis is activated in response to stressors and ensures an organism responds appropriately to ever-changing environmental challenges, which is essential for survival. Blood glucocorticoid levels are sensitively controlled by the HPA axis via negative feedback regulation. An elevation in blood glucocorticoids in response to chronic stress or depression can disrupt HPA axis function. Chronic elevation of cortisol secretions in some depressive subtypes is thought to be responsible for cognitive deficits [
