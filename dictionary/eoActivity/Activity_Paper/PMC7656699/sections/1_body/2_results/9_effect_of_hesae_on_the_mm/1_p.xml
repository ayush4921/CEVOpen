<p id="Par53">The electrochemical membrane potential across the mitochondrial membrane or MMP is an essential component for energy storage during oxidative phosphorylation. JC-10 dye facilitates the discrimination of energised and de-energised mitochondria as indicated by red fluorescent aggregates that concentrate in the energised mitochondria as the membrane potential increases, whereas cells with collapsed MMP fail to retain the dye in the mitochondria resulting in the green fluorescence of its monomeric form. As shown in Fig.
