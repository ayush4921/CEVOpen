<p id="Par47">The neuroprotective effects of HESAE against high-dose corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity was investigated through pre-treatment of HESAE at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, 400 μM corticosterone significantly reduced the viability to 59.85 ± 5.49% or 1.7-fold lower compared to negative control (
