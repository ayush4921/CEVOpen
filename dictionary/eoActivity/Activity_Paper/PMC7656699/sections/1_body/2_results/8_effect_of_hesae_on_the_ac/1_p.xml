<p id="Par52">Aconitase is an iron-sulfur protein in the Krebs cycle that catalyses the isomerisation of citrate to isocitrate for energy production. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone significantly decreased the aconitase activity to 21.03 ± 4.24% or 4.8-fold lower compared to negative control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, pre-treatment with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE did not increase the activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, higher concentrations of HESAE at 0.5 and 1 mg/mL were tested for aconitase activity. Nevertheless, the concentrations failed to restore the depleted activity. All tested concentrations of HESAE exhibited 1.7 to 3.5-fold lower in the activity compared to desipramine (
