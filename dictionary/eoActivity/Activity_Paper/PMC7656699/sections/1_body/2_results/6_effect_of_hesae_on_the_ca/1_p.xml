<p id="Par50">CAT is an endogenous antioxidant enzyme that catalyses the dismutation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> into O
 <sub>2</sub> and water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone significantly decreased the CAT activity to 78.87 ± 1.72% or 1.3-fold lower compared to negative control (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, higher concentrations of HESAE at 0.5 and 1 mg/mL were tested for CAT activity. Pre-treatment with 0.5 mg/mL HESAE significantly increased the activity up to 90.46 ± 5.71% or 1.1-fold higher compared to corticosterone (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and this is comparable to the effect of desipramine in increasing CAT activity.
