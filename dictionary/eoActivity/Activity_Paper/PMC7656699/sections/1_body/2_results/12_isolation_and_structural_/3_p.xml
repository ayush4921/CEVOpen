<p id="Par58">Structures of adenosine and herierin III were elucidated via the obtained NMR spectral data, including 1D (
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR) and 2D NMR [correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC)]. Spectral data are in agreement with those reported in the literature for structural elucidation of adenosine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and herierin III [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The complete NMR data assignments of both compounds were summarised in Additional file
