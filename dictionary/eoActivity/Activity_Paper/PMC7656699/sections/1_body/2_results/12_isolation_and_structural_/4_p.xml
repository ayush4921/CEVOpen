 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows a flow chart depicting the steps involved in isolation of the secondary metabolites. 95% ethanol was used as extracting solvent and the extraction yield was 9.606 g (17.31%). Size-exclusion chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as the packing material and MeOH as the solvent system was employed to isolate polar compounds. Large molecules were eluted from the column first followed by progressively smaller molecules. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR profiles of majority of the fractions showed overlapping of resonance signals due to sugars and secondary metabolites. Adenosine (6.9 mg, 0.46%) was isolated as a pure compound from the 8th fraction. In an attempt to separate the sugars from ethanol extract, the extract was subjected to pre-treatment with liquid-liquid partition between n-butanol and water. The yield of n-butanol and water fractions were 0.89 g (9.49%) and 4.52 g (48.19%), respectively. Non-polar compounds were extracted into n-butanol layer, while the sugars were extracted into water layer during the liquid-liquid partition process. n-butanol fraction was then fractionated using preparative radial chromatography with silica gel as stationary phase and CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> as mobile phase with increasing MeOH gradient. The polarity-based method was suitable for the isolation of non-polar to medium polar compounds. Therefore, herierin III (25.4 mg, 0.05%), a medium polar compound was obtained from the 6th fraction of first run, and 5th fraction from second and third runs of preparative radial chromatography.
