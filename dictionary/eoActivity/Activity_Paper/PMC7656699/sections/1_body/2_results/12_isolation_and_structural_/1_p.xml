 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the structures of two major compounds, namely adenosine (
 <bold>1</bold>) and herierin III (
 <bold>2</bold>) isolated from the ethanol extract of HESAE. Adenosine was isolated as a white powder. The UV spectrum showed absorption peak (λ
 <sub>max</sub>) at 207.5 and 259.5 nm, suggesting a typical adenine chromophore. In the IR spectrum, a broad peak was observed at 3362.71 cm
 <sup>− 1</sup> due to the presence of OH groups. Absorption due to amine function was not observed due to overlapping with the observed OH peak in the IR spectrum. The HRESIMS showed an [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> peak at m/z 268.1043, which established the molecular formula of adenosine as C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>13</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>.
