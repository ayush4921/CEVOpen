  <p>Effect of corticosterone and HESAE on the viability of PC-12 cells. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay following incubation with various concentrations of (
   <bold>a</bold>) corticosterone (200 to 800 μM) for 24 h and (
   <bold>b</bold>) HESAE (0.125 to 8 mg/mL) for 48 h, respectively. Data are expressed as mean ± SD and statistically analysed by Games-Howell’s or Tukey’s test. Asterisk (*) indicates significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the viability compared to the negative control group
