  <p>Effect of HESAE on the viability and LDH release in PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone. Cell viability and LDH release were evaluated by (
   <bold>a</bold>) MTT assay and (
   <bold>b</bold>) LDH assay following pre-treatment with HESAE for 48 h and high-dose corticosterone of 400 μM for 24 h. Data are expressed as mean ± SD and statistically analysed by Games-Howell’s or Tukey’s test. Asterisks (*) and hash signs (#) indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the viability and LDH release compared to the corticosterone group and desipramine group, respectively
