<p>To assure uniform water and sodium load, saline (0.9% NaCl) at 5 ml/100 gm was given to the animals 45 min before extract administration. The control group was given vehicle (deionized water) and standard group 10 mg/kg HCTZ while treatment groups were given 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg of AT-Cr, BS-AT, AS-AT, and DS-AT. Instantly after dosing, animals were kept in metabolic cages, and urine was collected and volume was recorded at 2, 4, and 6 h. Cumulative urine excretion was calculated according to body weight as mL/100 g. At the end of the experiment, urine electrolyte concentration (sodium and potassium) was estimated and expressed as mmol/L; moreover, urine pH was also determined [
