<p>Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) from the central vivarium of the University of Sargodha were used in this study. All animals were maintained in controlled conditions (12 h light/dark cycle, 25 ± 1°C temperature) with feed and water ad libitum. Animals were provided with housing conditions following accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care (NIH publication number # 85–23, revised in 1985), and we try to minimize animal distress and the number of animals used. All experimental procedures were approved (No. IAEC/UOS/2016/46) by the Ethical Committee of College of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha.</p>
