<p>For the determination of the total flavonoid contents (TFCs), total phenolic contents (TPC), and antioxidant potential, we utilized the methodology described by Younis et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) radical scavenging assay, nitric oxide scavenging assay, total reducing power (TRP), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays were used to determine antioxidant characteristics of AT-Cr, AS-AT, BS-AT, and DS-AT.
