<p>Rats were separated into five groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6): Group I = received NaCl 0.9%, Group II = AT-Cr (1–50 mg/kg), Group III = BS-AT (1–50 mg/kg), Group IV = AS-AT (1–25 mg/kg), and Group V = DS-AT (1–80 mg/kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were estimated for 45 minutes after dosing. Freshly prepared dilutions of extract were administered to rats at 1 ml/kg, and a dose of the most active fraction was selected which provided a 50% reduction in BP to further understand the blood pressure-lowering mechanism.
