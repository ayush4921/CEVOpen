<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> were purchased from a local herbal market in Lahore, Pakistan. Seeds were identified and authenticated by a plant taxonomist Dr. Amin-Ullah Shah, and a voucher specimen (#W-6031) was submitted for further research reference at the Herbarium of the University of Sargodha. 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> seeds (4 kg) were shade dried and pulverized to a coarse constituency for extraction. The powder was soaked in 3 L water and methanol (30 : 70, v/v), followed by filtration with a muslin cloth and filter papers. This process was repeated three times, and the filtrate was concentrated by using a rotary evaporator and stored in a cool place (4–6°C). The percentage yield of this crude extract of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> (AT-Cr) was 11%. For activity guided fractionation, 100 g AT-Cr was mixed with distilled water, and liquid-liquid extractions were performed using solvents with different polarity based absolute solvents: hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Obtained fractions were concentrated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator. This process resulted in 26.4 g of the hexane fraction (HS-AT), 7 g of the dichloromethane fraction (DS-AT), 22.4 g of the butanol fraction (BS-AT), and 43 g of the aqueous soluble fraction (AS-AT). The ethyl acetate fraction was obtained in negligible quantities. The hexane soluble fraction was not used because it is insoluble in employed solvents. All these samples were placed at 4°C in a refrigerator for further pharmacological and phytochemical studies [
