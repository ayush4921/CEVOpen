<p>The annotation of the chemical constituents was performed by comparison of spectral data (UV, MS, and MS/MS) with published data, as well as by the GNPS platform (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gnps.ucsd.edu/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://gnps.ucsd.edu/</ext-link>). To create the molecular network, six fragment ions were considered, and for precursor and fragment ions, the mass tolerances were considered up 0.02 Da and 0.1 Da. The molecular network was based on edges with cosine scores of more than 0.7 and 6 ions [
