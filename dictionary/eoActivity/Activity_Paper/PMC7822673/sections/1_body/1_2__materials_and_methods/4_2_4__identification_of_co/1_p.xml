<p>Previously, the samples DS-AT, BS-AT, and AS-AT were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and here, they were reanalyzed to perform annotation by GNPS and to create the molecular network. A UFLC Prominence Shimadzu coupled to diode array detector (DAD) and a mass spectrometer MicrOTOF-Q III (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) was used. The analyses were performed by a Kinetex C18 column (2.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 150 × 2.1 mm, Phenomenex) applying the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and oven temperature of 50°C. Ultrapure water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both added to 0.1% formic acid (v/v), were used as mobile phase. The applied methods were the same described by Tolouei et al. (2019) [
