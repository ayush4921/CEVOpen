<p>A previous research study from our laboratory has revealed that 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> has beneficial effects in reducing blood pressure and vascular complication, as well as protective effects on insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress in glucose-fed rats [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> has also been studied for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, diuretic, and lipoxygenase inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, considering the traditional uses and previous evidence of the effectiveness of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> against cardiovascular diseases, the current research was carried out to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the possible diuretic effect of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> and verify its relationship with a potential hypotensive effect using normotensive rats.
