<p>Oxidative stress has been the major underlying factor in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders like metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases, and heart failure owing to the rich supply of NADPH oxidase-induced ROS in vasculature and kidney. A high burden of ROS in the renal medulla will reduce the medullary blood flow and sodium excretion, resulting in high blood pressure and renal injury [

 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> seeds showed significant DPPH and nitric oxide (NOâˆ’) free radical scavenging ability, which is in line with the previously reported antioxidant potential of whole plant extract [

 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> extract and their fractions may, directly or indirectly, contribute to the diuretic and hypotensive activities.
