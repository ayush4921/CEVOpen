<p>Data obtained in this study indicates a possible role of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> as an antihypertensive drug for the treatment of several CVDs. Our data showed the hypotensive and diuretic potential of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius,</italic> and according to our results, these effects appear to be attributed to the activation of muscarinic receptors. In fact, the hypotensive effect of aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> (AS-AT) was not altered in the presence of L-NAME, indomethacin, or hexamethonium whereas atropine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the hypotensive response of AS-AT. In the vascular system, nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) regulate directly the arteriolar tone and consequently blood pressure levels. The main activator of NO and PGI2 synthesis in the vascular system is Ca2+. If Ca2+ levels rise, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) detaches from a protein called caveolin and is activated [

In vascular endothelium, M3 receptors may activate phospholipase C by increasing the inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels, which mobilizes Ca2+ from the cellular sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, substances capable of stimulating the M3 receptors may increase the release of NO and PGI2 and therefore reduce peripheral resistance and blood pressure. On the other hand, a recent study conducted by Tangsucharit et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] has shown that the acetylcholine M1 and M3 receptors can also induce endothelium-independent vasodilation. In fact, removal of the endothelium in rat mesenteric arteries significantly decreased the levels of expression of M2 and M3, but not of M1. In mesenteric vascular beds denuded of the endothelium, ACh administration (10 and 100â€‰nmol) caused long-lasting vasodilation, which was markedly blocked by treatment with highly selective antagonists, including pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) and 4-DAMP (M1 and M3 antagonists). These results suggest that the AChR muscarinic subtypes, mainly M1, are distributed by the rat mesenteric arteries and that the activation of M1 and/or M3, which may be located in the peptidergic nerves, releases calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), causing vasodilation independent of the endothelium. Thus, as atropine is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, it was able to block the effects of AS-AT, while L-NAME and indomethacin, which inhibit endothelial mediators (i.e., NO and PGI2), did not show this ability.
