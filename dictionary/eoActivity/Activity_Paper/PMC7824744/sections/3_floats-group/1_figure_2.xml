  <p>Quantitative flow cytometric analysis of the abundance of apoptotic HT22 cells using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Annexin V+/PI– cells are seen in the lower right are in the early stage and annexin V+/PI+ in the upper right quadrant are late stage. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Treatment of cells with glutamate, NAC and LRE alone or in combination with 5 mM glutamate; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Treatment of cells with glutamate, NAC and LRC and LRH alone or in combination with 5 mM glutamate; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Representative scatter plots of the distribution of annexin V and PI-stained cells. Values are mean ± SEM of at least three independent runs.
