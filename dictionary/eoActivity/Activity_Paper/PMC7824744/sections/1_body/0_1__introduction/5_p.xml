<p>However, no or few studies have reported the protective effects of extracts from the Tiger Milk Mushroom in brain cells. Thus, in this study, we set out to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of LR extracts against glutamate-induced oxidative stress, and also determined their effect on the expression of antioxidant genes in HT22 cells. In addition, we investigated potential neuroprotective effects of LR extracts in
