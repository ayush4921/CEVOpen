<p>Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) involve degeneration or death of nerve cells [

 <xref rid="B2-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One of the factors that plays a complex role in these diseases is reactive oxygen species (ROS). Normally ROS are generated in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [
