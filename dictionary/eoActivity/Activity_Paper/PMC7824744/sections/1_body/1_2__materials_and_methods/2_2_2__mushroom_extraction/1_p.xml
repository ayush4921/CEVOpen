<p>A powder of cultivated strain TM02 of 
 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> (LR) was obtained from LiGNO Biotech™ Sdn Bhd, Selangor, Malaysia. This powder was extracted into three fractions with ethanol, cold water and hot water using the maceration technique. Briefly, 100 g of LR powder was macerated with 1 L of ethanol and the extract was placed on the shaker at 4 °C for 24 h. After that, it was filtered by using Whatman® No.2 filter paper and ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation (Heidolph, Laborota 4011) to yield the crude ethanol extract (LRE). Cold water extraction: 100 g of LR powder was suspended in sterile water and placed on the shaker at 4 °C for 24 h. For hot water extraction, sclerotial powder was extracted with water at 95–100 °C for 2 h. After that, the mixture was filtered and freeze dried by lyophilizer (ModulyoD freeze dryer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to give a crude cold-water extract (LRC) and a crude hot-water extract (LRH). Yields of LRE, LRC and LRH were 0.73 g, 11.07 g and 10.13 g, respectively. Before starting the experiment, the crude extract of LRE was dissolved in DMSO, while the crude extracts of LRC and LRH were dissolved in sterile water to make the 100 mg/mL stock solution.
