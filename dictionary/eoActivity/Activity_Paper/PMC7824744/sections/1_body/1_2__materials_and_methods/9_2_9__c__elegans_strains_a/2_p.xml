<p>Concerning age-synchronized worms, the eggs were isolated by a bleaching reagent (5M NaOH and 5% NaOCl). They were then vortexed for 10 min and centrifuged for 40 s at 1300 rpm. Next, the supernatant was discarded and the eggs washed with sterile water twice. Then, as much water as possible was removed. An 8 mL M9 buffer was added to a 60 × 15 mm petri dish and the eggs were transferred into the dish and placed in a 20 °C incubator for 16 h. The eggs in the M9 buffer were hatched and remained at the L1 larvae stage.</p>
