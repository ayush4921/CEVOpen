<p>Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, has positive effects on several brain functions such as cognition, memory and learning [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, excess glutamate leads to glutamate toxicity, and causes neuronal apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B15-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are two pathways for glutamate toxicity, including receptor-initiated excitotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B33-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and nonreceptor-mediated oxidative glutamate toxicity [
 <xref rid="B34-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The latter is linked to glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells because this immortalized cell line lacks the ionotrophic glutamate receptor. High concentrations of extracellular glutamate (&gt;200 ÂµM) cause glutamate-mediated oxidative stress by preventing cysteine uptake into cells through a glutamate/cysteine antiporter followed by depletion of intracellular cysteine, resulting in a glutathione reduction [
 <xref rid="B35-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which leads to ROS accumulation. Excessive ROS could damage cells and intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in several ways. For example, ROS interacts with mitochondrial membranes, which leads to lipid peroxidation and membrane destabilization [
 <xref rid="B36-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These processes alter mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction. MMP is a good target for assessing in vitro toxicity. A decrease in MMP and inactive mitochondria may be linked to apoptosis and associated with various diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorder and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B41-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As previously reported, glutamate-induced apoptosis is mediated via the caspase-independent pathway in HT22 cells [
