<p>Furthermore, LRE exerted a neuroprotective effect against Aβ-induced deficits in chemotaxis behavior in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, leading to an increase in the CI of the CL 2355 transgenic strain, containing the human Aβ peptide that is also known as a hallmark of AD [

Our findings suggested that LRE may be a new candidate for neurodegeneration protection, However, LRE extracts should be extensively studied for their neuroprotective activity.
