<p>The transgenic CL2355 worms express Aβ in nerve cells (Alzheimer model). As a physiological response, these nematodes show a reduced ability for chemotaxis. In order to determine potential neuroprotective effects, we selected three concentrations of LRE (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL) that gave good effects in HT22 cells.</p>
