<p>Glutamate reduced the MMP of HT22 cells to 8.00 ± 9.23 compared to control (56.81 ± 11.28). Similarly, the cells, treated with CCCP as a positive control for MMP, significantly decreased the fluorescence intensity to 15.29 ± 7.947. LRE and 0.25 mM NAC alone had no influence on MMP. However, a co-treatment of the cells with 100 and 200 μg/mL of LRE and 5 mM glutamate significantly improved the TMRE fluorescence intensity in a dose-dependent manner compared to glutamate-treated cells at 47.19 ± 9.774, and 58.62 ± 14.36, respectively. Moreover, the co-treatment with NAC had a positive effect (39.95 ± 11.89 (
