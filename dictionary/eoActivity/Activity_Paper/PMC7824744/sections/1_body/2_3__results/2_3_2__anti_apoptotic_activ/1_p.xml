<p>In a second step, we investigated the role of apoptosis in glutamate-induced cell death in HT22 cells. In accordance with the MTT results, we selected concentrations of 100 and 200 µg/mL of LR and 5 mM glutamate. We found that 5 mM glutamate increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 10.71 ± 2.91% in controls to 62.64 ± 8.64%. Apoptosis in LRE- and NAC-treated cells was similar to that of controls. However, co-treatment cells with LRE and glutamate reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells to 10.18 ± 4.266% and 9.796 ± 4.416% (LRE) and 10.73 ± 4.175% (NAC) (
