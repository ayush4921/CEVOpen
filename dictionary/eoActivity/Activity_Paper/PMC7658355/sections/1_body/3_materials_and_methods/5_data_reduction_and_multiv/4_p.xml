<p id="Par33">In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation and 200 times of response permutation testing (RPT) was applied with 1/seventh of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to review the model quality and guard against over-fitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model, P values from a two-tailed Student’s t test on the normalized peak areas and the adjusting P value for correcting was obtained by Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method, and fold change (FC) value SSM verse NSSM, where metabolites with VIP values ≥ 1.0 and p values &lt; 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites. While calculating FC values, if the datum displaying the content of metabolite is zero, it would be changed by the half of the minimal corresponding value in the table of data matrix (2.5E-06)
