<p id="Par30">The acquired LC–MS raw data were filtered by the software of Progenesis QI v2.3 (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) through steps of baseline filtering, peak recognition, integration, retention time correction, peak alignment and normalization, and using the following parameters. Precursor tolerance was set at 5 ppm, product tolerance was set at 10 ppm, product ion threshold was set at 5%, and retention time (RT) tolerance was set at 0.02 min. Internal standard detection parameters were deselected for peak RT alignment, isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis, and noise elimination level was set at 10.00, minimum intensity was set to 15% of base peak intensity. The Excel file was obtained with three dimensions data sets including m/z (mass-to-charge ratio), peak RT (retention time) and peak intensities, and RT–m/z pairs were used as the identifier for each ion. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility)
