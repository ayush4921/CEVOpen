 </sup> source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to analyze the metabolic profiling in both ESI positive and ESI negative ion modes. An ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) was employed in detecting both positive and negative modes. The binary gradient elution system consisted of (A) 0.1% (v/v) formic acid dissolved in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid (v/v) dissolved in acetonitrile and separation was achieved using the following gradient: 0 min, 5% B; 1.5 min, 5% B; 3 min, 30% B; 7 min, 60% B; 9 min, 90% B; 11 min, 100% B; 13 min, 100% B; 13.2 min, 5% B; 16 min, 5% B. The flow rate was at 0.35 mL/min and column temperature was at 40 ℃. All the samples were kept at 4 ℃ during the detection, the injection volume was at 5 μL each time, and the mass range was from m/z 100 to 1000. The resolution was set at 70,000 for the full MS scans and 17,500 for HCD MS/MS scans, and the Collision energy was set at 10, 20 and 40 eV. The mass spectrometer operated as follows: spray voltage, 3500 V at negative and positive mode; capillary temperature, 320 ℃; sheath gas flow rate, 40 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10 arbitrary units.
