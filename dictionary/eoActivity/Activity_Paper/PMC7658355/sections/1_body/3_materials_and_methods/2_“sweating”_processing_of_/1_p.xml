<p id="Par26">The same batch of 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> was with all kinds of size collected, washed thoroughly and put in an open, clean, dry and cool place, so as to avoid overstocking during the process of natural water loss, preventing heat production. Then, reed heads were removed from the roots and picked over ones with uniform thickness and randomly divided them into two groups. One group (SSM) was processed by “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”, and the other group (NSSM) was unprocessed and directly stored at – 80 ℃. The steps of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” processing which are screened by modifying report from Liang et al. are as follows

 </sup>: More than 100 kg fresh roots with different sizes were piled up for seven days and covered with a sack to produce heat so as to make the internal moisture of root tissues spread outward in an open place. In order to make the whole roots sweat evenly, the roots were spread out for a night and then covered with sack every two days. When the internal sections of the roots turned purplish red, end “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” and gather them up. Six independent sample pairs were collected from two groups and each sample pair of the same size were ground into powder after being lyophilized in a speed vacuum and sieving with 50 order mesh were stored at − 80 ℃.
