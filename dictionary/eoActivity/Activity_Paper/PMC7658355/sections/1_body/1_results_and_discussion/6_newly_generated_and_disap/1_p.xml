<p id="Par21">By comparing the sum of fragments ion strength of each substance peak, 58 substance peaks only emerged in SSM, among which 31 metabolites identified, including 19 from positive ion models (ESI
 <sup>+</sup>) and 12 from negative ion models (ESI
 <sup>-</sup>). 99 substance peaks were exclusively determined in NSSM with 49 metabolites identified, which contained 27 and 22 differential metabolites from ESI
 <sup>+</sup> and ESI
 <sup>-</sup>, respectively (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Among these 80 identified (31 in SSM and 49 in NSSM) exclusive metabolites, 20, 9, 6, 4, 4, 3 of them belonged to carboxylic acids and derivatives, polyketides, fatty acyls, flavonoids, prenol lipids, and benzene and substituted derivatives, respectively.
