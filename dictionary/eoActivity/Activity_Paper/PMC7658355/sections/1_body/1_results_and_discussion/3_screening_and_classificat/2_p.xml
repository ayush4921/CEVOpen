<p id="Par14">To identify differential metabolites between samples, a fold change ≥ 1.6 (up-regulated) or ≤ 0.625 (down-regulated) in SSM compared to NSSM, and these metabolites were screened using a variable importance in projection (VIP) value (VIP ≥ 1.0) from the OPLS-DA model. A total of 287 differential metabolites had been identified from total 4759 identified metabolites between SSM and NSSM by VIP and FC value, containing 130 and 157 metabolites from the positive and negative model, respectively (Fig.
