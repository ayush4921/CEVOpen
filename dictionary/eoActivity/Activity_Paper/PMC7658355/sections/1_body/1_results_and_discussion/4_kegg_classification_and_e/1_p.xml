 </sup>. Our result showed that 51 metabolites mapped to “metabolism” and they had KEGG ID. Subsequently, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify differences in metabolic pathway between SSM and NSSM samples. 19 metabolites had been found enriched in 30 KEGG pathways (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). By calculating the –lg(
 <italic>P</italic>-value) of each pathway, linoleic acid metabolism was the most enriched pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were also the main enriched pathways (Fig.
