<p id="Par8">The difference of components between SSM and NSSM materials in this study merely comes from “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” process without long-term storage leading to complex components loss, with which may result in non-unique difference. Additionally, we compared the changes of some main characteristic bioactive components in Danshen before and after “S
 <italic>weating</italic>” to specifically reveal the effect of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”. The results gave a deeper insight into the mechanism behind “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” of Danshen and a better explanation of the scientific connotation of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”.
