 <italic>Sweating</italic>” is the main initial processing method for Danshen roughly as follows: the fresh roots of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>miltiorrhiza</italic> are piled up and covered to produce heat and emit moisture to the surface of the materials
 <sup>

 </sup>. “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” is beneficial not only to the drying of herbs, but also to regulate and promote the enzyme system and microbial community activity in herbs tissues, and accelerate the process of biotransformation and chemical transformation of primary and secondary metabolites, which directly affects the quality of medicinal materials

 </sup>. Pharmacological activities of medicinal materials can be changed by “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”. Some related pharmacodynamic studies have shown that the antioxidant activity
 <sup>

 </sup>, brain protective effect, and myocardial protective effect of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>miltiorrhiza</italic> (SSM) are stronger than those of non-sweating 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>miltiorrhiza</italic> (NSSM)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Cocktail probed drug method has been used to study the effects of SSM and NSSM on CYP450 enzyme activity in rats. The result has shown that there are significant differences in effects of SSM and NSSM on CYP450 enzyme activity in rats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. The unique pharmacology and efficacy of SSM is a reflection of hundreds of bioactive compounds rather than a single or several ones. In addition, the various activities of components in Danshen are considered responsible for the therapeutic effects of Danshen
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to study the changes of the composition and content of chemical components in roots of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>miltiorrhiza</italic> after “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”. However, due to the complexity of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it’s far from enough to be merely focused on several main bioactive components in TCM but ignore the whole changes of the metabolites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, and it’s difficult to comprehensively and accurately investigate the effect of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” on the chemical composition of Danshen by only determining some main components
 <italic>.</italic> Consequently, studies of the overall chemicals profile of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” on Danshen are necessary to better understand the mechanism of “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”.
