  <p>Differentially accumulating metabolites between SSM and NSSM. 
   <bold>a</bold> Differential gene volcano plot of the 4759 metabolites identified. Differential metabolites were defined as metabolites with fold change ≥ 1.6 or ≤ 0.625 in SSM compared with NSSM. A threshold of VIP &gt; 1.0 was used to separate differential metabolites from not-significantly differential metabolites,
