<p>Five groups of mice (6 mice/group) were induced with solid tumours by subcutaneous injection of DLA cells (1 X 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/animal) into the right hind limb to determine the effect of LEAM on solid tumour growth. Drug administration was initiated 24Â h after tumour cell inoculation orally and continued for 10 consecutive days. The treatment schedule for animal groups is as follows: 
 <disp-quote>
  <p>Group I: DLA-bearing mice (Negative control)</p>
 </disp-quote>
 <disp-quote>
  <p>Group II: DLA-bearing mice with a dose of 3.5 mg/kg b.wt. Cisplatin</p>
 </disp-quote>
 <disp-quote>
  <p>Group III: DLA-bearing mice + 100 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM</p>
 </disp-quote>
 <disp-quote>
  <p>Group IV: DLA-bearing mice + 200 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM</p>
 </disp-quote>
 <disp-quote>
  <p>Group V: DLA-bearing mice + 500 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM.</p>
