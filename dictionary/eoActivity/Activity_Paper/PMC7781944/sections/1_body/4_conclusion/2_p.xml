<p>Our study demonstrates the potency of 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> L. methanolic leaf extracts showing 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> antitumour activity without major changes in toxicity parameters evaluated. We found a dramatic decrease in cell viability and increased protection against experimental animals from the deleterious effect of DLA/EAC induced tumour in mice exerted by LEAM in a dose-dependent manner. However, in comparison with different concentrations of leaf extract tested, 500 mg/kg b.wt. dose of LEAM regressed tumour growth and prolonged survival in mice. Hence, it is proved that 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaf methanol extracts possessed potent antitumour activity. This indicates that the leaf may potentially provide better bioactive compounds with substantial anti-proliferative characteristics that could be useful in primary healthcare. However, to support the above, further investigations are being carried out to elucidate the exact mechanism of action and its metabolism studies.
