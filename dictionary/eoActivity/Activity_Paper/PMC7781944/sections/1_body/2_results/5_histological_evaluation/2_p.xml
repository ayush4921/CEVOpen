<p>Light microscopic observations of the vital organs such as brain, kidney, liver, and spleen of the mice did not display any gross pathological abnormalities in all the control and LEAM treated (500 mg/kg b.wt.) groups for acute toxicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(A-H</xref>)). The control and LEAM treated groups displayed typical morphological structure in the light photomicrographs of the kidney and liver. The kidneys showed no morphological difference for the LEAM treated group. The occurrence of glomerular architecture in terms of glomeruli, distal and proximal tubules was comparable to those of control groups. There was also no interstitial and intraglomerular blockage or tubular atrophies. All nephron cells appeared normal and displayed clearly visible nuclei with no lymphocyte distortion, bruising, necrosis, or infiltration. The liver of LEAM treated animals also showed regular cellular composition, binucleation without any distortions relative to the control group. There were also no signs of injury, necrosis, clogging, fatty acid aggregation, or hemorrhagic zones surrounding the central vein or liver sinusoids. The hepatocytes organized in cords were quite clear. Liver revealed no lyses in blood cells or infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages. Likewise, all mice showed normal structure and histology of the spleen and brain. Thus, the histopathological assessments of the selected organs did not reveal histopathies that could be attributed to the administration of LEAM to the mice.
