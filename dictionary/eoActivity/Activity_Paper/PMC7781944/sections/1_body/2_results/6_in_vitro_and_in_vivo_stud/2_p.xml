<p>In cytotoxicity assay, the LEAM showed excellent concentration-dependent cytotoxic potential against DLA and EAC cancer cells which is an indication of biological potency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). The 50% inhibitory concentration values were calculated for DLA and EAC cell lines from the corresponding regression equation. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 85.56 ± 5.28 and 68.07 ± 7.39 µg/mL for DLA and EAC, respectively. LEAM exhibited better cytotoxic activity against EAC than DLA cells as evident with lesser IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
