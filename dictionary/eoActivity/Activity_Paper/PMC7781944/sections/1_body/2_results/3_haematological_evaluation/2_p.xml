<p>The mean haematological profiles of untreated and treated mice with LEAM are given in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The mean haemoglobin content significantly reduced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) following single-dose administration when compared to control. Relative to untreated mice, when treated with LEAM, WBC (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and platelet count (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) augmented significantly. The differential blood count did not show any significant changes except lymphocyte percentage which showed a significant rise (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) when treated with LEAM. However, there were no significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in RBC, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC contents between control group and treated group (500 mg/kg b.wt. of LEAM).
