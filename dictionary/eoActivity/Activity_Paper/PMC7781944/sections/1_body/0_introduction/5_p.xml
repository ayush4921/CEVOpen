<p>In plants, leaves are considered to account for the highest accumulation of their bioactive compounds, which are synthesized as secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Compared with many organic solvents and aqueous media used to extract plant-based compounds, methanol seems to yield better extraction of compounds especially from the leaves [
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is also observed that the highest levels of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoids are extracted using methanol which is attributable to greater solubility of these bioactive compounds in methanol over certain solvents [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While major phytochemicals have been identified from 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>, the potential 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> antitumour activity of crude methanolic extracts remains rather obscure. Consequently, the present study was aimed at assessing the phytochemical potential and anticancer activity of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaf methanol extracts to experimentally justify its application in mice to Daltonâ€™s lymphoma ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) mediated solid and ascitic tumours.
