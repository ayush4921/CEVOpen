<p>Another report by Brito 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] noticeably discussed the antitumour and toxicity of volatile oil from 
 <italic>Annona leptopetala</italic> leaf suggesting antitumour activity with moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. Our results corroborate these findings indicating antitumour activity without major changes in toxicity parameters evaluated. The reduction in the viability per cent and tumour cell count in treated animals as seen in this study may also be due to the selective inhibition of cancer cells via the down-regulation and inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [
