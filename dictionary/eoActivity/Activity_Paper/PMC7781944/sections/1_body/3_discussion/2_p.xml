Acute toxicity findings in the present study did not indicate significant variation in the mice behaviour which suggests no alteration in the general state of the animal after LEAM administration. Accordingly, the acute toxicity study enabled us to determine the sublethal doses of LEAM which was determined to be 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg b.wt.. Similarly, the haematological and biochemical markers showed no significant difference in all the treated mice with different doses of LEAM in comparison to control. Even after an autopsy, the histological examination of the organs showed normal architectures in the LEAM treated livers, kidneys, spleens, and brains of mice. A noticeable antitumour effect was evidenced in the present study as there was a significant reduction in tumour volume, viable tumour cell count, overall survivorship, and life expectancy of tumour harbouring mice.
