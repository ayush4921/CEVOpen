<p>Nonetheless, few investigators have reported that 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> induces cytotoxicity due to alteration in glucose metabolism resulting in unsafe metabolism obstructions. This impedance can be a target against cancer since the proliferating tumour cells have high energy demand provided by aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation [
