  <p>Effect of LEAM on DLA-induced solid tumour. A dose-dependent decrease in the tumour volume was observed. Values are indicated as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). Differences in tumour inhibition were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s posthoc test and Barlett’s test to compare the variance in different-studied groups. Statistical significance was set at the 95% level, where *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001 and p &gt; 0.05 refers to nonsignificant difference (ns) vs. control
