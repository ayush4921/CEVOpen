 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> is a well-known facultative anaerobic bacterium responsible for pathogenesis of dental caries and tooth decay. Kacergius et al. showed that methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> significantly inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A greater inhibitory effect was obtained with methyl gallate, a major constituent of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In another study, aqueous extract of sumac demonstrated a concentration-dependent growth inhibition of five common oral bacteria namely, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Moreover, on orthodontic wire, the plant extract was also able to significantly reduce bacterial biofilm formation by 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It is noteworthy that 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract did not show significant effect against the growth of beneficial bacteria [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. All these data argue in favor of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> as a potential source of novel compounds that possess antibiofilm activity, and which could be used for oral health.
