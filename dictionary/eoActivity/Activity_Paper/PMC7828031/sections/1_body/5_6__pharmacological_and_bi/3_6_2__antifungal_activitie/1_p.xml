<p>Fungi are also important pathogens that infect humans, animals and even plants. As such, they can cause several diseases and lead to crop losses. Anthracnose is a disease caused by a number of the fungal pathogens such as 
 <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> which frequently attack temperate plants, causing damage to both mature and immature fruits [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> towards the control of tomato anthracnose, caused by 
 <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> in tomato plants and fruits, was tested. Interestingly, aqueous extract of sumacâ€™s fruits elicited significant antifungal activity against tomato anthracnose caused by 
 <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic>, suggesting that 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> can be a cost-effective and ecofriendly replacement to chemical fungicides in the management of tomato anthracnose disease [
