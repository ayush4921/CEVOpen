<p>Neurodegenerative diseases can be initiated by severe acute traumatic injuries, ischemia, hypoxia generating oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation which is strongly associated with one of Alzheimerâ€™s diseases such as optic neuropathies [
 <xref rid="B138-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Retinal degeneration is known to cause a visual impairment and blindness and it can occur when the blood supply to the retina is unable to meet the ocular metabolic needs [

 <xref rid="B140-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Therefore, the need for neuroprotective medication or any therapeutic approaches that reverse, block, or slow down neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases is urgently needed. A study investigating the neuroprotective effects of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> (ERC) fruit against retinal degeneration in vitro was conducted in the rat retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5 [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Results showed that ERC significantly reduced serum-deprivation-induced cell death of RGC-5 cells. Also, ERC was found to significantly abolish the reduction in the levels of GST and GSH induced by serum deprivation [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These findings highlight a potential neuroprotective activity of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> against retinal degeneration and justify its use in folk medicine. The limitation of this study is the use of a single retinal cell line. Further neural cell lines should be tested, and animal studies should be undertaken to further confirm the neuroprotective activity of sumac fruit.
