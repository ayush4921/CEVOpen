<p>A documented role for ROS and lipase inhibition in obesity is existent. Lipases present in the digestive system are important in the hydrolysis of glycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. The most important of these lipases is the pancreatic lipase (PL) which plays an important role in converting the triglycerides found in ingested oils into monoglycerides and free fatty acids [

Also, increasing evidence strongly suggests that elevated oxidative stress is critically involved in obesity and in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated metabolic syndromes [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> was first evaluated by Jamous et al., They showed that 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> leaves and fruit epicarp exhibited a potent inhibition of LP activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, sumac extract also showed a strong antioxidant and scavenging activity measured by the α, α-Diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DDPPH) scavenging activity assay [

 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Another recent study by Taskin et al. revealed that methanolic extract of sumac leaves exhibited a potent antioxidant and scavenging activity in DPPH, FRAP, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study by Heydari et al. showed that sumac fruit supplementation led to significant weight loss, decrease of waist circumference, and body mass index in obese patients [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>—through its antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition—represent a valuable source for potential natural compounds that could be beneficial in the fight against overweight or obesity.
