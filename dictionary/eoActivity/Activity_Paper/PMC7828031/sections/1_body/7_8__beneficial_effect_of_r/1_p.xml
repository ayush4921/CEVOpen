<p>Recently, the use of spices as a source of natural antioxidants, preservatives, and fortifying agents in the food industries has gained much interest [
 <xref rid="B152-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Gulmez et al. tested the ability of water extract of sumac fruit, used at concentration 8% (wt./vol.), to improve the bacteriological quality and refrigerated shelf life of broiler chicken meat [
 <xref rid="B151-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The authors showed that the number of contaminating bacteria (psychotrophs, mesophilic aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and fecal coliforms) grown on the meat, stored for 14 days at 25 °C, were reduced in sumac-treated compared to distilled water-treated broiler wings [

 <xref rid="B154-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Extract-treated butter was stored at 4 and 25 °C. Sumac fruit extract was shown to mildly increase the shelf life of yayik butter at both temperature [
