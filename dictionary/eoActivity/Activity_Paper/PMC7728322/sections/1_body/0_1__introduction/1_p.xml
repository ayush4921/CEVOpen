<p>Since time immemorial, traditional medicines have been playing a significant role in the life of mankind and remain important for the modern medicine despite the abundant number of synthetic available drugs. Drug industries are heavily engaged in large-scale pharmacologic screening of medicinal herbs, spices and other food plants with the aim to develop efficient and safer medicines [

Phytochemicals can act as multiple target compounds and they can be valuable sources of health promoting compounds especially if we consider that the pathogenesis of many diseases is rather multi-factorial in nature, and not due to a single cause [
