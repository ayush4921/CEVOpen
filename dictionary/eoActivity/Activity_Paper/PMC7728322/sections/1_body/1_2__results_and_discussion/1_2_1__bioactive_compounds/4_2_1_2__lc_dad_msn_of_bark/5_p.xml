<p>To confirm the structures of the most abundant compound we proceed with isolation. A total of 5 g of methanol extract of bark were applied to a sephadex column 4 × 100 cm and fraction were eluted with methanol. A total of 300 fractions of 20 mL were collected and pooled on the basis of their behaviour in TLC. From fraction 96–131 semipreparative HPLC yielded epicatechin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate (50 mg). Structure was elucidated on the basis of NMR and MS data. The NMR assignment for the compound were in agreement with the literature [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in particular the strong shift of the H-6 and H-8 values suggest that the sulphate group is linked to the 7-OH. The overall phytochemical constituents of the bark extract are reported in
