 <sup>n</sup> data reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05537-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, several peaks were identified as epicatechin and procyanidins derivatives. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin and PAC-B2 presence was confirmed by standard comparison. Their amounts were 4.9 mg/g, 0.46 mg/g and 13.1 mg/g for epicatechin, epigallotcatechin and PAC-B2, respectively. Other identified compounds on the basis of fragmentation and literature comparison are reported in

 <sup>n</sup> fragmentation scheme ascribable to PAC-B are detected indicating the presence of dimeric and trimeric PAC-B. Poly-charged derivatives of PAC-B are also detected showing significant amounts of hexamers and heptamers. Small phenolic acids are also detected in particular protocatechuic, benzoic and gallic acid derivatives were identified and their total amount is 1.99 mg/g. The total amount of identified phenolics is 133.1 mg/g. Some other peaks were detected and four showed values of
