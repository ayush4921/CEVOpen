<p>A substantial variation was found among the extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, lengthened due to the variation in bioactive contents of the respective organs. The bark contain considerably more phenolic constituents and methanol were the most efficient extraction solvent in contrast to ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and water. Thus, it can be said that phenolic are not disseminate equally through the organs of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>. Additionally, compounds extracted from of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> might be polar in nature.
