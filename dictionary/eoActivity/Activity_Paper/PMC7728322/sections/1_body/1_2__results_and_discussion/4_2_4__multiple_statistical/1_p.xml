<p>In this work, unsupervised multivariate was also achieved in order to bring out pertinent information and so to improve interpretation of all results simultaneously, which are not always discernible in univariate analysis approach. In fact, the statistical processing of heterogeneous data using univariate statistic do not permit to display the clustering of samples with homogeneous special character. Therefore, principal component analysis (PCA) was firstly done to highlight the intrinsic similarities/dissimilarities between the samples based upon their pharmaceutical characteristics. PCA is a hugely popular well-established dimensionality reduction method that aims to find a low-dimensional subspace that synthesize, as much as possible, the total variation in the data.</p>
