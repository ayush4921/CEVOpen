<p>In this research work, the extracts of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> were screened for possible enzyme inhibitory effects against several non-communicable diseases including diabetes mellitus II (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), Alzheimer’s disease [acetyl- (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BChE)] and skin hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase). As presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05537-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the methanolic bark extract showing the highest anti-tyrosinase activity (152.79 ± 0.27 mg KAE/g) also showed the most potent anti-amylase (0.99 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g). Additionally, the three extracts, i.e., methanolic and water bark and methanolic fruit extracts were more active glucosidase inhibitor (2.16 ± 0.01; 2.14± and 2.14± mmol ACAE/g). However, no direct correlation was observed between the two cholinesterase enzymes. The ethyl acetate leaf extract showed the highest anti-AChE activity (5.13 ± 0.11 mg GALAE/g) but the same extract exhibited poor inhibition activity against BChE (2.25 ± 0.62 mg GALAE/g). In fact, the highest anti-BChE activity was recorded by the ethyl acetate fruit extracts.
