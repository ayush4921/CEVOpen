<p>On the other hand, despite several publications have suggested that flavonoids have strong inhibitory effects against amylase and glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], our data do not corroborate with this fact. The methanolic leaf extract possessing the highest level of flavonoids (34.49 Â± 0.18 mg RE/g) does not exhibit significant anti-amylase and anti-glucosidase activities. Instead, the methanolic bark extract yielding the highest level of flavanol showed potent antidiabetic activity. In fact, these results can be explained by the different classes of flavonoids present in the extracts. Indeed, it is reported that the number and configuration of hydroxyl groups play a crucial role in regulating the bioactivity of flavonoids [

Therefore, considering these aforementioned facts retrieved from literature, it can be said that the high anti-tyrosinase and antidiabetic activity exhibited by the methanolic bark extract may be associated to the abundant presence of both phenolic and flavanol content.
