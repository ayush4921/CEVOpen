<p>In conclusion, the methanolic bark extract of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> yielding the highest phenolic and flavanol contents demonstrated substantial in vitro antioxidant potential with all assays, except with metal chelating assay, whereby the ethyl acetate leaf extract was most active. The observed antioxidant activity might be caused by the synergistic action of bioactive compounds present in the extracts. The methanolic bark extract significantly depressed tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. LC-DAD-MS
 <sup>n</sup> analysis revealed the presence of numerous procyanidin derivatives in bark as well as catechins and gallotannins. All these compounds are well known for their antioxidant properties. Furthermore, breynin, spiroketal sulfur containing glycosides were detected in barks. Fruits and leaves mostly contained flavonoid glycosides and procyanidins and breynin were not detected in these latter two extracts. This research work has presented valuable primary data on 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, but need further investigations, such as in vivo studies, bioavailability and toxicity before projecting this plant for future nutraceutical/functional food and/or for possible pharmaceutical applications.
