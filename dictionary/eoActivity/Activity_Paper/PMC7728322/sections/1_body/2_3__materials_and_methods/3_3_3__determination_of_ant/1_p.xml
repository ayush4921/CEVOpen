<p>To detect antioxidant properties, we used several chemical assays with different mechanisms namely, radical scavenging, reducing power and metal chelating. Trolox (TE) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were used as standard antioxidant compounds. Obtained results were expressed as equivalents of these compounds [

To detect inhibitory effects on enzymes, we used colorimetric enzyme inhibition assays and these assays included tyrosinase, α-glucosidase, α-amylase and cholinesterases. Some standard inhibitors (galantamine, kojic acid and acarbose) were used as positive controls.
