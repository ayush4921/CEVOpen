<p>Maceration was used for sample preparation with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol as extraction solvents. For this purpose, 5 g of the samples were macerated for 24 h at room temperature. After this, the mixtures were filtered and then the solvents were removed via a rotary-evaporator. With respect to the water extracts, 5 g of the plant material were infused with 100 mL boiled water. Thereafter, the water was dried using freeze-drying. All extracts were stored at +4 Â°C until further studies.</p>
