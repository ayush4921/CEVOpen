<p>Dried extracts were exactly weighted—15 mg—and dissolved in 1.5 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 20 min. The extracts were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and used for analysis. Extract was analyzed using Electrospray (ESI) source. The instrumentation was Agilent 1260 chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with 1260 diode array detector (DAD) and Varian MS-500 ion trap mass spectrometer (Varian inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with ESI source (Varian inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA). At the end of the column, two “T” splitters separated the flow rate: half of the liquid was split to DAD and half to Agilent/Varian MS-500 ion trap mass spectrometer. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra (Varian inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) were acquired in the range of 190–400 nm.</p>
