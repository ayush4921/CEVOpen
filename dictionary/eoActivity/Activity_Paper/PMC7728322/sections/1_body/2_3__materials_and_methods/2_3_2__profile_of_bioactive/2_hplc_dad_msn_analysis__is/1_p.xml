<p>The dried extracts (50 mg) were dissolved in deuterated chloroform (700 microliters) using ultrasound bath for 5 min, then the sample was centrifuged and transferred to NMR tube for measurement. The residue non dissolved was dried under vacuum, then was treated with deuterated methanol, sonicated for 5 min centrifuged and transferred to tube for NMR measurement. Other amount of extract (50 mg) was dispersed in deuterated water sonicated for 5 min, centrifuged and used for the NMR analysis. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III 400 Ultra shielded spectrometer with superconducting 400 MHz magnet system (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). NMR spectra was acquired in deuterated chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Durian
 <sup>®</sup> 4.95 mm NMR tubes (Duran Group, Mainz, Germany) were utilized. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ values.
