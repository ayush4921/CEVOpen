<p>The MS spectra were acquired in negative ion mode in 50–2000 Da range, using an ESI source, drying gas temperature was initially 350 °C and in 20 min decrease to 300, drying gas pressure was 35 psi, nebulizer was 35 psi, needle was set at 4500 V, RF 85% and capillary 80 V. Varian MS 500 mass spectrometer was used, using ESI as ion source in order to identify proanthocyanidins and spiroketal glycosides on the base of MSn spectra. Quantification of compounds was obtained using DAD. Catechin was used for the quantification of proanthocyanidins using solutions (range 180–1 µg/mL) at 280 nm and calibration curve was Y = 31.62X +1.021 (R2 = 0.9993).</p>
