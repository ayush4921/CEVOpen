 <italic>Marchantia</italic> sp. are a good source of bioactive metabolites, and a number of compounds were isolated from different 
 <italic>Marchantia</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Marchantiaceae is known to contain a large amount of marchantin-type cyclic bisbibenzyls, which contain different types of biological activities, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, anticancer, calmodulin inhibitory, and cardiotonic activities [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. 
 <italic>Fissidens</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Plagiochila</italic> sp. are also good sources of secondary metabolites. 
 <italic>Plagiochila barteri</italic> and 
 <italic>Plagiochila terebrans</italic> are known to produce cyclic bisbibenzyls, ent-spathulenol, 1(10),14-halimadien-13
 <italic>ξ</italic>-ol, trifarienol B (11), and marchantins C and H, with antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there are no scientific evidences for isolation and biological screening of bioactive metabolites from 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>demissum</italic> and
