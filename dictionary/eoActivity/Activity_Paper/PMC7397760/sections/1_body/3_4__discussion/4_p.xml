<p>Except 2 extracts, the other tested EtOAc extracts did not show potent inhibitory activity for alpha-amylase. The most promising inhibitory activity was shown by the EtOAc extract of 
 <italic>Fissidens</italic> sp.; therefore, this is a valuable finding, and the extract can be used to isolate respective active metabolites since isolation of antialpha-amylase compounds from lower plants is very rare. Furthermore, alpha-amylase inhibitory activity represents 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic activity. Hence, these active extracts are useful to regulate blood glucose levels and act as postprandial glucose regulators. There are only few studies on alpha-amylase inhibitory activity of bryophytes, and this study is one of them.
