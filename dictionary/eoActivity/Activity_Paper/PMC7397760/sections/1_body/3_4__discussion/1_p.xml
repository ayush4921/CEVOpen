<p>Only a handful of studies have been carried out to investigate the bioactive potential of lower plants including bryophytes [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since Sri Lanka is an isolated island with remarkable biodiversity among its flora, the density and the number of bryophyte species are very high. In this study, commonly available six bryophyte species were collected and authenticated as

 <italic>demissum</italic>,

 <italic>cupressiforme</italic>, and

 <italic>Marchantia</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Plagiochila</italic> sp.), and the rest of bryophytes are mosses.
