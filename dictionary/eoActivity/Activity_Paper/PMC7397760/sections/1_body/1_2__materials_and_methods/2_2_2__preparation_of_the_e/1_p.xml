<p>Air-dried and pulverized plant materials were subjected to serial extraction with sonication using hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol, respectively. The resulting extracts were filtered, and the filtrates were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using rotary evaporation (model: RV 10 B, made by IKA, German) at 40°C. The resulted crude extracts were transferred into preweighted glass vials. The dry samples were stored at 4°C until further use.</p>
