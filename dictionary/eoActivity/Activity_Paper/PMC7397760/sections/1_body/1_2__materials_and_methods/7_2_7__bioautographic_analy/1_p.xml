<p>The extracts which showed promising antimicrobial activities were subjected to analysis using bioautographic techniques in order to identify respective antimicrobial active bands. 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> was used as the testing microbe since most of the extracts showed highest activity against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>. As an exception, in this assay, the cell suspension was diluted to make the final OD (0.0001) by using melted MHA in 0.6%. The TLC plate was then overlaid with the diluted cell suspension of the test microorganism suspended in 0.6% MHA. Agar was allowed to solidify at room temperature and incubated at 37°C for 16–24 h. After the incubation period, in order to identify active bands, the TLC plate with MHA was flooded with a solution of MTT, 2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (in sterile distilled water), and was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C.
