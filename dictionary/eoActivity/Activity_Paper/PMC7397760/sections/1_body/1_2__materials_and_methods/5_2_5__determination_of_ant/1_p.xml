<p>The resulting crude bryophyte extracts were tested, in triplicate, for activity against three pathogenic bacteria, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (UBC 344), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027) and one pathogenic fungi, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 90028), at 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/disc concentrations using the standard agar disc-diffusion assay described by the American Clinical Laboratory Standard handbook with few modifications. In brief, cell suspensions of the test microorganisms equal to 0.5 McFarland were prepared using a 24 hrs old culture. A volume of 5 mL of each cell suspension was dispensed onto the surface of dried Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA powder (Hardy, USA), 38.0 g in 1,000 mL of distilled water) dishes, distributed all over the surface, and the excess suspension was removed (positive control: gentamicin (20 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/disc); negative control: methanol). After overnight incubation, the mean diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. Samples were dissolved in MeOH to make the final concentration 50 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> accordingly. Then, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample was delivered onto the sterile blank disc (WhatmanTM grade AA filter paper discs of 6 mm) to make the final concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g per disc. As the negative control, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MeOH was delivered onto a sterile blank disc. Gentamicin (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/disc) was used as the positive control for bacteria, while 1 : 1 mixture of ketoconazole and itraconazole (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/disc from each) was used for pathogenic fungus. The growth inhibitions were visually examined by comparing with the positive control [
