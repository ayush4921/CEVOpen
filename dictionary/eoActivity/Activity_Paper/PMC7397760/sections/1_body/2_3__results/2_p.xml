<p>In total, 18 extracts (hexane, EtOAc, and MeOH extracts of six bryophytes) were screened for their antimicrobial potential. The antimicrobial activities of crude extracts are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and positive results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Out of the 18 extracts, 10 extracts did not show any activity against the tested microorganisms. Most promising activities were shown against tested Gram-positive bacteria. Only the hexane extract of 
 <italic>Fissidens</italic> sp. (FS-Hex) showed the activity against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Only hexane extracts of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>demissum</italic> (SD-Hex) and 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>cupressiforme</italic> (HC-Hex) showed antifungal activity. None of the
