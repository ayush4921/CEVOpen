<p>The contribution of natural products to the current pharmacopeia is significant while they have provided noticeable leads to novel drug discoveries [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The exact number of drugs which are derived from natural products is doubtful. However, reliable estimates reveal that the amount of natural product contribution to the current drug market is not less than 50%. In the case of anticancer and anti-infective agents, the proportion is even higher, and estimate is that almost two-thirds of such agents are derived from natural products [
