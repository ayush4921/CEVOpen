<p>Bryophytes are placed taxonomically between algae and pteridophytes and are divided into three classes: mosses, liverworts, and hornworts [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Bryophytes are rarely used for herbal medications as medicinal plants. Therefore, the number of research studies carried out based on bryophytes is still low. However, hundreds of novel natural products have been isolated from bryophytes including polysaccharides, lipids, rare amino acids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, quinones, and many other specialized metabolites [
