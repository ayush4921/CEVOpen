<p>The results of this study show that the Sri Lankan bryophytes are capable of producing antimicrobial metabolites, active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and antialpha-amylase activity and thus are potential sources for the discovery of new bioactive substances that may prove to be clinically useful. This is the first record of investigating bioactive potential of Sri Lankan bryophytes. Therefore, further studies on lower plants including bryophytes bring out their hidden biosynthetic capabilities, along with wider bioactivity testing which can be expected to immensely enhance the value of this valuable and underutilized resource.</p>
