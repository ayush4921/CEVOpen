<p>Plant derived natural compounds are used throughout the world for medicinal purposes. Plant derived salicylates target many human proteins and can play prominent roles in human disease treatment. Initially, researchers focused on acetyl salicylate (aspirin) and showed that it can be a good target for drug development for many human diseases. Recent findings suggest that many natural salicylates have pharmacological roles. Our focused salicylates amorfrutins, ginkgolic acid, grifolic acid, THCA, and CBDA target different human proteins and pathways. It appears clear that these natural salicylates may be promising natural compounds in treating different human diseases. Some medicinal plants and natural products showed relevant results in clinical trials [

Our review suggests that further clinical trials with different salicylates on different human diseases will be needed based on many preclinical results with amorfrutins (antidiabetic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities), ginkgolic acid (anticancer, neuroprotective, and antiviral activities), grifolic acid (antitumor activity), THCA (immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antineoplastic activities), and CBDA (anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic, and anticonvulsant activities).
