<p>Grifolic acid treatment reduced cell viability on GH3 cells, the rat anterior pituitary adenoma cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (from 2.5 μM to 20 μM) and resulted in total cell death after 6h treatment with 20 μM. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) production was significantly decreased by grifolic acid (20 μM) 5 min after incubation and caused the maximal effect in 20 min. Grifolic acid also significantly decreased the cellular ATP level in GH3 cells. Without G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) activity, grifolic acid reduced GH3 adenoma cell viability by blocking NADH production in mitochondria, thereby decreasing MMP and ATP production [

Grifolic acid treatment reduced cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner on four osteosarcoma cell lines U-2 OS, MG-63, Saos-2, and 143B. Total cell death occurred 6 h after treatment with 30 μM grifolic acid. In the animal model, intratumoral injection of grifolic acid increased necrosis of human osteosarcoma xenograft in nude mice without any observable toxicity [
