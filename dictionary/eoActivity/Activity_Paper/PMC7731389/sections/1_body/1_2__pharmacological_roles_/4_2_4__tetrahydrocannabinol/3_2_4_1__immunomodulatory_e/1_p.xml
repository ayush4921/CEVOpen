<p>The cannabinoid receptor CB1 and CB2 are involved in immunomodulating actions of cannabinoids [

 <xref rid="B105-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Other studies suggest that metabolic pathways and noncannabinoid receptors are involved with immunomodulatory effect of cannabinoids [

 <xref rid="B108-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Importantly, agonists of cannabinoid receptor have a psychotropic effect [
 <xref rid="B107-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Therefore, there is an effort to identify the compounds which have therapeutic effects but that are not able to activate CB1 and CB2 to avoid the psychotropic effect. THCA showed their immunomodulatory effect through a different metabolic pathway, without activating CB1 and CB2 [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. THCA targeted phosphatidyl choline specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) enzymatic activity in phospholipids metabolism and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated U937 macrophages and peripheral blood macrophages in a dose-dependent manner with the EC
