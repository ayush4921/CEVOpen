<p>Today, cancer is a global concern, because of its leading position of causing death with about 8.8 million deaths and 18 million new cases per year [

A recent study on amorfrutin C shows that it acts as an anticancer agent by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of different cancer cell lines, including human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29 and T84), prostate cancer (PC-3), and breast cancer (MCF7) cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8 to 16 μM in these cancer cell lines) through targeting mitochondria. Treatment of HT-29 cells with amorfrutin C induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Synergistic apoptosis induction of amorfrutin C with alpha Fas receptor ligand (
 <italic>α</italic>FAS) and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in HT-29 cells suggest the stimulation of death receptor signaling pathway [
