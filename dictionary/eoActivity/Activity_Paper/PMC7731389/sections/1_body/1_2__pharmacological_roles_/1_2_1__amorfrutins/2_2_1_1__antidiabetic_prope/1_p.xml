<p>Type-2 diabetes is a worldwide increasing metabolic disease. For its prevention and treatment, new strategies are needed to develop. The gene expression of metabolism, inflammation, and other pathways in adipocytes is mainly regulated by the nuclear receptor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) [

 <italic>G. foetida</italic> and from the fruit of another legume 
 <italic>A. fruticosa</italic> which is used as an ingredient in some condiments. In a competitive time-resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay, the four amorfrutins showed the distinct Ki values selectivity for PPARγ subtypes (range from 236 to 354 nM), compared to other PPAR subtypes. Amorfrutins can regulate PPARγ gene expression selectively in adipocytes. Evaluation of in vivo effects in Type 2 diabetes mouse model suggested that amorfrutins act as antidiabetic agent [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These experiments together suggest that selective PPARγ-activation by dietary amorfrutins can develop a promising approach to fight against type-2 diabetes.
