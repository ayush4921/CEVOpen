<p>Although amorfrutin’s target PPARγ is the key regulator in metabolic regulation, it can inhibit inflammatory gene expression by a different mechanism including (i) direct interaction with transcription factor NF-κB, (ii) regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by reducing p38 activation [

So, for the treatment of inflammatory disease, many clinical studies have been developed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of PPARγ ligands. Amorfrutin A treatment in TNF-α- stimulated colon cells resulted in lower expression of various proinflammatory genes such as

 <italic>IL-8</italic>, and 
 <italic>MIP-3α</italic> suggesting that amorfrutins may have a beneficial effect for inflammatory disease, such as ulcerative colitis, via targeting PPARγ [
