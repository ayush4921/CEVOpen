<p>HIV-1 protease plays an important role in the HIV viral life cycle as it breaks down the newly synthesized polyproteins to create the mature proteins of an HIV virion. Thus, HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are very effective antiviral drugs that can reduce the morbidity and mortality of AIDS patients, thus significantly prolong their life [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. GA inhibited HIV protease activity in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of fewer than 30 μg/mL in the cell-free system and inhibited HIV-1SF162 infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a concentration-dependent manner (50 and 100 μg/mL) [

GA showed an inhibitory effect on the fusion of a variety of enveloped viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human immune deficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV), and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and also inhibited a nonenveloped human adenovirus. In the case of postinfection, GA inhibited HSV-1 and CMV replication targeting protein and DNA synthesis by a secondary mechanism [
