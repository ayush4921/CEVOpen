<p>GA inhibited the proliferation of human Hep-2 cancer cells with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20 µM [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and induced cell death in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells via inducing apoptosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein located in the outer membrane of mitochondria and plays its role by inhibiting cytochrome release and also caspase-3 activity; on the other hand, the proapototic protein Bax helps to release cytochrome and stimulates caspase-mediated cell death. So, lowering the Bcl-2/Bax ratio can be a good target for anticancer drug development [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Human Hep-2 cells and Tac8113 cells (human tongue squamous carcinoma cell line) treated by GA showed that reduced the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and enhanced caspase-3 activity. GA also inhibited the growth of Tac8113 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 40 µM [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) involves in the development of hematological malignancies in multiple myeloma. Phosphorylation of STAT3 stimulates different cancer related proteins, such as Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 (tumorigenesis), Cyclin D1 (proliferation), MMP-9 (invasion), and VEGF (angiogenesis) [

 <xref rid="B91-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Different tyrosine kinase called janus-like kinase (JAK), including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 positively regulates the STAT3 pathway [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]; on the other hand, different protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), including PTEN and SHP-1, negatively regulate STAT3 activation [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Thus, recent studies have been focused on the suppression of STAT3 activity for cancer treatment. Ginkgolic acid C (GAC) 17:1 suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in multiple myeloma U266 cells and significantly reduced cell proliferation in both U266 and MM.1S cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. GAC 17:1 upregulated the expression of PTEN and SHP-1 in protein and mRNA level, whereas it down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, COX-2, cyclin D1, VEGF, MMP-9, and MMP-2, in multiple myeloma cells [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In SW480 colon cancer cells, GA treatment inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion by stimulating adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and decreasing the expression of invasion-associated proteins such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), and urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA) [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In lung cancer cells, GA treatment ameliorated migration and invasion by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. GA reduced the viability of pancreatic cancer cells Panc-1 and BxPC-3. Both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that GA prevented the de novo lipogenesis of pancreatic cancer cells by inducing the activation of AMPK signaling pathway and suppressed several key enzymes (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FASN]) expression involved in lipogenesis [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells, GA treatment showed antimigratory effects and inhibited the sumoylation of NEMO leading to inhibition of IκBα degradation. Consequently, reduced activity of NF-κB leads to the downregulation of NF-κB target genes, uPA, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), CXCR4, and MMP-9 [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. GA inhibited the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines 786-O and A498 by inactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway with the downregulation of p-Akt and p-Erk expression. Thus, GA targets different signaling pathways, including STAT3 pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and EGFR signaling pathway and causes downregulation of their associated proteins [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1)-derived prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) and leukotrienes (LTs) are both crucial mediators in the development of inflammation-associated cancer. GA inhibited the activity of mPGES-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.7 µM) and 5-lipoxygenase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.2 µM), the key enzyme in LT biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-09049" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. So, GA can be an efficient target for developing cancer treatment.
