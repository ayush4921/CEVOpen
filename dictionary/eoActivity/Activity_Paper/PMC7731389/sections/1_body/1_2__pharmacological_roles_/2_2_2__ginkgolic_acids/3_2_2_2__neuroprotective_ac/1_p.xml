<p>The aberrant SUMOylation process has been involved in neurodegenerative diseases [

Neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified by the continuous loss of neurons, deposition of insoluble aggregates of two proteins in the brain, amyloid-β (Aβ) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Synaptic impairment occurs in this disease affecting the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex brain areas thus, hampered cognitive process and memory formation [

GA enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, restored Aβ-mediated paired-pulse ratio (PPR) alteration, and rescued Aβ-mediated change in excitatory neurotransmission. The neuroprotective role of GA against Aβ-induced synaptic deterioration representing an effective approach to AD treatment [
