<p>Cervical cancer is the most malignant cancer in the women ranking second globally and it affects the women aged from 35 to 60 years [

Apart from HPV infections still there are many other factors, such as history of genital warts, AIDS patients, tobacco smoking, and multiple sexual partners, which play their role in inducing the cervical cancer and lesions [

The treatment for cervical cancer begins with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy; these therapies remains to be the major strategies in treating not only cervical cancer but also other types of cancer. The chemotherapy has certain extent in saving many lives but still this therapy produces some immunological ill effects in the patients [

The chemotherapy includes the chemical or artificial medicinal agents which alters and damages the DNA in the tumor cells which reduces the ill-effect of cancer. These side effects could be reduced or prevented by the implementation of natural cancer therapeutic agents. The natural bioactive agents or products can be extracted from plants, algal, and microbial sources. The Indian traditional medicinal system has several medicines which can treat various types of diseases and disorders using medicinal plants and trees. However, it is not possible to cut down or damage the plants/trees for retrieving the medicines, as for treating a single patient it is necessary to take at least 1 kg of the plant sources. So the current research has aimed to isolate an endophytic fungi residing in the medicinal tree that could possess the metabolic nature of the host tree and aids in the production of the expected bioactive cancer therapeutic agent from a microbe which could be produced maximum quantity in a minimum culture area.
