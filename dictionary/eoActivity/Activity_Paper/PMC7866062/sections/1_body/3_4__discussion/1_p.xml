The highest causative reason is oxidative stress, and this has to be managed properly otherwise the excessive production of ROS in the cell alters the gene expression and transcriptional factors leading to highest rate of cell progression. This is mainly caused by the poor presence of antioxidants in the cell and increased rate of ROS in the aerobic cells [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ROS are mainly formed during the oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria where the molecular oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) changes into singlet O
 <sub>2</sub> or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and this is initiated by the several processes such as UV or radiation exposures, chemical and mechanical stresses, inflammatory reactions and repeated microbial infections [

The increased progression of ROS or oxidative stress in the cervical tissues further alters the properties of DNA and progresses as cervical neoplasia, cervical tumor, and cervical cancer. The reduction of ROS and prevention of ROS can be easily succeeded with the aid of polyphenols and flavonoids which are effective antioxidants. Currently, several research focused to extract the polyphenols and flavonoids from endophytic fungi and the metabolites were explored as anti-cancer metabolites in medicinal fields [
