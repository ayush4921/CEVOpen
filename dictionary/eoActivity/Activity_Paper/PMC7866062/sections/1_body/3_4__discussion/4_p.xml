<p>Inflammation is the major problem in the tumor progression because the long-term inflammation in a site of the body could eventually leads to the formation of cancer. Balkwill and Mantovani [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] found out there was a correlation between the inflammation and cancer, and this condition is a predisposition of cancer. The inflammation may be due to prolonged infections by the microbial invasions and if the infection were untreated in the specific cervical tissues that could eventually leads to the neoplasia or cervical carcinoma. Moreover, the inflammation promotes the malignant tumor growth or progression in the surrounding tissues of the inflammation area and this inflammation is a chronic and unregulated process [

The alteration in the gene expression in the inflammation surrounding cells/tissues is induced by the production of ROS or nitrogen species in the inflammation site. As a result of the alteration in the genetic factors, the inflammation plays a crucial role in initiation of tumor, malignancy and metastatic processes [

The DoE reduced the inflammation within few hours and this explicit the DoE has the capability in decreasing vascular permeability and cellular infiltration where the accumulation of leukocytes, proteins and fluids are minimized by the respective DoE dosage levels. The given DoE has the capacity in clearing out the debris and scavenges the ROS and/or free radicals in the injured or inflamed site which prevents the damages or alteration in the DNA of the cells [
