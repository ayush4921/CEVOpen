<p>The animals were anaesthetized following the treatment period of 7 days, using ketamine hydrochloride and the blood was fetched from the animal’s retro-orbital sinus (three animals from each group). The collected blood was dispensed into the respective centrifuge tube containing an anti-coagulant-EDTA and further used hematological experiments. The hematological parameters like hemoglobin, Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood cells (WBC), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), differential cell count, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) count were determined [
