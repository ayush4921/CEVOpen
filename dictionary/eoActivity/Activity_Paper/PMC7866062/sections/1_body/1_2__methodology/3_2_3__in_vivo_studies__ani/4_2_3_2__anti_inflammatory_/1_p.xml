<p>Female Wister albino rats weighed around 150 to 175 g were used for this study. The animals were segregated into five groups with six animals in each. The dosages received by the experimental groups were Group-I (Control-Without any sample and/ or negative control), Group-II (Negative control—0.1 mL of 1% carrageenan alone), Group-III (Standard—Indomethacin (20 mg/kg) + 0.1 mL of 1% carrageenan), Group-IV (DoE (125 mg/kg) + (0.1 mL of 1% carrageenan), Group V (DoE (300 mg/kg) + (0.1 mL of 1% carrageenan]. The carrageenan administered as 1%

The paw was stained with temporary ink at the intensity of sideways ankle bone (malleolus) and drenched in mercury up to the mark. The paw volume was measured using Digital Plethysmometer at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after carrageenan injection. The differentiation between initial and succeeding reading provides the approximate edema volume.
