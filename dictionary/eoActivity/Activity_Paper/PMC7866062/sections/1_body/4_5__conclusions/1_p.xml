<p>In summary, the results obtained in the present study indicated that the metabolite DoE purified from the CPME of 
 <italic>C. australiensis</italic> explored that their potentiality at the minimum concentration. The DoE exhibited its therapeutic properties on cervical cancer cells in minimum dosage; further the carrageenan-induced inflammation on animal models were significantly reduced by the implication of the DoE. This proved that the DoE explicated its therapeutic index towards the treatment of cervical cancer in animal models. Thus, the application of DoE in the cancer therapeutics will reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and aims in curing the cancer. Future research is needed to determine the role of DoE on other tumor cells and the molecular mechanisms against anticancer studies for further development of natural anticancer substances.
