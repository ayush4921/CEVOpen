<p>Similarly, the biochemical parameters were evaluated for the control, survival, and lethal group (Group I, V, and IV) and results were depicted in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00654-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The biochemical such as AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, and total proteins were found to be rising significant in an order for survival and lethal group when compared to control group. This implicit that the compound DoE is an effective drug which does not alter the biochemical and hematological parameters in the limited dosage.
