<p>Acute toxicity is the adverse change(s) which occurs instantly or during a short time within 24 h of administration following a single or short period of exposure to the metabolite. The adverse effect may be any type of effect resulting in functional impairment and/or biochemical lesions which affects the normal activity of the whole organism or specifically disabling a single/multiple organ(s). For this study, the various dosage levels (2 g (Gp II), 1.75 g (Gp III), 1.5 g (Gp IV), 1.25 g (Gp V), 1 g (Gp VI), 0.75 g (Gp VII), 0.5 g (Gp VIII), 0.35 g (Gp IX), 0.25 g (Gp X), and 0.1 g (Gp XI) per Kg of mice, based on the OECD 423 guidelines) were fixed to determine the toxicity of the purified compound DoE in mice models (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00654">Supplementary Table S1aâ€“j</xref>) and the control group animals were fixed in group I. Through this analysis the effective dosage for the survival of the animal was 1.25 g/kg (Gp V) and the lethal dosage was 1.5 g/kg (Gp IV). Above 1.5 g/kg of the DoE produced hyper sensitivity, righting reflex, tremors and convulsions leading to the death of the animal.
