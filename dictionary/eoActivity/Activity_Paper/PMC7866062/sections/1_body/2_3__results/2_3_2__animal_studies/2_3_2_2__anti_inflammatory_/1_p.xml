<p>From the earlier evaluation, the DoE was confirmed to be a potent free radical scavenger, as it has the capacity to reduce the inflammatory response of inflammation/ induced paw edema and this was assessed through carrageenan induced anti-inflammatory Wistar rat models. The investigation results revealed that the DoE is an effective metabolite in reducing the inflammation induced by carrageenan (

The animals developed the maximum inflammatory response at 3 h of induction and after 3 h, the inflammation started to reduce gradually. The percentage of inhibition was found to be 41.09% (300 mg/kg) which was found to be twice than the standard drug indomethacin (20.17%) used. This proved the DoE was an efficient anti-inflammatory drug.
