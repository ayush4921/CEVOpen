<p>The hematological parameters were evaluated for the survival and lethal dosage grouped animals compared with control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00654-f002">Figure 2</xref>Aâ€“D). The RBC count was similar to the control group whereas the count was low in lethal group. The WBC count was highest in lethal group than control group, this is because the lethality has been identified by the immune system and thereby the cells arrives for defensive mechanism in order to eliminate the excessive toxicity out the body. The granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes) count of the blood sample was similar in both survival and control groups but there was a slight variation in the lethal group and this indicated the severity of overdose to the body weight. The hemoglobin, MCH and MCHC count were observed to be decreased in the lethal grouped animals when compared to survival and control grouped animals. The MCV and MPV were found to be similar in both control and group V animals but the volume was higher in lethal group. The packed cell volume (PCV) was higher than in group V and control group animals. This conclude that the DoE dose above 1.25 g/kg affects the blood cells and the total corpuscular volume.
