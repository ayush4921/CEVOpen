<p>The CAM assay is a perceptive, easily feasible, and economy in vivo check for enquiries of the anti-angiogenic promise of individual compounds. The compound DoE exhibited a promising anti-angiogenesis by the inhibition of angiogenesis at an interval of 2 h and 18 h and the inhibition percentage was 72.08% and 91.62, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The solvent acetone explored its potentiality by inhibiting 18.8% and 27.27% for 2 h and 18 h, respectively. This evinced that the DoE has the good anti-angiogenic potentiality which could be explored as anticancer agents.
