<p>Binding position on M
 <sup>pro</sup> was evaluated and compared based on the native ligand. The result showed that four active compounds have different affinities to the receptor, but they bound specifically on the binding site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is suggested that the ligand inhibited the activity of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. These data were also supported by molecular interaction analysis which revealed the specific interaction between ligands and M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.) Interaction between active compounds and its receptor are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction. Four lead compound candidates showed the best poses with M
 <sup>pro</sup> and spike protein, namely, hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, and epigallocatechin gallate. The binding site on spike protein was also evaluated in detail (
