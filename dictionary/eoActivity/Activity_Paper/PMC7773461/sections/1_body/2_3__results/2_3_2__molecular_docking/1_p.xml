<p>The estimation of free energy of binding between potential inhibitors and receptors was performed using a docking experiment. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table"> Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show the docking analysis results between the selected compounds with M
 <sup>pro</sup> (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and S protein. The docking results showed that some compounds from plants with better binding positions with S protein than nelfinavir were hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin. Other compounds tended to be better positioned compared to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, except for 6-shogaol. Binding poses to M
 <sup>pro</sup> that were better or equivalent to nelfinavir were hesperidin, rhoifolin, and pectolinarin. Some compounds showed better binding poses than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on M
 <sup>pro</sup>.
