<p>Validation was carried out by redocking the native ligand on the target protein, where the native ligand was first separated from the receptor using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020. In this case, the receptor M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 6LU7) was docked to cocrystallized native ligand inhibitor N3 N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl) carbonyl] alanyl-L-valyl-N∼1∼-((1R, 2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl} but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The docking results will show the compound with the lowest bond energy when it binds to the target protein, to obtain the RMSD (root-mean-square distance) value of the docking compound. The method is said to be valid if the RMSD value obtained is ≤2 Å, so that docking of the test compound can be carried out with the target protein in the same grid box area [
