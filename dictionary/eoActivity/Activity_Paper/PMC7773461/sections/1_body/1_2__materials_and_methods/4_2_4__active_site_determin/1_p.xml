<p>The amino acids' location as active sites in the receptor region where the ligand was docked was determined using Autodock Tools. For this reason, a three-dimensional map of the grid box was made in the receptor region. The determination of this map was based on the type of docking used. A three-dimensional map was made as wide as the size of the receptor (spike glycoprotein) itself so that the ligand was likely to be docked to all parts of the receptor (blind docking). In M
 <sup>pro</sup>/3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> docking, the three-dimensional map was of only the area's size to be docked (targeted docking).
