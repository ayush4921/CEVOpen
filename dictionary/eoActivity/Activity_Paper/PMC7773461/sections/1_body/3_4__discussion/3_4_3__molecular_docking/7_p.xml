<p>The more the hydrogen bonds formed with the amino acid residue, the stronger the bonds. This causes the energy score to be lower, and the bonds will be more stable. Hydrogen bonds are interactions between hydrogen atoms (H), which are covalently bonded with atoms such as fluorine (F), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In this study, each best ligand selected has a different number of hydrogen bonds and is located on a different amino acid residue. Hesperidin has four hydrogen bonds with M
 <sup>pro</sup> at the amino acid residues Phe-A: 140, Glu-A: 166, Cys-A: 145, and Ser-A: 144. Nabiximol has three hydrogen bonds with Mpro, which resides at residues Thr-A: 190, Met-A: 165, and Asn-A: 142. Furthermore, the pectolinarin is hydrogen bonded with M
 <sup>pro</sup> at the amino acid residues Glu-A: 166, His-A: 163, Cys-A: 145, and Ser-A: 144. Meanwhile, epigallocatechin gallate has three hydrogen bonds with M
 <sup>pro</sup> in the residues Thr-A: 190, Met-A: 165, and Asn-A: 142.
