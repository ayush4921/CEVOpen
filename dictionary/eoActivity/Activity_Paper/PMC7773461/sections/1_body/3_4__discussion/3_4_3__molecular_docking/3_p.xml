<p>This study, which aimed at predicting the inhibition ability of compounds found in some plants against M
 <sup>pro</sup> and S proteins, has revealed several results, showing that these compounds have a better docking pose than nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). If the results are juxtaposed, the potential candidates to become drugs targeting S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> were hesperidin, nabiximols, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, morin, epigallocatechin gallate, and herbacetin.
