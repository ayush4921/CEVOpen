<p>Dozens of proteins are coded by a coronavirus, some of which are involved in viral replication and entry into cells. Main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>/3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) is a crucial enzyme for coronavirus replication [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and surface Spike (S) glycoprotein (S protein) is an essential binding protein for the fusion of the virus and cellular membrane via cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. SARS-Cov-2 is easily transmitted because the S protein on the virus's surface binds very efficiently to ACE2 on the human cells' surface. Therefore, M
 <sup>pro</sup> and S protein are ideal targets for drug design and development.
