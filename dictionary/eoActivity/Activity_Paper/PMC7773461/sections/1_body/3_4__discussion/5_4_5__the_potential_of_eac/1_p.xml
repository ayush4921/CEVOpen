 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. This table also contains information on the oral bioavailability of the compounds used as ligands in this analysis. However, only few compounds have high bioavailability when administered orally based on studies that have been conducted by several other researchers, i.e., pectolinarin, kaempferol, herbacetin, eugenol, and 6-shogaol. Of these, only pectolinarin does not meet Ro5. The low oral bioavailability has become a common problem in drug design, since it may pose failure to a new drug in clinical trials, even though the compounds have high efficacy in the in vitro and/or in vivo tests [

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Therefore, a compound's oral bioavailability is essential to be taken into account when predicting the compound as a drug candidate. The oral availability of some compounds can be low if administered together with food. However, the oral availability of a compound can also be improved by various strategies [
