<p>Herbacetin, which can be found in 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> sp. (golden root), has antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and a prototype of negative-strand RNA virus such as rabies and influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The best binding pose of this compound against SARS-3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was −9.263, as reported by Jo et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], while in this study, the binding score of −8.3 against S protein and −7.2 against M
 <sup>pro</sup> were obtained. They also stated that herbacetin might act as a MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor. Herbacetin is a very potential candidate as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 because it meets Ro5 and has also been reported to have good oral bioavailability. Besides, this compound also has anti-inflammatory activity [
