<p>From the abovementioned quantum chemical calculations, it can be seen that pectolinarin is configurationally more stable than other compounds with maximum dipole moment, suggesting better binding affinity. The FMOs analysis indicated that both HOMO and LUMO are bonding orbitals and comprise the aporphine portion for each structure; however, pectolinarin has a bandgap smaller than that calculated for the other molecules, indicating that this molecule is more reactive. The electrophilicity index above 1.5 for all structure reveals that the compounds have a significative attractive electron power, and the small hardness (

The predicted MEPS figure revealed that the selected compounds' positive and negative regions were subjected to the nucleophilic and electrophilic attack of those compounds.
