<p>The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) characterize the electron-donating ability of a molecule, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) determine the ability to accept an electron also known as frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), which are essential to determine the way the molecule interacts with other species, electric and optical properties, kinetic stability, molecular reactivity, and chemical reactivity descriptors, as softness and hardness [

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The bandgap between the HOMO and LUMO is very important in determining the chemical reactivity of the molecule. In terms of chemical hardness, the obtained HOMO-LUMO bandgap can give valuable information, where a large energy gap indicates hard and more stable molecules and a small energy gap indicates a soft and more reactive molecule. Among the five selected compounds, pectolinarin shows the lowest bandgap, suggesting that it is more reactive than other compounds. The chemical reactivity order of the three selected compounds was pectolinarin &gt; hesperidin &gt; rhoifolin &gt; morin &gt; epigallocatechin gallate.
