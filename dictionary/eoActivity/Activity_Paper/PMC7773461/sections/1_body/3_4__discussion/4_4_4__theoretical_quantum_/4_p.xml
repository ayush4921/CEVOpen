<p>Hesperidin has the lowest ionization potential value (IA = 5.369 eV), which indicates that it is the best electron donor. The calculated hardness values (
 <italic>η</italic>) for hesperidin (1.86 eV), pectolinarin (1.81 eV), epigallocatechin gallate (2.10 eV), rhoifolin (2.02 eV), and morin (2.03 eV) show that pectolinarin is the softer and more reactive one and epigallocatechin gallate is the harder and less reactive molecule, confirming the evidence obtained by the calculation of the bandgap. Comparing these hardness values with those calculated for other known alkaloids, such as liriodenine (
 <italic>η</italic> = 1.81) [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], annomontine (
 <italic>η</italic> = 1.94), and N-hidroxyannomontine (
 <italic>η</italic> = 1.69) [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], pectolinarin and hesperidin present values that classify them as soft molecules. The chemical potential 
 <italic>µ</italic> (eV) measures the escaping tendency of an electron, and it can be associated with the molecular electronegativity [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]; then, as 
 <italic>µ</italic> becomes more negative, it is more difficult to lose an electron but easier to gain one.
