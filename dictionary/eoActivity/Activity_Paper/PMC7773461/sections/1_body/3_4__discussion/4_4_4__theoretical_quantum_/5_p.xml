<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, rhoifolin is the least stable among all isolated compounds. Electronegativity (
 <italic>χ</italic>) represents the ability of molecules to attract electrons. The (
 <italic>χ</italic>) values displayed in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show that rhoifolin has higher electronegativity (4.190 eV) value than other isolated compounds. Electrophilicity (
 <italic>ω</italic>) gives an idea of the stabilization energy when the system gets saturated by electrons, which come from the external environment. This reactivity information shows that a molecule is capable of donating charges. The electrophilicity index above 1.5 for each structure reveals that the selective compounds have a significative attractive electron power.
