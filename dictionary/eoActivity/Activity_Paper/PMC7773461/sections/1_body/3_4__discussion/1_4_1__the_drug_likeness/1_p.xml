 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In determining that a compound has the potential as a drug, one of the methods is to follow the rule of five (Ro5). According to this rule, orally active drugs must not have more than one violation of established criteria [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Therefore, whether each docking compound met Lipinski's RO5 was checked. Some compounds that show violations towards RO5 are hesperidin (3), nabiximols (2), pectolinarin (3), epigallocatechin gallate (2), and rhoifolin (3) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The rule is used for the evaluation of the drug-likeness, as well as a determination if any particular chemical compound possesses chemical and physical properties to be used as an active drug, which can be consumed orally in humans [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It also acts as a basis for predicting a high probability of success or failure of one compound with particular pharmacological or biological activity to be developed as a drug. This rule also suggests that if a compound shows two or more Ro5 violations, then it shows low solubility or permeability [
