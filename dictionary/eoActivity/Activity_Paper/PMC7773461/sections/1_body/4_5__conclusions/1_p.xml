<p>Our study revealed that natural compounds hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin had better binding free energies with M
 <sup>pro</sup> and S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although the results of molecular docking of kaempferol, herbacetin, eugenol, and 6-shogaol are not as good as those compounds, they have good oral availability and also meet Ro5 criteria. These compounds have potential as antiviral phytochemicals that may inhibit the replication of the virus. These results are only preliminary screening to facilitate subsequent tests starting from in vitro and in vivo (in animal models or human clinical trials).
