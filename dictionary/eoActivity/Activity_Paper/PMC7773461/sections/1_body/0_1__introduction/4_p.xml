<p>Because COVID-19 is a new disease with global severe health problems, research is still needed, including finding specific therapeutic regimens to overcome morbidity and mortality. The plant is one of the medicinal active compound sources that have been widely used to treat diseases caused by microbes [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The natural products that have been reported to have antiviral activity can be used as a starting point in finding potential bioactive compound candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking can be used to predict how protein (receptor) interacts with bioactive compounds (ligands) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Several previous studies have been performed to investigate bioactive compounds in plants that have the potential to inhibit the proliferation of viruses [
