    "In this study isolates from Thymelaea hirsuta, a wild plant from the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, were identified and their selective cytotoxicity levels were evaluated. Phytochemical examination of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction of the methanolic (MeOH) extract of the plant led to the isolation of a new triflavanone compound (1), in addition to the isolation of nine previously reported compounds. These included five dicoumarinyl ethers found in Thymelaea: daphnoretin methyl ether (2), rutamontine (3), neodaphnoretin (4), acetyldaphnoretin (5), and edgeworthin (6); two flavonoids: genkwanin (7) and trans-tiliroside (8); p-hydroxy benzoic acid (9) and β sitosterol glucoside (10). Eight of the isolated compounds were tested for in vitro cytotoxicity against Vero and HepG2 cell lines using a sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. Compounds 1, 2 and 5 exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activities against HepG2 cells, with IC50 values of 8.6, 12.3 and 9.4 μM, respectively, yet these compounds exhibited non-toxic activities against the Vero cells. Additionally, compound 1 further exhibited promising cytotoxic activity against both MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells, with IC50 values of 4.26 and 9.6 μM, respectively. Compound 1 significantly stimulated apoptotic breast cancer cell death, resulting in a 14.97-fold increase and arresting 40.57% of the cell population at the Pre-G1 stage of the cell cycle. Finally, its apoptosis-inducing activity was further validated through activation of BAX and caspase-9, and inhibition of BCL2 levels. In silico molecular docking experiments revealed a good binding mode profile of the isolates towards Ras activation/pathway mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK); a common molecular pathway in the development and progression of liver tumors."
