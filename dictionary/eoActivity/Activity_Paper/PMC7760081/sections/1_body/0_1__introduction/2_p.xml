<p>As a preferable alternative to semi-synthetic drugs, natural products of plant origin are promoted as potential options for safer medicines and other life-saving drugs. The pharmaceutical use of medicinal plants with negligible side effects presents the possibility of their widespread application in mitigating the large fatalities associated with different deadly diseases [

 <italic>Dactylorhiza hatagirea</italic> provide an exemplary model for studying orchids as part of their ethnopharmacological properties and therapeutic applications. Owing to its immense significance in clinical research and drug discovery, the plant (tubers, leaves) has been used to study its potential to induce anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and other effects. In the context of global health concerns, this medicinally important herb has broadly been used in the evaluation of its ethnopharmacological applications towards validating its efficacy and efficiency for use in combatting different diseases. The present study puts forth a summary of information on the botany, taxonomy, chemistry, and ethnopharmacology of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic>. As overexploitation of the plant for use in pharmaceutics has drastically reduced its populations and has brought it under threat, a section of the manuscript is dedicated to approaches adopted for its conservation and long-term survival in its natural habitat.
