<p>Further studies are needed for exploring the potential of the plant for unknown bioactive constituents, studying the underlying mechanisms of bioactive components, and in performing analyses of their efficacy and possible use in assisting the exploration of new therapeutic molecules. Additionally, new possibilities also need to be explored for using the natural constituents of the plant in complementing standard medicines as a possible solution to diminish the occurrence of diseases and in combatting the infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms. The natural remedies of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> and its essential ingredients may play a vital role in the development of novel drugs for the treatment of different human diseases. There is no doubt that the extraction of secondary metabolites and their use in the drug industry is gaining pace; however, more research is needed on this plant to validate its effectiveness in humans. In addition, studies on frontier disciplines of modern aspects of biology such as genomics (transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc.) are needed in order to gain a detailed insight into this medicinally important plant. Considering the vulnerability of this orchid, effective measures through mass multiplication under in vitro and in vivo conditions should be carried out to maintain the germplasm of this critically endangered orchid above its threshold level. Additionally, the areas with natural populations of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> should be recommended as medicinal plant conservation areas (MPCA).
