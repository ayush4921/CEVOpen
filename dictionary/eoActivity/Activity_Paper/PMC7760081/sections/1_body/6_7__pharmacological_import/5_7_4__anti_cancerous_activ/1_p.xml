<p>The extract obtained from 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> shows a considerable effect on cancerous cell lines. The population of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 1% antibiotics with fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively, showed a considerable decrease in their population [

 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> show higher anti-cancerous potential than shoot extracts [

However, further study needs to be conducted using different animal models, under stress conditions, to understand its effects on different signaling pathways. Factors underlying the occurrence of the diseases should be explored in order to elucidate the mechanisms for devising effective treatment regimes.
