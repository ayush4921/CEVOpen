<p>Alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, steroids, diterpenes, saponins, and tannins present in the tubers of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> show potent anti-inflammatory activity. The activity was assessed in a rat paw oedema model induced by carrageenan and a cotton pellet granuloma model for acute/chronic inflammation. Adult Wistar rats of either sex responded better to hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> as compared to standard (aspirin 100 mg/kg and Indomethacin 10mg/kg). The extract showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions [

 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> tubers showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in the carrageenan-induced oedema among Wistar rats [
