 <p>The essential oil (EO), the methanolic (MeOH), and the 70% ethanolic (70% EtOH) extracts obtained from the aerial parts of 
  <italic>Ocimum campechianum</italic> Mill. (Ecuador) were chemically characterized through gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array-mass spectrometry detectors (HPLC-DAD-MS) and studied for their in vitro biological activity. The radical scavenger activity, performed by spectrophotometric 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2â€²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, highlighted significant IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for the EO, extracts and their main constituents (eugenol and rosmarinic acid). EO (and eugenol) showed noteworthy activity against 
  <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. 
  <italic>syringae</italic> and a moderate effect against clinical 
  <italic>Candida</italic> strains, with possible synergism in association to fluconazole against the latter microorganisms. The extracts and pure molecules exhibited weak cytotoxic activity against the HaCat cell line and no mutagenicity against 
  <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA98 and TA100 strains, giving indication of safety. Instead, EO showed a weak activity against adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549). The above-mentioned evidence leads us to suggest a potential use of the crude drug, extracts, and EO in cosmetic formulation and food supplements as antioxidant agents. In addition, EO may also have a possible application in plant protection and anti-
  <italic>Candida</italic> formulations.
