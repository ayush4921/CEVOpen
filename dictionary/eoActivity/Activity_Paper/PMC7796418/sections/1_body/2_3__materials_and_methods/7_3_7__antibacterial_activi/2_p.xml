<p>One-hundred microliters of bacterial culture standardized to 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and at 26 °C for 24 h, for human and phytopathogens, respectively. After the incubation period, 40 μL of water solution (20 mg/mL) of 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and then incubated for 30 min: microbial growth was evaluated by microplate reader (680XR, Bio Rad, Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 415 nm. Chloramphenicol (concentration range 20–0.32 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. All determinations were made in triplicate.
