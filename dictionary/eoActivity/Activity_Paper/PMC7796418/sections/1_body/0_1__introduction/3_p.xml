<p>The aim of our research was the chemical characterization of the EO and, for the first time, of the hydroalcoholic extracts of aerial parts, combined with the evaluation of their biological activity and that of their main constituents, providing a more exhaustive approach for studying the health potential of this species. In fact, the combination of critically assessed compositional data and biological effects may increase the scientific soundness of research [

In addition, we tested in vitro preliminary phytopathogenic activity with the precise aim of identifying promising extracts for further investigations with respect to the phytoiatric application, or for the sustainable defense of the crops.
