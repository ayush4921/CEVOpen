<p>The MIC and MFC results that gave the best FIC
 <sub>index</sub> data are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The MIC and MFC values for EO against all three strains were moderate. Even if no synergistic effects were evidenced for all strains, the FIC
 <sub>index</sub> for 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (FLU 43976) was close to the value of synergism, with the EO MICs and MFCs 2-fold lower than those displayed by the alone EO and for fluconazole 32-fold lower than those of alone fluconazole. This result suggested that 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO could be an interesting candidate to deeply investigate the synergism against fluconazole-resistant 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp.
