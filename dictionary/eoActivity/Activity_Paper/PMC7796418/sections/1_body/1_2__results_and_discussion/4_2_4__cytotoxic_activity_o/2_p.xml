<p>A preliminary screening of the extracts revealed a negative outcome for the alcoholic ones, and a weak activity for the EO that exhibited an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 71.89 ± 3.84 µg/mL. Rosmarinic acid was tested without obtaining any noteworthy results and eugenol did not reach an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value at the highest concentration tested. As a matter of fact, Fangjun and Zhijia (2018) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed that the latter molecule needs a concentration of at least 400 µM to obtain a result after 24 h of exposure. Therefore, the activity of the EO could be possibly due to other molecules or to a synergistic activity inside the phytocomplex.
