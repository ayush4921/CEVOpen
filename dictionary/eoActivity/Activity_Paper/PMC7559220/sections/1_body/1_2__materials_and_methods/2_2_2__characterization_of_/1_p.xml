<p>UV-vis (JASCO, V-530) with a resolution of 1 nm in the range of 300 to 600 nm was used to observe the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions in a colloidal solution. The zeta potential and hydrodynamic size were calculated using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., U.K.). The crystalline nature and size of the nanoparticles were confirmed through X-ray diffraction analysis (X-ray diffractometer, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with 40 kV/30 Ma X-ray, 2

 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5418 Å) and a fixed monochromator in the range of 20-80 degrees. The Scherrer approximation (

 <italic>θ</italic>) was used to calculate the average size of the nanoparticles. FT-IR was carried out at Shimadzu (Shimadzu Corporation) to investigate the type of functional groups involved in the reduction and capping of nanoscale silver. The samples for electron microscopy were gold coated (JEOL, Model No. JFC-1600), and images were obtained by scanning electron microscope (ZEISS EVO-MA 10, Oberkochen, Germany).
