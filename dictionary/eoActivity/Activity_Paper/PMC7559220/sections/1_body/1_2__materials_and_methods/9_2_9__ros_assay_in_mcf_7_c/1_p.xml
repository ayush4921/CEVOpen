<p>Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) probes were used to investigate the intracellular ROS production [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, the MCF-7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates for 24 hours and then treated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of AgNPs for 24 h. Trypsin EDTA was used to detach the cells. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L PBS containing a 10 mM DCFH-DA fluorescent probe. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. The extent of ROS generated was measured through a fluorescent spectrophotometer.
