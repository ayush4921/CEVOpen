<p>Caspase 3 and 9 assay kits (Caspase-Glo® 3 and 9 reagents, Promega) were used to quantify caspase activities. Briefly, 50,000 MCF-7 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator at 37°C for 24 hours. The 96-well plates containing AgNP-treated and AgNP-untreated control cells were then allowed to equilibrate at room temperature. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of Caspase-Glo® 3 or 9 reagent was added to each well of a 96-well plate (test well and control) containing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of culture medium. The plate was covered and the content mixed for 30 seconds at 500 rpm. The optical density was measured (ELISA reader, BioTek) at 405 nm after incubation of the plate at room temperature for 30 min.
