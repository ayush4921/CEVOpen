<p>The stock solution of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> aqueous extract (5 mg/mL) and AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (1 M) was prepared in distilled water. AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (extra pure, Merck) was diluted into 1, 2, 4, and 8 mM solutions. The extract and AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution were mixed in the ratio of 1 : 2, 1 : 4, 1 : 8, and 1 : 10. The reaction mixtures were kept at room temperature and at 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90°C in the dark. The time-dependent data were taken at an interval of 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min and 3, 4, and 5 hrs. The solution was stirred for 4 hours, and a color change was observed. For characterization, the mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm to get the pellet. The pellet was washed three times to remove any unbound plant compounds with distilled water by repeated centrifugation. Finally, the pellet was freeze-dried and lyophilized. The powder AgNPs obtained were further processed for characterization.
