<p>4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assay was used to further examine the alterations of chromatin which is an integral part of the process of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The fluorescent dye DAPI was intended for the staining of nuclear DNA in cells which have undergone the process of apoptosis. Briefly, cells (MCF-7) were grown to the density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well and introduced to the 24-well plates in the log phase followed by 24 h incubation. Afterwards, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of photosynthesized AgNPs were applied, and the culture was kept for up to 24 hours. After the treatment, 1x PBS was used to wash the cells which were fixed with 50

 <italic>μ</italic>L of the 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of the DAPI dye was used for staining followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes in the dark. 20
