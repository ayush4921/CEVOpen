<p>The interface of medicinal plants, nanoparticles, and cancer is an exciting horizon for the search of alternative and cheap chemotherapeutics. Herein, we optimized a complete green protocol for the phytosynthesis of AgNPs via aqueous extracts of the medicinally important plant 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic>. Indigenous knowledge reveals potential anticancer properties of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic>. It is used in making herbal tea. Recent research also indicated the significant anticancer potential of 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> against MCF-7 cells [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, to date, no reports are available to study the anticancer mechanism of the phytosynthesized AgNPs mediated by the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic>. This novel study describes the biosynthesis of AgNPs and investigates their cellular and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis caused by the 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> extract-mediated AgNPs. Earlier studies show various biological properties of biogenic AgNPs, such as antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], anticancerous [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], antiangiogenic, antiparasitic [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and antitumor [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. AgNPs have differential effects in the killing of cancer cells. Sanpui and his coworkers demonstrated that AgNPs induced apoptosis by affecting the membrane integrity and normal cellular functions [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Vasanth and his colleagues reported apoptosis in human cervical cells by treatment with AgNPs [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
