<p>Numerous chemical and physical methods are adopted for the synthesis of AgNPs [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although these methods are effective, they come with some shortcomings. The chemical and physical methods require high energy resources and generate toxic by-products and hazardous wastes [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent researches indicate the presence of noxious chemicals with the chemically synthesized nanoparticles making them relatively unfavourable for biomedical applications [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To overcome the issue of energy balance and toxic by-products, complete green methods are used for the synthesis of AgNPs. Therefore, a paradigm shift is observed towards the biological synthesis of AgNPs. Many biological assets like plants, microbes, algae, and yeasts are used to synthesize nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, due to their ample availability, low cost and a rich source of bioreducing agents, plants, and plant products are the most frequently used approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Biosynthesis is beneficial over other methods because of its low cost, rapidity, single step synthesis, high yield, and biocompatibility [
