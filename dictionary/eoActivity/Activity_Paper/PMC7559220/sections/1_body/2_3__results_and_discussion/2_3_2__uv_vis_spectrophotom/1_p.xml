<p>Biomodulated synthesis of AgNPs was optimized using different parameters. These parameters include optimization by (a) precursor concentration, (b) extract concentration, (c) temperature, and (d) time. As the aqueous extracts were added to the precursor solution, a color change was observed which indicates a successful reduction process. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2</xref> indicates the variation in color from light brown to darkish brown which can be attributed to the enhancement in the bioreduction process.
