<p>To further confirm apoptosis, Annexin V/PI staining assay was used. The assay demonstrated the apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to AgNPs (12.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and extract (25.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 hours. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"> Figure 9</xref> shows that untreated cells did not display any significant apoptosis, whereas extract and AgNP-treated cells become apoptotic after 24 hours with early apoptotic cell populations of 43.05% and an apoptotic population of 23.62%. Changes in the population of viable cells indicate that the cell becomes apoptotic due to AgNP-inducing antitumor activities. Similarly, Sriram and colleagues studied the anticancer effects of AgNPs in a tumor model and observed a decrease in the tumor volume [
