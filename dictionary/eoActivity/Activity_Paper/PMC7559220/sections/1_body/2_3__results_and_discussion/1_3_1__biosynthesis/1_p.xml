<p>Biosynthesis of AgNPs using the green route has been optimized using the extract of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic>. Biological synthesis is considered the most adequate method compared to the physical and chemical means. Hitherto, while being effective, these physical and chemical synthesis methods are accompanied by certain disadvantages like cost, energy demands, and generation of toxic hazardous waste streams [

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, in some reports, it was indicated that some toxic chemicals could remain adhered with the nanoparticles synthesized from chemical means which could not be used in biomedical applications [

 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> is a very important medicinal plant, and its therapeutic potential is well documented. Recent reports suggested the significant anticancer potential for the 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> species under in vitro conditions [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The medicinal potential of 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> is attributed to the novel phenolic and flavonoid chemical components, and these phytochemicals play the role of chelation and stabilize the nanoparticles in their biosynthesis. Although the biogenic synthesis of Ag nanoparticles has been reported successfully via plants, biosynthesis using medicinal pants with anticancer potential is rare. A mechanism proposed for the biosynthesis has been suggested in
