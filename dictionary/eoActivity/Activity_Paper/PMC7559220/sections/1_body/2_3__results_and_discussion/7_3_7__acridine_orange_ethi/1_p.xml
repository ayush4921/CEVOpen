<p>The AO/EB fluorescence microscopic staining assay was used to observe the morphological changes in MCF-7 cells. AO/EB staining differentiates between apoptotic and normal cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Figure 8</xref> shows the control untreated, extract, and AgNP-treated cells at 12.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (AgNPs) and 25.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (extract) concentrations after 24 hours. The figure shows that the control cells did not change and the cell remains green after staining, whereas the color of the treated cells changed (orange), indicating the apoptotic cells. Moreover, the treated cells show membrane blebbing, shrinkage, and nuclear fragmentation. The same type of membrane changes was observed in MCF-7-treated cells of
