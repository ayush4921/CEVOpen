<p>The size distribution was further studied using the dynamic light scattering technique. An average hydrodynamic particle size was calculated as 23.68 nm with a polydispersity index near 1. Our result agrees with the particle size of 27 to 32 nm obtained by Kotakadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] using the leaf extract of 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic>. Anandalakshmi and coworkers reported a hydrodynamic size of 150 nm with a diameter of 74 nm [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The zeta potential is the electric potential resulting from the distribution of charges which indirectly determine the stability of nanoparticles in colloidal suspension [
