 </xref> In this study, although there were no significant differences in body weights in the control and APAP group, higher liver/body weight ratio had been observed in the APAP-treated mice compared to those in the control group. The enlargement of liver in the APAP-treated mice indicate that hepatic lesions and liver injury related to the accumulation of collagen and extra cellular matrix protein in liver.

 </xref> Pre-administration with 1400 mg/kg/day GMSYS significantly decreased the liver/body weight ratio. Histopathologically, acute renal toxicity is characterized by injury of the proximal tubule cell and decreases of glomerular filtration rate.

 </xref> Although the kidney weight was reduced by APAP in the present study, there was no histopathological changes associated with renal toxicity in all groups (Supplementary data 2). Therefore, it is thought that the kidney weight decreased by APAP in this study was considered to be not associated with toxicity.
