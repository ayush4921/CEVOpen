<p id="par0205">In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time GMSYS was effective in preventing APAP-induced liver injury 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data indicated that GMSYS prevented APAP-induced liver cell death in BNL CL.2 cells. In addition, GMSYS effectively attenuated APAP-induced liver injury by inhibiting plasma ALT and AST activities and hepatic lipid peroxidation; by reducing the depletion of hepatic antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, GPx, GR, and GST; and by normalizing the GSH
 <sub>t</sub>/GSSG ratio. These results suggested that GMSYS possessed antioxidative activity that likely contributed to its protective effect against APAP-induced liver injury. Taken together, this study suggests that GMSYS has considerable potential for development as a natural hepatoprotective agent.
