 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The most clinically relevant drug in this class is acetaminophen (

 </xref> APAP is widely used globally as an effective analgesic and antipyretic agent. At therapeutic doses, APAP is mainly excreted in the urine via conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate, and small concentrations are metabolized to 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a reactive metabolite, through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-dependent oxidative enzyme pathway.

 </xref> Although NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione (
 <sc>l</sc>-Î³-glutamyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteinyl glycine, GSH), an overdose of APAP leads to the depletion of GSH through the accumulation of NAPQI and saturates the glucuronidation and sulfation pathways.

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7.</xref> Consequently, excess NAPQI binds with free thiols on intracellular proteins to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Previous reports have shown that oxidative stress is closely related to APAP hepatotoxicity. Additionally, lipid peroxidation resulting from oxidative stress is a pivotal marker for cell death due to APAP overdose.

  <sup>10</sup>
 </xref> Recently, much research has demonstrated that various natural products have the potential to prevent liver injury by stimulating the defense system against oxidative damage by APAP.
