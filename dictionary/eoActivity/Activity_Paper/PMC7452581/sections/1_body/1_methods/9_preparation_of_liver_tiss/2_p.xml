<p id="par0095">Liver tissue (50 mg) was homogenized in 500 μL RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail using a rotor-stator homogenizer (T 10 basic ULTRA-TURRAX; IKA works, Staufen, Germany). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent. To quantify GSSG activity exclusive of GSH, liver tissue (50 mg) was quickly added to 5 μL 2-vinylpyridine (1 M) and 500 μL RIPA buffer containing the above protease inhibitor cocktail and homogenized using a rotor-stator homogenizer. All subsequent assays were performed as described in this section.
