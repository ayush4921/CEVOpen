  <p>Effect of GMSYS on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in BNL CL.2 cells.</p>
  <p>Cells were pretreated with the various concentrations of GMSYS for 2 h and treated with APAP (20 mM) for 22 h. Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 kit. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM (n = 4). 
   <sup>##</sup> indicates a statistical significant difference at 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, when compared with negative control cells; * and ** indicates a statistical significant difference at 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively, when compared with APAP-alone treated cells.
