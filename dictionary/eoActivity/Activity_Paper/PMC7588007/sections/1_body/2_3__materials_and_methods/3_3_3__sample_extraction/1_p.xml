 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Shortly, the extraction consisted in S/M ratio of 25:1 mL/g DW mixed with 20 mL of pure ethanol (100%) as the extraction solvent extracted during 45 min in an ultrasound bath (USC1200TH, Prolabo, Sion, Switzerland) with operating at an ultrasound frequency of 30 kHz with extraction temperature set at 45 °C. After extraction, centrifugation was carried out for 15 min at 8000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, and the resulting supernatant filtered (0.45 µm, Merck, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, Lyon, France) prior to further analysis.
