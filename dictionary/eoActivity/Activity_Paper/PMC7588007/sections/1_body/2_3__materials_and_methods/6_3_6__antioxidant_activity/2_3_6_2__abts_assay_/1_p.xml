<p>The protocol of Velioglu et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] was adapted for the ABTS (2,2-Azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) assay. Briefly, by combining equal amounts of ABTS salt (7 mM) and potassium per sulphate (2.45 mM), a solution was prepared, then placed for 16 h in the dark. The sample extract (10 µL) was blended with the ABTS solution (190 µL). Absorbance was measured at 734 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy II reader, BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France), after keeping the mixture for 15 min in the dark at 25 °C. Triplicate assays were performed and antioxidant power was expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC).
