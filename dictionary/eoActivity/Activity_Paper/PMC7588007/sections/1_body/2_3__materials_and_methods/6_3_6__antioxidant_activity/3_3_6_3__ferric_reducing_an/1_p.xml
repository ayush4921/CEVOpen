<p>To find out FRAP, the protocol of Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] was adapted. The sample extract (10 µL) was blended with the FRAP solution (190 µL). Absorbance was recorded at 630 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy II reader, BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France), after incubating the mixture at 25 °C for 15 min. Triplicate assays were performed and antioxidant power was demonstrated as TEAC.
