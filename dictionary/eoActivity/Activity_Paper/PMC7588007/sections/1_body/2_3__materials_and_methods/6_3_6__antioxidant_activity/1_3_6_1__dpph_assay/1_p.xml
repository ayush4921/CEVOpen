<p>Free radical DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging potential was evaluated by following the protocol of Shah et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Briefly, the sample extract (20 μL) was blended with 180 μL of DPPH solution and kept for 1h in dark. Using a microplate reader (Synergy II reader, BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France), the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. Free radical scavenging potential was estimated by following equation: % scavenging = 100 × (1 − AE/AD), with AE = dilution absorbance at 517 nm and AD = pure DPPH absorbance as a standard.
