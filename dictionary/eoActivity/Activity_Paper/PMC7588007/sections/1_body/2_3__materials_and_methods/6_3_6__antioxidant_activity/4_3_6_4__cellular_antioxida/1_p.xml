<p>The cellular antioxidant assay was performed with the detection of reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen (ROS) species levels were determined by using a fluorescent dye dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123) as described previously by Garros et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. All extracts evaporated under nitrogen flow, dissolved in DMSO at 50 µg/mL, and added to the cells 6 h before oxidative stress induction at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The final concentration of DMSO applied on the cell was 1% (

Then, the extracts were washed two times with PBS and kept at 30 °C in the dark for 10 min. The BioRad (Marnes-la-Coquette, France) Fluorimeter (λem = 535 nm, λex = 505 nm) was used for the detection of the fluorescent signal after repeatedly washing with PBS.
