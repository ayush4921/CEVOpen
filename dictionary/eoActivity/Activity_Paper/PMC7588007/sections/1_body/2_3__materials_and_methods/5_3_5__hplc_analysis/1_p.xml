<p>Chicoric acid, rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid were estimated by HPLC using a method validated according to international standards of the association of analytical communities (AOAC) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A reversed phase HPLC fitted with autosampler, Varian (Les Ulis, France) Prostar 230 pump and a Varian Prostar 335 photodiode array detector was utilized by following previously reported protocol [

A RP-18 Purospher (Merck, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, Lyon, France) column (250 mm × 4.0 mm, internal diameter: 5 μm) was used at 35 °C for separation. The mixture of acetic acid (0.2%), water and methanol were used as mobile phase. During a 60 min run, the composition of the mobile phase was varied linearly from 5:95 (

 <italic>v</italic>) at a uniform flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Compounds were detected at 320 and 520 nm. Compound identification was achieved by comparing with their commercial standards (Merck, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, Lyon, France). Quantification was carried out using 5-point calibration curves 1 with at least 0.998 correlation coefficient [
