<p>Seeds of Thai basil were obtained from National Agriculture Research Center (NARC, Islamabad, Pakistan). Procedure of Abbasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was adopted for seed surface sterilization. Seeds were immersed for 30 s in mercuric chloride (0.1%) and afterward in ethanol and washed thrice with distilled water. MS basal medium [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with agar (8 g/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were utilized for seed germination. For callus culture establishment, 1â€“1.5 cm long sections of 8 to 10 leaf explant from 28 days old in vitro plantlets were inoculated on MS basal medium with different concentrations of BAP, GA

Data of callogenic frequency was noted on weekly basis and callus was subcultured with the same PGRs concentration after every 4 weeks. Following this, callus cultures were harvested after the first subculture for the determination of fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) respectively, as described previously by Nazir et al. [
