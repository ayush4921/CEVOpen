<p>Earlier reports have shown that exogenous auxins in major angiosperm species are essential growth regulators for callus induction [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cytokinin along with auxin is generally required for maximum callus induction by most plant species. In particular, the need for exogenous cytokinin to maintain the interdependent balance between cytokinin and auxin that promotes cell division has been reported as a significant strategy for the production of calluses [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likewise, in numerous other medicinal plant species, the combination of NAA with other PGRs resulted in maximum callogenic frequency [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, higher concentrations of applied PGRs may limit the callogenesis, possibly due to the repression of some endogenous hormones [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The combination of BAP and NAA has been shown to produce optimum biomass for callus cultures of many medicinal plants such as the endangered species 
 <italic>Aquilaria malaccensis</italic> Lam [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This may result from the synergistic interaction between BAP and NAA as observed for the production of 
 <italic>Brassica oleraces</italic> L. callus culture biomass [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our previous studies, on 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> L. cv purple basil in vitro cultures, optimal production of biomass was achieved using the PGR thidiazuron (TDZ) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, TDZ is no longer considered safe in Europe, where its use is banned (Status under Reg. (EC) No 1107/2009 (repealing Directive 91/414/EEC)). So, its use for nutraceutical applications, which is the intended application, is no longer suitable.
