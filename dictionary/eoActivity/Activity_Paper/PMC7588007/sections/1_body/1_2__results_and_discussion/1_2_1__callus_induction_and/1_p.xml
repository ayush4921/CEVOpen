<p>Callogenesis from 28 days old leaf explants was evaluated for optimum biomass production in response to various PGRs (6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), gibberellic acid (GA
 <sub>3</sub>), naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)) treatments either alone or in combination (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04859-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. Morphological differences in the color and texture of calluses were noted. Here, callogenesis originated at the cut end of explants after 7 to 12 days in response to all tested PGRs. However, the callogenic frequency was varied in response to all PGRs tested. A high callogenic frequency of 95% was observed for BAP:NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L) followed by 92% for BAP:NAA (2 mg/L:1 mg/L). Callogenesis was around 20% to 70% for BAP treatments, but the value increased to 95% when NAA was used in combination with BAP (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04859">Table S1</xref>). No callus induction was observed in the MS basal medium without hormones, whereas the initiation of callogenesis was observed with NAA alone, but the calluses rapidly turned brown, without noticeable growth, and eventually died.
