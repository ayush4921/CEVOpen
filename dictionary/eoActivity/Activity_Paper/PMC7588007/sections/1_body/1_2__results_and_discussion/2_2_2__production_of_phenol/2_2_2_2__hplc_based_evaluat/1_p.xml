<p>The HPLC analysis confirmed treatment with different PGRs of leaf-derived callus culture as a tool for improving the synthesis of the main biologically active phenolic acids of Thai basil (

 <sub>3</sub> treatments alone and with NAA exhibit a wide range of metabolite production. Maximum accumulation of chicoric acid (36.8 and 35.8 mg/g DW) obtained for the BAP treatments at concentrations of 2 and 5 mg/L, respectively, in combination with NAA at 1 mg/L (

Compared to extract from commercial Thai basil leaves, chicoric acid accumulation was 2.6-fold higher in the extract from an in vitro callus produced under optimized conditions, while rosmarinic acid content was similar in both types of extracts (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04859-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In comparison, the accumulation levels in callus extracts of their biosynthetic precursor, caffeic acid, was much lower than that of chicoric acid and rosmarinic acid (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04859-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The concentration of caffeic acid in extract from in vitro callus cultures was 7.5- to 10-fold lower than in the extract from commercial Thai basil leaves (
