<p>Chicoric, rosmarinic and caffeic acids have previously been reported in different basil species and varieties [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in particular in Thai basil [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is generally accepted that the accumulation of different phenolic acids in plant cultures may be modulated by the exogenous application of PGRs [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In line with this observation, our results show that the phenolic acids chicoric acid and rosmarinic acid can be modulated by PGRs in vitro callus cultures of Thai basil. Similarly, [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] also revealed an increase in the concentration of chicoric acid in their callus cultures of 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> grown on NAA supplemented medium. Similarly, increased production of rosmarinic acid was observed in 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> in vitro cultures grown on media supplemented with NAA in combination with other PGRs [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and in 
 <italic>O. americanum</italic> callus culture grown on BAP in combination with IAA [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the present study, chicoric acid and rosmarinic acid were both quantified and their contents were increased in response to PGR treatment. The lower levels of caffeic acid may be associated with its efficient biotransformation into its derivatives rosmarinic acid and chicoric acid [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is important to note that chicoric acid production in our Thai basil callus cultures grown under the optimal conditions is higher than that measured for leaves, but also higher than that reported in the possible agricultural production of other plant resources [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, considering its independence of climatic variations or of the potential losses in yield resulting from crop pestsâ€™ attacks, as well as, contrary to agricultural production, the possibility offered by the in vitro culture system of multiplying the harvestings, the feasibility of using Thai basil in vitro cultures for the industrial production of chicoric acid is thus possible.
