<p>Szopa and Ekiert [

This result is supported by a number of studies which report that the inclusion of a higher BAP concentration and a lower NAA concentration resulted in the maximum TPC [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This observation could be related to the stimulation of essential enzymes for the biosynthesis of various phenylpropanoids, such as 
 <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase (PAL/TAL), in response to several PGR concentrations [

 <sub>3</sub> has previously been shown to suppress the production of some phenylpropanoids, such as lignans in flax, in a dose-dependent manner [
