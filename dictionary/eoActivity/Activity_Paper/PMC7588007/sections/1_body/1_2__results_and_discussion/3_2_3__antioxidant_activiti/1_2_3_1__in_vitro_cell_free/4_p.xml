<p>Similarly, a significant relationship between phenolic acid accumulation and antioxidant capacity has been revealed for several medicinal plant species [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. From a strictly chemical point of view, these in vitro cell-free antioxidant assays are interesting since they can provide information on the mechanism reaction involved in the antioxidant potential of an extract [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Here, the results obtained could reflect a preferential ET-type mechanism. However, these in vitro assays do not necessarily reflect the situation of the in vivo systems and, therefore, their validity should be considered to be strictly limited to interpretation within the meaning of the chemical reactivity with respect to the in vitro produced radicals, and thus should be confirmed by in vivo assays.
