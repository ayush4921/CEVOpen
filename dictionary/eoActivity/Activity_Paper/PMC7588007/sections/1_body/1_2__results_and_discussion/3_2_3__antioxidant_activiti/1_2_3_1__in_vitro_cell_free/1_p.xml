<p>Three distinct in vitro cell-free antioxidant assays, namely DPPH, ABTS and FRAP were used to assess the antioxidant capacity of the extracts from Thai basil callus cultures. FRAP represents electron transfer (ET) antioxidant mechanism, while ABTS follows hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) antioxidant mechanism. Here, the results of both assays were calculated as TEAC (μM of Trolox C equivalent antioxidant capacity). DPPH assay can reveal both HAT- and ET-based antioxidants, and was calculated as a percentage of DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA percentage). Extracts from callus grown on BAP:NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L) presented the highest levels for DPPH (93.2% RSA) and ABTS (1322.0 µM TEAC) antioxidant assays (
