In the modern era, however, with the increasing awareness to the potential nutrition benefits or hazards of a given food product, an established list of nutrition facts has become an essential step in the initial evaluation of a candidate species. Here, for the first time, a comprehensive nutrition facts list is presented for HSB tubers (
