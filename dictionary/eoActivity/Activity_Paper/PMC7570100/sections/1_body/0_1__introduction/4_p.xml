<p>Hairy stork’s bill (HSB) (
 <italic>Erodium crassifolium</italic> L’Hér) is a Saharo-Arabian common perennial hemicryptophyte (i.e., buds are at or near the soil surface) that inhabits shrub–steppes of arid southeast Mediterranean regions. The species is distributed from northwest at Crete [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In Israel, HSB can be found in the Negev and Judean deserts, where the annual rainfall is 30–250 mm. The species is most abundant in the stony and arid loess soils and on slopes of limestone hills [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vegetative phase in form of rosette (early season) and 30 cm stems and leaves (late season) starts with the first effective rains. Flowering time is February to May and the flowers are pink to purple with dark color base (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The diaspores are carried away from the mother plant by strong winds and react to humidity changes by creating screw-like twists to penetrate the soil [

 <italic>E. crassifolium</italic> is among the few known to produce tubers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The tubers are formed on roots at depth of 5–20 cm and are typically small and spherical (1–2 cm in diameter). HSB tubers have a sweet taste and are best in late winter or early spring when they are whitish in color [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Traditional knowledge holds that the tubers are edible and Bedouin tribes are their primary consumers [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, no information exists regarding nutritional value of these tubers. Furthermore, in spite of enduring claims associating some medicinal properties with HSB tubers, no supportive documented evidence have been found so far.
