<p>GC-MS analyses were carried out using a HP7890 gas chromatograph coupled to a HP6973 mass spectrometer (electron multiplier potential 2 KV, filament current 0.35 mA, electron energy 70 eV and the spectra were recorded over the range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 45 to 1000). An Agilent 7683 autosampler was used for sample introduction. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.1 mL s
 <sup>–1</sup>. One μL of each sample was injected into the GC–MS using a 1:10 split ratio injection mode. An isothermal hold at 50 °C was kept for 2 min, followed by a heating gradient of 6 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 300 °C, with the final temperature held for 4 min. A 30 m, 0.25 mm ID 5% cross-linked phenylmethyl siloxane capillary column (HP-5MS) with a 0.25-μm film thickness was used for the separation, and the injection port temperature was 220 °C. The MS interface temperature was 280 °C. Peak assignments were carried out with the aid of library spectra (NIST 14.0) and compared with published data and MS data obtained from the injection of standards [(-)-Epigallocatechin, 08,108; catechin, 
 <italic>U-</italic>49,040; gallic acid, 91,215] purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland or USA.
