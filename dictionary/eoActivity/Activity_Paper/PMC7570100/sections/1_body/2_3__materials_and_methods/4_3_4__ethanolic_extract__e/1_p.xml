<p>HSB tubers were removed from cold storage (−20 °C) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tubers were homogenized using an electrical blender and weighed. For each 1 g of fresh material, 4 mL of 70% ethanol were added immediately to the crushed tubers and incubated overnight at 28 °C with shaking at 180 rpm, after which the samples were centrifuged in 50-mL tubes for 5 min at 2500 rpm in an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge with a 26 cm rotor (1820 RCF). The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo overnight. The remaining water content was lyophilized to powder and stored at −20 °C. From each gram of tubers, approx. 60 mg of lyophilized extract was obtained.</p>
