<p id="p0090">Though 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> is a weed but its use in traditional medicine is popular and this popularity has resulted into considerable isolation of some secondary metabolites from this plant. Alkaloids, terpenes, iridoids, phenolics and flavonoids are compounds that have been reportedly isolated from the plant. This study reveal that only twenty-nine (29) compounds have been isolated from this plant species so far. Among these compounds, alkaloids and iridoids showed some 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activities. 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Trease and Evans (1972)</xref> identified an alkaloid from aerial parts of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic>, the compound was named emetine (
 <bold>3</bold>). 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Pousset et al. (1973)</xref> reported that 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> contains two new tetrahydro- 
 <italic>β</italic> - carboline alkaloids, borrerine (
 <bold>1</bold>) and an apparent dimer, borreverine (
 <bold>2</bold>). The structures of these compounds were discovered by combined spectroscopic techniques. 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Vieira et al. (1999)</xref> isolated three iridoidal compounds from 
 <italic>Borreria verticillata</italic>. A new iridoid aglycone borreriagenin (
 <bold>10</bold>), with two known iridoids asperuloside (
 <bold>8</bold>) and daphylloside (
 <bold>11</bold>). 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Baldé et al. (1991)</xref> isolated a new bis-indole alkaloid, spermacoceine (
 <bold>5</bold>) and other known three alkaloids from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Borreria verticillata</italic>. These indole alkaloids are borrerine (
 <bold>1</bold>), borreverine (
 <bold>2</bold>) and isoborreverine (
 <bold>4</bold>), these structures were established from spectroscopic data. Cadinene, caryophyllene (
 <bold>17</bold>) and guaiene (
 <bold>22</bold>), these compounds were identified by the comparison of its IR spectrum from the oil extracted from 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Benjamin, 1979</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Andre et al. (1976)</xref> identified a compound from the leaves of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic>, when all the spectroscopic data were compared with an existing one, the compound was Stigmasterol (
 <bold>20</bold>). 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al. (2017)</xref> identified some secondary metabolites from the hydroalcoholic extract and ethyl acetate fraction from 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) analysis. Some of the compounds discovered are Gallic acid (
 <bold>25</bold>), β-sitosterol (
 <bold>19</bold>), Glycyrrhetinic acid (
 <bold>29</bold>), β-amyrin (
 <bold>23</bold>), Caffeic acid (
 <bold>27</bold>), Coumaric Acid (
 <bold>28</bold>), Quercetin (
 <bold>26</bold>), Ursolic acid (
 <bold>21</bold>), Ellagic acid (
 <bold>24</bold>). 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al. (2010)</xref> reportedly isolate three new and two known compounds from 
 <italic>Borreria verticillata.</italic> These were two novel simple indole alkaloids called verticillatine B (
 <bold>17</bold>) and verticillatine A (
 <bold>6</bold>), one new iridoid called 6′-O-(2-glyceryl) scandoside methyl ester (
 <bold>15</bold>), scandoside methyl ester (
 <bold>14</bold>) and asperuloside (
 <bold>8</bold>).
