 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdullahi-Gero et al. (2014)</xref> showed that the oral median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of ethanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>B. verticilatta</italic> was greater than 5,000 mg/kg body weight in mice and rats, while the intraperitoneal LD
 <sub>50</sub> in mice was 3,807.88 mg/kg and greater than 5,000 mg/kg in rats. This means that 
 <italic>B. vesticillata</italic> has very low toxicity and well tolerated to rats and mice (

 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> has a harmful effect on agricultural yield, it greatly reduces the yield. It is an important weed for major crop such root crops, sugarcane and vegetables. 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> is a popular weed in Brazil, Trinidad, Panama, Columbia and most of the West Africa countries. This plant species affect cassava, cocoa, cowpea, rice, maize and beans (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al., 2011</xref>). Mixed cropping system, cultivation, frequent grazing and mowing are effective in checking 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic>'s growth and progress in an area especially beyond the herbaceous stage and creating thick stomps which can impend the growth of other vegetation (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">ISSG, 2016</xref>). Many authors demonstrated the relative resistant nature of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> to many synthetic herbicides commonly sold
 <italic>.</italic> They reported that this weed show great selectivity in its response to these herbicides (
