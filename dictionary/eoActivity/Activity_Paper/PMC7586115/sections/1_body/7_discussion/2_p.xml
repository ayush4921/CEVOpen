 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aoudia et al. (2012)</xref> isolated phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic>, these compounds are gallic acid (
 <bold>25</bold>), protocatechin, ferulic acid, epicatechin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and caffeic acid (
 <bold>27</bold>). The antinemic activities of these secondary metabolites were also assessed in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests on normal and cancer cells. Some authors investigated various fractions of 
 <italic>Viola betonicifolia</italic> against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica.</italic> A novel methylated flavonoid was isolated with same other compaunds i.e. Kaurene and trachyloban diterpenes from Psidia punctulata of the Compositae family. These compounds were found to exhibit significant nematicidal activities (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds, 2003</xref>). The ethyl acetate fraction that is rich in flavonoids and phenolics contents, was discovered to inhibit the growth, mobility and life of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Muhammad and Saeed, 2011</xref>). These compounds resulted in a significant significant nematicidal activity (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aoudia et al., 2012</xref>). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of phenolic compounds reveal that some factors such as the main chemical moiety, the arrangement and position of substituents, and the number of hydroxyl groups in addition to other substituents on the phenolic moiety ring and the esterification of the carboxyl group, all these can affect the antimicrobial activity vis-à-vis the nematicidal effect (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kahkeshani et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Dubey et al., 2013</xref>). Phenolic compounds like gallic acid (
 <bold>25</bold>) and ellagic acid (
 <bold>24</bold>) possess more free hydroxyl groups on the phenolic moiety. They have a high measure of hydroxylation in phenol ring and highly methoxylated phenol groups with increased oxidized phenol groups. These helps the compounds to be able prevent motility, adherence and biofilm growth of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa i.e. 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus mutans</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Borges et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). These compounds can mimic and simulate the antimicrobial effects of known antibiotics i.e. ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin via synergism. The antinemic effect of phenolics has been copiously reported by several authors (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ntalli et al., 2009</xref>). The presence of flavonoids i.e. Quercetin (
 <bold>26</bold>), Ellagic acid (
 <bold>24</bold>) and phenolics i.e. caffeic acid (
 <bold>27</bold>) and coumaric acid (
 <bold>28</bold>) makes 
 <italic>B. verticilatta</italic> an effective and alternative candidate as bio-nematicides.
