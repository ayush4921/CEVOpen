<p id="p0160">Alkaloids, terpenes, iridoids, phenolics and flavonoids which are some of the secondary metabolites isolated from 
 <italic>B. verticillata,</italic> have been reported to possess antinemic property. Phytopesticides are human-friendly beside been easily accessible and bio-degradable, are therefore environmentally friendly compared to the synthetic pesticides which huge adverse effects on human, animals and the ecosystem. Multiple factors have renewed interest in the source of natural products as pesticides for the pesticide industry and the market. Application of these plant extracts to nematodes will be easy because of its accessibility and easy to use, not as the chemical pesticides, costly and dangerous to health. This plant species is widely distributed globally, is mostly regarded as weed. Work is going on, on the extract of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> on the on egg hatching, mortality, the immobility of second-stage juveniles (J2s), root galling on the Root-Knot Nematode (
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic>). 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic>' s antimicrobial activity should be utilized for agricultural purposes. Innovative and knowledge is essential for the discovery of novel nematicidal compounds, and constituents isolated from plants could play a foremost role in the discovery of leading constituents for chemical synthesis. Grasping and knowing the biochemical interaction between metabolites and compounds of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> and root-knot nematodes is vital in developing novel and environmental friendly bio-pesticides.
