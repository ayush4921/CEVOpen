 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> (Root-knot nematode) is one of the main plant-parasitic nematode species threatening the yield i.e. quality and quantity, of agricultural crops both annual and perennial ones. Root-knot nematodes are generally widespread and are responsible for considerable yield losses of a wide range of stable crops. Annual crop yield losses due to plant-parasitic nematodes are valued at about $78 billion worldwide (

Crops that are affected by root-knot nematodes displayed some unique symptoms, these includes stunting and nutrient deficiency, browning of leaves, early wilting, root galling, suppression in plant growth and reduction of photosynthetic pigments which result into yield losses, poor fruit quality and reduced shelf-life (

Among control methods against plant parasitic nematodes, synthetic chemical takes the main role. Although it brought instant relative and prove to be efficient, they are actually unaffordable by most rural farmers and not easily accessible for the resource-poor farmers in most developing countries. Over the years, people could notice the adverse effects of these pesticides made from chemicals, they are dangerous on plants, ecosystem, animals and humans. They are very toxic, non-biodegradable and posed hazards to farmers and non-target groups (
