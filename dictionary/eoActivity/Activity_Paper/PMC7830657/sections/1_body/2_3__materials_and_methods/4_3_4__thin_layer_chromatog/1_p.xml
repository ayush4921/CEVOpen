<p>To select an appropriate solvent system, for separating the various components present in the crude extract, TLC of the crude extract was performed using a method detailed earlier [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For detecting the presence of phytochemicals, an aluminium-backed thin layer chromatography (TLC) apparatus was loaded with 2 Î¼L of each extract. The glass TLC plates were 20 cm by 20 cm and pre-coated with silica gel 60 F254 (E. Merck/Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 0.2 mm thickness). A solution of chloroform, ethyl acetate and formic acid, in a ratio of 10:8:2

The developed plate was then viewed at 254 nm and 365 nm under ultra-violet light for fluorescent compounds using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Sunny UV.7804C, Tokyo, Japan). Next, the TLC plate was sprayed with vanillin sulphuric acid and subsequently heated to visualize colors of the different compounds. The R

When dried, weight measurements were taken, and the condensed fractions were further analyzed using HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography) technique for confirmation of the identity of phenolic compounds.
