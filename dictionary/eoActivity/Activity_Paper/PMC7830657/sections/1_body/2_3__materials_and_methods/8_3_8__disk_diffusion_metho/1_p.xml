<p>The antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out by the conventional disk diffusion technique as explained by Zazharskyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with some modifications. In this method, the Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plates were streaked by previously prepared inoculums using a sterile swab. Then, 5 μL of each ethyl acetate (I-II) and ethanol (III-V) fractions were impregnated onto sterilized paper discs (6 mm, Whatman paper N°5) in solvent (10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> dimethyl sulfoxide and 1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> tween 80 in deionized water). Under same conditions, the antibiotics Amikacin and Gentamycin (5 μg/mL) and the same solvent (10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> dimethyl sulfoxide and 1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> tween 80 in deionized water) employed in the dilution of extract fractions were used as positive and negative control respectively. The plates were maintained at a room temperature (RT) and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. In the end, antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring in millimetres the nearest surrounding diameter of resulting inhibition zones (around and including discs diameter). Each experiment was done in triplicates.
