<p>The 
 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> extracts were examined against a series of highly pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, four human pathogenic bacteria were selected to screen their in-vitro antimicrobial activities. All four microbial strains were obtained from the stock culture of our laboratory. Both Gram-positive strains, including 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 14579), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), and Gram-negative strains, including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 8739) and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 7829), were tested in this study, as these are the most common food borne pathogens of concern. Bead vials were used to safely store microorganisms in frozen condition (−18 °C).
