<p>The antioxidant capacity was also evaluated using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. In order to determine the ferric reducing activity of different fraction of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts, FRAP assay was performed based on the methods of Oyaizu [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] with slight modification. Briefly, all fractions in different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, 160 μg/mL) and standard (ascorbic acid) were mixed with 1 mL of distilled water, 2.5 mL of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> (1% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and 2.5 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). 22.5 mL of trichloro acetic acid (10% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) were then added in to these mixtures after a 20 min incubation at a temperature of 50 °C. All mixtures were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (2.5 mL) of each testing samples were mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1%, 
 <italic>w/v</italic>). Finally, the ferric reducing antioxidant power was calculated according to the absorbance at 700 nm using a spectrophotometer (Sunny UV.7804C, Tokyo, Japan) by following equation:
 <disp-formula>% ferric reducing antioxidant power = (A/A
  <sub>0</sub>) × 100%
 </disp-formula> where A is the absorbance of sample and A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of control (deionized distilled water).
