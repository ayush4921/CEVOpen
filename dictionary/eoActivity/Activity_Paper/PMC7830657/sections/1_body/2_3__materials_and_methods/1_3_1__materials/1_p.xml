 <italic>Artemisia heba-alba</italic> Asso.’s aerial (without pathogenic and physical damage) parts were collected in April and June 2019 from northern Iraq during the flowering season, when temperatures typically vary from a night-time low of 20 °C to a day-time high of 38 °C. The cultivated plants were grown at Mosul (20′ 24.0000″ N and 43° 7′ 48.0036″ E), which is a major city in northern Iraq. The soil used during cultivation of the plant primarily comprised of silt and sand. The choice for the geographical location was based on expert suggestion and literature survey. The plant parts were collected, wearing gloves to maintain sterility, and were subsequently kept in sterile plastic bag before being transported to the laboratory. Collected plant materials were identified/authenticated by personnel from Ministry of Agriculture, Baghdad, Iraq. After confirmation of plant identity, it was systematically washed with sterile distilled water to remove all surface dust particles. After this, plant materials were immediately placed in dark at room temperature (RT, approximately 25 °C) until dry, as phenolics are prone to photodegradation [

Eventually, the dried plant parts were vigorously crushed into a very fine powder/paste using a pre-chilled laboratory mortar and pestle. Following crushing, the plant powder was filtered through sterile muslin cloth and subsequently safely stored at −20 °C for further investigation. All reagents (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, chloroform, vanillin sulphuric acid, acetonitrile, phosphoric acid, hydroquinone, 4-Hydroxy benzoic acid, vanillic acid, catechol, quercetin, gallic acid, cinnamic acid, and thymol) used for extraction, isolation, and analysis were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Baghdad, Iraq).
