<p>HPLC was employed to confirm the identity of phenolic components extracted. With its high sensitivity and speed, HPLC represent one of the best analytical system to analyze plant substances such as phenols. The analytical HPLC system (reversed phase HPLC with silica-based C18; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) consisted of a detector for SPD-10A UV-VIS, VP pump LC-10AT, an auto injector SIL-10AF, and the system controller SCL-10A VP. The analytical column was the Chiralcel 
 <sup>®</sup> OD-RH (150 mm roughly 4.6 mm diameter, 5 mm particle size Chiral Technologies Inc. Exton, PA, USA). The mobile phase used was acetonitrile, water and phosphoric acid (30:70:0.08,

Separated compounds were detected by the built-in SPD-10A UV-Vis detector at 288 nm. Overall, the phenolic compounds were identified by the method described by Skendi et al. [
