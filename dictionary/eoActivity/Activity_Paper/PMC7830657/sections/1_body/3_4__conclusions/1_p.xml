<p>The results obtained in this study showed the composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of different 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> Asso. extracts. Eight phenolic compounds were identified. This study demonstrated for first time the use of Soxhlet apparatus for extraction of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> aerial parts, which resulted in higher yield of phenolics such as thymol, hydroquinone and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, as compared to previous reports. Fractions of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts depicted different levels of antimicrobial activities against the bacteria assayed in this study. Fraction I could efficiently inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, Fraction II showed strongest inhibition effect toward 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, Fraction III showed the broad antimicrobial effects again all microorganisms tested, except for 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, while Fractions IV and V did not exhibit strong antimicrobial effects in low concentrations. In terms of antioxidant effects, Fraction III showed strongest antioxidant effect, followed by Fractions V and IV, with Fractions I and II being the weakest. This difference was attributed to the phenolic compounds identified in each fraction, with the intensity of antioxidant effects strongly correlated to the number of hydroxyl groups. Further in vivo studies and clinical assays are still needed to confirm the safety and possible applications of these 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts as antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. Results from this study could be used to further develop a powerful method for extraction of phenolic compounds from white wormwood wood for use in various nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.
