<p>Another antioxidant activity test used in this study was ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. According to previous study [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], FRAP assay has been used to evaluate antioxidant activity of various compounds because it is reproducible and linear related to molar concentration of the antioxidants inside the testing samples. Since antioxidant compounds in 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts can produce a color complex with potassium ferricyanide, trichloro acetic acid, and ferric chloride, the increase in absorbance under 700 nm of the reaction mixture indicates the possibility of using these extracts as potential antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The results (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed that the fraction III had the strongest ferric reducing antioxidant power followed by Fractions V and IV, while Fractions I and II exhibited relatively weak ferric reducing antioxidant effects compared with other fractions. Noticeably, fraction III even exhibited higher effect than the standard in high concentration (&gt;40 μg/mL). FRAP IC
 <sub>50</sub> were reported as 9.8 μg/mL for standard, 40.4 μg/mL for Fraction I, 76.9 μg/mL for Fraction II, 8.3 μg/mL for Fraction III, 20.2 μg/mL for Fraction IV and 13.8 μg/mL for Fraction V. Sendi et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10 μg/mL for antioxidant properties of A. 
 <italic>herba-alba</italic> extracts after optimization of extraction conditions. Our values were close to that value, without optimization, and further optimization of extraction might result in even higher antioxidant activity, confirming the superiority of the Soxhlet extraction procedure applied in this study. All the results in this assay were consistent with the results got from DPPH assay. High antioxidant capacity depicted by FRAP value suggests that antioxidants in 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts were capable of donating a single electron or hydrogen atom for reduction. It has been mentioned that FRAP assay creates problems with some antioxidants such as gluthathione [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], as the speed of reaction is not fast enough. However, such compounds were not detected in 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts and thus the FRAP assay can still be used for assessment of antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts.
