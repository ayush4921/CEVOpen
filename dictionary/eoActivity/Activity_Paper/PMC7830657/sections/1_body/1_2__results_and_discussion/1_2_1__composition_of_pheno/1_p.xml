<p>One of the most abundant bioactive components of 
 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> are phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Five fractions were collected after extraction. The fractions I and II were related to ethyl acetate extraction, while the fractions III, IV and V were related to ethanol extraction. 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the composition and content of phenolic compounds in the different fraction parts of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> determined by HPLC-analysis under 280 nm. The composition and content of phenolic compounds were identified by comparing their retention times and peak areas with each standard (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot5-plants-10-00164">Section 3.5</xref>). In Fraction I, one major peak was obtained in the HPLC chromatographic profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00164-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which were identified as hydroquinone on the basis of its standard. In Fraction II, two major peaks were obtained, which were identified as 4-hydroxy benzoic acid and vanillic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00164-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, two phenolic compounds, catechol and quercetin, were obtained in Fraction III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00164-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Three phenolic compounds, gallic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid and cinnamic acid, were found in Fraction IV, while gallic acid, hydroquinone, and thymol were identified in Fraction V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00164-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The remaining phenolic components were present in very trace amounts that could not be extracted or quantified by this method. Based on the result shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the major phenolic compounds in the extract were hydroquinone, 4-hydroxy benzoic, cinnamic acid and thymol. Younsi et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found a total phenolic composition of 27.65 mg GAE/g dry weight, while our results demonstrated about 88 mg/g dry weight of phenolics. Compared with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the content of cinnamic acid could be up to 10.52%, which was consistent with the results of this study. Interesting, thymol, hydroquinone and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid were found at low contents in 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> previously [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which were different from the results of this study. The reason for higher yield in our study, was probably due to the use of Soxhlet apparatus, which can result in high yield of compounds with low solubility. Moreover, low contents of vanillic acid, catechol, quercetin, and gallic acid were also found in the extracts. These phenolics exert antioxidant properties, which could be used to regulate the kinetics of various degradation reactions affecting food quality [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The components herein reported in the 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> were similar to those reported in previous studies of these compounds in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with varying contents on account of the extraction method and origin of plant materials.
