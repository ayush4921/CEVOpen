<p>The antibacterial activity of the combined 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts were tested by direct TLC bioautography assay. 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> describes the retardation factors (R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic>) of the various inhibition zones recorded on the plate. In general, six different inhibition zones were recorded at R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.55, 0.70, and 0.80. For gram positive bacteria, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> recorded three (R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.20, 0.40, 0.70) and five (0.30, 0.40, 0.55, 0.70, 0.80) inhibition zones were recorded respectively. For Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> showed three (0.40, 0.55, 0.70) and one (R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.30) inhibition zones respectively. The antibacterial activity of different fractions of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts were also tested by disc diffusion method against same 4 bacterial strains. Based on the results shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, these five extracts exhibited antibacterial activities against most bacteria. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were inhibited at concentrations of 1.25 μL/mL for Fraction III, 2.5 μL/mL for Fraction IV and V and 5 μL/mL for Fraction I and II. 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> were inhibited at concentrations of 1.25 μL/mL for Fraction I, II and III, 2.5 μL/mL for Fraction IV and 5 μL/mL for Fraction V. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were inhibited at concentrations of 1.25 μL/mL for Fraction II and III, 2.5 μL/mL for Fraction IV and V and 10 μL/mL for Fraction I. 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> were inhibited at concentrations of 1.25 μL/mL for Fraction I, 5 μL/mL for Fraction II, 10 μL/mL for Fraction IV and V and 20 μL/mL for Fraction III. Fraction I could mostly inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> and showed low inhibition effects on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is consistent with the fact that the major compound in this Fraction is hydroquinone, which can inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> efficiently [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is also consistent with the R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.30 inhibition zone visible for B. cereus and P. vulgaris strains on the TLC-bioautography assay. For Fraction II, the inhibition zone of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were more significant than the other two strains, which was also depicted by the inhibition zones at R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.40 and 0.55 for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in the TLC bioautography assay. The reason for the stronger inhibition effects of this Fraction is the presence of the vanillic acid. Previous study showed that it exhibited high antimicrobial effect toward 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, due to the occurrence of quercetin, Fraction III showed the broad antimicrobial effect as it inhibited almost all the strains used in this test except for 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>. This is depicted in the TLC bioautography assay by R
 <italic>
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> = 0.40 and 0.70 in all microbes except 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>. Based on previous study, quercetin can potentially inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, Fraction IV and Fraction V did not show strong inhibition effects on all the strains used in low concentration. When the concentration of these two fractions increased, they also showed potential antimicrobial effects. That is probably because gallic acid was found in both of these fractions, which has been proven to have moderate antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Noticeably, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> is resistant to most of the extracts in this study, except Fraction III. This could be related to its outer membrane nature, which gives it intrinsic resistance to antimicrobials and antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, this is the first study focussed on different extraction fractions of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> using Soxhlet apparatus. On the other hand, it should be emphasized it is possible that some compounds in the extract could give rise to the antibacterial effects by synergistic interactions with other compounds, as most of them contained more than one phenolic compound. Moreover, the disc diffusion assay itself is a test mainly based on the diffusibility and solubility of the sample added. Thus, it must be mentioned that the individual compounds in these fractions must be tested separately before attributing the observed antimicrobial action to any individual compound.
