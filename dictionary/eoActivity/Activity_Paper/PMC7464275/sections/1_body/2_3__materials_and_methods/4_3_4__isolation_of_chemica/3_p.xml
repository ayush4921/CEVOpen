<p>A 60 g portion of Fraction 2 was subjected to column chromatography using Sephadex
 <sup>®</sup> LH-20 (GE Healthcare, Danderyd, Sweden) as the stationary phase. Three fractions, 2a (7.30 g), 2b (20.28 g) and 2c (5.84 g) were obtained following elution with various ratios (9:1; 7:3 and 3:7) of dichloromethane:methanol. Since UPLC-MS analysis revealed that 2a contained the compounds of interest (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 536, 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469), it was further purified on silica gel using mixtures of hexane:ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate:methanol sequentially. The obtained fractions 2a1 and 2a2 were finally purified using targeted prep-HPLC-MS, to yield compounds (

 <italic>m/z</italic> 536, 238 mg) and (
