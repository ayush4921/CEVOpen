<p>The overnight culture of each pathogen was diluted with fresh sterile TSB at a 1:100 ratio to provide an approximate inoculum size of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The inoculum size was estimated by comparing the turbidity of the inoculum visually with a 0.5 McFarland standard solution. A 100 µL volume of the culture was added to each well and the plates which were covered with sterile adhesive film. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (EcoTherm, Hartkirchen, Austria). After incubation, 40 µL of 0.2 mg/mL 
 <italic>p</italic>-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI, USA) was added to the incubated wells. The plates were maintained at ambient temperature for time periods 2–6 h depending on the response time of indicator to bacterial growth of each pathogen Readings were taken once there was change of colour of the culture control (growth of pathogen without inhibitor) to pink. The experiments were carried out in duplicate.
