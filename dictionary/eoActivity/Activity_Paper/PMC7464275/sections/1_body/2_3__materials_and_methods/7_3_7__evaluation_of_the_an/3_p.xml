<p>The serial dilution assay was used to determine the antibacterial activity of each dichloromethane:methanol (1:1) extract as described by Eloff [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with modifications as described by van Vuuren et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cultures were inoculated in Tryptone Soya broth (TSB) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to prepare overnight cultures for the assay. Microplates were aseptically prepared by placing 100 µL sterile broth in each well. Thereafter, 100 µL of the individual test samples (32 or 5.0 mg/mL) was added to the first row of each plate. Serial dilutions were performed by removing 100 μL of the mixed extract and broth from each well and transferring to the well in the next row, resulting in a final volume of 100 µL in each well. Ciprofloxacin (0.01 mg/mL) was used as the positive control, while acetone or DMSO were used as negative controls. A culture control (broth with culture) was included to monitor viability and response time to indicator.
