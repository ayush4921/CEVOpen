<p>Final purification of the compounds was achieved using prep-HPLC-MS comprising an AutoPurification system interfaced with a QDa mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Conditions were optimised to achieve good resolution in a short analysis time. Partially purified fractions from the columns were prepared as 50 mg/mL solutions in methanol (HPLC grade, Merck) and introduced as 250 µL injection volumes. Separation was achieved on an XBridge Prep C
 <sub>18</sub> column (250 mm × 19 mm i.d. 1.7 µm particle size, Waters) maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (Solvent A) and methanol (Solvent B) at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Gradient elution was performed as follows: the initial ratio was 10% B, held for 1 min, changed to 48% B within 1 min, changed to 65% B within 5 min, to 95% B within 5 min, maintaining for 1.5 min, before returning to the initial ratio in 0.5 min. Data were collected using MassLynx 4.1 (Waters, Milford Corp., MA, USA) chromatographic software. A probe temperature of 500 °C and a source temperature of 120 °C were maintained. The capillary and cone voltages were set to 800 and 10 V, respectively. Data were collected over the range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 100 to 750. The eluents containing the target compounds (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 535, 469, 711) were collected as 220 drops/tube (about 2 mL) using a fraction collector. Appropriately combined fractions were concentrated using a centrifugal evaporator (Genevac EZ 2 plus, Ipswic, UK) to yield residues, which were subsequently analysed by UPLC-MS as described.
