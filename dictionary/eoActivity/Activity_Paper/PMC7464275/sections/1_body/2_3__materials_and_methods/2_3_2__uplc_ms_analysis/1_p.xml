<p>The UPLC-MS analysis was carried out using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatographic system with a Micromass–LCT Premier quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QToF-MS) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) and a photodiode array (PDA) detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) detector. An injection volume of 2.0 μL (full-loop injection) was used. Separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC BEH C
 <sub>18</sub> column (150 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA), maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and HPLC grade (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) acetonitrile (Solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Gradient elution was executed as follows: the initial ratio was 10% B for 4 min, changed to 50% B for 6 min, then 95% B in 2.5 min, maintaining for 0.5 min, before returning to the initial ratio in 0.5 min. The system was equilibrated for 2 min prior to the subsequent analysis. Both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes were evaluated, but the positive mode was selected for further sample analysis, since it resulted in a greater abundance of ions and provided information-rich spectra. A blank sample (methanol alone) and quality control (QC) samples (aliquots of all samples combined in one vial) were analysed to establish background peaks and assist with data alignment and instrument precision, respectively.
