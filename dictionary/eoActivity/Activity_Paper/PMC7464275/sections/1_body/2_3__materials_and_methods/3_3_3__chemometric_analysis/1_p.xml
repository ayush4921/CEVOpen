<p>Raw data (114 samples by 763 compounds) matrix obtained from the UPLC-MS analysis were preprocessed using Masslynx software version 4.0 (Waters) and then exported to Microsoft Excel, and subsequently imported into MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (
 <uri xlink:href="www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml</uri>), a free web-based software, designed for high-throughput metabolomic data analysis. Data were filtered (mean intensity) and normalised using quantile normalisation and pareto scaling to construct the best model, as determined from the model statistics obtained. According to the empirical rules based on the type of filtering used, 25% of the compounds were filtered, and the new matrix after data filtering was 114 samples by 572 compounds. A chemometric analysis of the UPLC-MS data was carried out following an untargeted approach using HCA on principal components. Chemotypes of the clusters obtained from HCA were identified by PLS-DA. A biochemometric analysis was carried out by aligning the UPLC-MS data with the antibacterial activities of the crude extracts. The UPLC-MS data were assigned to two classes based on the activities of the crude extracts. UPLC-MS data of extracts with higher activity (MICs &lt; 1 mg/mL) were assigned to Class 1 (active), while UPLC-MS data of extracts with lower activity (MICs â‰¥ 1 mg/mL) were assigned to Class 2 (not active). An S-plot was constructed from the obtained OPLS-DA model to reveal compounds responsible for the separation of the two classes.
