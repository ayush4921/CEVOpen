<p>Flavogallonic acid dilactone (
 <bold>5</bold>) was isolated as a yellow amorphous powder. Two singlet signals at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 7.15 and 7.45 were evident in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03683">Figure S6A</xref>). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR signals were in agreement with literature data [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and, in particular, signals at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 160.3 and 158.8 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03683">Figure S6C</xref>) indicated two lactonised carbonyl carbons. Methyl-flavogallonate (
 <bold>6</bold>) was isolated as a yellow amorphous powder. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral data were similar to those of flavogallonic acid dilactone, but the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03683">Supplementary material Figure S6B</xref>) indicated the presence of an additional methyl group. The compound identity was further confirmed when the fragmentation ions (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 451, 433) obtained from UPLC-MS/MS were compared to literature [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This compound was first isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Terminalia myriocarpa</italic> [
