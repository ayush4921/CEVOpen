<p>During isolation, the major compounds, as well as the active compounds in the antibacterial assay, as revealed through bioassay-guided fraction, were targeted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and are discussed here collectively. The chemical profiles (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03683">Figure S1</xref>) suggested that compounds yielding fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 229 (Rt 2.83 min), 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 3.72 min) and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 4.14 min) were the major constituents of the 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark extract, with the last two as marker compounds responsible for the chemical variations observed in the loadings plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). These three compounds were isolated chromatographically and identified by NMR analysis.
