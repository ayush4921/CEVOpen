<p>The three main branches observed from the dendrogram with localities distributed between the three groups, resulted in the identification of markers for each group. Therefore, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) was carried out to identify the compounds contributing to the clustering observed in the dendrogram. A four-component PLS-DA model was constructed, indicating 89.2% variation with an accuracy of 97.2%. Groups Red (X), Green (Y) and Blue (Z) separated along PC1, with group Red (X) and Green (Y) distributed on the negative PC1 and group Blue (Z) on the positive PC1. In addition, a separation can be observed along PC2 with the Red (X) and Blue (Z) groups mainly distributed on the positive PC2, while all samples from the Green (Y) group are situated on the negative PC2. Variable importance for project (VIP) scores were used to identify the compounds contributing the most to the discrimination observed in the loadings plot (

 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 3.72 min) contributed to the clustering of samples corresponding to group Red (X) of the PLS-DA, while a compound corresponding to the molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 4.14 min) contributed to the clustering of samples in group Blue (Z). The molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 682 (Rt 4.66 min) contributed to the clustering of samples corresponding to group Green (Y). The chemometric analysis indicated that samples from Waterberg district are characterised by higher concentrations of compound 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 3.72 min), while samples from Vhembe district contain a higher concentration of compound 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469 (Rt 4.14 min). Samples in group Red (X) and Blue (Z) contain high concentrations of compound 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 299 (Rt 2.84 min), while samples in group Green (Y) have low concentrations. The chemical variability of the samples is further illustrated by the chemical profiles (

 <italic>T. sericiea</italic> from different geographical locations.
