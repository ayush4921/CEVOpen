<p>A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was conducted from a constructed principal component analysis (PCA) model (plots not shown), characterised by five principal components, which explained 62% of the variation in the data. The HCA was used to investigate the chemical variation (LC-MS data) within the samples. The dendrogram obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) indicated three main branches (X, Y and Z). The first branch X (red) consists of samples from Waterberg (P1, P6) and Mopani (P9) districts. The second branch Y (green) comprises samples from Waterberg (P1) and Vhembe (P3) districts, while samples from Mopani (P4) and Vhembe (P4, P5, P7, P8) districts form the third branch Z. The largest variation was observed for population P9 (samples distributed within the first and third branches), while the least variation was observed for population P3 (second branch). The exact location of samples from P4 is unknown, since the samples were purchased from an informal “
