 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>8</bold> due to insufficient amount yield), crude extract and fractions were tested to determine their antibacterial activities. The crude extract and Fraction 1 displayed moderate activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.29 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, Fraction 2 displayed poor activity at the tested concentrations, and, accordingly, its main constituents, sericoside and resveratrol- 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside, were considered inactive against most of the pathogens. Sericic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>), however, displayed antibacterial activity towards all of the pathogens, except 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, with the lowest MIC value against 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> (0.29 mg/mL) These results encouraged further purification of Fraction 1 to identify compounds responsible for the activities against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> (since sericic acid, the major constituent of Fraction 1 was not active against this pathogen). Compounds displaying antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> were isolated through bioassay-guided fractionation.
