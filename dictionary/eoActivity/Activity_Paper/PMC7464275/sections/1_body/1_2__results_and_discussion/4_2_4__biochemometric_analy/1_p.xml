<p>After establishing the chemical variation within the samples collected from different localities, the next step was to evaluate the effect of this chemical variability by comparing the antibacterial activities of the crude extracts. 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, the most susceptible pathogen to the crude extract, and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, resistant to sericic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>), were considered for this study. Since a good model would involve variability in the antibacterial activities, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> was selected based on the chemical variability of sericic acid in the samples. It was expected that samples with a high sericic acid content would have low activity against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>. Crude extracts of the 42 samples were tested against these pathogens (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and virtually all extracts yielded the same MIC value (1.0 mg/mL) against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>. Samples from P1.2, P1.3, P2.1, P2.2, P3 and P9.5 displayed higher activities (MIC 0.25 mg/mL) towards 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>. The variation in antibacterial activities of the samples against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> demonstrates the importance of evaluating antibacterial activities of plant samples from different localities to account for possible chemical variations. Since there were differences in the MICs obtained for 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, these results were used to conduct a biochemometric analysis to identify the specific compounds (and the combination thereof) that exert activity against this pathogen.
