<p>In the inactive Class 2, samples from population P6 were associated with low concentrations of flavogallonic acid dilactone, sericoside and a compound corresponding to the molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 471 (Rt 1.79 min), but were high in sericic acid and a compound corresponding to the molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 132 (Rt 2.16 min). Both populations displayed low concentrations of flavogallonic acid dilactone, an active compound against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>. Therefore, the variation could not have been due to flavogallonic acid dilactone. Inspection revealed that the activity could be due to 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 765 (Rt 2.19 min), 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 765 (Rt 1.92 min) and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 682 (Rt 4.66 min). However, the retention time of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 682 suggests a saponin similar to sericoside, which was not active. These compounds may not contribute to the variation observed, since the concentrations of these compounds were not high in other samples. It is important to note that population P3 displayed the highest activity (average MIC 0.25 mg/mL) when tested against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> and contained low concentrations of sericic acid and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside, while P6 contained high concentrations of sericic acid. We suggest that the major constituents, though not associated strongly with any of the classes, contributed to the variation observed. This position is further supported by the activities of the extracts against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> that indicated no variation in antibacterial activities, probably since sericic acid was also active along with the other isolated compounds. It is possible that the higher the concentration of the inactive metabolites in the crude extract, the lower the relative proportion of the active compounds, rendering the extract inactive. To confirm the negative contribution of sericoside and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside to the antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark, synergistic studies of the active and non-active compounds are required.
