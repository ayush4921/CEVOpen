<p>A revisit of the chemical profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that compounds present between retention times 1 and 3 min are ellagitannins and lignans, while compounds that eluted between 3 and 6 min are triterpenoids and saponins. Therefore, it can be concluded that active Class 1 samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f003">Figure 3</xref>) contain mainly triterpenes and saponins, while less active Class 2 samples contain mainly ellagitannins and lignans.
