<p>In the heatmap (

 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside (2.84/299) was present in several Class 1 and Class 2 samples in moderate concentrations. Similarly, sericoside (4.14/469) was present in several samples in both classes. The concentration of sericic acid (3.72/469) was very low in many samples of both classes. In general, there was no consistent association between phytochemicals and classes. However, when specific populations in each class were considered, association was established. Samples from population P3 (Class 1) were associated with low concentrations of resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside, flavogallonic acid dilactone (1.80/453), sericic acid and the unidentified compound corresponding to the molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 471 (Rt 1.79 min). However, these samples were associated with moderate concentrations of compounds corresponding to the molecular ions 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 765 (Rt 2.19 min), 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 765 (Rt 1.92 min) and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 682 (Rt 4.66 min).
