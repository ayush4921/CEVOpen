<p>The commercial potential of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> as an anti-infective agent has not been fully exploited due to the lack of adequate standardisation and quality control. This study aimed at exploring the phytochemical and antibacterial activity variation of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark samples, obtained from different districts in the Limpopo Province of South Africa using a metabolomics approach, to isolate the main root bark constituents and to determine their role in the observed activity. Although methods for isolating metabolites from root bark material of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> have previously been reported [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], details on the isolation procedures are not available, making them difficult to replicate. Previous methods involved several solvent partitioning steps, followed by silica gel chromatographic separation, to isolate the aglycones and glycosides, respectively. In this study, we present a direct column chromatography method, bypassing the initial solvent partitioning step, which accelerated the isolation workflow.
