  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram of the ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data (N = 39) obtained from Waterberg, Mopani and Vhembe districts of Limpopo Province. Branch X (red): samples from Waterberg and Mopani; branch Y (green): samples from Waterberg and Vhembe; branch Z (blue): samples from Mopani and Vhembe districts. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of clusters from the dendrogram. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Loadings scores plot obtained from the PLS-DA analysis. Compound indicated by red rectangle contributed to the clustering of the Red (X) group, while compound in blue rectangle contributed to the clustering of the Blue group (Z). These two compounds are the first two variables indicated by the variable importance for project (VIP) plot.
