 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, fourty Swiss albino mice were taken in each test and fasted for 18 h with free access to water. Each test was performed thrice. The mice were divided into eight groups, containing five mice in each group. Group 1 and 2 received two different doses of DrFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 3 and 4 received two doses of CfFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Whereas Group 5 and 6 received two doses of LsFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 7 received standard drug (Glibenclamide at 10 mg/kg body weight). Group 8 was treated with distilled water (10 mL/kg body weight), which served as a negative control. All substances were orally administered. Following a period of 1 h, all mice were orally administered 2.0 g glucose/kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected 120 min after the glucose administration by puncturing the heart. Blood glucose levels were measured by using a glucometer (GlucoLeader™ Enhance, HMD BioMedical Inc., Taiwan).
