<p id="p0085">The total tannin content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent as described previously [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 mL of the samples and the standard was added with 7.5 mL of distilled water. Then 0.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 1.0 mL of 35% sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) solution were added. The total volume was adjusted to 10.0 mL by adding distilled water. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 725 nm in a T60 UV–visible spectrophotometer. The concentration of tannin was expressed as milligrams of Tannic Acid (C
 <sub>76</sub>H
 <sub>52</sub>O
 <sub>46</sub>) Equivalent (mg TAE)/g of extract.
