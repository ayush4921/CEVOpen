<p id="p0080">Total flavonoid content was determined following the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, 0.25 mL of extracts or (+)-catechin standard solution was mixed with 1.25 mL of distilled water, followed by the addition of 0.75 mL of 5% sodium nitrite solution. After 6 min, 0.15 mL of 10% aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) solution was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for a further 5 min and then 0.5 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added. The mixture was brought to 2.5 mL with distilled water and mixed well. The absorbance was measured immediately at 510 nm in a T60 UV–visible spectrophotometer. The concentration of flavonoids was expressed as milligrams of Catechin (C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>14</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>) Equivalent (mg CE)/g of extract.
