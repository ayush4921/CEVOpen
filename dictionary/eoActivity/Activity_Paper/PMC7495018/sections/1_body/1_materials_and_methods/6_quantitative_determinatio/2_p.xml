<p id="p0075">The total phenolic content of the extracts was estimated according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 mL aliquots of extracts and standards were mixed with 2.5 mL deionized water followed by the addition of 0.1 mL (2 N) Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. They were mixed well and allowed to stand for 6 min before 0.5 mL of 20% sodium carbonate (Na

 <sub>3</sub>) solution was added. The color was developed after 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm in a UV–visible spectrophotometer (T60 UV–Visible Spectrophotometer, PG Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom). Total phenolic content was expressed as milligrams of Gallic Acid (C
