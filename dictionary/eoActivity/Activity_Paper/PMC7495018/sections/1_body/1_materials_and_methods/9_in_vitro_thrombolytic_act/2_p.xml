 <italic>In vitro</italic> thrombolytic activity was performed according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the previously weighed Eppendorf tubes, 500 μL of human blood was transferred. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to form the clot. After clot formation, serum was completely removed without disturbing the clot, and each tube having a clot was again weighed to determine the clot weight. A volume of 100 μL of extracts of different concentrations (5 and 10 mg/mL) were added to each Eppendorf tube containing pre-weighed clot. As a positive control, 100 μL of streptokinase and as a negative control, 100 μL of distilled water were separately added to the tubes. All the tubes were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and observed for clot lysis. After incubation, fluid released was removed and tubes were again weighed to observe the difference in weight after clot disruption. The difference obtained in weight taken before and after clot lysis was expressed as the percentage of clot lysis.
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">Percent clot lysis (%)= (Weight of the released clot/ Clot weight) × 100</disp-formula>
