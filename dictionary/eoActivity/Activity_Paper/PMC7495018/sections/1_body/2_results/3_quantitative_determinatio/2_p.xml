<p id="p0145">Quantitative determination was done for total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin content and the results are displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. In these investigations, LsFME was found to be rich in phenolic (418.0 mg/g), flavonoid (50.8 mg/g) and tannin (256.3 mg/g) content. For total phenol content (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), the order of the extracts in terms of higher to lower quantity was LsFME &gt; CfFME &gt; DrFME. For total flavonoid content (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), the order of the extracts in terms of higher to lower quantity was LsFME &gt; DrFME &gt; CfFME. And for total tannin content (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C), the order of the extracts in terms of higher to lower quantity was LsFME &gt; CfFME &gt; DrFME.
