 <italic>In vitro</italic> anthelmintic activity was measured by the ability of extracts to paralyze and kill the experimental worms. The results of anthelmintic activity are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The effects were implicated for five different extract concentrations and it is clear from the result that all the extracts showed anthelmintic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The lowest time for paralysis (2.95 ± 0.13 min) and time of death (3.96 ± 0.05 min) were recorded for LsFME at 50 mg/mL concentration. At 50 mg/mL extract concentration, the CfFME required 3.27 ± 0.13 min to paralyze the worms and 4.46 ± 0.05 min to kill the worms. Besides, the DrFME showed its paralysis effect at 3.55 ± 0.15 min and killing effect at 4.78 ± 0.30 min of extract administration. In contrast, the positive control (Levamisole) paralyzed the worms at 4.26 ± 0.13 min and killed them at 7.15 ± 0.18 min at its 1 mg/mL concentration while there was no sign of paralysis and death in the negative control (distilled water).
