<p id="p0170">Hemolytic activity of different extracts is expressed in percent hemolysis (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The extracts were utilized in five different concentrations and the effects were achieved in a concentration dependent manner. Highest hemolytic activities were found for CfFME at its 1.0 mg/mL (15.21%) and 0.5 mg/mL (9.15%) concentrations followed by LsFME at its 1.0 mg/mL (8.80%) concentration. The IC50 values were obtained as LsFME (366.6 μg/mL) &lt; CfFME (449.1 μg/mL) &lt; DrFME (457.1 μg/mL).
