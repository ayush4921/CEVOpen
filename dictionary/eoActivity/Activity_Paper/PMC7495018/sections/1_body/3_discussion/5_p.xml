<p id="p0205">Parasitic worms are responsible for some of the most widespread chronic human infections. These infestations are more prevalent in underdeveloped areas with poor people where children are more susceptible than adults [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. All the extracts performed very well in terms of anthelmintic activity which suggests their further broad-spectrum analysis with multiple targets. Our current study indicates that LsFME has been found to possess anthelmintic potential in a dose-dependent manner. This activity may be attributed to the presence of a high amount of phytochemicals it possesses. Phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, tannins, phenols, etc. May be responsible for the activity. Alkaloids cause paralysis of worms by acting on the central nervous system (CNS) whereas tannins and polyphenols selectively bind to free proteins present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and eventually cause mortality. On the other hand, the anthelmintic efficacy of saponins is due to its membrane permeabilizing property [
