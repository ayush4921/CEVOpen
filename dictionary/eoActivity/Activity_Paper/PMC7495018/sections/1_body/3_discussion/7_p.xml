<p id="p0215">Compounds with potent biological activity may not be utilized in pharmacological preparations if they showed hemolytic effects. Hemolytic assays, therefore, symbolizes a useful starting point by providing the baseline information on the interaction between bioactive compounds and biological entities at the cellular level. Hemolytic activity displayed by the compounds suggests general cytotoxicity towards normal healthy cells. Also, they indicate potential cytotoxicity [
