<p>AChE is a key of enzyme that plays important roles in cholinergic transmission by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Inhibition of AChE in the cholinergic framework is intimately linked with the therapy of neurodegenerative-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, by inhibiting AChE, the levels of this neurotransmitter can be elevated and thus improve the learning and memory functions. AChE inhibitors can be divided into two categories: reversible and irreversible. In general, reversible inhibitors have therapeutic applications, while irreversible AChE inhibitors are associated with toxicity effects [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The major drugs currently available for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are donepezil, tacrine, eserine, rivastigmine, huperzine A, and galantamine, which have a number of side effects [

Therefore, it would be beneficial to discover other inhibitors of AChE with more selectivity, enhance the bioavailability problems, and produce fewer adverse effects to the AD patients. The finding of inhibitors of AChE from natural products is increasing and proving to be a promising source of useful AChE inhibitors [
