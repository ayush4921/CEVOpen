<p>Three accessions of CA of different characteristics were collected from different geographical localities in Malaysia. These three accessions were denoted as CA-K017, CA-K018, and CA-K019. Matured plants were examined and measured based on morphological characteristics. The morphological characteristics measured were color and leaf margin. All the parameters were recorded in triplicates. The whole plant was washed, cleaned, and oven-dried at 40 Â°C. The powdered plant materials were extracted using 95% denatured alcohol at a room temperature for 72 h. The yields of the extracts were calculated. These extracts were designated as standardized extracts CA (SECA) of SECA-K017, SECA-K018, and SECA-K019. Voucher specimens were prepared and deposited in the Faculty of Applied Sciences, UiTM Shah Alam (Selangor, Malaysia) for future reference.</p>
