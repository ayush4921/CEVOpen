<p>The molecular docking study of triterpene compounds was performed to evaluate the binding interaction mode in the active site of the AChE enzyme (4EY7) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The 3D structures of the triterpenes were drawn with the Chemdraw program and optimized to confirm the potential energy surfaces. The dockings for the set of ligands with the respective enzyme were performed using Autodock 4.2. The 3D model of the AChE enzyme was downloaded from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Databank. Discovery studio 4.5 version (DS, Accelrys Software Inc., USA) was used to perform the process of the removal of water molecules and addition of the missing hydrogen atoms of the AChE enzyme. The highest binding affinity (lowest binding energy) score was selected to explore the binding enzyme–ligand interactions and displayed using the Discovery studio visualization software. Autodock 4.2 was used to dock the AChE enzyme and triterpene compounds (ligands) into the grid box with dimensions of 50 × 50 × 50 Å in the docking option. The best targeted compounds were analyzed according to the binding interactions between ligand and enzyme, such as hydrogen bonding, cation-π, and π-π stacking interactions.
