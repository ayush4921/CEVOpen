<p>In the present study, the detection of four triterpenes in CA was in line with Hashim et al., (2011) where four triterpenes were also present in their CA accessions [

In addition, the phenotype of CA with a smooth leaf had the highest level composition of madecassoside and asiaticoside compared to those with a fringed leaf [

Therefore, there is need for continuous fingerprinting analysis to standardize the herbal plants to promote the development of phyto-drugs or functional foods. This may also improve the yield of active constituents of the plants that will give optimal triterpenes, which can be used as biomarkers.
