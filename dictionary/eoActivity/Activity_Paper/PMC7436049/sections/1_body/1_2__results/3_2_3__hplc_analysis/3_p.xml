It has been reported that a functional moiety in lupine-type triterpenoids has shown a potential effect against neurodegenerative disorders [

In addition, literature supplies numerous reports on the enzyme that can be inhibited by pentacyclic triterpenoids, which reveals the ability of these compounds to easily bind on multiple targets based on hydrophobic interaction with an enzymeâ€™s domain [
