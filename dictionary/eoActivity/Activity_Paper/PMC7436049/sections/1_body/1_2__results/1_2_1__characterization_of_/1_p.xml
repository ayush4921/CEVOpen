<p>The morphological character analysis carried out for the three accessions of CA, namely CA-K017, CA-K018, and CA-K019, in relation to their leaf shape, color, and diameter size is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03353-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It was observed that leaves of both accessions, CA-K017 and CA-K019, were light green while CA-K018 was dark green. The leaf margin of CA was divided into three different groups. These were crenate (surface with rounded edge), crenulate (having a wavy edge), and crenate with dentate base (tooth-shape projection) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accession CA-K017 was found to have a crenate with dentate based leaf margin; meanwhile a crenate with a rounded edge leaf margin was detected in accession CA-K018. However, CA-K019 accession had a crenulate margin. The length of leaf when expressed in centimeters (cm), showed the CA-K018 accession had the longest leaf length, followed by CA-K019 and CA-K017 as shown in
