<p>Four biomarker compounds of CA and three extracts of accessions of CA (SECA-K017, SECA-K018, and SECA-K019), were tested for in vitro AChE inhibitory activity. All samples inhibited AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner. The results expressed as half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values, are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03353-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In our study, the AChE inhibitory activity exhibited by CA accessions could be associated with the content of triterpenes as shown by the HPLC analysis. Asiatic acid and madecassic acid showed a notable AChE inhibitory effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.05 ± 0.06 µg/mL and 17.83 ± 0.05 µg/mL, respectively, lower than the CA accessions and others triterpenes, which corroborates their competitive, selective, and reversible affinity for AChE [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, SECA-K017 and SECA-K018 extracts demonstrated a moderate AChE inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 481.5 ± 0.13 and 763.5 ± 0.16 µg/mL, respectively. The other accession, SECA-K019, did not show AChE inhibitory activity. Therefore, SECA-K017 and SECA-K018 extracts demonstrated inhibitory action against the AChE enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies for the evaluation of different CA accessions on AChE inhibitory activity that have been done.
