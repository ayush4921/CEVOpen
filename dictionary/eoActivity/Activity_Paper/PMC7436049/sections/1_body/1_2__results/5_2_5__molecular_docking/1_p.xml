<p>Molecular docking is a tool to predict the binding interaction of ligands towards targeted proteins as well as giving the binding affinity of small compounds [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In order to confirm the in vitro results and to find out potential residues towards the active site of targeted enzyme, the ligandâ€“enzyme binding interactions between CA active compounds and the AChE enzyme were evaluated using AutoDock 4.2 [
