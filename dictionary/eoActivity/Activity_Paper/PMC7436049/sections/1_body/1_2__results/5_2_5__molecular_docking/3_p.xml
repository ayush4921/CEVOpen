<p>Additionally, the ligand-enzyme binding interactions are stabilized by the presence of hydrophobic alkyl, hydrophobic π-alkyl, and hydrophobic π-sigma interactions with the compounds inside AChE as shown in

According to the molecular interactions shown in the docking analysis, the asiatic acid and madecassic acid that is present in CA may be represented as a potential inhibitor based on its very good interaction due to strong hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
