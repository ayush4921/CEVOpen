<p>The in vitro studies showed that asiatic acid and madecassic acid have the highest inhibitory activity with the lowest binding energy of −10.27 and −8.7 Kcal/mol, respectively, compared with other triterpenes, but lower than eserine against AChE. The docking results obtained for asiatic acid and madecassic acid suggest that the present hydroxyl group at the C-1, C-2, and C-3 position theoretically improves the AChE inhibition of the 4EY7 enzyme. The ligand-enzyme binding interaction representations of the best conformation of the complexed active sites’ interaction of AChE with eserine (a), asiatic acid (b), and madecassic acid (c) are presented in

The molecular interactions between triterpene compounds and active sites of the AChE protein were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions. Tyr337 and Trp86 are the important residues of AChE as these amino acids function to maintain the geometry of the binding gorge and provide electrostatic balance [

Regarding the hydrogen bonding, eserine showed the highest stability due to conventional hydrogen bond interaction with Phe295 (2.51Å), while asiatic acid presented three strong hydrogen bonding interactions with His447 (1.24 Å), Tyr337 (3.72 Å), and Arg296 (1.97 Å) residues. In addition, madecassic acid demonstrated strong hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr341 (4.31 Å), Phe295 (2.64Å), and Arg296 (2.29 Å). The bond lengths of respected interactions between compounds and amino acids were determined (
