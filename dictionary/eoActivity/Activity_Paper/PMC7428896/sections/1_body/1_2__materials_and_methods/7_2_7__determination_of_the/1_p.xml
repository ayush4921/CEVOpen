<p>The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were identified by determining the lowest concentration of antibacterial agent that reduces the viability of the initial bacterial inoculum by ≥99.9%. Here, antibiotic-free nutrient agar plates were inoculated with one loopful of culture taken from each of the first two broth cultures that showed no growth and the first growth-containing tube in the MIC tubes. The MBC plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After the incubation periods, the lowest concentration of each of the extracts that did not produce bacterial growth on the solid medium was regarded as their MBC values. This observation was matched with the MIC test tubes that did not show evidence of growth after 48 h of incubation.</p>
