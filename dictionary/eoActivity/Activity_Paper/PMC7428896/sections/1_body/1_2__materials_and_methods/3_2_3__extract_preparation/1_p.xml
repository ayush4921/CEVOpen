<p>The seeds of sun-dried 
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic> were collected and further air-dried at room temperature before being pulverized in a mill (Christy Lab Mill, Christy and Norris Ltd; Process Engineers, Chelmsford, England) and stored in a sterile air-tight container for further use. To prepare 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract (NHE), 400 g of the pulverized seeds was steeped in 1500 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane for 72 h with shaking (Stuart Scientific Orbital Shaker, UK). To prepare nondefatted methanol extract (NDME), 150 g of the seed powder was steeped in 1000 mL of methanol for 72 h. To prepare defatted methanol extract (DME), the powdered seed material soaked in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was extracted and air-dried for three days before being soaked again in methanol for 72 h. The steeped seed materials in all the solvent were extracted after the soaking period for two other consecutive times. The extracts from each preparation were combined, filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40°C using a rotary evaporator (Laborota 4000–efficient, Heidolph, Germany). Each of the crude extracts collected was dried at room temperature to a constant weight. The resulting crude extracts were stored in desiccators containing silica beads to remove moisture from the extract until used for assay. The extracts were resuspended in each of the extracting solvents to yield a 40 mg/mL stock solution from which different concentrations were prepared for analysis.
