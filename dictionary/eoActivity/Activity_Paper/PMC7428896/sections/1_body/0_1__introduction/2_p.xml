<p>In addition to this, emergence, persistence, and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria or “superbugs” [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have posed a serious global threat of growing concern to treatment of infections. The “superbugs” denoting microorganisms with higher morbidity and mortality rate have increased due to several mutations that resulted in resistance to various classes of antibiotics. This is, on the other hand, due to the use and misuse of antimicrobials, enhanced global migration, increased use of antibiotics in clinics and animal production, selection pressure, poor sanitation, wildlife spread, and poor sewerage disposal system [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In medical arena, the increased antibiotic resistance has become a major threat to public health as effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments has reduced drastically while morbidity, mortality, and health care cost have increased significantly. While the death of the golden era of antibiotics resulted from the inability of researchers to maintain the pace at which antibiotics are discovered in the face of emerging resistant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and persistent failure to develop or discover new antibiotics and nonjudicious use of antibiotics are the predisposing factors associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], there is the need to search for alternative means of treating microbial infections globally as success in treating infectious diseases depends on the discovery of new and more antimicrobial compounds [
