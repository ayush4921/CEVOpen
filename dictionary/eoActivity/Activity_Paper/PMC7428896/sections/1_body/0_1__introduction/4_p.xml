<p>Although various species of the 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic> plants have been used as antidiarrhoea, anti-inflammatory, laxatives, for stomachache management, and as a tonic for sexual stimulation [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], El-Halawany et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] indicated that 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic> plants have antiulcer, antiplasmodial, antinociceptive, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. The phytochemicals obtained from the seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>melegueta</italic> have been used for years in the treatment of infectious diseases, and its grains possess active ingredients that may be exploited for local development of antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The antimicrobial activities have been attributed to the presence of phenols and phenolic compounds in its seeds [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and terpenoids such as aframodial [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Amadi and Wu, [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that the potentials of phenols and terpenoids isolated from 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic> plants have been well documented. Since the seed extracts exhibited antiseptic and bactericidal potentials locally, they play significant roles in treating wounds and in preventing infections [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Though there is dearth of information comparing antibacterial activity of fatted and defatted extracts of this plant, this study aimed at investigating the antibacterial activities of fatted and defatted methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>melegueta</italic> seeds with those of some selected antibiotics widely used against bacterial infections.
