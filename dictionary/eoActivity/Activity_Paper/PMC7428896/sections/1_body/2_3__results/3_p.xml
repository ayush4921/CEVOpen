 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was compared using agar dilution and macrobroth dilution assays based on the fact that the extracts were thoroughly mixed in the respective media while the isolates had a direct contact with the extract in the macrobroth dilution. The agar dilution assay showed that NDME and DME inhibited the isolates at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 10 mg/mL. For the NDME, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442 was inhibited at the MIC of 0.15 mg/mL, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 35654, and 
 <italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides</italic> ATCC 51903 had their MICs at 0.31 mg/mL, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 4352 had its MIC at 0.63 mg/mL, while 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> KZN, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> NCTC 6571, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 10031, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 19582 had their MICs at 5.0 mg/mL. For the DME, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 4352, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442, 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 35654, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides</italic> ATCC 51903 had 0.31 mg/mL as their MICs, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 had an MICs of 0.63 mg/mL, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 19582, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 10031, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> NCTC 6571 had their 5.0 mg/mL as their MICs, while 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> KZN had MICs of 10 mg/mL. In comparison, the MICs and MBCs were obtained from the macrobroth dilution. From the macrobroth dilution, while the MICs of the NDME ranged between 0.15 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs ranged between 0.63 and 5.0 mg/mL, the MICs of the DME ranged between 0.08 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs were between 0.31 and 5.0 mg/mL. The DMEs of the 
 <italic>Aframomum melegueta</italic> was 50% higher in antibacterial activity than those of the NDME.
