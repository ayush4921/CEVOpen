<p>The antibacterial activities of the three extracts including 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract (NHE), nondefatted methanol extract (NDME), and defatted methanol extract (DME) are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The NHE exhibited no antibacterial activity. This showed that the fatty portion of the plant extract had no antibacterial activity. The NDME, on the contrary, was able to inhibit the test isolates at an average level as compared with the DME that showed high potency and a better antibacterial activity against the different isolates. At the highest concentration of 10 mg/mL, NDME produced inhibition zones ranging from 11 to 29 mm, while the isolates were not susceptible at a concentration of 1 mg/mL or less. While DME produced inhibition zones ranging from 20 to 40 mm at the highest concentration of 10 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL of this extract produced inhibition zones ranging from 14 to 20 mm with the exception of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> NCTC 6571 and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>e ATCC 4352 that were resistant. Contrariwise, 0.1 mg/mL of the DME was able to produce inhibition zones ranging between 12 and 14 mm in 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 35654 and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442, respectively. Other isolates were not susceptible to this extract at 0.1 mg/mL.
