<p>Though there is a dearth of information indicating the effects of fatty portion of plant material on the antibacterial activities of varied phytochemicals, there have been several reports on the antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts (NHEs) of some other plants [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. While the NHE of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>melegueta</italic> showed no antibacterial activity against the selected bacterial strains, the antibacterial activities of NDME and DME may be considered significant as Rios and Recio [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] suggested that extracts with MICs of 0.1 mg/mL have significant antibacterial activities but those with MIC greater than 1 mg/mL should be avoided. Fabry et al. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] defined active crude extracts as those having MIC values&lt; 8 mg/mL. Hence, since lower MIC and MBC values indicate higher efficacy [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and phytochemicals are routinely classified as antimicrobials when susceptibility tests had MICs in the range of 0.1–1.0 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the MICs and MBCs of less than 1 mg/mL, in this study, were considered to be of good activity for both NDME and DME.
