<p>Plants have a long history of antibiotic usage for the cure of disease caused by microorganisms. Many extracts from different plants have been tested for their antimicrobial activities, but there are still many plants requiring more careful investigation to reveal their hidden potential(s). While increasingly difficult socioeconomic situations and unavailability of modern medicine at affordable prices have forced tropical and developing countries, recording high rate of infectious diseases, to rely on traditional medicines [
