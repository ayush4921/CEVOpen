<p>Though NDME and DME, respectively, inhibited 60% of the isolates at concentrations ranging between 0.08 and 0.63 mg/mL, DME showed a better antibacterial activity. This is contrary to minimum inhibitory concentration of 31.25 mg/mL against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and that of 1.51 mg/mL against 
 <italic>Enterococcus aerogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] in the previous studies with 
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic>. The difference in the antibacterial activity of NDME and DME could be attributed to the inhibitory effect of the fatty portion of the plant material. Since 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract showed no antibacterial activity and the antibacterial activity of the NDME was lesser than that obtained from the DME, the interaction and presence of the fatty portion of the plant could have resulted in antagonistic interactions with phytochemicals having significant antibacterial activities.
