<p>New antibiotics are urgently needed to combat infectious diseases caused by multiresistant pathogens. Discovery rates of antibiotic compounds have dramatically dropped in the past decades. High costs of drug discovery and development along with frequent rediscovery of known compounds and the rapid emergence of new resistances among pathogens

 </sup> Considering this, innovative approaches to isolate underexplored microorganisms and test their ability to produce antibiotically active compounds emerged. One example is endophytes, microorganisms causing no harm to their plant host while inhabiting their tissues. Endophytic fungi, and particularly those of the phylum
