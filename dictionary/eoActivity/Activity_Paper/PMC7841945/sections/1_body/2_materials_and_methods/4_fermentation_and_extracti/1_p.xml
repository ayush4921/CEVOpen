<p>Rice media contained 10 g of rice (Billa Himalaya Basmatireis organic) supplemented with 25 mL of distilled water and were autoclaved before inoculation. Each isolate was inoculated onto the media in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and left for growing in the dark at 24 °C until fungal hyphae had permeated the entire media plus additionally 7 days. For upscales of the fermentation, the dimensions of flasks, rice, and water remained identical, but the number of flasks was increased. In total, LN303 was inoculated into 20 flasks, LN276 was grown in 5 flasks, and LN528, LN401, and LN427 each in one. During harvest, cultures were transferred to Schott flasks, frozen, lyophilized for 48 h, and subsequently extracted with 100 mL of dichloromethane:methanol (2:1) per rice culture for 1 h at 200 rpm at 28 °C. The extract was aliquoted into 50 mL Falcon tubes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for a minimum of 10 min or until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. The dry matter yield was determined and then re-dissolved using appropriate amounts of methanol.</p>
