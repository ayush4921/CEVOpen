<p>LC–MS analyses were performed on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the ESI source of an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation was carried out on an Acclaim 120 C18, 2.1 × 150 mm, 3 μm HPLC column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using water and acetonitrile, both modified with 0.1% formic acid as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The sample components were separated and eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 95% B in 45 min, followed by an isocratic column cleaning (9.5 min at 95% B) and re-equilibration step (10 min at 5% B). The flow rate was 0.45 mL/min, and the column oven temperature was set to 25 °C. High-resolution ESI-MS (HRESIMS) spectra were recorded in positive and negative ion mode in the range
