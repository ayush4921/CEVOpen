<p>NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 NMR spectrometer (UltraShield) using a 5 mm switchable probe (TCI Prodigy Kryo-probe head, 5 mm, triple resonance-inverse-detection probe head) with 
 <italic>z</italic> axis gradients and automatic tuning and matching accessory (Bruker BioSpin). The resonance frequency for 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR was 500.13 MHz and for 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR 125.75 MHz. All measurements were performed for a solution in fully deuterated chloroform at 298 K. Standard 1D and gradient-enhanced 2D experiments, like double quantum filtered COSY, HSQC, and HMBC, were used as supplied by the manufacturer. Chemical shifts are referenced internally to the residual, nondeuterated solvent signal 
 <sup>1</sup>H (δ 7.26 ppm) and to the carbon signal of chloroform 
 <sup>13</sup>C (δ 77.00 ppm).
