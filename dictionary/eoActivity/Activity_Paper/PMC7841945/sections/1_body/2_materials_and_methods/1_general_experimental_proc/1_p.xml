<p>Analytical HPLC separations were performed with a Shimadzu Prominence system consisting of a CBM-20A system controller, a LC-20A solvent delivery pump, a DGU-20A5 degasser, a SIL-20A autosampler, a CTO-20AC column oven, an SPD-M20A diode array detector, and an FRC-10A fraction collector. For semipreparative HPLC separations, a Shimadzu system consisting of a CBM-20A system controller, two LC-20AR solvent delivery pumps, a DGU-20A3R degasser, a manual injector, an SPD-10Ai UV–Vis detector, and an FRC-10A fraction collector were applied. These systems were equipped with Shim-pack GIS columns (Shimadzu, Nakagyo-ku, Kyo̅to, Japan) of 5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm and 10 μm, 20 × 250 mm. Gradient elution with double-distilled water and ACN (LiChrosolv Reag. Ph Eur, gradient grade for LC, Merck KGaA) at room temperature with a flow of 1 mL/min and 20 mL/min and an injection volume of 10 μL and 2 mL, respectively, was applied. Detection wavelength for fractionation was set to 254 nm.</p>
