<p>Five specimens of 
 <italic>L. nivale</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>alpinum</italic> were harvested at Rax Mountain in Austria on August 8, 2016, and have been identified by Dr. Martina Oberhofer (Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna). A voucher specimen of LN2, the plant that hosted the fungal strain LN303, is deposited at the herbarium of the Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna (LN2080816). After a cooled transport, plants were rinsed under tap water and surface-sterilized using a 0.1% HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> supplemented with 0.1% Tween (400 mL), whereby organ-specific sterilization protocols were applied. While the roots and rhizomes were exposed to HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution for 10 min, more delicate above-ground organs were treated for 5 min. After sterilization, plant parts were rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. 100 μL from the last washing water was plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and tryptic soy agar and incubated overnight to ensure successful sterilization. Plant material was dissected in the sterile bench, and 0.1 g was filled into maceration tubes. 1 mL of 20% sterile glycerol solution was added, and plant material was macerated applying a Precellys24 tissue homogenizer and bead tubes provided by the manufacturer (Bertin Instruments, France). Macerates were then diluted in four consecutive 1:10 dilutions; 100 μL was dispersed on the surface of different nutrient media. Plates were monitored for 3 months, and new colonies were subcultured. 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> sp. was isolated repeatedly. Eleven isolates were each purified with single spore isolation three consecutive times. After pure cultures were obtained, DNA extraction and barcoding was performed using ITS3-LR3 primers (5′-3′GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC; CCGTGTTTCAAGACGGG) for the LSU region, and the resulting sequences were compared to those in the GenBank database (NCBI). Sequences are deposited at GenBank, and accession numbers are represented in

 </sup> Three isolates LN276, LN303, and LN528 originating from the three host plant individuals were chosen for extraction and analyses along with two more isolates LN401 and LN427, both isolated from plant 5.
