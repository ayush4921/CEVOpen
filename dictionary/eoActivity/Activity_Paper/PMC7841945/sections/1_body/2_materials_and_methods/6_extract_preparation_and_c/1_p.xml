<p>The solid upscale extracts of LN303 were dissolved in methanol to concentrations of approx. 100 mg/mL. Samples were pretreated with water prior to semipreparative HPLC analyses. For that purpose, 1 mL of water was added to 1 mL of the extract, and the sample was left for 1 h at room temperature and was then centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5804 R) in order to remove the undissolved parts of the sample. Final sample concentrations were about 1 mg/mL for analytical and 50 mg/mL for semipreparative HPLC. Fractionation of supernatants was conducted on the semipreparative HPLC with a water and ACN gradient (0–10 min: 5–30% ACN; 10–40 min: 30–70% ACN; 40–45 min: 70–95% ACN; 45–85 min: 95% ACN). In total, seven time-depending fractions (fraction 1–7: min 0–7.5, 7.5–17.5, 17.5–25.0, 25.0–32.5, 32.5–40.0, 40.0–60.0, and 60.0–85, respectively) were collected and evaporated to dryness at 40 °C (Heidolph Rotary Evaporator VV2011). Residues were subsequently redissolved in methanol and tested for bioactivity. Fraction 4 (F4) was subfractionated with an optimized gradient (0–5 min: 50–52% ACN; 5–15 min: 52–53% ACN, 15–20 min: 53–95% ACN; 20–25 min: 95% ACN). In total, 11 fractions were collected in 2.5 min steps, whereas the main peaks were collected manually from minute 5.5 to 6.7 corresponding to akanthenin A, minute 9.9 to 10.7 corresponding to emestrin, and minute 15 to 15.8 corresponding to akanthenin B.</p>
