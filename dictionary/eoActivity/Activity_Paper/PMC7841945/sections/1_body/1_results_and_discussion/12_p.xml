 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> did not show any antibiotic activity, while the activities of emestrin (
 <bold>3</bold>) correlated qualitatively with the activity profile of the LN303 total extract. Moreover, our results fit the literature data for emestrin, for which strong antifungal activities and activity against
