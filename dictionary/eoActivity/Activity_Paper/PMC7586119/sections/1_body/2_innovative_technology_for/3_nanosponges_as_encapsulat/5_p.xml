<p id="p0125">Studies have shown that natural products encapsulated in nanosponges yielded better results than with natural products alone (

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Nanosponges have been used as a stable carrier for the encapsulation of various therapeutic agents. Different types of phytochemical bioactive compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, rutin, oryzanol, chlorogenic acid, etc. have been encapsulated in cyclodextrin nanosponges (

 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Ramírez-Ambrosi et al. (2014)</xref> evaluated the efficacy of β-cyclodextrin nanosponges for encapsulation of polyphenols phloridzin, rutin, and chlorogenic acid. The results showed that rutin had an encapsulation efficiency of 83.7 % (which was the highest) using 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole as cross-linker in a 1:3 ratio of nanosponge/cross-linker, while phloridzin (87.2%) and chlorogenic acid (77.5 %), with best results seen with HMDI. 
 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">Radic et al. (2020)</xref> evaluated the influence of olive pomace extracts matrix and cyclodextrins (CDs) on bio-accessibility and intestinal permeability of main olive pomace polyphenols. Their results demonstrated that olive pomace polyphenols were stable during gastrointestinal digestion and encapsulation of olive pomace polyphenol with cyclodextrins significantly increased bioaccessibility of tyrosol by forming inclusion complexes and preventing tyrosol adhesion to bile salts and other macromolecules present in reaction mixtures during simulation of olive pomace extract digestion. Despite the acclaimed pharmacological efficacy, there has been no investigation on cyclodextrin-based nanosponges encapsulation of phytochemicals for applications as biofungicides and nutraceuticals against mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins. Nanosponges may play crucial role in the detoxification of mycotoxins in this era of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) due to their binding and neutralization capacity (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Fliszar-Nyul et al., 2019</xref>). This is because, these cyclodextrin-based nanosponges can reduce toxic effects associated with several microorganisms including mycotoxigenic fungi by binding and neutralising attendant harmful secondary metabolites in the body without leaving any harmful effects.
