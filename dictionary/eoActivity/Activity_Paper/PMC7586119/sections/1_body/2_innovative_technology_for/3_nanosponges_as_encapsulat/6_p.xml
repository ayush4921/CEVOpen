<p id="p0130">Cyclodextrins as nanosponges have been extensively used in a variety of applications, and a new class of them include integrated hydrogel cellulose nanosponges referred to as nanoemulgels that have recently attracted the attention of many scientists in the discovery and development of a variety of drugs. They are polymeric emulsion systems that provide synergistic complimentary properties from nanosponges or nanofibers and hydrogels, thereby reinforcing the overall antifungal activity in the food packaging sector (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Aldawasri et al. (2015)</xref> formulated lemongrass-loaded ethyl cellulose nanosponges with a topical hydrogel that forms a protective coating on the applied surface, whilst the encapsulated lemongrass oil had an enhanced antifungal activity against

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et al. (2020)</xref> developed an effective green packaging technology for food safety and quality of gouda cheese. This technology was based extending the shelf life of gouda cheese using cinnamaldehyde and eugenol essential oils integrated to polyvinylpyrrolidone-carboxymethyl cellulose-bacterial cellulose-guar gum (PVP-CMC-BC-GG) hydrogel film (

 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Moreover, nanoemulgel formulations are ideal within the agricultural sector because they possessed repellent activities against insects. 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Lehtonen et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that addition of hexanal in aerogel extended the shelf life of plant-based products (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., blueberries and cherry tomatoes). The use of nanoemulgels in agriculture is still in its infancy but widely exploited in the medical sector. However, the popularity of nanoemulgels may likely increase as alternative antifungal agents in the agricultural sector. However, before that happens, it is imperative to conduct cycle analysis of any nanoformulation for agricultural applications so as to evaluate their overall ecotoxicology.
