<p id="p0050">Antifungal and anti-mycotoxigenic activities of herbal plants with potential antioxidant properties were investigated against fungal strains that are phytopathogenic, i.e. 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides, A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic>. The results reported potentials of the selected medicinal plants to be used for the discovery of biofungicides that may prevent oxidative related food spoilage (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Fattah et al. (2018)</xref> reported the antioxidant, antifungal and anti-mycotoxigenic potentials of wild stevia extracts against 
 <italic>A. flavus, A. ochraceus, A. niger,</italic> and 
 <italic>F. moniliforme.</italic> Furthermore, essential oils have been found to effectively modulate the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi such as 
 <italic>A. favus, A. oryzae, A. niger, Alternaria alternata, F. moniliforme, F. graminearum, Penicillium citrinum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. viridicatum</italic>, etc., and their associated mycotoxins (

 <italic>Carum carvi L</italic> applied at a concentration from 1.5 μl/g demonstrated complete inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, and likewise 4.5 μL/g exhibited complete inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> as well as the secretion of aflatoxins by the same strain in polenta. Also noted was that a concentration of 35.0 μl/g of 
 <italic>Juniperus communis L.</italic> essential oil showed strong potency against 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> IKB (i.e. by significantly inhibited their growth) with percentage inhibition between 42.4 and 79.8%, while 50.0 μl/g of 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> impeded aflatoxin production by 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> IKB in polenta completely.
