<p id="p0035">Plants have been widely used in folk medicine since time immemorial in order to treat and prevent various ailments from one generation to another (

 <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Street and Prinsloo, 2013</xref>). Despite the advancement made in modern medicine, many populated groups in developing countries still depend on traditional medicine for preventing and treating various ailments. This is due to cultural beliefs, low cost and effectiveness (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ayele, 2018</xref>). According to the World Health Organization (
 <xref rid="bib160" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2001</xref>), approximately 80% of the population of the world still depend on traditional medicine for primary healthcare (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Prakash et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have also created renewed interest in the use of botanicals and their compounds as nutraceuticals in this regard in both developed and developing countries (

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Dikhoba et al., 2019</xref>). The advantage of using plants for drug discovery is due to their abundance in nature and wide distribution geographically. A considerable number of drugs have been synthesized from plants based on their use in traditional medicine (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2012</xref>). Africa is richly endowed with a wealth of medicinal plants. However, very few studies have looked into exploiting their constituents for mycotoxin detoxification (
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Stoev et al., 2019</xref>; Makhuvele et al. unpublished data), and thus necessitate studies in this regard. The following sections provide an overview of various botanicals that exhibit antifungal activities. In addition, we also follow a nanoencapsulation approach through the fabrication and use of nanosponges to improve the stability from oxidation/degradation, availability, and demonstrate the most pronounced efficacy of botanicals.
