<p id="p0040">Plants produce secondary metabolites as a defence mechanism against pathogenic microorganisms, insects and adverse environmental conditions. These metabolites are known as phytochemicals, which are non-nutritive (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Prakash et al., 2020</xref>) and to some extent essential oils. However, they can protect humans and animals against certain diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins associated with them due to the antimicrobial properties they possess (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Alabi et al., 2011</xref>). There are various major groups of phytochemical compounds discovered to date and differ according to their chemical structures (
 <xref rid="bib171" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2020</xref>). These major groups include phenolic compounds, flavonoids, phytosterols, carotenoids, tocols, terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, aromatic acids, glucosinolates, carotenoids, essential oils, chlorophyll and organic acids as well as proteases inhibitors (

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Loi et al., 2020</xref>). Such compounds may act directly or indirectly to protect against ailments or pathogens, because they contain antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant properties (
