<p id="p0100">The nanoencapsulation (e.g. nanoemulsion, nanofibre, nanogel, nanoliposome, nanoparticle, nanotube, and nanosponge) coupled with phytochemicals provides promising avenues to explore possible strategies for enhancing efficacy and combating fungal resistance where conventional antifungal drugs prove to be ineffective (

 <xref rid="bib170" ref-type="bibr">Powers et al. (2019)</xref> emphasized on the priority and importance of big data approaches for expediting the identification of active components. They utilized a huge data to evaluate antifungal activity of 82 essential oils against

 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The results obtained demonstrated that antifungal susceptibility to the essential oils was as follows: 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>A. Niger.</italic> However, the use of phytochemical compounds alone limits their full applications. This limitation is due to their instability, insolubility, high volatility, low bioavailability, ability to change organoleptic characteristics of food/feed, and limited of facilities and resources for their extraction and purification (

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Loi et al., 2020</xref>). To overcome these factors, cohesive research collaborations between academics, research institutions, government agencies, food and pharmacological industries, as well as international stakeholders are required. In addition, different emerging technologies such as nanotechnology can, in part, provide solutions to encounter some of these limitations (
