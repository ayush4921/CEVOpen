<p id="p0010">Food and feed contamination by toxigenic fungi is of serious health concern and has been recorded since mankind initiated the cultivation and storage of agricultural commodities. These toxigenic fungi belong mainly to the genera 
 <italic>Aspergillus, Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic>Claviceps, Penicillium, Stachybotrys,</italic> and 
 <italic>Altenaria,</italic> etc. They produce toxic substances, some of which are referred to as mycotoxins. Cumulative evidence from the literature suggest that these mycotoxins do not present any apparent biochemical importance in fungal development or growth. However some secondary metabolites play a role in virulence, development and pathogenicity (

 <xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">Venkatesh and Keller, 2019</xref>). Mycotoxins have adverse effects on humans and animals even at low concentrations (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Adekoya et al., 2019</xref>), and the proliferation of toxigenic fungi on food and feed is always favoured by certain environmental factors such as humidity and temperature, as well as certain biotic conditions (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> substrate composition). High incidences of mycotoxin occurrence are usually reported in tropical regions such as Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where conditions for their proliferation are optimal. Mycotoxins contaminate mainly commodities such as cereals, grains, nuts, and their by-products during production, pre-harvest and post-harvest (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Gbashi et al., 2019</xref>). These toxins often enter the body mainly via ingestion, as well as by inhalation, parental and dermal exposure routes. The toxins can also enter the food chain through infected crops which are consumed either directly or indirectly by humans or animals as feed sources. As such, they appear in meat, milk and eggs (
