<p id="Par3">Plants have always played a significant role as an ideal resource to generate traditional medicines. About 21000 plants around the world were enlisted by WHO to be used for the medicinal objective and nearly around 800 plants have been specified for antidiabetic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among them, 150 species have received large scientific and medical attention in commercial arena [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. India, being recognized as botanical garden of the world is the biggest producer of such herbal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Presence of the components like glycosides, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, carotenoids in such medicinal plants are highly effective to trigger function of pancreatic tissues to enhance the production of insulin or to prohibit intestinal adsorption of glucose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therapeutic potential of different important plant extracts were evaluated through experimental trials using various animal models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among all such herbal plants, 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> is very popular and has been well recognized mainly for its anti-hyperglycemic activities. The genus 
 <italic>Swertia</italic> which belongs to family Gentianaceae, has approximately 135 species with herbal remedial properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Among them, 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic>, popularly known as “
 <italic>chirayata</italic> or 
 <italic>chirayita</italic>”, is considered to have diverse therapeutic properties, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, wound healing, antipyretic, antihelmintic, antioxidant and antitussive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Large number of publications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in the research field clearly suggests the increasing importance and application of such important medicinal plant in various therapeutic fields. Brahmachari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] clearly indicated 
 <italic>Swertia</italic> genus as a rich sources of xanthones, flavonoids, irridoid, terpenoids and alkaloids. Bhattacharya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] specified the presence of twenty precious polyhydroxylated xanthones in such plant extract. Hypoglycemic effects of extracts, developed from various parts of this plant like bark, leaf, shoot, root, and even entire plant were experimentally evaluated by large number of researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In individual research investigations, Thomson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Kavitha and Dattatri, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] emphasized the therapeutic potential of aqueous extract of the species whereas Sekar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Alam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] specifically highlighted the importance of ethanoic extract of the plant for exploitation of its antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. Similarly, anti-carcinogenic, antimicrobial, antihelmintic, antimalarial, anti-hepatitis, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of plant extract, formulated from different parts of the plant were experimentally determined by different researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
