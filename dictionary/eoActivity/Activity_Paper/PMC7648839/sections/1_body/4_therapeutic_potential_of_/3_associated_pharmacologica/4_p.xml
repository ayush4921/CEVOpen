<p id="Par14">Several researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] also investigated the efficiencies of plant derivatives for antimalarial activity. Banerjee et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] clearly indicated that xanthones present in the plant extract is mainly reasonable for such antimalarial activity. Bhat and Surolia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], examined the organic and aqueous solvent extracts of three plants including 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> for antimicrobial activity and also against malaria, caused by 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> FCK 2. The plant extracts were evaluated in terms of its antimalarial activity on thin blood smears followed by using [35S]-methionine incorporation into parasite proteins and the activity levels in terms of inhibition was quantified as 50% (IC50). The result obtained in their study with [35S]-methionine incorporation clearly suggests that plant extracts having potent antimalarial activity. They also concluded that purer compounds isolated from plant extract having potential antimalarial activity compared to crude plant extracts. Similarly the plant extract was evaluated for its anti-carcinogenic and cytotoxic activities. Saha et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] made their effort towards identifying compounds which can able to give protection against cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic activities of environmental toxicants in order to prevent the overall risk for cancer. For that, they have investigated anticarcinogenic activity of 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> Buch on DMBA imposed mouse skin carcinogenic model. The extract of the plant was purified to enrich with 'Amarogentin' and tested for the specific activity. Effects like inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis were apparent from both crude and purified form of the plant extracts. Parallelly, in order to identify the cytotoxic effects, Gopalkrishna et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] clearly studied antiviral activity of the same plant extract specifically to develop protection against herpes simplex viruses. In diluted condition (1:64), the crude plant extract suppressed HSV-1, formation of plaque at higher level of 70% and the effect was confirmed by HSV antigen expression and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) test.
