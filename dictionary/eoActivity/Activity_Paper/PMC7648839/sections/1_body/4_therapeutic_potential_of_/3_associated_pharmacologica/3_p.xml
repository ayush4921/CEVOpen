<p id="Par13">Das et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] evaluated analgesic as well as anti-inflammatory property of ethanolic plant root extract by pharmacological screening of rat paw edema model, induced by carrageenan. Writhing test based on acetic acid induction and radiant heat tail-flick methods were implemented to determine analgesic property. Extract was effective enough to lower the development of edema with doses level 400 mg/kg while resulting 57.81% inhibition of edema volume after 3 h. The experimental investigations clearly suggest that the plant is also having analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Banerjee et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] used acute, sub-acute and chronic male albino rat experimental models to evaluate xanthone derivative (1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxy xanthone) from 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> extract against inflammation. They concluded that activity of the plant derivative is relatively comparable to the standard drug diclofenac in terms of anti-inflammatory activity. Alam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] investigated analgesic activity of ethanolic and methanolic extract of various plant parts like leaf, stem using acetic acid induced mice model. Findings from such investigation clearly suggest that ethanolic extract from leaf and stem part of the plant showed reasonable writhing inhibition (p &lt; 0.001).
