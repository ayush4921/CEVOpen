<p id="Par11">Apart from diabetics, the plant extract is well known for its hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antihelmintic, anticarcinogenic, antiviral, cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties. Different types of paracetamol and galactosamine models have been implemented to analyze the hepatoprotective properties of 
 <italic>S. chirayita</italic> plant extract. Nagalekshmi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] analyzed how the plant extracts develop safety to defend acute hepatotoxicity, imposed by paracetamol dosages of 150 (mg/kg) on Swiss albino mice. Significant protection against paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity was developed with oral feeding of specific doses (100–200 mg/kg) of 
 <italic>S. chirayita</italic> extract. Similarly Karan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] observed methanol extracted plant derivatives with dosages 100 mg/kg body weight of experimental animals was effective to develop 81% and 78% protection against paracetamol and galactosamine induced toxicities respectively. Balasundari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] identified that plant extract works specifically against paracetamol induced toxicity in initial single-layer cultures of rat hepatocytes. Zhou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] specifically identified twenty-six isolated compounds from 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> ethanolic extract and every such compound were analyzed in vitro condition to develop protection against hepatitis B 17 virus using HepG 2.2.15 cell lines. Researchers also analyzed the hepatoprotective property developed through the treatment of such plant extract is also linked with its antioxidant property.
