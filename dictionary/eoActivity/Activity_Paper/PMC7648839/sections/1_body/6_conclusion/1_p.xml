<p id="Par18">Pharmacological importance of medicinal herb, 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> is growing day by day due to its valuable phytochemical constituents. Its beneficial effects have largely been extended for management of diabetics and several other associated disorders. Although, the lack of sufficient evidence on safety assessment mainly hinders its large scale commercial applications on humans. Still large numbers of toxicological and histopathological studies are needed to be performed in order to understand its mechanism and standardize the plant product against human ailments. Conservation of such endangered plant species is another biggest concern as increasing national and international demand comes up with illegal overharvesting and unscrupulous collection of such wild plant species which finally leads to drastic depletion of the plant populations. Adaptation of some advanced plant biotechnological techniques like micro-propagation, hairy root technologies and synthetic seed production can help in surplus supply of such plant species to meet its future demand.
