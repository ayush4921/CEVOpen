<p>To evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the SF extracts in cell culture, the DCFDA/H2DCFDA–Cellular ROS Assay (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was employed. SH-SY5Y cells were plated at the density of 25,000 cells per well in black, clear-bottomed 96-well plates. The next day, cells were incubated with 20

 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) for 4 hours. DCFDA is a nonfluorescent probe that is oxidized in the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of ROS [
