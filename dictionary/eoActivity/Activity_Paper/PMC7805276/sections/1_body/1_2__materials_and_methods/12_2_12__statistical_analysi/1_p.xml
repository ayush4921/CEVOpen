<p>Results are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) or means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of 
 <italic>n</italic> replicates. Statistical significance to compare cell viability differences between control cells and cells treated with the SF extracts, as well as between cells treated with A
 <italic>β</italic> peptides and cells treated with both A
 <italic>β</italic> peptides and SF extracts, was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. The same analysis determined statistically significant DCF fluorescence differences between cells treated with TBHP and cells treated with TBHP and SF extracts. The level of statistical significance was 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
