<p>The Institute of Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources (IPB&amp;GR) of the Hellenic Agricultural Organization “Demeter” provided the SF plant material. The plant populations were cultivated at the experimental field of IPB&amp;GR (40°34'35”N, 21°57'19”E), with the following soil properties: soil type: red loam, pH 7.73, clay: 39.0, organic matter: 1.43%, P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>: 45 ppm, and K
 <sub>2</sub>O: 520 ppm. Mild winters, warm springs, and humid summers characterize the weather at the experimental site. A plant taxonomist conducted the plants identification, while the plants were selected according to their phenotypic and agronomic characteristics, with confirmed genetic material. SF aerial parts were collected prior to blooming, air-dried in the shade before use, and packed in tightly closed containers. The collection process followed the international bioethics guidelines. A voucher specimen was deposited, under the code no. 1215-SlvfELGO, in the Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Department of Life and Health Sciences, School of Sciences and Engineering, University of Nicosia, for future reference.
