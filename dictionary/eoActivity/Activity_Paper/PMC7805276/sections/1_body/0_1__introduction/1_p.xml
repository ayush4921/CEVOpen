<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder with a prevalence of 5% among individuals over 65 years old, increasing to 30% among those over 85 years old. It is the commonest form of dementia, as well as the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and is dramatically affecting cognitive and behavioural skills [

One of the main contributing factors to AD's progression is the presence of oxidative stress, i.e., a disturbance in the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, in favour of the oxidants. This phenomenon promotes the generation of damaging accumulates of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to the accumulation of the neurotoxic extracellular amyloid beta (A
