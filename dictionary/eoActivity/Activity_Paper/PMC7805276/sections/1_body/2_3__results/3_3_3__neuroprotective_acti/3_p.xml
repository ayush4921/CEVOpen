<p>A similar pattern was observed for the SFD extract (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL partly rescued cell viability to ∼69% with statistical significance. A trend for rescue was recorded at 50 and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of SFD. It should be noted that while treatment with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL SFD extract reduced cell viability in normal cells, it increased cell viability in cells treated with the neurotoxic A

 <sub>25–35</sub>, revealing a struggle between the neuroprotective capability and the cytotoxic effect of SFD extract. In the smaller, nontoxic concentration of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, the SFD extract exhibits the maximum neuroprotective potential and shows no signs of cytotoxicity.
