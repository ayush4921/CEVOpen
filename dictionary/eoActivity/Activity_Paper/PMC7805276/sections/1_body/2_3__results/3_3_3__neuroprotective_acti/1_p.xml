<p>For the better evaluation of the possible application of SF extracts in AD treatment, their neuroprotective activity was assessed. This took place in SH-SY5Y cells, and initially, the cytotoxic effect of the extracts on these cells was evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The results showed that treatment with SF extracts in high concentrations (SFM extract ≥ 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, SFP extract ≥ 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and SFD extract ≥ 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) reduced cell viability. Conversely, at the concentrations of 20 and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, the SFP extract had a statistically significant effect on improving cell viability (1.38- and 1.22-fold, resp., in comparison to control cells). A 1.27-fold increase in cell viability was also observed upon treating with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL SFD. At 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL SFD treatment, there was an obvious trend for cell viability increase, which however was not statistically significant.
