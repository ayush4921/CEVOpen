<p>The values obtained from the assays for the determination of the total phenolic and the total flavonoid content revealed that these contents varied in range between the SF extracts, due to the usage of the different solvents used for the extraction of the chemical compounds. The SFM extract had the highest content of phenolics and flavonoids, while the SFD had the lowest. Overall, the values obtained for the determination of the TPC and the TFC revealed a high yield of phenolics and flavonoids, due to the possible presence of rosmarinic acid, carnosol, apigenin, and luteolin, that have been previously identified as the most abundant constituents of SF extracts from the experimental field that our material is originating from [
