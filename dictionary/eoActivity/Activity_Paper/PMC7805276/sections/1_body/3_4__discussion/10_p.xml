<p>Oxidative stress is involved in the progression of the commonest neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In AD, increased oxidative stress promotes the generation of senile plaques formed by A
 <italic>β</italic> peptides, and these plaques contribute to further elevation of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, a holistic approach to treat AD needs to focus on both antioxidant and neuroprotective aspects, and medicinal remedies that combine these properties may be considered more advantageous. Based on this assumption, between the three extracts of the current study, the most promising for AD treatment are the SFD and the SFP extracts that combine an important antioxidant potential and a significant neuroprotective activity against A
 <italic>β</italic> toxicity. Nevertheless, SFM can also be of medicinal use for its antioxidant capacity, while there is always the possibility of developing a mixture of several extracts to capitalize on all the benefits that different SF extracts have.
