<p>The FRAP assay results showed that SFM possesses the greatest antiradical activity and SFD is the weakest antioxidant; thus, FRAP followed a trend similar to that of TPC and TFC. Additionally, the DCFDA assay conducted in cells, corresponded with the FRAP/TPC/TFC results, in showing the SFM extract to possess the highest ROS scavenging ability. The DCFDA assay demonstrated that SFD and SFP exhibit a considerable antioxidant capacity as well. The superiority of SFM extract in terms of antioxidant capacity, as well as the similar trend of TPC/TFC and FRAP assay results, is in agreement with previously published findings [

 <sup>•</sup> results, since DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay showed the SFD extract to possess the strongest antioxidant activity, followed by the SFM and then by the SFP extract. This discordance of TPC/TFC and DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> in 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> has been also reported in a previous work, where the highest DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> scavenging ability of the chloroform extract corresponded to the lowest TPC, in comparison to the other extracts of that study [
