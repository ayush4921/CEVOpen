 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, this study used cultivated plants with superior phenotypic and agronomic characteristics, instead of native plants that show large variations in morphological features and phytochemical components, thus affecting polyphenolic composition. Moreover, taking into account that the quality of plant material depends on its phytochemical content, which is largely affected by intrinsic and external parameters, cultivation provides the standardization of the starting plant material of constant high quality, ensuring high yields of the desired constituents [
