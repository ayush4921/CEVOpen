<p id="p0145">Regarding the antifungal pathogens, 
 <italic>V. amygdalina, C. macrostachyes</italic> and 
 <italic>E. globules</italic> honeys showed relatively stronger potency in inhibiting the growth of the tested human fungal pathogens at an average MIC (v/v%) of 16.8 ± 0.37, 20.2 ± 0.63 and 24.0 ± 0.27 respectively. The study indicated that fungi were less susceptible than bacteria. The less susceptibility of fungi to different honey samples than bacteria were also reported (
