<p id="p0160">The presence of significant variations in medicinal properties among the different botanical origin honeys are well established (

 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2010</xref>). In this regard the variations in antimicrobial potencies among the different honeys reported to be more than 100-folds, which is attributed to their botanical and geographical origins (
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Molan and Cooper, 2000</xref>). The difference in levels of antimicrobial activities and the functional properties in human health promotion among the different honeys have been associated to their floral source, geographical location, climatic conditions and the plant bio and chemo-types (

 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Molan, 1992b</xref>). Moreover, the more antimicrobial properties of some of the honeys could be due to their higher phenolic content and antioxidant properties. The strong relations of antimicrobial properties of honeys with their antioxidant properties and phenolic contents well discussed (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Isla et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly phenolic compounds are believed to defend against diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders and, neurodegenerative diseases by cleaning up potentially damaging free radicals occurring in our body (
