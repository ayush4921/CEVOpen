<p>Pharmaceutical law adopted in 2001 [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-08751" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] stated that the concession to operate a community pharmacy may be obtained only by a pharmacist and that one pharmacist could have only one concession. A year later, the regulations were liberalized, allowing any person or company to open a pharmacy. It was possible to run many pharmacies, but a maximum of 10% of pharmacies in Poland. This situation has led to the formation of many so-called chain pharmacies that were not owned by pharmacists. Ten percent limit ownership was the first anti-concentration limit in the Polish pharmaceutical law. In 2004, with Polandâ€™s accession to the European Union, the anti-concentration limit was changed from 10% pharmacies in the country up to 1% pharmacies in the province.
