<p>The profitability of a pharmacy depends on three parameters: the number of patients per pharmacy, the amount of expenditures on drugs per patient, as well as the pharmacy’s margins. The latter is partly regulated (via drug reimbursements) by law. The pharmacy’s income is also affected by other factors, such as the location, factual and friendly staff, epidemiology, etc. The average turnover of a typical pharmacy in Poland is very low compared to other EU countries. This is mainly due to two reasons: the average drug expenditure per inhabitant of Poland is among the lowest in Europe, and the number of inhabitants per pharmacy is relatively small. In 2018, pharmacies achieved a total turnover of PLN 34.5 billion. Individual pharmacies generated a total turnover of approx. PLN 14.2 billion (41.1% of the market value), i.e., on average approximately 144,000 PLN per month per pharmacy. At the same time, chain pharmacies generated a turnover of approximately PLN 20.3 billion (58.9% of the market value), an average of 273,500 PLN per month per pharmacy [
