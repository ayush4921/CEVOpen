<p>In 2012, the reimbursement act resulted in an increase in patients’ co-payment for prescription drugs (reimbursed and non-reimbursed) by as much as 5.2 percentage points (from 52.5% to 57.7%), and in the case of reimbursed drugs alone, by 2 percentage points (from 36.7% in 2011 to 38.7% in 2012). In the first quarter of 2013, the co-payment of patients for reimbursed drugs increased to 40.3%. In 2013–2019, the Ministry of Health’s reimbursement policy placed particular emphasis on reducing the prices of drugs covered by pharmacy reimbursement, which translated into price pressure on drug manufacturers related to the frequent publication of reimbursement lists and lowering prices of subsequent generic drugs entering the lists. Market conditions also resulted in a significant drop in the wholesale margin for reimbursed medications during this period. According to PharmaExpert, in 2011 the share of reimbursed drugs accounted for 45% of pharmacy turnover, systematically falling. All these factors ultimately led to a lower level of patient co-payment for reimbursed drugs. Currently, the co-payment of Polish patients for reimbursed drugs is around 27–28%, while the co-payment level for all prescription drugs, according to IQVIA is still very high and amounts to 55.6% [
