<p id="Par36">CCL1 cells treated for 24 h with the NADES solvents and extracts were fixed in 100% ice-cold ethanol and stored at − 20 °C overnight. The cell pellets were washed twice with 1xPBS (2.68 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.37 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>), pH 7. Incubation with RNase A (100 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C followed. Before FACS analysis the cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml) for 20 min at dark. FACS analysis was performed by a BD FACSCanto apparatus and the results were analyzed by FlowJo software V10.
