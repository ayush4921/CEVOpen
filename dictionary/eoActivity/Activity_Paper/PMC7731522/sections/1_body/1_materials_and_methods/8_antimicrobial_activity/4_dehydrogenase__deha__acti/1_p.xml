<p id="Par32">The DEHA activity of the test microorganisms was assessed by MTT-test (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, M2128-1G, Sigma-Aldrich). The method is based on the reduction of the MTT dye by the membrane located bacterial enzyme NADH: ubiquinone reductase (H+-translocation) to insoluble formazan crystals. Briefly, the treated and untreated bacterial, respectively fungal cells, were incubated for 2 h with MTT dye in a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. An equivalent volume of 5% HCOOH in isopropanol dissolved the formed crystals. Absorption was measured using ELISA reader (BioTek Elx800, USA) at 550 nm (reference 690 nm) against a blank solution.</p>
