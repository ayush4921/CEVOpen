<p id="Par41">Recently, it became clear that NADES components can be selected not only to fine-tune solvent physicochemical characteristics but also to improve the biological activity of dissolved active compounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. That is why we decided to check the antimicrobial activity of the extracts, and to compare the results with the activity of ethanol extracts, based on total phenolics concentration. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of total phenolics in the extracts were measured. In addition, the metabolic activity of the microorganisms after the treatment was studied by measuring the dehydrogenase activity (DEHA) with the MTT test. The results of these tests are shown in Table
