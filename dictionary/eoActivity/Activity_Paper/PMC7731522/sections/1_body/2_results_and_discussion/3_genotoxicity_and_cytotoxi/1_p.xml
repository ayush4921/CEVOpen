<p id="Par44">Any further implication of the tested four NADES in the practice requires proofs for their genotoxicity safety. Many data in the literature show the genotoxicity of a broad range of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical additives regardless of their nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Some data point to the fact that these substances added to the products consumed by or applied on people exert their genotoxicity at allowed concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This unambiguously entails the application of sensitive tests for fast and accurate evaluation of the potential of any substance that is planned to be implicated in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic practices to induce general cytotoxicity via inhibiting cell proliferation and/or damage in DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The method of Comet Assay is a brilliant technology for fast and sensitive analysis of genotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; it requires single cells, is fast and with high precision evaluates all kinds of DNA damages. Data quantification allows precise estimation of genotoxicity. In this study, the tested NADES solvents and the extracts which demonstrated antimicrobial activity: the extracts with XXGly and CAPD of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. major</italic>, were tested for their genotoxicity. The preparation for this test first required the evaluation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of the tested substances. Therefore, the in vitro cytotoxicity of the NADESs and extracts was determined on the normal mouse fibroblast cell line CCL-1 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) for two exposure times—24 and 72 h. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values calculated after 24 h exposure time were used for performing the genotoxicity assay. The calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of all tested samples are given in Table
