<p id="Par48">These NADES probes demonstrated a lack of genotoxicity at all tested concentrations. Conserning the detected genotoxicity the NADES solvents can be classified in a row showing an increase in genotoxicity with an increase in the tested concentrations of the compounds. The NADES solvents and extracts are listed in the direction left to right, which marks increased genotoxicity. The NADES solvents are arranged as follows: CAPD &lt; XXGIH &lt; XXPD &lt; XXGly. The extracts can be classified like this: CAPD/P &lt; XXGly/P &lt; XXGly/S &lt; CAPD/S.</p>
