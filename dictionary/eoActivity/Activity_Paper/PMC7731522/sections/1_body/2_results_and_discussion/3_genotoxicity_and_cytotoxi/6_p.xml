<p id="Par49">Generally, all tested NADES revealed little changes in the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle after treatment for 24 h with increasing concentrations. The closer look at the graph in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a shows that XXGIH at all tested concentrations, most explicitly at ½ and ¼IC
 <sub>50</sub> demonstrated decrease in the population of cells in G0/G1, suggesting a slight cytostatic effect. CCL1 cells treated with CAPD/S applied at IC
 <sub>50</sub>, and CAPD/P at all tested concentrations, especially at ¼IC
 <sub>50</sub> showed fewer cells in G0/G1. These results correspond with the detected genotoxicity in the samples. The detected genotoxicity led to moderate cytostatic effect on the CCL1 cells.
