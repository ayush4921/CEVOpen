<p id="Par45">As visible from the median inhibitory concentrations in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the solvent XXGly was less cytotoxic than CAPD. The same trend was observed for the relevant extracts. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of the solvents XXGly, CAPD and XXGIH diminished with time and was less pronounced after 72 h of exposure than after 24 h. All extracts showed dose and time dependent cytotoxicity. The XXGly/
 <italic>S</italic> extract exhibited more potent antiproliferative effect on mouse fibroblasts than XXGly/
 <italic>P</italic> and was more cytotoxic to the cells than the solvent itself in both exposure periods. The cytotoxicity of XXGly/P was more pronounced than that of the solvent after the longer exposure period (72 h). CAPD/S showed a twofold higher antiproliferative effect on the cells after 24 h of exposure than CAPD. However, after 72 h the effect of CAPD/
 <italic>S</italic> diminished slightly compared to that of the solvent at the first incubation period. The cytotoxicity of the CAPD/
 <italic>P</italic> extract was time-dependent and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were significantly lower than those of the pure solvent, especially after long exposure time. Considering the MIC values determined by the BMD assay, it can be seen that CAPD/
 <italic>P</italic> exhibited anti-staphylococcal and anti-fungal activities at concentrations 3.9 and 1.99 µg/ml tP, respectively, that are significantly lower than the median inhibitory concentration cytotoxic for normal mouse fibroblasts (IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h = 4.6 µg/ml tP).
