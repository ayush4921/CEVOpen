<p id="Par40">The results demonstrated that some of the NADES extracted more bioactive compounds than the classic water-alcohol mixture. The water-containing NADES XXGlH was the most effective one, it extracted more phenolics and more flavonoids from the mountain tea that 70% ethanol. In the case of plantain phenolics XXGlH was again the most effective solvent: it extracted 25% more phenolics, compared to the reference solvent. However, none of the four NADES extracted flavonoids from plantain more efficiently than the 70% ethanol. This difference could be explained considering the specific chemical structures of flavonoids in the two medicinal plants. In

 <italic>P. major </italic>are flavone monoglycosides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which are less polar than diglycosides. As the chosen NADESs have polarities higher than 70% ethanol, the better extraction of more polar flavonoid diglycosides can be explained by this fact, at least to some extent.
