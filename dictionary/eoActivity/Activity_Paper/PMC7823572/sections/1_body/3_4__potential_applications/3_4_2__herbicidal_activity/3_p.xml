<p>The harmlessness of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil for food crops, a great challenger in the search for natural herbicides, has been corroborated by other authors. For instance, Prakash et al. confirmed that it did not affect the germination of chickpea seeds. The mean length of both hypocotyl and radicle were not significantly reduced after three days of exposure to the essential oil regarding control (3.65 and 0.82 cm 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 3.75 and 0.93 cm, respectively). Only its combination with 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> essential oils showed certain phytotoxicity against the seeds, probably due to the activity of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> [

 <italic>Curcuma</italic> have shown phytotoxic actions against food crops. For instance, 
 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> essential oil with a predominance of oxygenated compounds (18.20% 
 <italic>epi</italic>-curzerenone and 15.75% 1,8-cineole) severely depressed the germination, germination rate and seedling development of lettuce and tomatoes. Particularly, the seed germination of both crops decreased from 80% to 0% and from 100% to 40%, correspondingly, at the highest dose of 
 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> essential oil (1.00%) assayed, and the hypocotyl and radicle growths were significantly reduced, with the essential oil at only 0.73â€“0.86% [
