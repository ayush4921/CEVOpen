<p>Regarding these data, the essential oil from the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> can be considered a green alternative for biopreservation in the agri-food industry. It has demonstrated promising dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. This efficacy is not always shared with the essential oils extracted from other parts of
