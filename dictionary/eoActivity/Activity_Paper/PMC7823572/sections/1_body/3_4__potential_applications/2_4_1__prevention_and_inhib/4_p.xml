Particularly, packaging with a biopolymer film containing turmeric essential oil (35.46% turmerone, 20.61% cumene and 13.82% ar-turmerone) constitutes a sustainable and efficient technology to protect these food products against attacks of the filamentous fungus. The biopolymer film acts as a carrier, releasing in a sustained way the antimicrobial agent turmeric essential oil [
