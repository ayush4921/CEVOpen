<p>The antioxidant properties of the turmeric essential oils have been widely studied. The leaf essential oil with 22.8% β-sesquiphellandrene and 9.5% terpinolene as the main compounds has been proposed as a potential option to prevent the oxidative deterioration of fat-containing food products because of its hydrogen-donating properties and reducing power [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil is able to decrease lipid peroxidation and other processes related to free-radical formation, achieving the extending shelf-lives of food products. In fact, it has exhibited the lowest peroxide value with respect to oleoresins and synthetic antioxidants, meaning a more efficient inhibitory effect of the formation of the secondary oxidation product malondialdehyde [

This effect has been corroborated by means of diverse methods that evaluate both the scavenging capacity for different free radicals and the metal ion-chelating ability of the essential oil. Particularly, the essential oil obtained from the fresh rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (α-turmerone (42.6%), β-turmerone (16.0%) and ar-turmerone (12.9%)) has exhibited satisfactory dose-dependent DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical-scavenging activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 10.03 and 0.54 mg/mL, respectively), as well as reducing power [

These are good estimators of the antioxidant activity of any extract in general, using a simple redox reaction between the antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS), being considered the DPPH method as the first line for evaluating the ability of a compound and extract or other biological source to act as a free-radical scavenger or hydrogen donor because of its accuracy, simplicity and low cost [
 <xref rid="B258-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. On the other hand, ABTS has been observed as especially useful to track changes in the antioxidant system itself during the storage and processing steps [
 <xref rid="B257-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Reducing power is usually a complementary test to the previous ones to further evaluate the antioxidant activity [
