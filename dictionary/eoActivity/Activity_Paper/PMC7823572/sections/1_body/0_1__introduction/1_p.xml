<p>Medicinal and aromatic plant species (MAPs) have been broadly exploited as food flavourings, medicinal agents, preservatives and ornaments, as well as beauty and personal delight products, becoming natural alternatives that offer reliability, safety and sustainability [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Amongst them, turmeric (
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic>) is especially popular worldwide because of its attractive culinary, cosmetic and medicinal uses [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Specifically, the interest of this tuberous species resides in its exploitation as a colouring and flavouring agent, as well as in its numerous pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuro- and dermoprotective, antiasthmatic or hypoglycaemic [
