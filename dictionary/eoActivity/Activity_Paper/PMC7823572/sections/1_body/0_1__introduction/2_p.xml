<p>Furthermore, rhizomes are a rich source of two major products with remarkable attributes: curcuminoids and essential oils [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the one hand, curcuminoids are the responsible for the previously described orange-yellow colour [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. They particularly refer to a group of three phenolic compounds, curcumin, desmethoxycurcumin and bisdesmethoxycurcumin, belonging to the diarylheptanoid family. They consist of a diketonic hydroxycarbon skeleton with different functional groups, depending on the curcuminoid [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Their content in the 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome may vary according to many factors, such as the variety and geographic location, as well as cultivation and postharvest processing conditions [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Unfortunately, their poor solubility, low absorption and bioavailability, as well as high metabolic rate, limit their use for therapeutic purposes [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, the major component curcumin has not been approved as a therapeutic agent yet due to its pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties, despite it is generally considered a safe substance [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In response, curcuminoids have been associated with lipids, micelles, nanoparticles and other molecules to enhance their effects. An example is the binding of curcumin with phosphocaseins. This combination represents a suitable vector to deliver efficiently the compound, as well as other drugs and nutrients in general. New analogues with improved activity are being tried to develop from the original ones [
