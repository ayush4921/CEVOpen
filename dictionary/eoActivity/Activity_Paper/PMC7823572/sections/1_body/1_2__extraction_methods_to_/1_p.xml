<p>The characteristic aroma of turmericâ€™s rhizomes is provided mainly by its essential oil, representing an excellent marker of quality of this spice and its derived products. Several extraction processes have been carried out with the subterranean plant stems to obtain this mixture of flavouring compounds, steam distillation being the most commonly chosen one [

 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In this process, a blast of steam goes through the plant material placed on a perforated plate above, dragging the organic compounds [

With the aim of avoiding these drawbacks and consequently increasing the quality and quantity of the essential oil, this technique has usually been modified and/or combined with others. For instance, Chandra et al. incorporated a continuous water circulation process to the regular steam distillation of the essential oil of turmeric rhizomes and leaves, achieving 13% and 29% more yield, respectively, compared to the conventional process [

 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In general, a steam jacket is formed, helping reach a constant elevated temperature of the distillation and avoiding the degradation of the oil and, therefore, the unwanted odours that emerge from it [
