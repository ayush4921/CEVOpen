<p>The stage of maturity of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizomes can also influence in the yield, chemical composition and properties of the essential oil. In relation to this, Garg et al. demonstrated that the percentage of the essential oil content widely varied between fresh and dried rhizomes of 27 accessions of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> in North India [

 <xref rid="B165-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], probably due to the lower percentage of ar-turmerone and β-turmerone. Anyway, the control of the drying conditions constitutes an important parameter in order to obtain the highest content of essential oil in the minimum time possible [

 <xref rid="B167-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. The sun and mechanical drying coexist as drying methods of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizomes [
 <xref rid="B156-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In particular, Monton et al. confirmed that one hour of microwave drying without conventional drying represented the optimum conditions to obtain the highest content of turmeric essential oil [
