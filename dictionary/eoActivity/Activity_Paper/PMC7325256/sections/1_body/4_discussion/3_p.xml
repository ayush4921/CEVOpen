<p id="Par62">Castor oil-induced diarrhoeal model is the first model to assess the ability of test extract towards its antidiarrhoeal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It causes an imbalance between the secretary and absorptive processes in the small intestine by producing inflammation and local irritation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. After oral administration, “ricinoleic acid” the active constituent of CO, is released by intestinal lipases. Consequently, it activates intestinal smooth-muscle cells via endothelial prostanoid receptors (EP
 <sub>3</sub>). Then it induces fluid and electrolyte secretion secondary to stimulation of an active anion secretory process, which is mediated by cAMP [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, the use of castor oil as diarrhoea inducer for all models is reasonable since it resembles the pathophysiologic processes and ensures the actual diarrhoeal (secretory and inflammatory diarrhoea) diseases in humans.
