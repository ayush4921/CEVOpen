<p id="Par61">80% methanol was used as a macerating solvent for plant extraction and it was similar with other laboratory works done on

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In general, hydro-alcoholic co-solvents such as 80% methanol seem to possess the optimum solubility characteristics for initial crude extraction and provide high extraction yield [
