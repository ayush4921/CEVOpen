<p id="Par54">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the mean comparison of different concentrations of extract within a group and with the standard antibacterial disc was presented. As shown in the table, all concentrations of plant extract showed a statistically significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) as compared with the positive control in all standard bacteria. In addition, the 200 mg/mL concentration of extract had significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) for 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as compared with 400 mg/mL of crude extract. It had also a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001 as compared with 800 mg/mL concentration for 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> while, the p-value is less than 0.01 for 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>. In addition, the 400 mg/kg concentration of test extract showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as compared with 800 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, while 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>.
