<p id="Par40">Three test concentrations of plant extract (800 mg/mL, 400 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL), vehicle and standard antibiotic disc were used for determining zone of inhibition. Ceftazidime (30 μg/ disc, for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) and ciprofloxacin (0.005 mg/disc, for the remaining bacteria) were used as a standard drug and distilled water was used as a negative control. The standard antibacterial discs were selected based on the susceptibility of bacterial species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test organisms by using vernier calliper and then compared with the reference as well as the control. Each procedure was done in triplicates and average values were being taken for further use [
