<p>Anthocyanins play an important role in the coloration of plant petals [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most blue or purple flowers contain delphinidin-based anthocyanins, and red or magenta flowers contain pelargonidin or cyanidin-based anthocyanins (Naonobu et al. 2013). In this study, a total of 15 anthocyanins and their derivatives from 4 aglycones (cyanidin, pelargonin, peonidin, and delphinidin) were detected in the petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species. Among them, pelargonin chloride, cyanidin-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside, pelargonin-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside, cyanidin-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside, cyanidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin chloride, peonidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside chloride, delphinidin chloride, cyanidin 
 <italic>O</italic>-syringic acid and jaceosidin, centaureidin were the first reported in 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> petals. Peonidin, jaceosidin, centaureidin and cyanidin-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside were only detected in GP petals. Jaceosidin is mainly found in the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, and jaceosidin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Compared with GP petals, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside were at a lower level in the petals of other species, which may account for the light pink color of GP petals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside in RB petals was higher when compared with the other three 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species, which may be one of the reasons that it possesses red orange petals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Peonidin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside in ZP petals was also higher when compared with MY.
