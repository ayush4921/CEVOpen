 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species are multifunctional plants that are widely used in food, medicinal and ornamental decoration. Ornamental use is mainly based on petal color, while edible and medicinal use of 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species is limited to its fruits, which are rich in flavonoids. Due to the health benefits of flavonoid consumption, a growing number of plant flowers are used to make scented tea, such as jasmine-scented tea [
