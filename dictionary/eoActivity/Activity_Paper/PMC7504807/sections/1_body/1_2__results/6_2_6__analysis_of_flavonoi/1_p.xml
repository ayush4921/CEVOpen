<p>To gain more insight into the differential flavonoid metabolites between the petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species, differential flavonoid metabolites were filtered according to the fold change (≥2 or ≤0.5), the variable importance in the projection (VIP, &gt;1) of OPLS-DA model and the filtering criteria. The filtering results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03994">Supplementary Table S2</xref> in full detail, and illustrated by volcano plots and Venn diagrams (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Of the 179 flavonoid metabolites, 69 (38.55%) were significantly different between GP and RB (23 higher, 46 lower), 69 (38.55%) between GP and MY (12 higher, 57 lower), 69 (38.55%) between ZP and GP, (51 higher, 18 lower), 40 (22.35%) between ZP and MY (13 higher, 27 lower), 36 (20.11%) between ZP and RB (26 higher, 10 lower), 44 (24.58%) between MY and RB (28 higher, 16 lower). The same amount of differential flavonoid metabolites was detected when comparing GP to ZP, RB or MY. Moreover, most of the flavonoid metabolites of ZP, RB and MY were lower relative to GP (

 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species.
