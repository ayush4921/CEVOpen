<p>In the intersection of the Venn diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f005">Figure 5</xref>gâ€“j), 47 common differential metabolites were found among comparison groups GP vs. RB, GP vs. MY, and ZP vs. GP. Moreover, 9 were found amongst comparison groups ZP vs. GP, ZP vs. RB, and ZP vs. MY, 15 amongst comparison groups ZP vs. RB, MY vs. RB, and GP vs. RB and 15 among comparison groups GP vs. MY, ZP vs. MY, and MY vs. RB. Additionally, each comparison group had unique differential metabolites, implying that differential metabolites could clearly distinguish the four
