<p>The differential flavonoid metabolites of each comparison group were annotated by searching against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.kegg.jp/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.kegg.jp/</uri>) in order to obtain detailed pathway information (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03994">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The KEGG pathway classification results indicated that flavonoid metabolites which were present in differential amounts among the species sampled were mainly involved in “flavone and flavonol biosynthesis”, “anthocyanin biosynthesis”, “isoflavonoid biosynthesis”, “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”, “biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids”, “flavonoid biosynthesis”, and “metabolic pathways” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The differential flavonoid metabolites present in comparisons with GP were mainly involved in “flavone and flavonol biosynthesis”, implying that flavones and flavonols distinguish GP from the other three 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species. “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” was the main enrichment pathway in comparison groups ZP vs. MY and MY vs. RB.
