<p>PCA is a chemometric tool that uses a small number of principal components to reveal the internal structure among multiple variables. In the PCA plot, the three biological replicates of QC samples grouped together (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). In the PCA score plot, GP was clearly separated from ZP, RB, MY in PC1, indicating that GP had a significantly different flavonoid profile. This result was consistent with the fact that the correlation between GP and the other three species was very weak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Moreover, ZP, RB, and MY were also separated in PC1, but had more distinct separation in PC2 (
