<p>The flavonoid metabolites of the petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species were investigated based on UPLC-ESI-MS/MS and databases. A total of 179 (GP, 159; ZP, 145; ZP, 138; MY, 137) flavonoid metabolites were identified in the petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species, including 49 flavonols, 46 flavonoids, 19 flavonoid carbosides, 17 procyanidins, 15 anthocyanins, 10 dihydroflavonoids, 10 flavanols, 6 isoflavones, 5 dihydroflavonols, and 2 chalcones (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03994">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), which revealed that there were significant differences in the metabolite levels of the four species. The content of flavonoid metabolites in the GP petals compared with ZP, MY, and RB varied greatly. By clustering all flavonoid metabolites, it was revealed that nearly half of the flavonoid metabolites in GP were present at higher levels than ZP, MY, and RB.
