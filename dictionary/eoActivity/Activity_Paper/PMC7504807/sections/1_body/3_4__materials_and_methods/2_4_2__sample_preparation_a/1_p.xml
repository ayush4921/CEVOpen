<p>Flavonoids were extracted according to the method of Han, Li [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], with some modifications. Fresh petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species were ground into powder and extracted with methanol in an ultrasonic bath at 25 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 15 min. This step was repeated three times to ensure efficient extraction. Supernatants were condensed to a volume of 8 mL by rotary evaporation and stored at −4 °C for determination of total flavonoid content. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
