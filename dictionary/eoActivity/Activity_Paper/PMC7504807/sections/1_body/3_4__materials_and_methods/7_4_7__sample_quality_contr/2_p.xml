<p>TIC maps from QC mass spectrometry are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03994">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. The curve of the metabolites had high overlap and the retention time and peak intensity were consistent, therefore the signal stability was good when the mass spectrometer detected the same sample at different times.
