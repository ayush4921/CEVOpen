<p>Quality control sample (QC) is a mixture of sample extracts (mix) with a concentration of 100 mg dry weight of petals per 1 mL methanol extract and 3 replicates (mix01, mix02, mix03) to analyze the repeatability of the sample under the same treatment method. Calculating the CV (coefficient of variation) value of each metabolite in these three mix repeats can be a measure of the volatility of the instrument and the stability of substance detection. In this study, 100% of the metabolites with CV value less than 0.5, more than 96% of the metabolites with CV value less than 0.3 and more than 93% of the metabolites with CV value less than 0.2. Moreover, during instrumental analysis, one quality control sample is inserted into every 10 test and analysis samples to monitor the repeatability of the analysis process. The duplication of metabolite extraction and detection, i.e., technical repetition, can be determined by overlapping display and analysis of total ion flow (TIC) diagrams of the essential spectrum detection and analysis of QC samples with different quality control. </p>
