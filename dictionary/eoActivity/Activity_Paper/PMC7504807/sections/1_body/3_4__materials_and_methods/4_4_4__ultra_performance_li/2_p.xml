<p>The UPLC analysis was performed with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm). The solvent system was 0.04% acetic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.04% acetic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). Oven temperature was set to 40 °C, and a flow rate of 0.40 mL/min was used. The A:B (
