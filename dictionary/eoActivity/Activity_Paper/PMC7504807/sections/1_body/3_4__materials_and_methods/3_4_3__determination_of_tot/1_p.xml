<p>The total flavonoid content of four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> petals were measured by a modified aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Next, 0.2 mL methanol extract was mixed with 5% sodium nitrite solution (0.2 mL) in a 10 mL volumetric flask, to which 10% aluminum nitrate solution (0.2 mL) was added and mixed after 6 min. Subsequently, 2 mL of 4% NaOH solution was added and the mixture was made up to the line with methanol after 6 min. After incubation for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 510 nm with a spectrophotometer. The data were calculated and expressed as milligrams of rutin equivalent per 100 g of fresh weight (mg RE/100 g FW).
