  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species are used for both ornamental decoration and medicinal purposes. In order to have a better understanding of the flavonoid profile of 
  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic>, the petals of four 
  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species, including 
  <italic>Chaenomeles japonica</italic> (RB)
  <italic>, Chaenomeles speciose</italic> (ZP), 
  <italic>Chaenomeles sinensis</italic> (GP), and 
  <italic>Chaenomeles cathayensis</italic> (MY), were selected as experimental material. The total flavonoid content of GP was found to be the highest, followed by MY, ZP, and RB. In total, 179 flavonoid metabolites (including 49 flavonols, 46 flavonoids, 19 flavone C-glycosides, 17 procyanidins, 15 anthocyanins, 10 flavanols, 10 dihydroflavonoids, 6 isoflavones, 5 dihydroflavonols, and 2 chalcones) were identified by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Screening of differential flavonoid metabolites showed that GP had higher levels of metabolites when compared with the other three 
  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species. Annotation and enrichment analysis of flavonoid metabolites revealed that cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside and pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside anthocyanins are likely responsible for the color differences of the four 
  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> petals. Additionally, a large number of flavonoids, flavonols, and isoflavones were enriched in the petals of GP. This study provides new insights into the development and utilization of 
  <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> petals and provides a basis for future investigations into their utilization.
