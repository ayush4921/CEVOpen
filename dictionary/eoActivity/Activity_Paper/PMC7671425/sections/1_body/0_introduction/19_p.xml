<p>Hypoglycemic activities in mice with type 1 diabetes have been confirmed by BS oleo-gum and respective active ingredients, KBA and AKBA by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines related to inducing auto-immune procedure in pancreatic islets, such as interleukin (IL)-1A, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and infiltrating lymphocytes into islets. Two of the major antidiabetic mechanisms include suppressing pancreatic islet tissue atrophy and peri-insular apoptotic cells mediated by anticaspase 3 (

 <italic>B. carterii</italic> oleo-gum resin showed an antidiabetic capacity by increasing the serum insulin, regenerating β-cells of Langerhans islets, enhancing glycogenesis, and declining glycogenolysis in rats with alloxan-induced type 1 diabetes (
