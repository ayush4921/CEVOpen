<p>Some results demonstrated the decline of the blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes by orally administrating the aqueous extracts of the leaf and root of 
 <italic>B. glabra</italic>. The continuous application of the extract of the leaf and root for 28 days represented a reduction of cholesterol, creatinine, triglyceride, serum glucose, urea, enzyme activity with considerable hypo-glycemic impacts (

One of the auto-immune diseases is a type I diabetes, in which a chronic inflammatory procedure eventually leads to beta-cell mortality and a lack of insulin production. It was indicated that extracts obtained by the gum resin of BS have anti-inflammatory features, especially via targeting agents or mediators associated with auto-immune diseases (
