<p>The preliminary phytochemical screening of the extract in this recent study revealed the presence of alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids, tannins, saponins and flavonoids. Hence, the biological effect of aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) are connected with their active principles including flavonoids, tannins and alkaloids which have been reported to have antihyperglycemic properties amongst others, however, required in order to ascertain the actual mechanism of this plant. This finding is in line with those of the previous studies carried out on antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic activity of different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) leaves (Bakerf.) Cufod. Using various models: 70% EtOH and fractions in Alloxan monohydrate-induced mice
