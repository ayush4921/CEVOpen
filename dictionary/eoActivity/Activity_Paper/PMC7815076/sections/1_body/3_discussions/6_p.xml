<p>The AST, ALT and ALP are physiologically and clinically important enzymes. Since ALT occurs in much higher concentration in the liver than elsewhere, therefore increased ALT activity specifically reflects hepatic damage, which is a normal occurrence in diabetes may be due to leakage of the enzymes to blood stream. Within limits AST and ALT levels act as indicators of normal liver function.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Diabetes and hyperlipidemia also cause cellular damage by altering the cell membrane architecture resulting in enhanced activities of ALP in diabetic rats. Presently in treated diabetic rats, restoration of these enzymes to normal levels indicates restoration of liver normal functioning upon treatment with

The present results appear consistent with a previous report, the restoration of transaminases to their normal levels after treatment indicates revival of insulin secretion and regenerative activities of islets of Langerhans cells of pancreas after administration of the plant material, by Toma et al
