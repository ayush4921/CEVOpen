<p>Diabetic nephropathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes. A key morphological change associated with sustained hyperglycemia is the accumulation of glycogen granules in distal tubules, which leads to renal hypertrophy.

 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> aqueous leaves extract decreased significantly the serum creatinine and urea levels by enhancing renal functions and, the serum total cholesterol content did not show significant change, which agreed with an earlier study
