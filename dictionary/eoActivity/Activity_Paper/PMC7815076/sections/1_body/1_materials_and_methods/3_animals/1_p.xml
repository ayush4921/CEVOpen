<p>Thirty rats of weight 90–150 gram indiscriminately distributed to five groups (n= 6). Then labelled in the following manner: diabetic control (DC), normal control (NC), extract treated (MS 250 and 500mg/kg), and diabetic glibenclamide treated (GL 5mg/kg). All groups were allowed to have standard rat pellets and water throughout the experiment in a separated cage, 21±1°C and light periods. Animals used for this study were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for two weeks prior to the experiment to avoid any non-specific stress.
