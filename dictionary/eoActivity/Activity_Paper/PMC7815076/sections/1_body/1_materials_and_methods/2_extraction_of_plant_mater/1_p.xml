<p>Fresh leaves of the 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) were cleaned of tiny particles, chopped, dried under shade (at room temperature), grinded to powder using mortar and pestle, and stored in cool and dry place. Then 1.208 and 2.130Kg of powdered leaves were kept in Erlenmeyer flasks and macerated with water (distilled) for 4hrs with intermittent agitation by orbital shaker DS-500. The extract solution was filtered using cotton of 0.1 mm2 mesh gauze and freeze-dried at lower temperature (˗46°C to ˗51°C) and lower pressure (133x10-3mbr) to form crude extract. Then kept in a desiccator at room temperature.
