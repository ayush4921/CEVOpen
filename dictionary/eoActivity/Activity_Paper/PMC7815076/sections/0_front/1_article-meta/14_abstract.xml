  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Diabetes is a serious metabolic disorder with complications that result in significant morbidity and mortality. Current drugs used for diabetes therapy are not free from side effects and do not restore normal glucose homeostasis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of 
   <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) aqueous leaves extract.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Thirty rats of weight 90–150 gram were distributed to five groups (n= 6). Then labelled as diabetic control (DC), normal control (NC), extract treated (MS 250 and 500mg/kg), and glibenclamide treated (GL 5mg/kg). The experimental rats were induced by intra-peritoneal injection of Alloxan monohydrate at a dose of 180 mg/kg after dissolving in normal saline. Clinical biochemistry such as AST, ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, and cholesterol, blood glucose level, histopathological and preliminary phytochemical screening were evaluated.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Phytochemical tests revealed the presence of different secondary metabolites. Alkaloid, flavonoid, tannin, saponin, phytosteroids, phenols and terpenoids. 
   <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) leaves aqueous extract (250 and 500mg/kg) improved the body weight of rats, showed remarkable reduction in blood glucose concentration (P&lt;0.05), and significantly decreased serum urea, creatinine, ALT, AST and ALP (P &lt; 0.05). Levels of serum cholesterol remained unaltered in the experimental groups when compared with diabetic control. Histopathology of non-treated rats showed deterioration of insulin producing pancreas cells; nevertheless, β-cells restoration was observed due to administration of

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>It is possible to conclude that oral administration of 
   <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) aqueous leaf extracts (250mg/kg and 500mg/kg) for 28 days showed beneficial effects on antihyperglycemia, improved body weight and Alloxan damaged pancreatic β-cells, and restored biochemical changes.
