<p>Seaweeds produce bioactive compounds, including fucoidans, fucosterol, and phlorotannins, which are responsible for regulating immune-signaling and anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> has been shown to possess immunomodulatory properties that are potentially applicable for stimulating the immune response or controlling immune cell activity for mitigating associated negative effects such as inflammation [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These marine sources of medicinal compounds may also affect multiple targets in the immune and inflammatory systems that are important for disease progression. The immunomodulatory activities of a 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> polysaccharide (SFP) have been investigated previously in RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse splenocytes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by Sung et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It was found that SFP induced macrophage activation by increasing the expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules, and it resulted in the production of markedly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) 
 <italic>α</italic>, interleukin- (IL-) 6, and IL-12p70) through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B), MAPK signaling, and the T helper 1 (Th1) immune response. Similarly, Byun [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] compared the immunomodulatory effects of SFP with those of SFE in macrophages and murine splenocytes and confirmed that the immunomodulation may be dependent on polysaccharide extracts. This study demonstrated that SFP significantly increases nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine production (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>), whereas SFE does not cause increased NO and cytokine production. In the case of splenocytes, SFP increased splenocyte proliferation and Th1 type cytokine (IL-2 and interferon- (IFN-) 
 <italic>γ</italic>) production to a greater extent than SFE. The above results suggested that the immunomodulatory activity of SFP was mainly mediated via the regulation of Th1-related cytokine expression. The time-effect relation of the cytokine response also indicated that macrophages and natural killer cells involved in nonspecific immunity were primarily activated and that helper T cells were secondarily affected in response to SFP treatment.
