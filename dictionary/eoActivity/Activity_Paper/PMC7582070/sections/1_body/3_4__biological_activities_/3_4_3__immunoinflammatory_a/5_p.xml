<p>These and other studies report of bioactive compounds derived from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> on immunoinflammatory activities and its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied and remain largely unresolved. Further studies are required to determine the anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> extracts and their application in food and pharmaceutical products. These extracts should be further purified and characterized to possibly identify the relationship between their anti-inflammatory role and chemical structure, which would provide a novel insight into the application of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> in the development of alternative anti-inflammatory drugs.
