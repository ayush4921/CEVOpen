<p>As is well known, UV radiation is an important etiologic factor for inflammatory skin damages, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cellular and tissue injuries, cell death, skin cancer, and premature skin aging [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In a study performed by Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the experimental HaCaT keratinocytes and BALB/c mice were treated with the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> ethanol extract (SFE-EtOAc); it was found that SFE-EtOAc could be an effective anti-inflammatory agent protecting against UVB irradiation-induced skin damage. The results showed that SFE-EtOAc effectively inhibited UVB-induced cytotoxicity and the production of proinflammatory proteins or mediators including COX-2, TNF-

 <italic>in vitro</italic> HaCaT human keratinocytes and in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> BALB/c mice.
