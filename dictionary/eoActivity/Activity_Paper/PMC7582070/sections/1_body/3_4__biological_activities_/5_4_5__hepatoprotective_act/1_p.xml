<p>Despite the huge advancements in modern medicine, drugs able to effectively stimulate hepatic function offer complete protection to the liver, or aid in the regeneration of hepatic cells is yet undiscovered. Additionally, some drugs also induce adverse or side effects. Thus, it is necessary to develop alternative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of hepatic diseases, based on more effective and less toxic agents [

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Kawano et al. [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] reported that diets containing edible seaweeds (
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>) prevented liver toxicity induced by D-galactosamine in rats. It also normalized the elevated levels of serum alanine transferase (ALT) and those of GSH in the cecum. However, they have not clarified the components or factors in 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> able to repress D-GalN-hepatopathy [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In a following study, the authors suggested that the protective effect of the three kinds of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> against D-GalN-hepatopathy could be partly attributed to fucoidan. This study proposed one plausible mechanism, i.e., the marked increase of GSH levels in cecal contents as a result of repeated intake of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> could promote the D-GalN-hepatopathy defense mechanism by influencing bacterial translocation to the intestine. The obtained results demonstrate the hepatoprotective activity of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> fucoidan and provide new prospects for its clinical application in the treatment of hepatic diseases.
