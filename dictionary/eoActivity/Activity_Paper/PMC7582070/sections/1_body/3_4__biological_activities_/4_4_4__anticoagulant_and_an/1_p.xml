<p>Anticoagulants inhibit or decrease the ability of blood to clot or coagulate and therefore help preventing the formation of harmful clots in blood vessels [

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Alternative drugs for heparin are in high demand, due to its adverse effects, such as occasional life-threatening bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Thus, the disadvantages associated with heparin motivate further research on novel substances with anticoagulant properties [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities are the most studied properties of sulfated polysaccharides from seaweeds [
