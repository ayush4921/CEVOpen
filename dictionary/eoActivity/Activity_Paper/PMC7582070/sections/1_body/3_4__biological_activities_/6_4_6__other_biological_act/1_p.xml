<p>Other biological effects include fibrinolytic, antipyretic, analgesic, antiatopic, antibacterial, anticancer/antitumor, and antidiabetic activities (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>) isolated from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> with a backbone composed of 1-O-palmitoyl-2-O-oleoyl-3-O-(
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl)-glycerol (POGG) and 1-O-myristoyl-2-O-oleoyl-3-O-(
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl)-glycerol (MOGG) were shown to exhibit fibrinolytic activity in a reaction system comprising pro-u-PA and plasminogen [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] revealed that tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, neophytadiene, and oleic acid from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> show potent antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities, especially antiedema activity. Yoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] reported that the ethanol extract from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> (SFE) showed antibacterial activity and that 70% SFE significantly inhibited the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 8.13 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Another recent report revealed that the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity can be enhanced using 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> enzymatic extracts, which also exhibited potent antioxidant and alcohol dehydrogenase activities [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Additionally, Jo et al. [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported the antitumoral effects of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> hot-water extract and elucidated the potential mechanisms using both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> systems. They found that the modulation of the Bcl-2 family members and activation of the p53 pathway may be closely related to the prevention of cancer and may therefore function as an important antitumoral mechanism.
