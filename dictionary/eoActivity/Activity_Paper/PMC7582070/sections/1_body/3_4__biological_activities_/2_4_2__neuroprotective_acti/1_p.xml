<p>With the increase in life expectancy, normal brain aging and neurological disorders due to pathological degeneration of neurons are a growing concern for the elderly. The pathogenesis of neurological disorders tends to be associated with region-specific neuronal degeneration and atrophy, which is primarily caused by the reduced level of neurotrophic factors [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The development of effective neuroprotective agents is important for the treatment of both acute and chronic brain disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Seaweeds are potential sources for such agents [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. So far, three compounds with neuritogenic activity have been identified from the genus 
 <italic>Sargassum</italic>. Sargaquinoic acid and sargachromenol from 
 <italic>Sargassum macrocarpum</italic> were found to promote neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in the presence of nerve growth factor at low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Another neurodifferentiation compound, pheophytin A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), identified and characterized from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>, was shown to have a similar neuritogenic activity in PC12 cells [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This study suggested that pheophytin A at a concentration of 3.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL synergizes with nerve growth factor (NGF) to promote neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Moreover, in the follow-up study, the same group investigated the effects of the pheophytin A analog vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> on PC12 cell differentiation. Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> demonstrated neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in PC12 cells, and in a manner similar to NGF, it stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway via the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, it should be noted that PC12 cells are neurosecretory cells that originate from the peripheral nervous system and that they do not form neurites 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Another point to note is that these compounds do not have the potential to initiate neuritogenesis by themselves; instead, they can enhance the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in the presence of low concentrations of nerve growth factor, but further efforts are required to evaluate the potential neurotrophic effects of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> on neurons from the central nervous system (CNS). Hannan et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] investigated the ethanol extracts of 22 seaweed species, including 
 <italic>Gelidium amansii</italic>, 
 <italic>Undaria pinnatifida</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> for their ability to protect mature neurons from atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. In this preliminary screening experiment, the ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> (SFE) showed neurite outgrowth-promoting ability, thus helping the development of rat hippocampal neurons. In another study, the authors extended the previously reported neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> in the PC12 cells to the CNS neurons and further proved its efficacy with respect to the formation of neural networks by enhancing synaptogenesis. Treatment of rat hippocampal neurons with SFE (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) resulted in a significant enhancement of desirable effects, such as neuronal maturation in the early stage of development, cytoarchitecture complexity, and synaptogenesis in the later maturation stage. In addition to its effect on neurite development, SFE significantly increased the number of postsynaptic density-95 and synaptic vesicle 2 puncta and synapses (about 35%, 67%, and 125%, respectively, with respect to that in the control) [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Notably, small molecules isolated from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> showed higher protective effect against neurite damage in cases of excessive neuronal cell loss, indicating that 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> can promote neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis, and support neuronal survival. Thus, 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> could have potential therapeutic value for brain aging as well as for neurodegenerative diseases by favoring the reconstruction of the partially damaged neuronal network.
