<p>Marine organisms are rich sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds, and their importance as sources of novel bioactive substances is growing rapidly [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> is a source of many health-promoting components, mainly phlorotannins, fucoxanthin, and polysaccharides. Surprisingly, phlorotannins have been found only in marine brown algae, which protect them from natural enemies by acting as herbivore deterrents, digestive inhibitors, ultraviolet (UV) screens, and antibacterial agents [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Phlorotannins are structurally less complex than terrestrial tannins, as they comprise chains of 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene formed via the acetate-malonate pathway [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The phlorotannins can be categorised into three primary types according to the criteria of interphloroglucinol linkages: (i) fucols, (ii) phlorethols, and (iii) fucophlorethols (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fucoxanthin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) is a well-known xanthophyll pigment, responsible for the brown color of seaweeds; it accounts for around 10% of the total natural seaweed carotenoid content [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interesting bioactive properties are associated with fucoxanthin, which is a popular functional ingredient in food, cosmeceutical, and nutraceutical industries [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the bioavailability of marine algae-derived bioactive small molecules like fucoxanthin or phlorotannins has not yet been sufficiently researched, especially in 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>. In a recent study [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the grasshopper ketone (GK) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>) was isolated and purified from the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral and chemical evidence and demonstrated that GK has anti-inflammatory activity and contributes to the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Ina et al. previously isolated an analog to chlorophyll-related compounds, pheophytin A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>), from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> and demonstrated that it is a neurodifferentiation compound [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to Wu et al., two bioactive products identified as 1-O-palmitoyl-2-O-oleoyl-3-O-(
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl)-lycerol and 1-O-myristoyl-2-O-oleoyl-3-O-(
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl)-glycerol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>) obtained from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> showed fibrinolytic activity in the reaction system of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (pro-u-PA) and plasminogen [
