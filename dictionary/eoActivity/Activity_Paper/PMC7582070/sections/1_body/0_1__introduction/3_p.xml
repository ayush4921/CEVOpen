<p>Since 2000, more than 40 papers have been published on the bioactive properties of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>. However, there is still insufficient systemic data on its chemical constituents and pharmacological effects. This paper summarizes the research conducted over the past decades, on the chemical components of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> and their biological activities. Nowadays, the therapeutic effects of this seaweed are scientifically credible and have been partially explained by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Hence, our review summarized the literature on the biological characterization and pharmacological bioactivities of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>, with an emphasis on its functional properties, which could provide a comprehensive insight into the chemical structures and biological activities of its active compounds and could also provide information that would lead to the development of more applications based on 
 <italic>S. fulvellum.</italic>
