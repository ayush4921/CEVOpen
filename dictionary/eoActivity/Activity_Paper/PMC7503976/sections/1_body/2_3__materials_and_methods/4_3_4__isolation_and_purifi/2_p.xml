 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (50:50) followed by an increasing gradient of CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (up to 10:90) to obtain F

 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (50:50) followed by an increasing gradient of CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (up to 10:90) to obtain 2 subfractions, F

 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>/EtOAc (up to 30:70) to obtain 1 subfraction, F

 <sub>G</sub> (5.6 g) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography; the column was eluted using CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (50:50) followed by an increasing gradient of CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (up to 10:90) to obtain F
 <sub>5</sub> (5 g). The collected fractions were monitored on TLC plates. The thin layer chromatograms were developed in a solvent system of ethyl acetate/methanol/water (EMW 81:11:8). A natural product staining solution (1 g methanolic diphenylboric acid, 100 mL methanol, 5 mL PEG 400 and 95 mL ethanol) was used to visualize compounds on a TLC plate.
