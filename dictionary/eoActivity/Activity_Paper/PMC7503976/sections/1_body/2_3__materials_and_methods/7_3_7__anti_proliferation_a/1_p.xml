The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest) and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (Lonza). Resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mM and incubation continued for 2 h, after which fluorescence (Exc
