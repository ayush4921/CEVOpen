<p>To assess trypanocidal activity, compounds were added to in vitro cultures of 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> (strain Lister 427) in 96-well plates (triplicate; 2.4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> parasites/well) at a fixed concentration of 20 µM for pure compounds (
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>) or 25 µg/mL for the crude extract and fractions F
 <sub>1</sub>, F
 <sub>2</sub>, F
 <sub>3</sub>, F
 <sub>4</sub> and F
 <sub>5</sub>. The culture medium consisted of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium containing 25 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (IMDM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest), penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza) and HMI-9 supplement (0.05 mM bathocuproine disulfonic acid, 1.5 mM cysteine, 1.25 mM pyruvic acid, 0.09 mM uracil, 0.09 mM cytosine, 0.16 mM thymidine, 0.014% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM hypoxanthine; all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03781" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. After an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator, resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mM and incubation continued for a further 24 h, after which conversion of resazurin to resorufin was measured in a Spectramax M3 fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices; Exc
 <sub>560</sub>/Em
 <sub>590</sub>). The % cell viability in wells containing test samples was calculated relative to untreated control wells using the fluorescence readings, after subtracting background fluorescence in wells without cells. For dose-response experiments, parasites were cultured in the presence of 3-fold serial dilutions of the test samples and % viability plotted against log (compound concentration) to obtain IC
 <sub>50</sub> values by non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism v.5.02). Pentamidine (an existing drug for treatment of trypanosomiasis) was used as the positive control.
