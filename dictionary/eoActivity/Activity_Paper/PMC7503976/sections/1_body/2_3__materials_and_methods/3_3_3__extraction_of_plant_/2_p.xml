<p>The extract was eluted initially with hexane and the solvent polarity was increased gradually with ethyl acetate and finally methanol, yielding 17 fractions. Fractions with similar TLC (Thin-layer chromatography) profiles, i.e., containing the same compounds but in varying concentrations, were combined and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator giving a total of 8 fractions coded as F
 <sub>A</sub>-F
 <sub>H</sub>. F
 <sub>A</sub> was obtained with hexane/ethyl acetate (70:30); F
 <sub>B</sub> and F
 <sub>C</sub> were obtained with hexane/ethyl acetate (30:70); F
 <sub>D</sub> was obtained with ethyl acetate (100%); F
 <sub>E</sub> and F
 <sub>F</sub> were obtained with ethyl acetate/methanol (70:30); and F
 <sub>G</sub> and F
 <sub>H</sub> were obtained with ethyl acetate/methanol (30:70). The collected fractions were monitored on TLC plates.
