<p>The reducing power was determined according to the method of Anokwuru et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03781" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A 0.2 M (pH 6.6) sodium phosphate buffer (50 µL) and 50 µL of the crude extract, fractions F

 <bold>4</bold> were added in triplicate in the first three wells of a 96-well plate, followed by serial dilution. Fifty µL of a 1% aqueous potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) [K

After incubation, 50 µL of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution was added to each well. Eighty µL of each mixture was transferred to another 96-well plate and 80 µL of distilled water, followed by 16 µL ferric chloride (0.1%
