<p>The main constituents isolated and identified from the stem bark of 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic> are macrocaffrine, yohimbine, sarpagan, akuammicine, dihydroindole, indolenine, peraksine, oxindole, anhydronium, ajmaline, ajmalicine and geissoschizol. These alkaloids also have pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antioxidant, antitumor and antidiabetic properties [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03781" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although herbal practitioners use 
 <italic>Rauvolfia caffra</italic> in South Africa and some African countries for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, there are a limited number of studies into the chemistry of the underground and aerial parts of 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic> as well as the bioactivity of the extracts. Therefore, we decided to isolate compounds from the stem bark, identify the major chemical constituents present and determine if they are responsible for the bioactivity of the plant. Our results confirm the reported antioxidant activity of the crude methanol extracts from 
 <italic>Rauvolfia caffra</italic> [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03781" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, isolated compounds from this plant have not yet been studied for their antioxidant activity. Moreover, the antitrypanosomal activity of the crude methanol extracts and isolated bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>Rauvolfia caffra</italic> have never been evaluated. Therefore, this study is the first survey to detect significant in vitro antioxidant and antitrypanosomal activities of 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic>.
