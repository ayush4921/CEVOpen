 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> (427 strain) parasites in in vitro cultures. The crude extract, fractions F
 <sub>1</sub> and F
 <sub>3</sub> strongly affected the viability of the trypanosomes at the tested concentration (50 μg/mL), with viabilities of −0.1 ± 0.2%, 11.3 ± 2.7% and 1.0 ± 0.1%, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03781-f001">Figure 1</xref>. In contrast, at the same concentration, raucaffricine (
 <bold>2</bold>), isolated from F
 <sub>3</sub> did not decrease the viability of the trypanosomes (106.7 ± 1.8%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03781-f001">Figure 1</xref>), showing that the major compound of this fraction did not contribute to the antitrypanosomal activity of the plant. To our knowledge this is the first report of significant antitrypanosomal activity of 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic>.
