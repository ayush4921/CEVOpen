<p>The cell toxicity assay (CTA) was used to determine the cytotoxic abilities of the crude extract, fractions F

 <sub>3</sub>, F
 <sub>4</sub> and F
 <sub>5</sub>, raucaffricine (

 <bold>4</bold>) against HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cells. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured with the respective samples for 48 h and the remaining percentage cell viability relative to untreated control cells determined using resazurin. The standard drug emetine displayed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.026 μM, whereas all the tested samples did not cause any cytotoxic effects at a concentration of 50 μg/mL, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03781-f003">Figure 3</xref>. A previous study showed that 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic> has anti-proliferation activity. The MeOH/CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> stem bark extract exhibited activity against the proliferation of Vero cells. However, the MeOH/CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> stem bark extract did not show significant activity against proliferation of RD and Hep-G2 cells [

 <italic>R. caffra</italic> may be due to its active constituents, and these effects may be further influenced by the type of extraction and solvent used.
