<p>Spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> were evaluated for their anti-proliferative potency towards HepG2 liver cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Both cells lines were cultured as monolayers in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin sulphate (100 µg/mL). Then, cells were sub-cultured with trypsine/EDTA solution, counted with haemocytometer and plated onto 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) and left overnight so as to form a semi-confluent monolayer. A modified method was employed utilising the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl] − 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye, as reported earlier
