<p>In summary, a series of spirooxindole-based derivatives (
 <bold>6a–p</bold>) was examined for its anticancer effect towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> were more effective towards HCC HepG2 cells rather than prostate cancer PC-3 cells, except compounds 
 <bold>6f</bold>, 
 <bold>6 m</bold> and 
 <bold>6n.</bold> In particular, spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6i</bold> were found to be the most potent derivatives in this study against HepG2 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values equal to 6.9 and 6.3 μM, respectively. The SAR outcomes highlighted that C-5 substitution of the indoline moiety with a large lipophilic Br group, and incorporation of unsubstituted phenyl group at C-6 of pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine moiety are indispensable factors for the growth inhibitory activity against HepG2 cells. Furthermore, spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> was assessed for its apoptosis induction potential in HepG2 cells, where its pro-apoptotic impact was approved via the significant elevation in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-9 and p53 proteins by about 9, 8.8, 12.2 and 10 folds, respectively, and via the significant increase in the annexin V-FITC positive apoptotic cells percent. Besides, 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> were screened for their potential antioxidant activity 
 <italic>via</italic> assessing their DPPH radical scavenging capacities and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The obtained results indicated that spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6 m</bold> are the most efficient DPPH radical scavengers (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.76 ± 1.82 and 28.07 ± 1.63 µg/mL, respectively), and exhibited the best FRAP activity (11.98 and 12.13 µM, respectively). Finally, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study was carried out to predict the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold>, which revealed that 6a is not only with promising antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities, but also with proper drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties.
