<p>Recently, we have reported a one-pot three-component synthesis of novel spirooxindole derivatives 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> as efficient anti-proliferative agents towards the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line

 </xref>. In the current study, the reported promising anti-proliferative impact of spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> spurred us to extend our investigations around their different potential biological activities, where they were evaluated for their potential antioxidant activity 
 <italic>via</italic> assessing their DPPH radical scavenging capacities and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In addition, 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> were examined for their anticancer effect towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> was then assessed for its apoptosis induction potential in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, so as to obtain some mechanistic insights for the anti-proliferative impact of the herein reported spirooxindoles. Finally, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study was carried out by the use of the automated SwissADME tool to afford clues about the physicochemical properties, ADME parameters, drug-like nature and pharmacokinetic properties of spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold>.
