<p>The synthetic pathway adopted for preparation of the desired spirooxindoles is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. First, ethyl benzoates 
 <bold>2a–d</bold> were reacted with acetonitrile under reflux temperature in dry benzene and DMF, and in the presence of sodium hydride to furnish intermediates 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanenitriles 
 <bold>3a–d</bold>. Furthermore, synthesis of 5-aminopyrazole 
 <bold>5</bold> was achieved through the heterocyclocondensation of intermediate 
 <bold>4</bold> with phenylhydrazine in ethyl alcohol under reflux temperature. Finally, the target spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> were prepared through a one-pot three-component reaction of equimolar amounts of isatins 
 <bold>1a–d</bold>, 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanenitriles 
 <bold>3a–d</bold>, and 1-phenyl-3-(thiophen-2-yl)-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazol-5-amine 
 <bold>5</bold> in HOAc/H
 <sub>2</sub>O mixture (1:1 v/v) at 70 °C (
