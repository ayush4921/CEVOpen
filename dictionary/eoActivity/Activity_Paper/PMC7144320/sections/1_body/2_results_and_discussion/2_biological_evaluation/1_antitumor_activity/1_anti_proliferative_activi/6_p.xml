<p>We then explored the impact of substitution of the pendant phenyl group at C-6 of pyrazolo[3,4-
 <italic>b</italic>]pyridine moiety on the activity against HepG2 cells. Spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6e</bold>, 
 <bold>6i</bold> and 
 <bold>6 m</bold> that were entailed with an unsubstituted phenyl group showed better activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.9, 8.4, 6.3 and 30.6 µM, respectively) than their corresponding 4-substitutedphenyl counterparts 
 <bold>6c–d</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 213 − 49.1 µM), 
 <bold>6f–h</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 19.9 – &gt; 50 µM), 
 <bold>6j–l</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 9.9 − 13.2 µM) and 
 <bold>6n–p</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 µM), suggesting that incorporation of an unsubstituted phenyl group at C-6 of pyrazolo[3,4-
 <italic>b</italic>]pyridine moiety is indispensable for the anti-proliferative activity towards HCC HepG2 cells.
