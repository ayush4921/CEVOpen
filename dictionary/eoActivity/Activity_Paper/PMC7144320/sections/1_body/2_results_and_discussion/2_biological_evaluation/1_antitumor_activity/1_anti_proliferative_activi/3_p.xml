<p>Regarding the activity towards HepG2 cells, the data displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ascribed to the tested spirooxindoles excellent to weak efficacy in inhibiting the growth of the HCC HepG2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 6.3 and 49.1 µM, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), except compounds 
 <bold>6 g</bold> and 
 <bold>6n–6p</bold> which failed to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells up to 50 μM. In particular, spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6i</bold> were found to be the most potent derivatives in this study against HepG2 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values equal to 6.9 and 6.3 μM, respectively. In addition, spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6j</bold> exhibited good activity towards HepG2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.4 and 9.9 µM, respectively), whereas, compounds 
 <bold>6 b</bold>, 
 <bold>6c</bold>, 
 <bold>6 h</bold>, 
 <bold>6k</bold> and 
 <bold>6 l</bold> elicited moderate potency against HepG2 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 12.7 − 21.0 µM. Morphological assessment revealed the toxic effects of spirooxinodoles 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6i</bold> as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> including dramatic cellular effects including cell rounding, shrinkage and monolayer disruption.
