<p id="Par15">The experimental study, here, is applied on the Egyptian case for the essential oils. The data were collected from several peer researches article including in-vitro experiments. For each case, the in-vitro experiment may only focus in analyzing the chemical composition of the EO, or apply one or more of EOs on a specific infection type (e.g. bacteria, viruses, or cancer). This encouraged the authors, here, to experiment the machine and deep learning algorithms in predicting the biological activities for some of the Egyptian essential oils-producing plants. The training and testing processes are conducted on a novel dataset of EOs-producing plants from Egypt, that are collected and manipulated by authors from peer reviewed scientific researches

 </sup>. The resulting dataset consists of a sample of one hundred and twenty (120) plants. The total chemical compounds extracted from this dataset are 573 compounds. In the proposed experimental case, the biological activities of the essential oils are classified according to eight categories of bio-activities (anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-wormal, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities).
