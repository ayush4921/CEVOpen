<p id="Par13">Many researchers have adopted the AI in EO's researches aiming to reduce the in-vitro procedures and to make reasonable predications of the experiment results. For instance, Ragno et al. (2020) have developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster the EOs and to identify the EOs that have strong ability in inhibiting bacterial growth of all bacterial strains

 </sup>. Moreover, Artini et al. (2018) have exhibited a binary classification model based on ML to classify the essential oils activities from different Mediterranean plants against pseudomonas aeruginosa

 </sup>. Similarly, Daynac et al. (2015) have used the fast artificial neural networks (FNN) to predict the antimicrobial activity of 49 EOs against four types of pathogens. The FNN algorithm predicted more than 70% of the antimicrobial activities within a 10Â mm maximum error range
