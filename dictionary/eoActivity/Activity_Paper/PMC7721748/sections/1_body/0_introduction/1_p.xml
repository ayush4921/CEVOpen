 </sup>. Deep learning is one of the most promising branches of artificial intelligence with proven power in taking the raw features extracted from the extremely large data sets, such as the data produced from genomics, chemistry, and pharmaceutical laboratories. Processing these data result in inferred patterns and training process-based predictive models
