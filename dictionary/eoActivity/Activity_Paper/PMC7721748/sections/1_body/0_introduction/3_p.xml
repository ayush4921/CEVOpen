<p id="Par4">Generally, the bioactivity of the EO-producing plant depends on the chemical structure and EOs content, which determine the overall bioactivity of such plant. EOs are, in fact, composed of different combinations of low nuclear weight natural blends with complete organic locomotion. According to their structure, these dynamic blends can be categorized into some significant pools (e.g. hydrocarbons, oxygenated mixtures, and sulfur or conceivably nitrogen). These mixesâ€™ pools are the mystery key for the biological activity of each EO
