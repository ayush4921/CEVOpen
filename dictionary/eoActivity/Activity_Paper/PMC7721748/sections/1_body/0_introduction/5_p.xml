 </sup>. ANN, in general, can be depicted as a numerical model of a particular structure, comprising of some of the single processing components (i.e. nodes and neurons), constructed between inter-connected layers. Each entire layer is mainly composed of hidden neurons which are responsible for transforming the input values and sending the outputs to the other associated neurons

 </sup>. Recently, due to the expansion of the biological information, the fully connected neural network would have a huge number of parameters, which needs full processing inside the network layers to deliver the desired output. Deep learning approaches have proven their efficiency in the applications whose data are characterized by their large quantities, high dimensionality, and highly structured. Thus, deep learning approaches are widely used in image processing due to the nature of the image which contains many thousands of variables (pixels) that can be clearly grouped into well- defined objects
