<p id="Par27">Finally, the sequence of the convolutional and pooling layers ends with a fully connected feed-forward neural layer that uses a “sigmoid” activation function. The sigmoid function is selected in the proposed CNN implementation because its function depends mainly on converting each score of the final node to a probability value between 0 to 1, independent of what the other scores are. So, the input could be classified into multiple independent classes (
