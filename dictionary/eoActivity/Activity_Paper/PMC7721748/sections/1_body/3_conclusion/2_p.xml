<p id="Par23">Due to the efficacy of the EOs as antiseptics, antimicrobials, antifungals, antioxidant, antitumor, antivirals, and anti-inflammatories, they have a great attention from the health concerns industries, such as medicine, pharmaceutics, cosmetics, and others. However, there is a significant challenge in deciding the relevance between the chemical compounds that form the EO and its biological activities through the traditional in-vitro experiments. In this study, two classification models are implemented to classify and predict the biological activities of 120 types of Egyptian essential oils as an experimental study case. This experiment has been implemented based on two types of supervised learning algorithms, Multiclass Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network in order to evaluate the efficiency of both machine and deep learning techniques. The comparison between the accuracy and relevance metrics for both MNN and CNN algorithms in the testing stage showed that the CNN outperformed the MNN as it scored an accuracy rate 98.13%, while the MNN recorded 81.88%.</p>
