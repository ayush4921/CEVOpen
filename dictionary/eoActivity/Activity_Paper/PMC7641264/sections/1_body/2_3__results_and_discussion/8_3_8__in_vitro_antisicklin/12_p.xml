<p>Indeed, hydrophobic interactions between hemoglobin S (HbS) molecules conduct to intracellular hydrophobic interactions that induce intracellular polymerization. This hemoglobin aggregation modifies the erythrocyte shape conducting to a sickled form. Plant extracts contain molecules that can interact with HbS molecules and compete with their polymerization [
