<p>Antisickling assay was carried out using Emmel test as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In brief, sickle cell blood was diluted with 150 mM phosphate buffer saline (NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> 30 mM, Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> 120 mM, and NaCl 150 mM) and mixed with an equivalent volume of 2% sodium metabisulfite. A drop of the mixture was spotted on a microscope slide in the presence of aqueous plant extracts and covered with a cover slip. Physiologic solution was used as the negative control when parahydroxybenzoic acid was used as the positive control. Paraffin was applied to seal the edges of the cover slip completely to create hypoxia condition.
