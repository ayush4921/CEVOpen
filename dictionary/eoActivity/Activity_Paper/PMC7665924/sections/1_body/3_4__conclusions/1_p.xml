<p>For the first time, an HPLC-DAD based metabolomics approach was performed to discriminate the natural and commercial medicinal slices of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> roots in Vietnam. Moreover, seven compositions were quantified to evaluate the quality of natural and commercial samples. With this approach, the natural 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> samples were significantly distinguished from the commercial ones. Large different contents of seven selected metabolites among two categories of samples indicated dramatic changes of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> chemical compositions on processing and manufacturing. On the other hand, the discrimination based on the difference of standard metabolites of commercial samples performed a considerable variation of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> quality among manufactures. Because 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> is a common traditional medicine, its quality needs to be strictly controlled. Besides emodin and THSG, interestingly, the new compound, 6-hydroxymusizin 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-apiofuranosyl-(1⟶6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside was identified as a marker for the discrimination. Overall, this study presented an effective method for precisely distinguishing natural and commercial 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> products, also possibly applying for quality evaluation of other diverse medicinal herbs.
