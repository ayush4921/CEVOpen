<p>Overall, except emodin, six other standards showed higher contents in natural samples that might lead to discrimination to CMS samples. The clusters of samples in CMS groups could base on the different contents of THSG 
 <bold>(1)</bold>, physcionin 
 <bold>(2)</bold>, emodin 8-glucoside 
 <bold>(3)</bold>, 6-hydroxymusizin 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-apiofuranosyl-(1⟶6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, pleuropyrone A 
 <bold>(6)</bold>, and torachrysone 8-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(7)</bold>, where CMS group 2 contained higher contents of standards than CMS groups 3 and 4, respectively. CMS group 1, included only the sample CMS_06, was classified by a significantly high content of emodin 
 <bold>(4)</bold>. Considerably, the variation in contents of 6-hydroxymusizin 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-apiofuranosyl-(1⟶6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(5)</bold> among analytes showed a similar trend as THSG (
 <bold>1</bold>), thus, could be used as a new marker for classification of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic>. In general, commercial 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> products were processed by steaming with black bean or stored under unappropriated conditions, which notably decreased the contents of metabolites [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The previous study reported that and 50% of stilbenes contents might decompose after high-temperature processing, which reduced sharply the toxicity of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, THSG and emodin were proved as the major anticancer, antioxidant, and antivirus agents of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]
 <italic>. T</italic>hus, the decrease in these compounds may lead to a serious decline in the quality of medicine. In addition, the obtained results showed a variation of THSG contents in CMS samples, in which the contents of THSG in natural samples may be up to 108-fold higher than CMS samples. A previous study on 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> also illustrated a high difference in the contents of major metabolites between natural and commercial processed products. Accordingly, THSG or emodin contents of natural roots might be up to 130-fold higher than in commercial products [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The variation of compositions of CMS samples in this study indicated that the quality of commercial 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> may vary significantly among manufactures due to different processing or preserving methods. Therefore, further studies should be carried out to explain clearly the reason and consequences of these issues.
