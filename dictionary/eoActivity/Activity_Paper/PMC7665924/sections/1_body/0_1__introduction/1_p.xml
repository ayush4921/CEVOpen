 <italic>Fallopia multiflora</italic> (Thunberg) Haraldson, synonym Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., is a well-known traditional medicine in several South Asian countries. The roots of this plant have been used to promote hair growth and enhance liver and kidney functions [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous studies reported that the major compounds, i.e., 2,3,4′,5-tetrahydroxystilbene 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (THSG) and emodin may exhibit hepatoprotective [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antiaging [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. THSG and other stilbenes also showed the antihyperlipidemia effect [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas emodin exhibited significant anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and tonic tension inhibiting effects [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, polyphenolics, flavonoids, glycosides, tannins, steroids, and other types of compounds were isolated from 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> which have shown remarkable antioxidant, immunomodulating, and cerebrovascular protective effects [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Commonly, roots of 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> are processed by steaming with black beans, thus, declining more than half of THSG content [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent studies showed that the contents of THSG, emodin, emodin-8-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and gallic acid could be decreased sharply at high temperature, hence, decreased its antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The phytochemicals of 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> may vary due to geographical origins. Several recent studies demonstrated that the contents of THSG, emodin, and physcion might be dramatically different due to the origins of the plants [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HPLC-fingerprint chromatography and LC-MS based metabolomics approaches are the common methods for geographical and processing discrimination of 
 <italic>F. multiflora,</italic> which illustrated clearly the markers to distinguish the samples with high accuracy [
