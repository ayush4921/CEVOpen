<p>In Vietnam, 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> has been widely used in raw materials or processed products [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, there is no effective way to classify, identify, and control the quality of commercial 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> products in Vietnam. Recently, we reported about the phenolic constituents from 
 <italic>F. multiflora</italic> roots, including THSG (
 <bold>1</bold>), physcionin (
 <bold>2</bold>), emodin 8-glucoside (

 <italic>F. multiflora</italic>. In addition, the contents of these compounds were quantified and compared among the samples.
