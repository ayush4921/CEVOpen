<p>Six samples of 3- to 4-year-old natural roots of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic>, coded Nat_1 to Nat_6, were collected in six districts of Ha Giang, a northern mountainous province in Vietnam, in October 2015. These samples were identiﬁed by Dr. Nguyen The Cuong, the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. Commercial medicinal slices (CMS) of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora,</italic> which coded CMS_1 to CMS_12 were purchased at oriental medicine stores in Hanoi, Vietnam, in November 2015. After being cut and powdered, 5 g of each sample was extracted three times in methanol under sonication condition at 30°C. Then, all of the filtrates were concentrated and made up the volume with methanol to 20 ml. The samples could be diluted if necessary. All solutions had been filtered through 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Agilent Econoﬁlters (Agilent Technologies, USA) before being injected to the HPLC system. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
