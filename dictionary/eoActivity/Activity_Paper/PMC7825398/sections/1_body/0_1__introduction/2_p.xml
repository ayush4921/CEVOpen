 <italic>Yucca schidigera</italic> and its extracts are among the medicinal plants associated with plenty of beneficial effects when applied in aquaculture [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several studies found that aquatic animals’ performances showed improvements as a direct result of using yucca as feed or water additives [

 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="B14-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dietary yucca increases protein metabolism in the fish body, with a possible reduction in ammonia excretion [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The improvement in protein metabolism enhances feed utilization and results in a high feed intake and growth rate [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Concurrently, yucca is characterized by its anti-stressor potential and beneficial effects that make it a prospective phytogenic additive for the aquaculture industry [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Yucca has abundant amounts of saponin and resveratrol, which can eliminate the waterborne ammonia and lower its impacts on aquatic animals’ performance and health [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, many commercial aquatic products include yucca and saponin in their formulation to be applied in aquaculture ponds and intensive systems. It enhances the water quality, feed intake, growth rate, anti-oxidative, and immune responses in aquatic species. Furthermore, yucca increases resistance against infectious bacteria and invaders [
