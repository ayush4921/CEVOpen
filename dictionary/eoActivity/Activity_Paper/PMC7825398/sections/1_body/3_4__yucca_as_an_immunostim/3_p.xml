<p>In this context, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] indicated that YSE dietary incorporation could boost the immunity of mirror carp (
 <italic>C. carpio</italic>) by increasing the lysozyme activity (LYZ) with the inclusion of YSE at 200 and 400 mg/kg diet and increasing C3 and C4 by using YSE at 400 mg/kg diet. Furthermore, YSE supplementation up-regulates the intestine TGF-β2 mRNA levels and downregulates the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. The authors referred to the YSE saponin content and its ability to form immunostimulatory complexes to explain the enhancement in immunity. In the same manner, Bae et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found that yucca meal at 1.5 mg/kg diet as a functional additive in olive flounder (
 <italic>P. olivaceus</italic>) diets improved nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) results and the cumulative survival rate compared to the control group. Likewise, El-Keredy and Naena [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported lower mortality and morbidity rates for Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) infected with 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in all YSE groups compared to the control, where the best survival percentage was recorded in the group that was fed 0.1% YSE. In addition, the enhancement in immunity was linked to the impacts of the active components in YSE. Similarly, Peterman et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] demonstrated that fish fed One Current™ displayed a higher survival rate compared to the control group.
