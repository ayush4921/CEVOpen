<p>For shrimp, Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that the addition of 0.2% YSE in the diet was beneficial to shrimp immunity and linked this improvement to increased serum total protein and reduced harmful and volatile chemicals. Likewise, Yeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] found that exposing giant freshwater prawns (
 <italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic>) (17.9 Â± 2.7 g) to saponin in the water at different concentrations of 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg/L for 168 hrs resulted in increasing the immunity in terms of the total hemocyte count (THC) and decreased the phenoloxidase activity and the respiratory protein level, particularly at 0.9 mg/L.
