<p>The efficacy of yucca as a natural immunostimulant substance is attributed to its high content of bioactive components (e.g., alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, steroids, phenolics, tannins, glycosides, and flavonoids) [

The aquatic organisms treated with dietary yucca showed direct enhanced local intestinal immunity, which was correlated with a general immune system enhancement due to the influence of yucca as an antibacterial agent against pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [
