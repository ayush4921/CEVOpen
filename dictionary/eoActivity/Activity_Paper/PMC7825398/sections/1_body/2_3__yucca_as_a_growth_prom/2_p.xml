<p>In this context, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] evaluated the effect of dietary incorporation of 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> extract (YSE) at different levels of 0, 200, or 400 mg/kg diet for 8 weeks on the growth performance of mirror carp (
 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) with an initial weight of 45.21 ± 0.43 g. The growth results of this study showed an enhancement in the final body weight and weight gain rate with YSE at 400 mg/kg diet compared to the control group. The boosted growth performance was linked to the alteration in the microbial population, which enhanced the feed digestion and utilization, regardless of the non-significant alteration in intestinal digestive enzymes. Moreover, Peterman et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] found a remarkable growth performance (higher weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR)) and feed utilization (lower feed conversion ratio (FCR)) after a 3 month feeding period in channel catfish (
 <italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>, 11 g initial body weight) fed a commercial blend (One Current™) of prebiotic fiber, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, essential oils, and 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> compared to the control group.
