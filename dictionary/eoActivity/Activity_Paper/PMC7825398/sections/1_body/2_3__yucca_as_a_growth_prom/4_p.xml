<p>In a different approach, Abdel-Tawwab et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] examined Nile tilapia’s (28–32 g) responses to YSE and/or the yeast 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as water additives at the level of 1 g/m
 <sup>3</sup> for 8 weeks. The results of the Nile tilapia growth were improved (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) due to the water additives and the highest growth was recorded in fish treated with YSE + yeast. Likewise, Fayed et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] studied the effect of three concentrations of YSE (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg/L) in the water on European seabass juveniles (
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>, 5.0 ± 0.5 g) for 45 days. The growth performance increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with increasing YSE levels in the water in association with the hematologic and water quality improvement.
