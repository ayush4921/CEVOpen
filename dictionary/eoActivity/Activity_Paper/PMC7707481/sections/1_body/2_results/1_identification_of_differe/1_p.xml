<p>To investigate the metabolites changes of LJF under different salt stresses (0, 100, 200, 300 mM NaCl), a metabolomic method based on HPLC-Triple TOF-MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was applied. The preliminary experiments of our research had found that a total of 300 compounds were detected in LJF by HPLC-Triple TOF-MS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243111.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), among them, 79 compounds were identified and characterized by comparisons of retention times, mass-to-charge ratio and secondary mass spectrum with authentic standards. The list of 79 compounds including 24 phenolic acids, 23 flavonoids, 15 iridoids, 12 Amino acids, 5 nucleosides was provided as

Low salt stress group (100 mM NaCl) appeared to be better than other samples in terms of relative contents (peak areas) of the wide variety of bioactive components, indicating that LJF treated with 100 mM NaCl had the best quality. Besides, the phenylpropanoid pathway, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid biosynthesis were disturbed in all salt-stress LJF.
