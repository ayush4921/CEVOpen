<p>The changes in the metabolic level of LJF stressed by 300 mM NaCl compared to the control group were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g003">Fig 3</xref>. It is noteworthy that shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway metabolites (e.g. quinic acid (1.23-fold), caffeic acid (1.18-fold), ferulic acid (0.92-fold), isochlorogenic acid A (1.71-fold), isochlorogenic acid C (0.49-fold), luteolin-5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (4.25-fold), lonicerin (3.67-fold), flavoyadorinin-B (0.81-fold), isoquercitrin (1.05-fold), and astragalin (1.71-fold)) were prominently decreased compared to the control group. And the iridoids such as morroniside (1.08-fold), swertiamarine (1.01-fold), loganic acid (0.77-fold) showed a downward trend as well as phenolic acid and flavonoid at high salt-treated samples, while, centauroside (1.89-fold), secologanin (1.49-fold) were increased. In the past decades, more than 30 iridoids have been reported from

 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, 15 iridoids were identified from LJF treated with different salt stress. Such as loganin, kingiside, secoxyloganin, sweroside, loganin acid, morroniside, vogeloside, and swertiamarine. By OPLS-DA analysis, the control group and high salt-treated group could be completely separated in positive and negative mode, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243111.s003">S3C Fig</xref>. To our knowledge, there is no information on the changes of iridoids in LJF under different salt stress. The results provided detailed information for the quantification of iridoids in LJF.
