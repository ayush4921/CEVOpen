<p>In addition to the changes observed at 100 mM NaCl, samples with medium salt-treated also induced caffeic acid (2.02-fold), 1,3-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1.15-fold), chlorogenic acid (1.17-fold), 1,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (0.52-fold) compared with the control group; and the key components of flavonoid, especially flavone and flavanol biosynthesis, luteolin-5-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside (2.73-fold), lonicerin (3.01-fold), flavoyadorinin-B (2.29-fold), the relative contents rose more at 200 Mm NaCl; besides, hyperoside (1.22-fold), genistein (1.08) have also increased. However, the synthesis of quercetin was reduced under medium salt stress; it might indicate quercetin was used to synthesis other flavonoids to defense salt stress. Through OPLS-DA analysis, the control group and low salt-treated group could be completely separated in positive and negative mode, respectively (
