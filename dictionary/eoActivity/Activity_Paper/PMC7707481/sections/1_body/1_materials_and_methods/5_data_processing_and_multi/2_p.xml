<p>The data from PeakView1.2 and MarkerView were further exported to SIMCA-P software (Version 13.0, Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis. Unsupervised PCA was performed to elucidate the total metabolic differences among the samples between control and salinity stress groups. The supervised OPLS-DA was carried out multiple times. The ellipses shown in the score plots of PCA and OPLS-DA was defined as a 95% confidence interval for model changes. VIP representing the weighted sum of squares of OPLS-DA analysis was performed. When VIP was great than 1, there was a significant difference in metabolites. Hierarchical clustering analysis of samples based on the significantly changed metabolite was executed by the software of Heml 1.0 Heatmap Illustrator. The column represents 47 metabolites with significant differences, and the row represents samples with different salt stress conditions, respectively.</p>
