<p>The perennial twining woody vine 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb. (Caprifoliaceae) is cultivated worldwide as an ornamental plant and commonly used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Its flower buds are listed as the top grade in ‘Ming Yi Bie Lu’ and recorded in Chinese pharmacopeia as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF). LJF has been used thousands of years for the treatment of fever, infections, sores, and swelling. Modern pharmacological studies also prove that it possesses antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and hepatoprotective activities [

They are phenolic acid and flavonoid derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, the accumulation and synthesis of metabolites is the result of the interaction of endogenous genes and exogenous environment factors. Therefore, a systematic quality assessment method is needed for the quality control of herbal medicines under salt stress.
