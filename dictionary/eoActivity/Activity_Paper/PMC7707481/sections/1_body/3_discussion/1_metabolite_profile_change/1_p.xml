<p>The variation in metabolites of LJF is significantly different between the control and salt-treated samples. Phenolics compound are the most used dietary antioxidants, most of them were derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Especially phenolic acid and flavonoid are major components in LJF; Among them, luteoloside and chlorogenic acid are the quantitative component in LJF. Therefore, it is necessary to study how luteoloside, chlorogenic acid and other bioactive components distribute in plant under salt stress. It is reported that the elevated level of chlorogenic acid could enhance oxidative damage tolerance [

 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, these ingredients also exhibit other pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, antihyperglycemic, and anticancer. And we found that the contents of phenolic acid were much higher under low salt stress compared to other groups. Flavonoids are a class of compounds with 2-phenylchromone structure. It plays an important role in plant growth, development, flowering, fruiting, and antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant aspects. In recent years, much effort has been performed to elucidate the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway from a molecular genetic point of view [
 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; and several breakthroughs have been made in the flavonoid pathway. Although Arabidopsis thaliana is helpful to analyze the regulation pathway of flavonoids, it is not exactly applicable to non-model plants. Hence, more research needs to be conducted, especially in medicinal plants under salt stress. In this study, the quality marker of chlorogenic acid and luteoloside in LJF increase 1.3, 1.28-fold under salt stress, respectively. This results further support the reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. And that's consistent with our hypothesis. Besides, primary metabolites not only constitute essential nutrients for plant growth, but also protect cellular membranes integrality under salt stress. In the study, the contents of proline, serine, and lysine all significantly changed under salt stress. And proline, which is an osmoprotectant, be screened out as a differential marker under salt stress; This may be related to the salt tolerance of LJF. In addition, the molecular mechanism that the accumulation of secondary metabolites in LJF under low salt stress, which will be further analyzed combining with the data of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics.
