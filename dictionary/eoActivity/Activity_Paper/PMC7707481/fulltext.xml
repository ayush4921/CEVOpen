However, medicinal plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape from salt stress. They acclimatize themselves to the stress by reprogramming their metabolic pathways. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF) with strong antioxidant activity is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, tea, and beverage. Nevertheless, the variation of integrated metabolites in LJF under different salt stresses remains unclear. In this study, High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC- triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to comparatively investigate the metabolites changes in LJF under different salt stress (0, 100, 200, 300 mM NaCl). Total 47 differential metabolites were screened from 79 metabolites identified in LJF under different salt stress. Low salt-treated group (100 mM NaCl) appeared to be the best group in terms of relative contents (peak areas) of the wide variety in bioactive components. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid pathway, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid biosynthesis were disturbed in all salt-stress LJF. The results showed that LJF metabolisms were dramatically induced under salt stress and the quality of LJF was better under low salt stress. The study provides novel insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and a beneficial framework of knowledge applied to improvement the medicinal value of LJF.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Jiangsu Graduate Scientific Research and Practice Innovation Plan</institution></funding-source><award-id>KYCX20-1499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0911-5934</contrib-id><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Zhichen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Jiangsu Graduate Scientific Research and Practice Innovation Plan (KYCX20-1499).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The growth, development, and production of medicinal plant are usually affected by various environmental conditions including salinity [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], drought [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], nutrient [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cold [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], abiotic stress and biotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soil salinity is the most common stress that can stimulate the accumulation of compatible osmolytes and antioxidants [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Primary metabolites including fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides are synthesized by all plant species and play important roles in the life cycle of plants [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As an autotrophic organism, plant can accumulate and synthesize specialized metabolites, such as phenolic, flavonoid, terpenoid, and other secondary metabolites to acquire a competitive advantage under environmental stresses. However, the accumulated and synthesized of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants under salt stress are still poorly known. Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites that possess the high antioxidant capacity to protect plants from oxidative damage under abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Up to now, the functions of phenolic compounds on the adaptation of plants to the environment are still elusive. Understanding the alterations of plant metabolome under salt stress could provide potential clues to improve salt tolerance and quality in plants.</p><p>The perennial twining woody vine <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb. (Caprifoliaceae) is cultivated worldwide as an ornamental plant and commonly used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Its flower buds are listed as the top grade in &#x02018;Ming Yi Bie Lu&#x02019; and recorded in Chinese pharmacopeia as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF). LJF has been used thousands of years for the treatment of fever, infections, sores, and swelling. Modern pharmacological studies also prove that it possesses antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and hepatoprotective activities [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; and bioactive compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids, iridoids, and volatile oil comprise of the pharmacological properties. Recently, LJF has also been applied to suppress COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which poses a substantial threat to public health worldwide. In addition to being used in traditional Chinese medicine, LJF is also used as a food additive in tea, beverage, and wine, which is called &#x0201c;functional food&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among, chlorogenic acid and luteoloside are the major qualitative markers of LJF recorded in the Chinese pharmacopeia. They are phenolic acid and flavonoid derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, the accumulation and synthesis of metabolites is the result of the interaction of endogenous genes and exogenous environment factors. Therefore, a systematic quality assessment method is needed for the quality control of herbal medicines under salt stress.</p><p>Salinity stress promotes the accumulation and synthesis of effective components in LJF, especially chlorogenic acid, and other phenolic components, but the precise mechanisms of the action need further attention [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, we speculated that salinity might enhance the quality of LJF. Nevertheless, controlling or evaluating the quality of herbal medicine using bioactive compounds is biased, as the complexity and incomplete knowledge of the bioactive compounds. Hence, it is necessary to systemically investigate bioactive compounds and their synthesis in LJF under salt stress to select the optimal growth environment for medicinal quality improvement. The metabolomic approach has been widely applied to comprehensively analyze metabolites and discover biomarkers of salt stress in medicinal plants [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. LC-MS is regarded as one of the most common methods in metabolomics, which has been widely used to investigate the metabolic profiles of plant materials. Recently, several LC-MS methods are established for qualitative and quantitative analysis of bioactive compounds in traditional Chinese medicine in our laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, LJF was treated with varying saline concentrations (0, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl) for 35 days. A metabolic profiling method based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass/mass spectrometer (HPLC-Triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were employed to identify the significant metabolites, discriminate the groups, and screen differential metabolites. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of primary and secondary metabolites were also investigated in LJF to evaluate the effect of salt stress. Our study provides insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and can be used as a powerful method to improve the medicinal evaluation for the development of LJF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p>Methanol and acetonitrile of HPLC grade were purchased from Merck (Damstadt, Germany); ultrapure water was prepared using a Milli-Q purifying system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA); standard compounds of chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, loganin, proline, alanine, serine, leucine, lysine, histidine, arginine, cytidine, uridine, adenosine, and phenylalanine were obtained from Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co.

Phenolics compound are the most used dietary antioxidants, most of them were derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Especially phenolic acid and flavonoid are major components in LJF; Among them, luteoloside and chlorogenic acid are the quantitative component in LJF. Therefore, it is necessary to study how luteoloside, chlorogenic acid and other bioactive components distribute in plant under salt stress. It is reported that the elevated level of chlorogenic acid could enhance oxidative damage tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; and caffeic acid is not only rapidly absorbed and maintained metabolically stable but also has the same antioxidant capacity as chlorogenic acid [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, these ingredients also exhibit other pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, antihyperglycemic, and anticancer. And we found that the contents of phenolic acid were much higher under low salt stress compared to other groups. Flavonoids are a class of compounds with 2-phenylchromone structure. It plays an important role in plant growth, development, flowering, fruiting, and antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant aspects. In recent years, much effort has been performed to elucidate the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway from a molecular genetic point of view [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; and several breakthroughs have been made in the flavonoid pathway. Although Arabidopsis thaliana is helpful to analyze the regulation pathway of flavonoids, it is not exactly applicable to non-model plants. Hence, more research needs to be conducted, especially in medicinal plants under salt stress. In this study, the quality marker of chlorogenic acid and luteoloside in LJF increase 1.3, 1.28-fold under salt stress, respectively. This results further support the reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. And that's consistent with our hypothesis. Besides, primary metabolites not only constitute essential nutrients for plant growth, but also protect cellular membranes integrality under salt stress. In the study, the contents of proline, serine, and lysine all significantly changed under salt stress. And proline, which is an osmoprotectant, be screened out as a differential marker under salt stress; This may be related to the salt tolerance of LJF. In addition, the molecular mechanism that the accumulation of secondary metabolites in LJF under low salt stress, which will be further analyzed combining with the data of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Global visualization of pathways changes and proposed phenolic acid, flavonoid and iridoid biosynthesis of LJF exposed to salt stress</title><p>The chemical interactions between plants and the environment are mainly mediated by the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and much of these metabolites are derivatives of primary metabolites produced by plants [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Primary metabolite citric acid is a key metabolic component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), generating energy and providing adaptive flexibility for adverse environments. Most secondary metabolite biosynthesis starts from basic pathways, such as glycolysis or shikimic acid pathways [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Shikimic acid is a precursor for the aromatic amino acids, alkaloids, tannins, and lignin. According to the type of secondary metabolites in plants, they can be divided into three major classes of biosynthetic pathways including nitrogen-containing compounds (cyanogenic glycosides, alkaloids, and glucosinolates), phenolic compounds (flavonoids and phenylpropane), and terpenes (isoprenoids). In this study, we investigate some metabolic pathways including phenolic acid, flavonoid, iridoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid, then selecting the representative pathways for more detailed analysis. The biosynthesis OF metabolite is subject to dynamic regulation by metabolic feedback and environmental factors. Therefore, to future research how these metabolites distributed under oxidative stress is important. Specifically, chlorogenic acid and luteoloside, which is the chemical markers for evaluating the quality of LJF in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 edition) [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid is one of the most widely known derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acid in the plant kingdom, and numerous reports on the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid have been published [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the biosynthetic pathway for generating chlorogenic acid is still controversial; hence, more studies remain to be carried out. The phenolic acid, flavonoid, and iridoid biosynthesis of LJF under salt stress were inferred in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Generally, the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds is believed to be primarily regulated at the transcriptional level; the above synthetic pathway provided in the reference for phenolic acid synthesis facilitated a better understanding of its transcriptional regulation. Meanwhile, it also provides new ideas for the selection of regulatory genes for metabolic engineering under salt stress. And the published studies also focus on luteoloside and flavonoid biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the subgroup pathway including isoflavinoid, flavone, and flavonol biosynthesis also should be attentioned. Besides, the pathways of iridoid metabolites were also mentioned in the study. In the subsequent, we will utilize multivariate omics data [<xref rid="pone.0243111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to better understanding the molecular changes/mechanism of LJF under salt stress, the prognostic molecular pathways will be analyzed by integrating genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic. Overall, an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism and network regulation of bioactive constituents synthesis in medicinal plants under salt stress will be an crucial research directions.</p><fig id="pone.0243111.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0243111.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways of differential metabolites in LJF under salt stress.</title><p>Metabolic pathways of phenolic acids and its interactions with other pathways in LJF under salt stress.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0243111.g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that the combination of LC-MS-based metabolomics and multivariate statistical analysis was an effective approach to distinguish and qualify LJF under different salt stress. A total of 79 compounds were identified in LJF treated with different salt stresses, 47 of them were differential compounds. Differential metabolites indicated that secondary metabolites, which were close to the antioxidant capacity, such as phenolic acid, flavonoid, and iridoid were affected in all LJF samples exposed to salt stress. Among these metabolites, significantly increases were observed at 100 mM NaCl treatment compared to the control group, while the relative contents (peak areas) of metabolites were decreased under 300 mM, indicating that low salt-treated group appeared to be better in terms of relative contents of the wide variety of bioactive components and excess salts in the soil are harmful to the development and quality of plants. Meanwhile, the biosynthesis of phenolic acid, flavonoid, and iridoid were influenced in all LJF samples under salt stress. These metabolomic changes exposed to salt stress were first reported on LJF and clearly involved in a network.
