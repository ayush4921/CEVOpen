<p>Chiocchetti et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] studied five agro-industrial food by-products, such as rice bran, pumpkin, peels from cucumber, cupua√ßu seed peel and jackfruit, in order to establish alternative sources of nutrients. They determined the macronutrients, total and dialyzable Fe, the concentrations of iron-uptake inhibitors (phytic acid, tannins, fiber) and their correlation with iron bioavailability, several compounds that are interesting antifungal agents. These authors concluded that some by-products, in particular cucumber and pumpkin peels, could be valuable alternative sources of bioavailable Fe to reduce iron deficiency in at-risk populations and may contribute significantly to iron intake. This study showed the search for new by-products that can be used as alternative and inexpensive iron sources, and research into the development of new products based on cucumber and pumpkin peel.
