 <xref rid="B8-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] describe in their work the search for biologically-active compounds from hydroxytyrosol (HXT) and their possible uses as functional ingredients in meat. They expose the health benefits provided by HXT consumption and the latest research about its use on meat. Due to its molecular structure, its regular consumption has several beneficial effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and as a protector of skin and eyes, etc. For these reasons, the use of HXT extract is a good strategy for use in meat products to replace synthetic additives. However, this extract has a strong odour and flavour, so it is necessary to previously treat this compound in order to not alter the organoleptic quality of the meat product when is added as an ingredient. For that reason, researchers have currently been focused on the encapsulation of this extract and the production of emulsion gels to prevent the sensorial alteration of meat products. In addition, the inclusion on meat endogenously, through the animal diet, or through its application in new packaging systems are the best strategies in order to introduce it into meat products.
