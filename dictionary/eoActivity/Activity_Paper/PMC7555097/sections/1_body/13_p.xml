<p>In the current publication, Serrano et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reviewed the potential anti-inflammatory health effects of traditional herbs. This review includes a summary of the dose–response anti-inflammatory activity of little-studied traditional botanical species, such as citrus fruit extracts rich in hesperidin, camu-camu (
 <italic>Myrciaria dubia</italic>), blackcurrant (
 <italic>Ribes nigrum</italic>), devil’s claw (
 <italic>Harpagophytum procumbens</italic>) and cat’s claw (
 <italic>Uncaria tomentosa</italic>). All these extracts reported greater or similiar effects than tea and cocoa. In addition, the known pathways of action and the potential synergistic effects of the constituent compounds of the extracts were also discussed.
