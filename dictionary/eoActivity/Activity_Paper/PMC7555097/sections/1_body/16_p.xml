<p>Agregan et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] provide a study of the the antioxidant potential of extracts obtained from three brown macroalgae, such as 
 <italic>Fucus vesiculosus, Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifurcaria bifurcata</italic>, and two microalgae, such as 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> using a green and innovative extraction (ultrasound-assisted extraction using water/ethanol). Among the obtained macroalgae extracts, Bifurcaria bifurcata and the other macroalgaes were particularly suitable to be used as sources of phenolic antioxidants and to be included in products for human consumption.
