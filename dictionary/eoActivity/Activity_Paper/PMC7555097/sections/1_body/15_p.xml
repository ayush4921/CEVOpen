 <xref rid="B4-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] describe their work to find biologically-active compounds from two extracts of the plant species 
 <italic>Euphorbia dendroides</italic> L. They describe several compounds that are interesting antiproliferative and antioxidant antifungal agents, such as chlorogenic and gallic acids as major compounds. The two extracts exhibited antioxidant and anticancer activity. Based on the total phenolics and flavonoids contents, they concluded that the two extracts of
