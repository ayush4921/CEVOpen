 <italic>Mespilus germanica</italic> L. hydroacetonic extract on streptozocin-induced diabetic BALB/c mice. The serum glucose lowering, normalization animal body weight, and antioxidative stress effects of 
 <italic>Mespilus germanica</italic> L. leaf extract were investigated in normal and streptozotocin-induced BALB/c mice. The present study indicated that the 
 <italic>Mespilus germanica</italic> leaf extract significantly decreased serum glucose and maintained normal body weight in BALB/c diabetic mice as compared with control groups. In addition, this extract decreased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, this species and other citable plants are very valuable and should be evaluated in experimental and clinical trials for their pharmacological efficacy and the discovery of new approved drugs for diabetes mellitus.
