<p>Therefore, it is reasonable to imagine that, over the next few decades, the uses of natural extracts from medicinal plants will rapidly increase. In this sense, the search for new, effective and cheap sources of bioactive compounds is attracting food industry interest. However, it is important to study the implication on sensory characteristics of natural extracts of medicinal plants on foods to select specific raw materials; some of them of residual origin are especially promising due to their lower costs. Natural extracts from medicinal plants can be used as effective strategies for the production of functional foods, therefore achieving a significant increase in social and environmental sustainability. However, extensive research on sensory characteristics, antioxidant and antimicrobial sources, optimization of concentration of the extracts and a better knowledge of the mechanisms of the implication on shelf life of food, is still required.</p>
