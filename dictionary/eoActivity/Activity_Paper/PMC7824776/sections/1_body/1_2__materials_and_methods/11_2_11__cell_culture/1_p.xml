 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The complete medium was changed twice a week and subcultures were performed when the cells reached a 75% confluence. Cells were counted using trypan blue reagent and Countess
 <sup>®</sup> Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher, Scoresby, VIC, Australia). All assays used the cells at passage numbers less than twenty.
