<p>RT qPCR analyses were set up as described in SensiFAST™ SYBR No-ROX kit (Bioline, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia) and performed at 95 °C for 2 min, succeeded by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 10 s using a Rotor-Gene Q machine (Qiagen, Chadstone, VIC, Australia). β-actin was used as a reference gene. The primer specificity was confirmed by the analysis of melting curve. The relative quantification of gene expression was accomplished following 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method [
