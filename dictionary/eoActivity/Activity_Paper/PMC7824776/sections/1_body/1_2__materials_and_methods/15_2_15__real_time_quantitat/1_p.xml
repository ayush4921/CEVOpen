<p>Total cellular RNA was isolated from the HepG2 cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Chadstone, VIC, Australia). Complementary DNA templates were synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA in 20 μL assays, using SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis kit (Bioline). Reactions were set at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by 42 °C for 15 min, 48 °C for 15 min, 85 °C for 5 min and finally cooled at 4 °C before being stored at −20 °C. Primers (
