 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added. After 2 h incubation at ambient temperature, the mixture was read at 760 nm absorbance using a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Data are the mean of four replicates ± SD. Gallic acid standards ranging from 0 to 100 μg/mL were used to construct a calibration curve.
