<p>The viability of HepG2 cells under the effect of medicinal honeys was assayed using PrestoBlue
 <sup>®</sup> kit (Invitrogen, Australia). An amount of 100 μL of complete DMEM medium containing 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well was pipetted on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Ten hours later, the media was discarded, and the cells were incubated in free-serum DMEM overnight. Honey solutions in a range of 0–20% (

 <italic>v</italic>) were prepared in 2% FBS-DMEM and applied to the cells. After 24-, 48- and 72-h incubation with honeys, the cells were washed with PBS twice followed by adding PrestoBlue reagent 10.0% in free-serum medium followed by another two-hour incubation. The fluorescence intensity was recorded at 535 nm/590 nm using a POLARstar spectrophotometer (BMG LabTech, Ortenberg, Germany). Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of the fluorescence unit of treated cells to control, which is untreated cells.
