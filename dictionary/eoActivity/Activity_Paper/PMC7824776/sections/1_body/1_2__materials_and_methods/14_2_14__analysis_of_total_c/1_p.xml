<p>Lipids were extracted from cell pellets following Folch et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The dry lipid was dissolved in 200 μL methanol for the subsequent determination of total cellular cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) by enzymatic methods, using Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Scoresby, VIC, Australia) and EnzyChrom Triglyceride Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) respectively. Cellular protein content was assayed based on bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Scoresby, VIC, Australia). TC and TG contents were normalized to relevant protein content (µg/mg cellular protein) and expressed in fold change relative to control (1.0 mM fatty acid treatment).
