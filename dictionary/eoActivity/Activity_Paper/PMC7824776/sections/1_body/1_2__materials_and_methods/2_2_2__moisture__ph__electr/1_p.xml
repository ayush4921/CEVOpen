<p>Moisture, pH and electrical conductivity were measured following the International Honey Commission method [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moisture content was recorded using a Refracto 30GS refractometer (Mettler Toledo, Port Melbourne, VIC, Australia) and converted following a Chetaway table. pH value was measured from 10% honey solutions. Electrical conductivity was measured from 20% honey solutions (
