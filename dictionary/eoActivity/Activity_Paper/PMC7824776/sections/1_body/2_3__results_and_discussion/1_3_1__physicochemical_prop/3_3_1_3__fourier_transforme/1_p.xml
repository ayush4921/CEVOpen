<p>Chemometric analysis of the medicinal honeys using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) exhibited five vibrational regions assigned for specific chemical bonds that are typical for natural honeys (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The regions of 3700–3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 3000–2800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicate the O–H stretching of water molecules, and C–H stretching of sugars, respectively [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A peak appears at 1624 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in all honeys and is assigned for the bending of H–O–H molecules [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The 1540–1175 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region indicated the presence of bending modes for C–O–H, C–C–H, and O–C–H groups [

 <sup>−1</sup> bands known as a fingerprint region for honey’s sugars were specific for stretching modes of C–O and C–C from carbohydrates (Anjos, Campos, Ruiz, and Antunes, 2015). Bands in the range 900–750 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicated the stretching modes of C–O and C–C of saccharide molecules [
