<p>Moisture content (MC) is a critical factor determining honey quality and affecting other physical properties of honey such as sugars, crystallization, viscosity and stability [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. High MC also promotes the growth of osmotolerant yeasts, which deteriorates the quality of honey. MC depends on several factors such as weather and maturity of honey. In the present study, moisture content was considerably low in arjuna, guggul and jiaogulan honeys (14.9%, 13.4% and 14.0%, respectively), compared to manuka and olive honeys (18.5% and 18.4%) (
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00151-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results indicated MC values recorded in the tested honeys (including the 4 we produced) were well below 20.0%, the imposed limit for natural nectar honeys and consistent to previous findings which reported a moisture range of 13.0â€“19.0% for natural honeys from various origins [
