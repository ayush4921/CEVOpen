<p>Monosaccharides (fructose and glucose) are the major components of honey and they govern the physical state of honey. 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00151-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicates that the total content of fructose and glucose is over 60 g/100 g for all medicinal honeys, except olive honey (49.2 g/100 g honey). The results comply with the regulation by Council Directive 2001/110/EC [

In addition, the ratio of fructose/glucose (F/G) is important for the development of crystal sugar nuclei in honey, as it has been reported that honey having F/G ratio &gt; 1 can be stored longer without crystallization, in contrast, honey having F/G ratio &lt; 1 develops crystals rapidly, leading to unfavored color and texture. In the current study, all tested honeys presented F/G ratios &gt; 1 that are comparable to most natural honeys [
