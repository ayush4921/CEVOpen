 <italic>Nrf2</italic> and 
 <italic>NQO1</italic> genes have been extensively studied for their defense responses against cytotoxicity and oxidation. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f004">Figure 4</xref> showed that the analogue, manuka honey and jiaogulan activated 
 <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene at both 1.0% and 2.0%. Other honeys did not show their effect on this gene but they upregulated the downstream 
 <italic>NQO1</italic>, thus 
 <italic>Nrf2</italic> had possibly been expressed differently in these honey treatments before the experimental terminating time (24 h) and later was recorded at the detected level [
