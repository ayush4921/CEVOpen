<p>HepG2 cells were treated with individual honeys (1.0% and 2.0%) in the presence of 1.0 mM of fatty acids (oleic/palmitic; 2:1) and their total cellular cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides content (TG) were recorded after 24 h (

Cellular TG strongly increased (&gt;3.0 fold of the control) by fatty acids treatments and the addition of any medicinal honey did not reduce TG accumulation in the liver cells. The results will be discussed together with gene expression data.
