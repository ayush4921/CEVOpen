<p>Manuka honey (

 <italic>HMGCR</italic> mRNA abundance as in the control, but it upregulated 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> gene expression. The transcriptional level of 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> gene is highly controlled by cellular sterol levels though the activation of 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic>, in which an elevation in cellular sterol level suppresses 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> gene transcription and in contrast, a depletion of cellular sterols leads to an elevated 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> mRNA abundance and subsequently, an increased clearance of plasma LDL particles [
