<p>To understand the effect of honey on cholesterol homeostasis at molecular levels, we explored the expression of associated genes in HepG2 cells (

 <italic>SREBP</italic>-2, 
 <italic>HMGCR</italic>, 
 <italic>LDLR</italic>, 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>). As honey is composed of sugar and non-sugar components, an analogue which consists of sugars similar to the composition of honeys (40% fructose, 35% glucose and 5% sucrose) was examined for the effect of the sugars on the genes and relative contrast to the tested honeys.
