<p>Jiaogulan honey (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>E) induced the expression of the tested genes in a pattern that should lead to a lower TC content, but this TC reduction was not recorded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>E). Our TC data obtained for this honey opposed previous studies, which reported that jiaogulan extracts (0.1–0.3 mg/mL) reduce TC in primary hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and total saponin extract of jiaogulan leaves activates AMPK, LXRα and its target transporters (ABCG5 and ABCG8) and reduces TC in hepatocytes of animal models [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>F) stimulated 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic>, 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> and 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> genes at 2.0% concentration which could be relevant for the TC reduction, but this expectation also did not happen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). As olive retentate contains an enriched and purified source of low-molecular-weight polyphenols that are usable for food and pharmaceutical industries, it is supposed to confer a protective effect on oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, it is evidenced that cholesterol exits as free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In the current investigation, although jiaogulan and olive honeys did not lead to a decrease in TC content after 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>E,F), they possibly induced a conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters through the esterification of cholesterol with fatty acids to protect the cells from free cholesterol toxicity, while modulating the tested genes in the pattern of 
 <italic>AMPK-SREBP2</italic> pathway, responsive to a reduction in cellular free cholesterol content [
