<p>It has been reported that oxidative stress closely links to dysregulated lipid homeostasis, thus, we explored the transcription factor NF-E2-related factors 2 (
 <italic>Nrf2</italic>) and its downstream gene, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (
 <italic>NQO1</italic>), which are central in defense responses to oxidative stress [

 <italic>AMPK</italic>), a key energy sensor has been extensively investigated in lipid metabolism pathways because its activation induces ATP-generating pathways, including the uptake and oxidation of glucose and fatty acids [
