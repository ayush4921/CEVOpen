<p>Cholesterol metabolism is co-regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (
 <italic>SREBP-2</italic>) and liver X receptors (
 <italic>LXRs</italic>) in the liver. 
 <italic>SREBP</italic>-2 preferentially modulates genes associated with cholesterol synthesis and uptake (
 <italic>HMGCR</italic> and 
 <italic>LDLR</italic>, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 
 <italic>LXRs</italic> are responsible for reducing cholesterol absorption in intestine and promoting the excretion of bile cholesterol in the liver through upregulating membrane transporters [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas proliferator-activated receptor alpha (
 <italic>PPARα</italic>) is a critical molecule that controls the transcription of downstream genes of the lipid catabolism. The activation of 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> enhances the β-oxidation of fatty acids, reducing the content of cellular lipids [

As such, in the current study, manuka honey and four other honeys newly developed in The Pangenomics Laboratory, RMIT University, were examined for their standard quality and effects on the aforementioned biomarkers in fatty acid-induced HepG2 cells. This cell line was used as it is highly differentiated and exhibits several genotypic characteristics of normal liver cells, including cholesterol synthesis and excretion [
