<p id="p0080">GC polysaccharide exhibit antibacterial potential 
 <italic>vs</italic> S. aureus and E. coli were studied and described in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). As depicted in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, GC polysaccharide antibacterial function 
 <italic>vs S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was concentration-dependent (0.25–3.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), and polysaccharides from GC exhibited enriched antibacterial potential 
 <italic>vs S. aureus</italic> than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The GC polysaccharide inhibition zones toward 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at a dose of 0.25 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were found to be 10.39 ± 0.42 and 6.89 ± 0.65 mm, respectively. Once the dose of GC polysaccharide has risen to 3 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, the zone inhibitions were 19.65 ± 1.06 mm and 13.91 ± 0.76 mm of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. In line with previous reports (
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> demonstrated stronger antimicrobial potential 
 <italic>vs S. aureus</italic> than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Another research showed that polysaccharide antimicrobial production from fruits of B. papyrifera toward S. aureus was greater than that of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2016</xref>). The GC polysaccharides display stronger antimicrobial potential against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in present research. GC polysaccharides' MIC against S. aureus and E. coli were 0.56 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1.06 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively. The GC polysaccharide is indicated to be a significant and active constituent for food and pharmaceutical businesses (
