<p id="p0085">A mechanism for antimicrobial activity of a GC polysaccharide that interact with outer and inner cell membrane permeability that diminishes the production of protein synthesis and inhibition of nucleic acids. ALP exists between the cell membrane and the cell nucleus, with β-Gal in the cell membrane. Under normal conditions, their activities cannot be identified in the culture medium. As is evident from 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B, ALP behaviors in the control group culture medium and experiment group were essentially invariable amongst 1 and 6 h, suggesting cell wall stability. While experimental group ALP behaviors grown exponentially between 8 and 10 h, this may be attributed to GC polysaccharides induced cell lysis. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C reported that the development of β-galactosidase in the experimental population culture medium displayed a strong growing pattern and that the level of β-glucosidase in E. coli (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D) was lower than that in S. aureus. These findings hypothesize that GC polysaccharides may damage inner membrane permeability of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. A few reports propose that the antibacterial potential of polysaccharides may be identified with rupture the outer and inner cell membrane of pathogens (
