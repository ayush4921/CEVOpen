Natural polyphenols exert their useful health effects mainly via their antioxidant potential by reducing the concentration of oxygen, interrupting singlet oxygen, averting beginning of the first chain by scavenging early hydroxyl radicals, attaching metal ion catalysts, and decomposing primary oxidation products to non-radical organisms, and breaking chains to avoid continued extraction of hydrogen from substances (

Free radicals play a major role in human health and are helpful in the battle against various diseases such as inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, and lung damage (
