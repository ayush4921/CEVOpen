<p>In acute oral toxicity test, leaves extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> revealed no mortality at the 2 gm/kg bodyweight concentration in mice. The mice did not also demonstrate any toxic effects like changes in behavioral activities such as anxiety, polyuria, diarrhea, seizures, and coma which received the extract. Thus, the median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> is &gt;2gm/kg. This finding supports the tough evidence of the non-toxic outcome of the plant.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This extract is therefore safe and this could explain the safe use of this plant by the local people who have been using it in the traditional treatment of malaria in Ethiopia.
