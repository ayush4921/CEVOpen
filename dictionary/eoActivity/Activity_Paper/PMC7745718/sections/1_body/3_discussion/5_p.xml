<p>Bodyweight loss is one of the most common features in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> infected mice.
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Therefore, a potential antimalarial plant product is expected to preserve these parameters in 
 <italic>p. berghei</italic> infected mice due to the rise in the level of parasitemia.

This effect could have been contributed from the overall improvement of packed cell volume and parasite clearance among extract-treated groups.

 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> However, the lower doses of the extract did not prevent body weight loss in all experimental protocol, although there was significant suppression of parasitemia. This indicates the contribution of other factors for these reductions beyond malaria infection. The weight loss could be due to catabolic action on stored lipids or anorexigenic effect of the extract that may lead to reduced food intake because of the presence of appetite-suppressant phytoconstituents in the extract.

 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> may possess appetite-suppressing activity which could be attributed to flavonoids, saponins, and phenolic compounds.
