<p>In the present study, the antioxidant activity of the leaves extract of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> was tested using DPPH free radical. The extract exhibited antioxidant activity as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. There was concentration-dependent free radical scavenging activity by the extract and the standard drug. Ascorbic acid was used as a standard drug for the determination of the antioxidant activity by DPPH method. The concentration of ascorbic acid and the 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> varied from 50 to 1000µg/mL. The percentage inhibitions of the extract were: 27.43%, 35.67%, 50.02%, 65.43%, 72.32%, 79.86%, and 82.54% at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000μg/mL concentration of the extract, respectively. Likewise, the percentage inhibitions of ascorbic acid were: 35.21%, 50.21%, 65.43%, 77.53%, 86.43%, 90.42%, 96.83% at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000μg/mL concentration of the standard drug, respectively. Furthermore, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the extract and ascorbic acid were: 9.37μg/mL, and 2.31μg/mL, respectively (
