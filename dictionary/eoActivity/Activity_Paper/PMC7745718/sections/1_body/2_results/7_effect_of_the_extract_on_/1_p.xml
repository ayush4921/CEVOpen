<p>In the curative test, the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> showed a dose-dependent parasitemia suppression (33.76%, 39.24%, and 53.59% at 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg, respectively). As summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> exhibited a significant (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001) curative action at the doses of 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg on the 7th day from a thin blood smear. The mean survival time in the curative test was significant at the middle (200mg/kg, p&lt;0.001) and highest dose (400mg/kg, p&lt;0.0001) of crude extract as compared to the negative control. Similarly, the mean survival time of mice treated with the standard drug significantly (p&lt;0.0001) extended when compared to the untreated group (
