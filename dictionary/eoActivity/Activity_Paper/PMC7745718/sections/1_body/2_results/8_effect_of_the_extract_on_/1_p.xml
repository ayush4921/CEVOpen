<p>All doses of the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg) significantly (p&lt;0.0001) prevented the PCV reduction when compared to the untreated group (

Similarly, chloroquine 25 mg/kg significantly (p&lt;0.0001) prevented the packed cell volume reduction when compared to the negative control group. Excluding the lower dose (100mg/kg), both the middle (200mg/kg) and higher (400mg/kg) doses of the extract exhibited a significant (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively) increment of body weight as compared to the untreated group. Similarly, the standard drug showed significant (p&lt;0.0001) increment of body weight change between the seventh and fourth day as compared to the untreated group. The extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and chloroquine 25 mg/kg significantly (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, and p&lt;0.001, respectively) prevents the drop of temperature compared to the untreated group. Though, the lower dose (100mg/kg) of the extract failed to prevent the drop of temperature as compared to the negative control group (
