<p>The crude extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> showed a significant parasitemia suppression (25%, p&lt;0.001; 32.84%, p&lt;0.0001; and 50%, p&lt;0.0001), at 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg doses the extract, respectively, as compared to the negative control. Likewise, the standard drug significantly (p&lt;0.0001, 100%) suppressed the parasitemia level when compared with the negative control group (

Regarding the mean survival time, mice that received the middle dose (200 mg/kg) and the higher dose (400mg/kg) of the extract had longer MST (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) as compared to the negative control group. However, the lower dose (100 mg/kg) of the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> did not show a significant difference in MST when compared with the negative control (
