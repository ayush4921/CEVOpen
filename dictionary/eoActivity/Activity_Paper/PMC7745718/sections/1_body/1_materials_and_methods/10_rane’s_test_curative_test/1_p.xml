 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA strain (Chloroquine sensitive) was injected into 25 Swiss Albino mice, intraperitoneally (IP). After 72 hours, the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups of 6 mice each. Subsequently, 3 different doses of the extract (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg/day), chloroquine phosphate (25 mg/kg/day), and distilled water (1 mL/100 g/day) were given orally to the respective groups. These treatments were administered once daily for 3 consecutive days. For each mouse, thin blood film stained with 10% Giemsa was prepared from the tail blood of each mouse daily for 5 consecutive days to monitor the levels of parasitemia. The mice were further observed for 30 days. Any death that occurred during this period was recorded and used to determine the mean survival time. Similar to the chemosuppressive test, the average % parasitemia suppression was calculated.
