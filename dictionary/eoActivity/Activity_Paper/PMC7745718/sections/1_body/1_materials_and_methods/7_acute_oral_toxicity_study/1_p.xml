<p>Acute oral toxicity test was done according to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) 425 guideline for the crude extracts.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Following the acclimatization of the mice for one week, five female mice (weighing 25–28 gram, 6–8weeks of age) were employed for the acute toxicity study. Following the period of fasting, the first one mouse was weighed and the test substance 2000mg/kg bodyweight of the extract of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> was administered by the oral route. The animal was observed at least once during the first thirty minutes, intermittently during the first 24 hours, with special attention given during the first four hours and daily thereafter, for a total of 14 days. Observations include changes in skin, eyes, mucous membranes, respiratory, circulatory, autonomic, and central nervous system changes, and behavioral patterns. The mouse in the sighting test did not show any sign of toxicity for 4 days and the toxicity test of the remaining four mice for methanolic crude extract was given and followed as usual for 14 days.
