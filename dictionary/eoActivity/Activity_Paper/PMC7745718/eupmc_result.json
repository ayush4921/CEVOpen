    "<h4>Background</h4>Malaria is among the most devastating and widespread tropical parasitic diseases which is more prevalent in developing countries. <i>Acanthus polystachyus</i> (Acanthaceae) leaves are traditionally used for the treatment of malaria in Ethiopia. This study aimed to investigate the in vivo antimalarial and in vitro antioxidant activity of the leaves extract of <i>Acanthus polystachyus.</i><h4>Materials and methods</h4>The leaves part of <i>A. polystachyus</i> were extracted using 80% methanol. The antioxidant effect of <i>Acanthus polystachyus</i> extract was evaluated by using (DPPH) diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay model. To evaluate the antimalarial effect of the <i>A. polystachyus</i> extract, <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> ANKA strain (chloroquine sensitive) was used to infect the mice in three different experimental protocol: suppressive, curative, and prophylactic test models.<h4>Results</h4>The leaves extract of <i>Acanthus polystachyus</i> significantly (<i>P</i><0.05-0.0001) suppressed the parasitemia in all experimental protocol. The extract exhibited a chemosupression of 27.64%, 33.67% and 49.25% in 4-day suppressive test; 33.76%, 39.24% and 53.59% in curative test, and 25%, 32.84% and 50% in prophylactic tests at dose of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg, respectively. The extract also extended the mean survival time, prevented the bodyweight loss and body temperature drop, and packed cell volume significantly (<i>P</i><0.05) as compared to the negative control. Dose-dependent antioxidant activity was shown by the leaf extract of <i>A. polystachyus</i> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.37Âµg/mL.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current finding showed that the leaves extract of <i>Acanthus polystachyus</i> has revealed promising antimalarial effects. Thus, this finding supports the traditional use of <i>A. polystachyus</i> for the treatment of malaria."
