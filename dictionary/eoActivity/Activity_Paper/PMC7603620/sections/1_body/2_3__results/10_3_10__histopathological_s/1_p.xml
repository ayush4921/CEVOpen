 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is a photomicrograph of a cross-sectional representative of DOX-only treated heart showing myocyte congestion and antemortem coronary microthrombi when compared to untreated normal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and 
 <italic>IGESE</italic>-only treated heart tissues with normal cardiac architecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, pretreatment with varying doses of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> resulted in dose-related improvements in the histological distortions induced by DOX especially at 200 mg/kg/day (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and 400 mg/kg/day of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); although, histological features of vascular congestion were still seen with 100 mg/kg/day of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> oral pretreatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). On the contrary, there were histological features of persistent coronary microthrombi in rat heart pretreated with 20 mg/kg/day of Vit. C, indicating the lingering DOX-induced histological lesions, even with the standard antioxidant drug (
