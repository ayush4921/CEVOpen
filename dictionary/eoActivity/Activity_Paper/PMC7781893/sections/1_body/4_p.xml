<p>For phylogenetic analysis, a maximum-likelihood tree was constructed with 1000 bootstrap replicates using FastTree software (Liu etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A subset of another 17 species from the family Rutaceae was included, with 
 <italic>Toona ciliata</italic> from Meliaceae as outgroup. FastTree uses Generalized Time-Reversible (GTR), the best-fitting model of nucleotide substitution models, for nucleotide evolution analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> is placed under the family Rutaceae. The taxonomic status of 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> exhibits a closest relationship with its variant 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> var. 
 <italic>bodinieri</italic>. This finding could provide insight into conservation, exploitation and genetic evolution for this medicinal plant species.
