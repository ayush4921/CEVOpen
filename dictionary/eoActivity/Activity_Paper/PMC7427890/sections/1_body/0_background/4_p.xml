<p id="Par8">It is estimated that in the state of Santa Catarina alone, there are more than 6500 ha of abandoned areas contaminated by heavy metals from coal mining activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Due to diminishing profitability in the late twentieth century, some mined areas were abandoned while local communities developed in these locations. Even after decades of inactivity, abandoned mine areas are still contaminated by heavy metals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and may pose a risk to the food security of these communities. Some abandoned open-pit coal mines were restored according to each company’s practices, reconstructing the landscape and soil to create minimal conditions for vegetation development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The restoration process consists basically of filling the pit with pyrite and covering this layer with another layer of clay soil, covering this sterile layer with clayey regolith, and putting back soil, followed by planting species for soil fixation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, this restoration process is usually deficient, especially due to the different mining processes employed by mining companies and the lack of inspection of mined areas by responsible authorities, resulting in contamination of the surface layers of the soil with coal residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Some plant species can survive and even thrive in these contaminated sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and can be bioindicators of contamination and useful for bioremediation, if they have bioaccumulation potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Some of these species, however, also have medicinal or food use, and therefore may pose a risk to human health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, few studies are investigating whether plant resources occurring in areas contaminated by heavy metals are being used by the local population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].
