<p id="Par21">When questioned whether they were aware of the presence of contamination in abandoned mine areas, 166 residents (85%) said they were. However, when asked about harm to the environment or their lives, only 19 residents (10%) reported some type of physical discomfort (i.e., stomachache and low blood pressure), when ingesting the species 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Plectranthus barbatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Solanum paniculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>. Regarding harm to the environment, the interviewees cited atmospheric pollution, due to the excessive dust released in the region from coal extraction. All residents moved to the area after the mining activity ended and did not see what the landscape looked like before mining; however, 172 residents (88%) said they had observed changes; 113 residents (58%) reported negative changes, i.e., forest loss, fewer animals, fewer plants (this type of response was classified as negative, a posteriori, by the authors); and 58 residents (30%) reported landscape improvements, i.e., more trees, more plants, cleaner air (this type of response was classified as positive, a posteriori, by the authors). Another issue confirmed by 147 of the residents (75%) was the lack of information from public agencies and mining companies, about the environmental impacts that mining may cause and possible contamination of plant resources. Duration of residence time, gender, perceived changes in the landscape (i.e., positive, neutral, negative), location, and type of abandoned area (i.e., either abandoned or partially restored) did not affect the group of species cited by respondents (Additional file
