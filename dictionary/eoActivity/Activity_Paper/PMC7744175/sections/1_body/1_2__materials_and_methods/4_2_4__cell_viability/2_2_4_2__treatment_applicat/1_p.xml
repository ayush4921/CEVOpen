<p>Solutions of fresh extract were prepared by dissolving extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> with sterile distilled water while tamoxifen was used as a control. All mixtures of extracts were filtered using 0.22 nm filter membrane before transferring them into 96-well plates containing the two cell lines. Precisely, an amount 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> of cell concentrations were seeded in each well for 24 hours before treatment application of treatments. Cells in each of the 96-well plate were treated with different concentrations gradient of samples mixture from 1.95 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml to 1 mg/ml for different times of exposure (24, 48, and 72 hours). The procedure was done in three replications.
