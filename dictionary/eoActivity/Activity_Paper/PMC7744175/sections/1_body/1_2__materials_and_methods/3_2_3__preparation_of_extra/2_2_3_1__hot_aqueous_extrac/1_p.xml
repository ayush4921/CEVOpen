<p>The extraction method procedure was adopted from a previous study by Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with some modifications. Ten grams of mycelium powder were boiled in a 200 ml of double-distilled water in a ratio of 1 : 20 with temperature ranging from 90°C to 95°C for 20 to 30 minutes. The samples were subsequently centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was filtered using Whatman No.1 filter paper. The residues were reextracted with 100 ml of distilled water. The filtrate from two rounds of extractions were combined and dried by freeze-drying. The extract obtained and stored at 4°C was used directly for evaluation of cytotoxicity.
