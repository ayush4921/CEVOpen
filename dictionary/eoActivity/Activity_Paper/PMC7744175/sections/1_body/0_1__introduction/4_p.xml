<p>Edibility of mushrooms is based on such criteria as being nonpoisonous, desirable taste and aroma [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and unique texture [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These mushrooms are known as culinary mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Edible mushrooms are mainly consumed for their nutritional or dietary benefits. However, advances in research have discovered that mushrooms have metabolites that are medically significant and have been utilized for their anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antihypersensitive [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], antiatherosclerotic, and anticarcinogenic properties [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For this reason, edible mushrooms are those that can be consumed as either culinary-medicinal mushrooms or edible-medicinal mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, not all medicinal mushrooms are readily edible due to hard texture of their fruiting bodies. These types of mushrooms are consumed in the form of powdered extract. There are several poisonous mushrooms that had been reported such as 
 <italic>Entoloma rhodopolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Scleroderma citrinum</italic> which are known to cause rhabdomyolysis and gastrointestinal distress in animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The primary purpose of the present study was to introduce a new species of local polypore mushroom establishing its cytotoxic efficacy at the cellular level with a view of promoting further research and development of mushrooms research advances in Malaysia.
