<p>Malaysia is a megadiverse country with flora and fauna of great biodiversity. Literature has it that tropical climate is the most favorable habitat for diverse species of polypores. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] listed 4000 species of fungi found mostly from divisions or phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Estimated at about 70% of macrofungi, these phyla have not been described and discussed [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Much of the information and knowledge on the abundance of macrofungi diversity are either outdated or scattered in many different publications and not readily available [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or already out of print [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
