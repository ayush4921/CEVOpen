<p>As the concentrations were increased, hot aqueous extract induced inhibition effects at moderate level on A549. The findings suggest that hot aqueous extract had low anticancer effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml), possibly due to different pharmacological potential as reported in numerous other studies. Hot aqueous extracts of mushroom have been reported to have copious amount of carbohydrate and protein as high-molecular-weight polysaccharides and polysaccharide-protein complexes but low in fat. This feature sets mushroom as immunomodulatory by modulating immune system in the human body rather than targeting cells directly [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that the hot water extract of 
 <italic>Polyporus rhinocerus</italic> exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against HL-60 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>∼1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml). The reports concurred with Lau et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] who also reported that hot aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Lignosus rhinocerotis</italic> reduced viability of several cancer cells (A549, MCF7, HL-60, PC3, and HK1) by 50% after 72 hr duration of treatment exposure at higher concentration. Hot aqueous extracts of mushrooms were proven to be less effective against tumor cells directly unless specific extraction protocol was carried out. Jamil et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that boiled water extract from tuber of 
 <italic>L. rhinocerotis</italic> had mild cytotoxicity activity against A549 while purification of the extract changed the cytotoxicity level (57.78 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml) of the tuber on the same cell type.
