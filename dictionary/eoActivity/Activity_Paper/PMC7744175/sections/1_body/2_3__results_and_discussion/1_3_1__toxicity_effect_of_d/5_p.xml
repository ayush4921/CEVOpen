<p>In treatments of less than 72 hr duration, the effects were clearly seen on proliferation and inhibition rates of MRC5 where maximum damage occurred in the cells. The cells responded differently according to treatments. Changes in the effects of cytotoxicity as recorded in the study suggest that MRC5 cells were a toxicity marker at cellular level, as well as an indicator of whether the mushroom was edible and safe for human consumption. The present study also observed that hot aqueous mycelium extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> was safe for human consumption as the proliferation rate was recorded to be consistent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As concentrations increased, survival rates remained high. However, cold aqueous mycelium extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> demonstrated low selection ability with acute cytotoxicity at higher concentration (61.3% at 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) at which the extract inhibited normal lung cells (MRC5) with 38.7%. Hot aqueous extract at lower concentrations showed cytostatic effect on A549 cell line at lower concentration but became cytotoxic at the highest concentration. Cold aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> showed higher cytotoxicity effect compared to hot aqueous extract. For hot and cold aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic>, cell inhibition of A549 increased as treatment duration was extended. Both extracts showed significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at higher concentrations of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> against A549 cell line. At lower concentration (15.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml), tamoxifen yielded necrotic symptoms on MRC5 and A549. Tamoxifen produced the highest rate of inhibition compared to the two different aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic>.
