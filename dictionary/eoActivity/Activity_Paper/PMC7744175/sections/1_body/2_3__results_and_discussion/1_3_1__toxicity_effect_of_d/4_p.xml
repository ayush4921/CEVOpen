<p>Untreated A549 cell line had polygonal shape and remained proliferating to a confluent level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). On the other hand, cells treated with different concentrations of both aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> induced obvious morphological changes at the highest concentration. Hot water extract showed some symptoms in separation of cell fragments and in density at 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. Cell density decreased in treatment with 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml as compared to the untreated (control). At similar concentrations (500 and 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml) for cold aqueous extract, the cells progressively shrunk to smaller, rounded shape and some of the cells were observed to be detached. However, at higher concentrations, the separation of cell fragments was observed on cells treated with cold water aqueous compared to hot aqueous extract treatment. At lower concentrations, most cells remained in elongated shape with adherent ability and still attached to the surface of flasks. The majority of A549 cells were completely detrimental, remained detached, and floated in the medium after treatment with tamoxifen at concentrations of 15.625 to 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. Tamoxifen at concentration lower than 15.625 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml caused changes in cell density.
