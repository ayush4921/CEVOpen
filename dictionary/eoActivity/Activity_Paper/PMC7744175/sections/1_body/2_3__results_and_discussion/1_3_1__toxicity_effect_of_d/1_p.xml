<p>The proliferation rate of MRC5 cell line treated with hot aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> showed no significant changes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as the concentrations were increased. The survival rate was significantly higher, as treatment application times were prolonged up to 72 hr as presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. On the contrary, treatment with cold aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> showed acute cell inhibition at the highest concentration compared to hot aqueous extract with rate of inhibition being less than 40% after 72 hr of treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for both 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> extracts were more than 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on MRC5 cell line, suggesting that this mushroom was safe for human consumption. Tamoxifen was used as a positive control. The characteristics of tamoxifen were toxic at cell levels showing lowest survival rate among other treatments in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although tamoxifen was harmful to MRC5 cell line, the cells still survived at lower concentrations (1.95, 3.9, 7.8, and 15.625 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml) with survival percentages of 94.4, 93.8, 79.4, and 27.5%, respectively. The survival rates for other concentrations were approximately zero. Cell survival rates for other concentrations were recorded to be near zero. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the stability of the reaction between extracts and cells gave an indication of being time-dependent. In some treatments, survival rate slightly increased from 24 to 48 hours of exposure. Exposure for 72 hours recorded significant changes for all treatments, suggesting that exposure at longer time was needed for maximum damage, which, in turn, influenced the stability of samples, and reactions of cells.
