<p>In a 250 mL 2-neck round bottom flask, 5-bromosalicyladehyde (2 g, 9.95 mmol), ethyl acetoacetate (1.9 mL, 14.85 mmol), and piperidine (9 μL, 1.00 mmol) were added along with ethanol as solvent and the mixture was heated at 50 °C for 8 h. Water (20 mL) was added to quench the reaction, and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was dried using sodium sulphate and concentrated under vacuum. The product 2 was obtained as yellow solid (2.18 g) in 82% yield.</p>
