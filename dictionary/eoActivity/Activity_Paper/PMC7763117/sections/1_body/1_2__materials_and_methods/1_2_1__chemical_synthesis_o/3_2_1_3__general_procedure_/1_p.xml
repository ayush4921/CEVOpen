<p>An oven dried 100 × 13 mm sealed tube having magnetic bead was charged with thaizole-coumarin substrate (4, 100 mg, 0.31 mmol), boronic acid (0.46 mmol), KOtBu (70 mg, 0.62 mmol) and Pd-PEPPSI-IPent precatalyst (4.8 mg, 0.006 mmol) in toluene (1.5 mL, 0.2 M). The reaction was purged with nitrogen to develop an inert atmosphere. The reaction was carried out at 80 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature and loaded onto silica gel, purified via flash column chromatography (SiO 
 <sub>2</sub> , using solvent system of n-Hexane and ethyl acetate in ratio of 9:1), and afforded the desired products 5a–5e in good to excellent yields.
