<p>3-Acetyl-6-bromo-2 
 <italic>H</italic> -chromen-2-one 2 (1.5 g, 5.62 mmol) in dichloromethane (28 mL, 0.2 M) was added to the mixture in the 2-neck round bottom flask in an ice bath. Bromine (0.15 mL, 5.62 mmol) was added dropwise, and the reaction was allowed to cool to ambient temperature overnight. Water (25 mL) was added to quench the reaction and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL Ã— 3). The combined organic layer was concentrated in vacuo to obtain compound 3 as yellow solid (1.63 g) in 84% yield.
