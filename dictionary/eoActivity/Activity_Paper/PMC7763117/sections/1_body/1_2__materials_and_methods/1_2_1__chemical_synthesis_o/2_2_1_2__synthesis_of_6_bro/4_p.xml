<p>A 2-neck round bottom flask was filled with 6-bromo-3-(2-bromoacetyl)-2 
 <italic>H</italic> -chromen-2-one 3 (1 g, 2.89 mmol) and thioacetamide (326.0 mg, 4.34 mmol) in ethanol (15 mL, 0.2 M). The reaction mixture was heated at 60 Â°C for 16 h, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After the completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography (n-hexane: ethyl acetate 20:1). The compound 4 was obtained as yellow solid in 80% yield (745 mg).
