<p>The fungal strain Trichoderma harzianum was obtained from culture collections of SA-Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Science (SA CIRBS), IIUI. Single spore technique was used for Trichoderma harzianum to get a pure culture. The culture was refreshed in potato dextrose agar (PDA). Antifungal activity was performed via agar well diffusion method. The PDA plate surface was inoculated by pouring 100 µL of fungal suspension over the entire agar surface and spreading it with a glass rod. The fungal suspension was prepared by mixing fungal spores in autoclaved distilled water. The plates were left to dry. Then, a hole with a diameter of 6 to 8 mm was punched aseptically with a sterile cork borer, and 20 µL of each compound was introduced into the well. DMSO and fluconazole were used as positive and negative control. The agar plates were incubated at 25 °C for 4 days. Similar to the antibacterial assay, a qualitative test was also performed in antifungal activity to find out active compounds, and then minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out on active compounds against Trichoderma harzianum to find out the lowest concentration of compound that inhibits the growth of fungus. Serial dilution of compounds was performed. The concentration for MIC includes 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 µg/mL.</p>
