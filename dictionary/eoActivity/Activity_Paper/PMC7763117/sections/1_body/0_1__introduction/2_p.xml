<p>The advent of computational tools offers a rapid and complementary role in understanding the binding and inhibition patterns of different drug-like molecules against a variety of targets [15,16]. Particularly, molecular docking analysis helps to show the binding ability of ligands with desired targets [17â€“20]. The inhibitory potential of thiazole coumarin derivatives has been explored herein using molecular docking to explain their inhibition activities against both bacterial and fungal strains.</p>
