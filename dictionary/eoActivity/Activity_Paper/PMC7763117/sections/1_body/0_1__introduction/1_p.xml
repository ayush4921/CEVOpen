<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the leading public health concerns of the current age [1, 2], mainly due to the emergence, spread, and persistence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria or ‘superbugs’ which cannot be treated with conventional remedies. The plausible causes of the antimicrobial resistance are the widespread use of antibiotics and the weary antibiotic research progress [3]. Similarly, the incidence of systemic fungal infection has become an important complication and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immune compromised individuals, such as those who are receiving anticancer chemotherapy, those who have had organ transplants, and AIDS patients [4,5]. In many antimicrobial drugs, the heterocyclic thiazole nucleus are an integral part of the drug as pharmacophore [6,7]. Drug designing techniques have led to the designing of novel coumarin scaffold with various bioactive entities in order to realize pharmacophores with good pharmacology as well as enhanced pharmacokinetics [8–10]. A large number of studies have been conducted on the combined effect of thiazole and coumarin scaffolds that show improved biological activities [11–14]. The present study is based on in vitro antibacterial and antifungal screening of small drug-like thiazole coumarin derivatives.</p>
