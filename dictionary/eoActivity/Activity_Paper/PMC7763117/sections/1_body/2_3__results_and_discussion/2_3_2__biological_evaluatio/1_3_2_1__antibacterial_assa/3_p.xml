<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5e was determined by agar well diffusion method. The concentration of the compounds ranges from 31.25 to 500 µg/mL. The MIC value of 5a was determined to be 62.5 µg/mL against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The compound 5b exhibited MIC at 500 µg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 125 µg/mL against Escherichia coli (Tables 4 and 5).</p>
