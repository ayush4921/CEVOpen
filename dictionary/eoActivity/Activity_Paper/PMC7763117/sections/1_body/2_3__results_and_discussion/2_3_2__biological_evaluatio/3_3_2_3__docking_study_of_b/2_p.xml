<p>The main purpose of docking studies was to investigate the possible interaction of these compounds with target. Active site of target 1YLJ based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, such as Asp131, Tyr105, Ser130, Thr235, Tyr129, Leu127, Lys234, Ala126, Thr216, Gln128, Asp233, Ala218, Thr215, Gly217, Asn214, Gly217, Thr215, Ser237, Ser70, Lys73, Ser130, and Arg276. All docked compounds showed strong hydrogen binding with Thr216, Asn214, Lys234, Thr216, Ser130, Lys73, Ser70, and Ser237, in addition to arene-π interactions with Lys234 and Arg276, as shown in Figure 1. High antibacterial behavior of compounds 5a and 5b may be due to their strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with key amino acids, as shown in Table 8. Aromatic moiety of compound 5a has arene-π interactions with Lys234, and N-atom showed hydrogen bonding with Thr216 at distance of 1.82 Å. All the thiazole coumarins compounds bind at the same place.</p>
