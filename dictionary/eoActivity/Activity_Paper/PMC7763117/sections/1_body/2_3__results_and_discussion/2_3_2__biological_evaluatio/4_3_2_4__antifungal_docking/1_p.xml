<p>The results showed that the thiazole coumarin derivatives have some antifungal activity. According to antifungal screening, 3 of the synthesized compounds effectively inhibited the growth of the tested fungal strain. Compound 5d showed the best activity in inhibiting the growth of the fungal strain. In order to check the inhibition pattern of tested compound, molecular docking of compounds against target PDB id: 2YOK was performed. The high inhibitory activity of compound 5d may be attributed to its strong binding interactions with Thr259, Arg280, Arg264, and Arg407. Methoxy group at para position of ring and the carbonyl of compound showed H-binding with Arg260 and Thr259 with distances of 2.63 &amp; 2.5 Å, respectively. Similarly, aromatic moieties of compound 5b showed arene-π interactions with Arg407-Arg264. Compound 5c and 5e did not show any type of interactions with key residues, as shown in Table 9. Activity of compounds 5a, 5b, and 5d is due to their strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with key residues, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
