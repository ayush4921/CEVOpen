<p>Various types of boronic acids were utilized to extend the scope of reaction. Structurally variable arylated thiazole coumarins were synthesized as per optimized reaction conditions, as shown in Table 2. Alkyl, alkoxy, and aryl-substituted boronic acids were employed in the reaction, leading to the formation of the final arylated product in excellent yields. o-tolylboronic acid was reacted under the optimized conditions, yielding the desired product 5b in 94% isolated yield, while m-tolylboronic acids resulted in the final coupled product 5c in 85% yield. Similarly, 4-methoxypenylboronic acid resulted in the end product 5d in 91% yield. 1-Naphthylboronic acid also provided the comparable yield of 88% of the desired product 5e.</p>
