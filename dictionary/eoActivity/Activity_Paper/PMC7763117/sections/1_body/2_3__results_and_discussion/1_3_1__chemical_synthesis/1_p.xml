<p>The thiazole-coumarin substrate was prepared in 3 steps following a slightly modified reported procedure[14]. In the first step, a Knoevenagel condensation using 5-bromosalicylaldehyde and ethyl acetoacetate was performed in the presence of catalytic amount of piperidine to obtain 3-acetyl-6-bromo-2 
 <italic>H</italic> -chromen-2-one (2) in 80% isolated yield. In the second step, the intermediate was further treated with bromine in dichloromethane to obtain the monobromination product 3 in 82% yield. Finally, the Hantzch thiazole synthesis of 3 with thioacetamide formed the thiazole coumarin product 4 having bromo substituent at 6-position in 85% isolated yield (Scheme 1).
