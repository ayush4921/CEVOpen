 <italic>Ochna kirkii</italic> Oliv., 
 <italic>Ehretia amoena</italic> Klotzsch and 
 <italic>Pteleopsis myrtifolia</italic> (M.A.Lawson) Engl. &amp; Diels. Further phytochemical and pharmacological studies are needed. However, other plants with taxonomic proximity, such as 
 <italic>Ochna integerrima</italic> (Lour.) Merr. present a significant
