  <p>Effect of polyphenols on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition. Cells were exposed to normoglycemic condition (NG) or hyperglycemic condition (HG) in the presence or not of each polyphenol-rich plant extract (10 µM gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) or standard polyphenol (10 μM). Intracellular ROS levels were measured by the 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay (
   <bold>A</bold>). For the experiment with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway inhibitor, cells were pre-incubated with the Compound C (10 μM) during 1 h. Subsequently, the intracellular ROS levels were determined in the experimental conditions described above for normoglycemic (NG) and hyperglycemic (HG) conditions (
   <bold>B</bold>). Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments. **:
