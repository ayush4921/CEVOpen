  <p>Overview of the molecular targets involved in the protective effects of medicinal plant polyphenols on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition. High glucose condition increased ROS levels and deregulated key redox factors comprising Nox4, SOD, catalase, GPx, HO-1, and Nrf2. Medicinal plant polyphenols attenuated oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycemic condition. Cell preconditioning with inhibitors of signaling pathways showed the causal role of NFκB while a protective action of AMPK on redox changes. Hyperglycemic condition promoted a pro-inflammatory status by elevating NFκB gene expression and IL-6 secretion, and damaged ET-1, eNOS and NO vasoactive marker production. Interestingly, medicinal plant polyphenols protected against the deleterious effects of hyperglycemic condition. Quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic and gallic acids identified as predominant plant polyphenols exerted similar protective effects.</p>
