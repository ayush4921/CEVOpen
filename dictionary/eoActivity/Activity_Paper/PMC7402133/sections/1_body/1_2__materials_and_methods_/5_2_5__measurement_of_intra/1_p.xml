<p>The ROS levels were measured using the fluorogenic probe 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay, in accordance with the method previously reported [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Cells were seeded in a 96-well black plate (1.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in DMEM containing 5.5 mM glucose (normoglycemic condition) for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed, cells rinsed twice with PBS, and 100 μL of PBS containing 10 μM of DCFH-DA (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) added in each well. After incubation in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C,) for 45 min., PBS containing DCFH-DA was removed and cells were treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE), or with a pure polyphenol (quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, or gallic acids, 10 µM), or with a related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic or hippuric acids, 10 µM) in hyperglycemic condition (33 mM glucose) or in normoglycemic condition (5.5 mM glucose). After 3 h, fluorescence measurement was performed at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 nm and 520 nm, respectively (FLUOstar Optima, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK). For ROS level determination in cells that were exposed to specific inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways, cells were pre-incubated with 10 μM of inhibitors targeting NFκB (JSH-23) or AMPK (Compound C) in a humidified atmosphere (5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C) for 1 h. Then, as described above, cells were treated with PBS containing DCFH-DA for 45 min. before exposition to each plant extract or pure polyphenol in hyperglycemic condition for 3 h. Next, fluorescence measurement was conducted at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 nm and 520 nm, respectively (FLUOstar Optima, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK).
