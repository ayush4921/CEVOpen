<p>Murine bEnd3 cerebral endothelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-2299™, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 25 mM glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5 mM L-glutamine, 50 µU/mL penicillin, and 2 µg/mL streptomycin (Pan Biotech, Dutscher, Brumath, France). For the bEnd3-Blue cell line model, the bEnd3 cells were transfected with the plasmid pNiFty-secreted alkaline phosphatase (pNiFty2-SEAP, Invivogen, Toulouse, France) using lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFischer Scientific, Les Ulis, France) and selection with Zeocin™ at 200 μg/mL (Invivogen, Toulouse, France) during three weeks, according to the previously published method [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. pNiFty2-SEAP plasmid contains five specific NFκB repeated transcription factor binding sites, an endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule proximal promoter and a SEAP reporter gene. bEnd3-Blue cells were cultured in complete DMEM containing 200 μg/mL of Zeocin™. Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C.
