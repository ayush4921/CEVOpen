<p>The 4-amino-5-methylamino-2’,7’-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) diacetate was used to determine intracellular NO levels, according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 96-well black plate (1.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in DMEM containing 5.5 mM glucose (normoglycemic condition) for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE), or with a pure polyphenol (quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, or gallic acids, 10 µM), or with a related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, or hippuric acids, 10 µM) in hyperglycemic condition (33 mM glucose) or in normoglycemic condition (5.5 mM glucose) for 3 h. Next, the medium was removed, cells were washed once with PBS and 100 µL of PBS containing 5 µM of DAF-FM (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) added in each well. After incubation in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C,) for 45 min., PBS containing DAF-FM was removed, and cells were treated with 100 µL of insulin (1 µg/mL, Sigma Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h. Fluorescence measurement was performed at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 nm and 520 nm, respectively (FLUOstar Optima, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK).
