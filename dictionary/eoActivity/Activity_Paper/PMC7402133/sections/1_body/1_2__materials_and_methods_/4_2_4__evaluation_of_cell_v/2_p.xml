<p>The mitochondrial metabolic activity of cells was measured by using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) during 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells were treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE), or with a pure polyphenol (quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic or gallic acids, 10 µM), or with a related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, or hippuric acids, 10 µM) for 24 h. Five hours before the end of the experiment, 20 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT reagent (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) diluted in PBS were added in each well. After centrifugation at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 4 min. at 25 °C, the medium was removed and 200 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were added in each well, in order to dissolve formazan crystals originating from MTT mitochondrial metabolism in living cells. Absorbance was measured at 560 nm (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland).
