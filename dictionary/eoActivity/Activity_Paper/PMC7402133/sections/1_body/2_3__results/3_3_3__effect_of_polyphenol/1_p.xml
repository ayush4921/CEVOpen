<p>During diabetes, oxidative stress plays a causal role in hyperglycemia-related neurovascular complications by inducing blood-brain barrier dysfunction. We determined the impact of an experimental hyperglycemia mimicked by high glucose concentration on ROS production from cerebral endothelial cells that were exposed or not to polyphenols. The data show that the exposure of cells to the hyperglycemic condition led to a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels reaching 126.91 Â± 1.70% (

Noticeably, all polyphenol-rich plant extracts as well as standard caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin counteracted the deleterious effect of the hyperglycemic condition. These data suggest that hyperglycemic condition induced oxidative stress on cerebral endothelial cells and that polyphenols exerted a protective action. Such an antioxidant effect of polyphenol-rich plant extracts could be partly attributed to their free radical-scavenging and reducing capacities described above, and they may result from the presence of phytochemicals, like quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids in the medicinal plant extracts.
