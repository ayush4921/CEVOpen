<p>In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved in high glucose-induced ROS production from endothelial cells and the protective effect of polyphenols, bEnd3 cells were pre-incubated with specific inhibitors targeting NFκB or AMPK pathways, before ROS level measurement. The results show that the inhibition of NFκB pathway led to a decrease in ROS levels in both normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions, providing evidence for a causal role of NFκB in ROS production (

Conversely, the inhibition of AMPK pathway induced an elevation of ROS levels in both normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions, highlighting a protective role of AMPK against ROS production. Interestingly, the co-treatment of cells with AMPK pathway inhibitor and polyphenols during hyperglycemic condition abrogated the increase in ROS production exacerbated by AMPK pathway inhibitor (
