<p>Endothelial cells are the major source of NO, which plays an important physiological role as a vasodilator factor. During hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress, it is established that ROS alter eNOS activity and NO production. Moreover, ROS may exacerbate the production of the vasoconstrictor factor ET-1. We evaluated the effect of polyphenols on these vasoactive markers. The results show that high glucose concentration caused an elevated expression of ET-1 gene expression (

Some polyphenol-rich plant extracts and standard polyphenols exerted a protective action against the deleterious effect of high glucose concentration on ET-1 and eNOS gene expression. Moreover, the hyperglycemic condition significantly decreased intracellular NO levels (

Standard caffeic, chlorogenic and gallic acids, as well as quercetin exerted a similar protective action, suggesting their possible contribution to the plant extract benefits on NO generation during hyperglycemic condition. Noteworthy, there was a significant negative Pearson correlation between intracellular NO and ROS levels in cells that were exposed to the hyperglycemic condition (
