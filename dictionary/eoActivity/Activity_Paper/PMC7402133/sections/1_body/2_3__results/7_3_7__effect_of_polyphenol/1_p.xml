<p>Hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress is known to cause the nuclear translocation of NFκB, which activates the transcription of several genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6. We evaluated the production of pro-inflammatory markers by measuring NFκB gene expression and IL-6 secretion. The data indicate that NFκB gene expression (

Interestingly, all polyphenol-rich plant extracts and standard polyphenols exerted an anti-inflammatory action by lowering both NFκB gene expression and IL-6 secretion, except for gallic acid, without effect on NFκB gene expression.
