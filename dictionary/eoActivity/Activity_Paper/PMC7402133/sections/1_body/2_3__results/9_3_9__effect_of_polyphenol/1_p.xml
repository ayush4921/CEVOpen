<p>Given that polyphenols are poorly absorbed and extensively catabolized by the gut microflora, six related circulating metabolites were assessed for their ability to modulate cerebral endothelial cell viability as well as key redox, inflammatory, and vasoactive markers in hyperglycemic condition. These metabolites were ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and hippuric acids. Cell counting data (

 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00573-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> summarizes the data that were obtained regarding ROS production, NFκB transcriptional activity, IL-6 secretion, and NO levels in cells that were exposed to normoglycemic or hyperglycemic condition, in the presence or not of circulating metabolites. While the hyperglycemic condition significantly elevated intracellular ROS levels, only ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acids exerted an antioxidant effect by decreasing the ROS production. Of note, all of the polyphenol circulating metabolites exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by abrogating the elevation of NFκB activity and IL-6 release induced by high glucose condition. Furthermore, all of the polyphenol circulating metabolites protected against the decrease in intracellular NO vasodilator levels mediated by hyperglycemic condition.
