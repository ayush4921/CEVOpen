<p>The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of characterized polyphenol-rich extracts from medicinal plants on redox, inflammatory, and vasoactive markers of cerebral endothelial cells that were exposed to hyperglycemic condition. For the first time, four medicinal plants from RÃ©union Island were selected in the same study for a comparative analysis of their effects on cerebral endothelial cells, based on their antidiabetic properties referenced in the French Pharmacopeia and their economic interest for innovative pharmacological developments, namely 
 <italic>Antirhea borbonica</italic>, 
 <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic>, 
 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Terminalia bentzoe.</italic> Furthermore, we determined the impact of pure quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids detected as major medicinal plant polyphenols, and six polyphenols related circulating metabolites (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and hippuric acids) on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition.
