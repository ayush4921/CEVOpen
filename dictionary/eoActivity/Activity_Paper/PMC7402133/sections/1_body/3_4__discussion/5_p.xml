<p>Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the rate of ROS production and the capacity of the endogenous antioxidant defense to neutralize ROS. Our data indicate that plant polyphenols were able to regulate both ROS-producing and ROS-detoxifying systems, depending on the medicinal plant considered. One the one hand, only 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant polyphenols as well as caffeic and gallic acids counteracted the up-regulation of the expression of the gene encoding the ROS-producing enzyme Nox4 in hyperglycemic condition. This agrees with our previous data showing the ability of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant polyphenols to abrogate Nox4 gene expression elevation in adipose cells that were exposed to oxidative stress induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A similar protective antioxidant effect of resveratrol was observed in bEnd3 cells through inhibition of high glucose-induced Nox activation and ROS generation [
 <xref rid="B49-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Nox4 is the most abundant vascular Nox isoform, located in the mitochondria. Once activated, Nox4 leads to an increased production of ROS that triggers the nuclear translocation of NFκB, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production [
 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A persistent elevation of Nox4 mRNA levels was described in human aortic endothelial cells that were exposed for 24–72 h to hyperglycemic condition. This event was associated with the nuclear translocation of NFκB and its binding to Nox4 gene promoter [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Concordantly, our present study demonstrates NFκB involvement in redox changes mediated by high glucose in bEnd3 cells. In vivo studies reported increased levels of Nox4 protein in cerebral endothelial cells from mouse ischemic brains and stroke patient samples. A link between the level of Nox4 protein, brain infarct volume, and neurological improvements was depicted in Nox4
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice [
 <xref rid="B70-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Here, our data highlighting the capacity of polyphenols to target both Nox4 and NFκB suggest the relevance to assess their possible benefits in in vivo animal models exposed to cerebrovascular complications, such as stroke. On the other hand, medicinal plant polyphenols also improved major antioxidant factors, including SOD, catalase, GPx, HO-1, and Nrf2. More precisely, we found that Cu/ZnSOD activity was up-regulated in hyperglycemic condition, whereas MnSOD activity was not modulated by high glucose. Accordingly, Weidig et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] observed a significant elevation of Cu/ZnSOD activity in coronary endothelial cells that were exposed to 22 mM of glucose. This may be explained by the fact that cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD is recognized as the first line of the endogenous defense system to neutralize superoxide radicals [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Medicinal plant polyphenols regulated SOD activity on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition, which suggested their ability to preserve the endogenous antioxidant defense system. Moreover, the hyperglycemic condition down-regulated the expression of Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase, and HO-1 genes and up-regulated GPx gene expression, while polyphenols counteracted these effects. Accordingly, 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant polyphenols were previously shown to up-regulate SOD gene expression on adipose cells that were exposed to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It was also reported that quercetin, detected in 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plants, improved HO-1 gene expression on endothelial cells exposed to hyperglycemic condition. Of note, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] demonstrated that quercetin significantly elevated HO-1 gene expression when human aortic endothelial cells were exposed to the pro-inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharides, by regulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Additionally, quercetin was shown to regulate SOD enzymatic activity in a traumatic brain injury model via Nrf2 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Nrf2 redox-sensitive transcriptional factor is recognized to play a crucial role in cellular defense mechanisms against a variety of stresses. During oxidative stress condition, Nrf2 is translocated into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element of target genes, such as SOD, catalase, GPx, and HO-1, to regulate their transcription rate, helping to restore redox homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Recently, we showed that high glucose-induced oxidative stress was associated with altered Nrf2 gene expression and nuclear translocation in cerebral endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The present study demonstrates that all medicinal plant polyphenols, except 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant, abrogated the down-regulation of Nrf2 gene expression mediated by hyperglycemic condition in cerebral endothelial cells. Quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids exerted a similar protective action, raising the possibility for their contribution to the beneficial effect of medicinal plant extracts. Consistently, literature data reported that polyphenols, such quercetin and caffeic acid, regulate Nrf2 production [
 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. According to Nabavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], Nrf2 may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic microvascular complications. Authors also emphasized the relevance of antioxidant strategies while using polyphenols to target Nrf2. In Nrf2
 <sup>−/−</sup> rat and diabetic mouse models, Nrf2 activation led to an improvement of vascular function and decreased vasoconstriction [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Such a link between oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunctions was found in the present study, through the evidence of a negative correlation between intracellular ROS levels and NO vasodilator production. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that all medicinal plant extracts counteracted the decrease in NO production induced by the hyperglycemic condition. Except for 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant, all polyphenol-rich plant extract also protected against the down-regulation of eNOS gene expression mediated by high glucose. Conversely, medicinal plant polyphenols suppressed the up-regulation of ET-1 vasoconstrictor gene expression that was caused by high glucose. These data demonstrate the protective action of medicinal plant extracts against the altered production of vasoactive markers in hyperglycemic condition and suggest their capacity to ameliorate vasodilation and attenuate vasoconstriction. Similar beneficial effects were detected for quercetin, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids, emphasizing their possible involvement in the bioactivity of plant extracts. Accordingly, other studies showed that polyphenols, like quercetin and chlorogenic acid, protected endothelial cells from hypochloride-caused oxidative stress and improved ex vivo aortic vessel function by enhancing eNOS activity and NO release [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that the French medicinal plants 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> constitute natural sources of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenols that are able to improve vasoactive markers, and could be used as innovative therapeutic strategies against cerebrovascular disorders that are associated with hyperglycemia. The novel comparative analysis we performed regarding the medicinal plant polyphenolic composition helps to identify three medicinal plants with high levels of polyphenols, namely 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic>, 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>, as compared to 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant, which contains a lower polyphenol content. Concomitantly, the comparison of the biological activities of plant extracts on the same cellular model and in similar experimental conditions highlights the absence of cytotoxic action for all plant extracts tested. This underlines the possibility of their use in preclinical studies, in order to identify the most bioactive extract for future investigations in humans. On the one hand, all of the polyphenolic plant extracts were able to modulate redox, inflammatory, and vasoactive markers in cerebral endothelial cells, with a degree of efficiency depending on the medicinal plant considered. This provides new perspectives on the advantage of the use of a mixture of natural polyphenolic compounds when compared to the use of pure polyphenols for nutritional strategies. Such mixtures of natural polyphenols may also lead to their synergistic action through the impact of plant matrix on polyphenol chemical stability and cell accessibility. Our previous study contributed to show that a crude curcuminoid-rich extract from 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> exerts stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on adipose cells than curcumin-enriched fractions [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the use of pure compounds helps to hypothesize their contribution to the mechanism of action of plant extracts, and to emphasize their relevance as therapeutic potentials for pharmacological strategies against cerebrovascular complications related to hyperglycemia.
