<p>When the experimental rats became hyperglycemic in lipid studies, there was an elevated level of total cholesterol, which was implicated along with the marked increase of triglyceride, which activates the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, an atherogenic pattern of risk factors that include a lower level of HDL-cholesterol. Higher LDL concentrations are predictive of coronary events independent of other coronary disease risk factors [

The subdued extract activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase during insulin insufficiency may be due to the rise in the release of fatty acids from peripheral tissue to the blood vessels. Our finding is in arrangement with the reports of Ahmed et al. [
