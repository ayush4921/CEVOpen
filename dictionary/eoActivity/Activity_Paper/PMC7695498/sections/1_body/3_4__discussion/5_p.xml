<p>The significant reduction of glucose concentration could partly be that the phytochemical constituents of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> promoted glucose entry into cells to reduce the release of glucose in the blood. This study showed that ALX-induced diabetes led to various lipid abnormalities, and it has been reported in previous studies that the activities of ALX caused lipid profile derangement [

The marked increase in the high concentration of serum lipids was mainly due to the activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase during insulin insufficiency, which may be due to the rise in the release of fatty acids from peripheral tissue to the blood vessels. Diabetes is a debilitating disease associated with hyperglycemia characterized by dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for coronary heart diseases [
