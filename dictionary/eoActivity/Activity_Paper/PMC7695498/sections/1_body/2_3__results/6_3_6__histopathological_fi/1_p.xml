<p>The photomicrograph of the normal heart (A) group showed normal myocardial and normal widening of interstitium of the heart tissue. The photomicrograph of the diabetic untreated (B) group of heart tissue revealed myocardial distortion, characterized with cellular degeneration and reduction of interstitium of the heart. The photomicrograph of the diabetic treated with 250 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> (C) showed that there was a slight recovery of myocardial tissue with the interstitium of the heart tissue, while the photomicrograph of the diabetic treated with 500 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> (D) showed complete restoration of myocardial tissue following the reversal of the degenerative changes and widening the space of interstitium of the heart tissue.
