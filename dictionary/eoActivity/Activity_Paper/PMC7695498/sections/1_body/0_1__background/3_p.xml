<p>Experimental diabetes induced by alloxan (ALX) selectively disrupts the pancreas 
 <italic>Î²</italic> cells, which are known to be one of the weakest structures to oxidative stress by generating excess reactive oxygen species and produces heart lesions that are similar to human diabetic cardiomyopathy [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oxidative stress contributes to increase protein, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolisms, which links with increased free radical release accompanied by a decrease in antioxidants, leading to diabetes [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The rate of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia has been extensively documented and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular complications, including cardiomyopathy [
