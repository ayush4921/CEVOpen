<p>Evidence of the first human use of plants as medicines was observed in the fossil record of the Middle Paleolithic period, which began approximately 60,000 years ago [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Traditional medical knowledge and practices developed in different civilizations by the trial-and-error use of local botanicals and other biomaterial resources that accumulated slowly over long periods of time [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that herbal medicines currently serve the health needs of approximately 80% of the world's population, especially millions of people living in the vast rural areas of developing countries [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. China is a multiracial country with 56 nationalities, 55 of which are officially recognized as ethnic minorities in 18 provinces of China. Each ethnic minority, e.g., the Tibetans, Mongols, Uygurs, Dai, Yi, and Miao, has its own traditional medicine, and each differs slightly in theory and practice from TCM. Ethnomedicine thus refers to the use of traditional medicine guided by the medical theory and practical experience of each ethnic minority [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since 2017, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Traditional Chinese Medicine has given ethnomedicine a relatively independent status although it is considered as part of TCM. The importance of ethnomedicine has been increasing in China since 1951 as discussed in detail below. 
 <italic>Chinese Traditional Medicine Statistics</italic> published in 2015 by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China and the 
 <italic>Investigation and Analysis of Quality Standards of Ethnomedicines in Nine Provinces of China</italic> published in 2015 by the National Medical Products Administration of China listed 161 pharmaceutical enterprises that produced 4317 ethnic patent medicines (EPMs) and nearly 4000 in-hospital preparations of ethnomedicines used in 253 ethnic hospitals. A total of 39 EPMs were included in 
 <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic> (2015 edition). The fourth national survey of Chinese Materia medica resources is underway with the objective of determining the status of the available resources and investigating the modern value of herbal medicine including ethnic and folk medicines [
