<p>This review focuses on Dai and Yi traditional medicines in Yunnan Province because of their long histories and descriptions in the ancient medical literature. The earliest book of Yi traditional medicine that can be verified is the 
 <italic>Yuanyang Yi Medicine Book</italic>, which was written in 957 AD and found in Yuanyang County of Yunnan Province in 1985 [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The earliest books of Dai traditional medicine that can be verified are 
 <italic>Ge Ya San Ha Ya</italic>, which was written in 964-884 BC, and 
 <italic>Dang Ha Ya Long</italic>, which was written in 1323 AD [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There are 1, 666 Dai medicines [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], nearly 1, 400 Yi medicines [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and 400 medicines are listed in the 
 <italic>Yi Materia Medica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. There are 478 Yi medical formulas described in 
 <italic>Chinese Yi Medicine Prescriptions Science</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and 200 Dai medical formulas are in 
 <italic>Study on Dai classical prescriptions of China</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The numbers of folk formulas from Dai and Yi traditional medicine are not available to record yet. Just as the example of Yunnan Baiyao mentioned before, a series of ethnomedicines in Yunnan were successfully industrialized and modernized to promote the modern vitality of ancient ethnomedicines and thus serve a wide population range. The Tong Shu Capsule is a YPM produced by the Yunnan Baiyao Group that has been approved recently for phase II clinical research in the United States. Yunnan Province expects to produce TCMs including ethnomedicines with a value of 140 billion RMB in 2020 and an average annual growth of more than 15%, accounting for 75% of its production [
