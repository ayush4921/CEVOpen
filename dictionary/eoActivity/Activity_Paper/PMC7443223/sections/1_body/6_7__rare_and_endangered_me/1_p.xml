<p>The rapidly increasing demand for CPMs is likely to challenge the sustainability of herbal resources in China. At present, 80% of the most frequently used species cannot meet medical demand, and 1,800â€“2,100 medicinal species are facing extinction [

 <italic>China Plant Red Data Book</italic> published in 1992, 388 plant species were listed as threatened, with 121 species as endangered and needing first-grade national protection, 110 species as rare needing second-grade national protection, and 157 species as vulnerable needing third-grade national protection. Of those plant species, 77 are herbal medicines that account for 19.86% of the threatened species [

The rare medicinal materials used in DPMs and YPMs are listed in
