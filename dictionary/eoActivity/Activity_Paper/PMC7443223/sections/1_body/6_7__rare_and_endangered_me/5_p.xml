<p>Due to the lack of more pharmaceutical information disclosed, as well as the lack of basic research, the safety information of these DPMs and YPMs including toxic medicines is insufficient. The modern toxicological evidence of these toxic medicines is collected and summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, focusing on Dai and Yi toxic medicines. The root of 
 <italic>Tripterygium hypoglaucum</italic> (Levl.) Hutch (Huobahuagen) soaked in wine as an oral medicine is an ancient Yi medicine described in the 
 <italic>Ailao Materia Medica</italic> in the treatment of arthritis, joint swelling, pain, bruises, and sprains [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. 
 <italic>Boenning hauseniase silicarpa</italic> Levl. (Shijiaocao) is described in the 
 <italic>Materia Medica in South Yunnan</italic> (Dian Nan Ben Cao, AD.1396 -1476) written by Lan Mao as a bitter, pungent, and warm medicine used to treat chest pain, heartache, stomachache, and abdominal distension. Shijiaocao is also described in the 
 <italic>Ailao Materia Medica</italic> as a treatment for sore throat, gastric pain, and dysentery. It is described as a cure of acute gastroenteritis in combination with the parasite of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum bungeanum</italic> in the 
 <italic>Wa Die Yi Medical Book</italic>, which was written at the end of the Qing Dynasty [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Ancient documents describe the usage of the toxic herbs included in the medical practice of Yi, Dai, or other ethnic minorities in Yunnan. Modern toxicological study can ensure their safe and effective use, and further study is warranted to determine how the toxicity reduces while the prescription remains effective.
