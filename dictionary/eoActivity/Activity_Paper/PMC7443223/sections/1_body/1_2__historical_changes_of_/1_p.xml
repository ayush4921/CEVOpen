<p>Since 1949, the Chinese government has successively introduced many policies to support and protect the development of ethnomedicine (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>Ethnic Minorities Health Work Plan of China</italic> published in 1951 recommended that native doctors who used herbs to cure diseases should be united and supported to the greatest extent. 
 <italic>The Decision on Health Reform and Development</italic> published in 1997 discussed how ethnomedicine should be mined, organized, summarized, and improved. 
 <italic>The Decision on Further Strengthening Rural Health Work</italic>, published in 2002, promoted the development and organization of ethnomedicine resources and technologies in rural regions. For many years, ethnic folk doctors in rural areas provided care in very much the same way as barefoot doctors, a nickname for part-time paramedical workers in rural areas who were trained for simple diagnoses and treatments in the 1960s and 1970s. During that time, China's health services could not cover all areas of the country, and the need of ethnic and folk medical practices was tacitly accepted. At present, the Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Dai, Kazakh, Korean, Zhuang, and Hui medicine have set up physician certification systems for special skill or knowledge to support ethnic folk doctors obtaining legal medical qualification through certain procedures. The 
 <italic>Outline of a Strategic Plan for Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine</italic> (2016â€“2030) published by the State Council of China promotes the development of ethnomedicine.
