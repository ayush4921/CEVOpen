  <p>High-content anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound screening. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The SARS-CoV-2 (at 25TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) infected Vero E6 cells were detected by high-content imaging of the control condition. Fluorescent signals: green, anti-SARS-CoV NP mAb; blue, Hoechst. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Percentage of the infected Vero E6 of the control conditions. (
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold>) The high-content images of the infected Vero E6 cells treated with hydroxychloroquine (
   <bold>c</bold>) and ivermectin (
   <bold>d</bold>) (the left panel). The percentage of virus inhibition (blue) and cell viability (red) was shown in the right panel (n = 3 biological replicates). (
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold>) The production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by plaque reduction assay after 48 h of hydroxychloroquine (
   <bold>e</bold>) and ivermectin (
   <bold>f</bold>) treatment (n = 2 biological replicates) (
   <bold>g</bold>) A total of 122 Thai natural products (114 medicinal plant extracts and 8 purified compounds) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (n = 2 technical replicates). (
   <bold>h</bold>) Percentage of virus inhibition of six selected candidates corresponding to the number-labeled blue dots in (
   <bold>g</bold>). Full details of the screening results provided in Supplementary Table
