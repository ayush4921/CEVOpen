<p id="Par6">From this rationale, we established a high-content screening platform for the antiviral drug candidates by using a fluorescence-based technique in a standard cell line for coronavirus infection, Vero E6. A total of 122 of the extracts and purified compounds derived Thai medicinal plants were screened. The extracts and compounds with the high antiviral potency were further evaluated by doseâ€“response analysis and plaque reduction assay. Additionally, to confirm the efficiency of the selected compound in human airway, we proved the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential with a high-content imaging technique in human lung epithelial cells in comparison to remdesivir, the first COVID-19 drug approved by FDA. In the end, this study demonstrated that
