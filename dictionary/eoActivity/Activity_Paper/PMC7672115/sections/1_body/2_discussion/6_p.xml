<p id="Par18">Taken together, we identified 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and its active compound, panduratin A, as the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents by using the high-content imaging system coupled with the plaque reduction assay. Importantly, 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A exhibited the potent antiviral efficacy in Vero E6 cells when the treatment was performed after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the optimal IC
 <sub>50</sub> (3.62 μg/mL and 0.81 μM, respectively) and the favorable cytotoxicity profile (CC
 <sub>50</sub> 28.06 μg/mL and 14.71 μM, respectively). Panduratin A inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the pre-entry phase as well. The information from this present study suggested the promise of panduratin A as a single therapy, and as the combinational therapeutic with other FDA-approved agents, for the effective treatment of COVID-19. The possibility of this rationale should be further evaluated. Since 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> is the common plant affordable and available in tropical regions, a pharmaceutically active compound derived from 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> offers a tremendous therapeutic opportunity to fight in this bloody COVID-19 battlefield. Accordingly, we suggested panduratin A as the novel natural candidate for anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection.
