<p id="Par15">Several molecular and cellular mechanisms might be employed by panduratin A to exert its effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Using the biochemical approach, this phytochemical was demonstrated to physically bind and inhibit an HIV-1 protease

 </sup> and a DENV NS2B/NS3 protease

 </sup>. Also, the structure-based computational approach supported panduratin A potential as the competitive inhibitor of NS2B/NS3 of DENV2

 </sup>. Whether this compound interacts with those proteases in vivo is yet to be determined. In this view, panduratin A might act as the protease inhibitor to exhibit the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect.
