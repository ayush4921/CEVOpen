<p id="Par17">Besides, panduratin A was found to induce autophagy, which is vital in restricting viral replication. Nonetheless, concerns have also been raised regarding the protective role of autophagy for the evasion of host innate immunity upon viral infection

 </sup>. Autophagic induction by panduratin A treatment in mammalian cells occurred through the activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. The small molecule compound has also been shown to induce PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway pertinent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Consequently, the induction of ER stress can further facilitate autophagy

 </sup>. Moreover, panduratin A can stimulate AMPK signaling leading to the activation of PPARα and PPARδ

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>, possibly through its autophagic induction mechanism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. It has yet to be elucidated whether panduratin A suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection via the induction of autophagy, and which pathway is a direct target for this compound.
