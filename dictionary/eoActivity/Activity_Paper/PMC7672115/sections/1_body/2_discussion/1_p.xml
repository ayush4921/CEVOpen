<p id="Par13">In this study, the high-content imaging system, coupled with the plaque assay, was utilized for the first time to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from the Thai medicinal plant library, consisting of 114 medicinal plant extracts and 8 purified compounds (details in Supplementary Table 1). Among the positive hits, the crude extract of 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> and its purified compound, panduratin A, demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 replication and infectivity with the favorable cytotoxicity profile in Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, panduratin A inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and replication at both pre-entry and post-infection phases, and its antiviral activity was even more potent than hydroxychloroquine FDA-approved drug currently used for COVID-19 treatment

Apart from the standard cell line widely used as the model for coronavirus infection, we also investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of panduratin A in human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3). These cells represent the major targets of the virus in human. We found that panduratin A exerted the high inhibitory efficacy similar to remdesivir, a therapeutic drug firstly approved by FDA. Additionally, this compound was demonstrated to have no or minimal cytotoxicity at the therapeutic window in various cell types, including human liver cancer cell line (HepG2), immortalized hepatocyte-like cell line (imHC), human normal kidney (HK-2), human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), and human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2) (Supplementary Fig. 3). This finding highlighted the potential implication of panduratin A as the novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate for COVID-19 therapy. Nevertheless, in vivo study and the clinical trial are needed to assess the pharmacokinetic effect and the appropriate human dose of panduratin A before clinical use.
