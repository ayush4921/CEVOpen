<p id="Par8">Subsequently, we performed the high-content screening of Thai natural products, consisting of medicinal plant extracts and phytochemical compounds, to search for the new and promising anti-SARs-CoV-2 candidates. A total of 122 of the crude extracts and the purified compounds derived from Thai natural products were investigated. Four candidates consisting of two extracts (at 10 μg/mL) of 
 <italic>Boesenbergia rotunda</italic> (fingerroot) and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (ginger), and two purified compounds (at 10 μM), i.e., andrographolide and panduratin A, exhibited 99.9% inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g,h)
 <italic>.</italic> Interestingly, panduratin A is the purified compound derived from 
 <italic>B. rotunda.</italic> This finding encouraged us to look for 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> and 6-Gingerol, the extract and the purified compound counterpart of andrographolide and 
 <italic>Z. officinale,</italic> respectively. We found that 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract (at 10 μg/mL) had moderate inhibitory activity, while 6-Gingerol (at 10 μM) had a mild effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g,h). This result suggested further evaluation of these medicinal plant extracts and phytochemical compounds in a dose–response manner.
