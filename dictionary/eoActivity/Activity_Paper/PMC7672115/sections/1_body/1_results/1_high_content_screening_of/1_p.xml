<p id="Par7">The high-content imaging screening system was developed and optimized in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 25TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. At 48 h after infection, the infected cells were evaluated by fluorescence analysis with the primary antibody specific to NP of SARS-CoV, which was able to cross-react with NP protein of SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing serum from COVID-19 patient (the positive control) completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b). In addition, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, two FDA-approved drugs with reported anti-SARS-CoV2 activities in vitro and in clinical trials

 </sup>, were included as reference drugs to validate our screening system. Hydroxychloroquine showed a potent antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.08 µM. Besides, this drug had less cytotoxic with CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Ivermectin demonstrated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.68 µM. However, its therapeutic window was narrow with CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 31.68 µM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The production of the infectious virion, as measured by plaque reduction assay, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 suppression following hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e,f). This finding pointed out the high efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 cells and encouraged to use this drug as the validated control in further experiments.
