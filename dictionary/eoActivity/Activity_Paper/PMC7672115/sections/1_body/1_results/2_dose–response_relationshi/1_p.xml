<p id="Par9">From the initial screening, three pairs of Thai medicinal plant extracts and their purified compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g,h) were selected to further examine for antiviral potentials. In this part, the post-treatment approach was followed, in which two-fold dilutions of the extracts or the compounds were added into the cell culture after 2 h of viral adsorption and maintained for the 48 h period. Thereafter, the culture supernatants were harvested, and the cells were fixed and stained with anti-SARS-CoV NP mAb and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Hydroxychloroquine at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration (5.08 µM; as showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), together with the neutralizing serum, served as the positive controls of the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Overall, each of six candidates exhibited a dose–response relationship. The extract of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and its purified compound, andrographolide, showed the potent antiviral effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 68.06 µg/mL (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL) and 6.58 µM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 27.77 µM), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c,f). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> extract exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 29.19 µg/mL (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.75 µg/mL) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d); however, its purified compound 6-Gingerol had lower potency with IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). Among six selected candidates, the 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and its purified compound, panduratin A, exhibited very potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.62 µg/mL (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.06 µg/mL) and 0.81 µM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.71 µM), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e,h). Analyses of viral output by plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i–n) were consistent with the high-content screening results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c–h). The absolute inhibition of the infectious virion production in the post-treatment approach was observed in 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract (100 µg/mL)
 <italic>,</italic> andrographolide (12.5 μM), 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract (12.5 µg/mL), and panduratin A (5 µM). Collectively, 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and its purified compound panduratin A had higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities than other candidates.
