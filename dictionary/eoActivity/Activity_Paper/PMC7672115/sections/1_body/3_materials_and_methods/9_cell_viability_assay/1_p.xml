<p id="Par30">Cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and treated with various concentrations of the extracts or purified compounds for 48 h. Cell viability was evaluated by an MTT colorimetric assay. In brief, the medium was replaced with MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The formazan crystal was dissolved with DMSO (Merck, Germany) and measured at a wavelength of 570 nm by EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, USA). Data was normalized versus the solvent control, and then CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.
