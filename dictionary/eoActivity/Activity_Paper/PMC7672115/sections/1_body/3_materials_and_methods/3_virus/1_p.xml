<p id="Par24">SARS-CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2/01/human/Jan2020/Thailand) was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of a confirmed COVID-19 patient in Thailand. The virus was propagated in Vero E6 cells by three passages to establish a high-titer stock (passage 4) and stored at − 80 °C for using in all experiments. Virus titration as TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titer/mL was performed in the 96-well microtiter plate. Briefly, the virus stock was titrated in quadruplicate in 96-well microtiter plates on Vero E6 cells in serial dilution to obtain 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) by using the Reed Muench method
