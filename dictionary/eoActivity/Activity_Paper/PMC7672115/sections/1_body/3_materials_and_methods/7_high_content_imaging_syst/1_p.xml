<p id="Par28">In each treatment condition, the cells in the 96-well plate were fixed and permeabilized with 50% (v/v) acetone in methanol on ice for 20 min. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween detergent (PBST) and blocked in PBST with 2% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, the cells were incubated with 1:500 dilution ratio of primary antibody specific for SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein (NP) (Rabbit mAb) (Sino Biological Inc., China) for 1 h at 37 °C. This antibody can cross-react with the NP protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well. The unbound antibody was removed by washing with PBST three times. Then, the Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), was used at 1:500 dilution ratio. Nuclei of the cells were stained with Hoechst dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The fluorescent signals were detected and analyzed by the high-content imaging system (Operetta, PerkinElmer) at 40 × magnification. The percentage of the infected cells in each well was automatically obtained from 13 images per well using Harmony software (PerkinElmer, USA) (the parameters and the analytical sequence were provided in Supplementary Information).</p>
