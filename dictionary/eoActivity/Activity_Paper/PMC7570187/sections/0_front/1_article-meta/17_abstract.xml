  <italic>Punica protopunica</italic> Balf. is one of only two species housed by the 
  <italic>Punica</italic> genera. 
  <italic>Punica protopunica.</italic> Balf., known as Socotran pomegranate, is an endemic, isolated species found only in Socotra archipelago in the northwestern Indian Ocean, and is considered to be the ancestor of pomegranate. This review stems from the fact that in many 
  <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. articles, 
  <italic>Punica protopunica</italic> Balf. is mentioned, but just in an informative way, without mentioning their taxonomic and genetic relationship and their medicinal properties. It is there where the need arises to know more about this forgotten species: “the other pomegranate tree.” A large part of the human population does not know of its existence, since only its “sister” has spread throughout the world. The present review deals with the taxonomy and origin of 
  <italic>Punica protopunica</italic> Balf., the morphology of the tree, distribution, cultivation, vulnerability, and as well as its relationship with 
  <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. It also discusses its uses in traditional medicine, its antioxidant capacity, and the medicinal properties of this forgotten species.
