<p>Due to the globalization of pomegranate cultivation, there are genetic variations within the same species. More than 500 varieties of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. are known, although few varieties bring their cultivation to a commercial level of production (about 50) [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. has a smaller wild fruit, a lesser variety of colors, and an acidic flavor that makes it an inedible fruit. There is a great polarization when referring to the two species of the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera, on the one hand, there is the common pomegranate, widespread throughout the world, reported as a super fruit in any recipe magazine article (
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L.). The other is the Socotran pomegranate (
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf.), which is little known, hidden from the eyes of the world and only used by the people of Socotra for medicinal purposes, the one without admirers.
