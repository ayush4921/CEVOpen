 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. has strong ties to 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., and a strong relationship with the flora of the adjacent continental areas of Arabia and Northeast Africa, tropical Africa, Madagascar, India, South Asia, Polynesia and Central America that, as already mentioned, were united in the Cretaceous. It is believed that at least since the late Cretaceous, much of Socotra was emerged, considering itself one of the longest isolated landmasses on earth. Its vascular plants have an endemicity index, quite similar to that of other islands such as the Canary Islands, and it is a refuge for interesting paleoendemisms of very ancient origin, including the case of
