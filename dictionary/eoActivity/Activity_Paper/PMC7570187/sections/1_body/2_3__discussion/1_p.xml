<p>Socotra Archipelago is known to be a section of what was once the Gondwana Supercontinent [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The biodiversity and geology of the island of Socotra are living and tangible proof of the historical biogeography of the supercontinent of Gondwana [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the early Cretaceous, Gondwana included the continental areas of Africa, South Asia, Polynesia and Central America, which later separated to create the continents as we know them today. Subsequently, the 4 islands of the Socotra archipelago, was isolated from the Indian Ocean approximately 20 million years ago, when the African and Arab plates separated, which resulted in the formation of the Gulf of Aden [

 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. At some point in that transformation, the Socotra archipelago was left behind, isolating all the living matter contained in that piece of land. It is known that Socotra is not an island formed by volcanic lava but is a separate portion of a continent, so the endemic species are really old and “rare” in the eyes of modern humans.
