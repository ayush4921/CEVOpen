<p>Socotra was included on the World Heritage List in 2008 as a natural site, which has had a positive impact on the conservation of its species [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The inclusion was under the selection criteria number 10 that establishes: “to contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation”. In its operational guidelines, UNESCO requests that in order to maintain this status, the assets and properties included on the list must be protected by well-established and delimited legislation and institutional regulations, to guarantee their safeguarding. Likewise, the states must demonstrate that actions are carried out to protect them at the national, regional and local levels, and must attach the appropriate texts to the nomination with a detailed explanation of how this protection operates [

 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., are now more protected than ever, however, UNESCO has detected some factors that affect the property, such as livestock farming/grazing of domesticated animals, management plan, uncontrolled developments including ground transport infrastructure: the road network, absence of biosecurity politics to eradicate the introduction of invasive species, extreme weather events (storms and cyclones) and industrial activities among others [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There is a development and conservation program for the archipelago called: Socotra Archipelago Conservation and Development Program (SCDP). This is an initiative of the Republic of Yemen to develop and conserve the archipelago’s resources. The SCDP is supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the governments of three European countries (Italy, Poland and the Netherlands), in conjunction with international donors and private non-profit organizations. The mission of the SCDP is to join the efforts of all the aforementioned organizations and countries for the human development of the population and conservation of the biodiversity of the Socotra archipelago with a sustainable approach [
