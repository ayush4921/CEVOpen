<p>In some of the studies cited above, cytotoxicity tests were carried out. Cultured MRC-5 SV2 cells were used for the toxicity test for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. fruit and leaves extracts. Cell viability was evaluated fluorimetrically. Fluorescence was measured and cell viability results were compared versus control group (data were expressed as a percentage reduction in cell viability). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. was 29.5 ± 3.7 µg, which is interpreted as low toxicity by the authors [

 <sub>2</sub>. Confluent monolayers were incubated with dilutions of extracts (100, 50, 25, and 12.5 µg/mL) in culture medium for 3 days. The 50% inhibitory cellular concentration (ICC
 <sub>50</sub>) was measured by a dye absorption assay, with culture medium as a control. The ICC
 <sub>50</sub> of the pomegranate was less than 10 µg, which was considered non-cytotoxic [
