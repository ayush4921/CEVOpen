<p>In 2007, Mothana et al., published the study “anticancer potential of Yemeni plants used in folk medicine”. Twenty-four methanolic extracts of common plants in traditional medicine in Socotra and other Yemen states were evaluated. 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., (leaf and fruit extracts) was included. They used a microtiter plate assay based on cell staining with violet crystal to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic potency of the extracts at different concentrations, with 5 human cancer cell lines: two urinary bladder carcinomas (5637 and RT-112), two lung cancer line (A-427 and LCLC-103H) and a breast cancer line (MCF-7). The methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. exhibited a moderate potency of toxicity (seventh place of the extracts evaluated) in all tumor cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 16.5 to 37.6 µg/mL. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Dendrosicyos socotrana</italic> had the greatest cytotoxic effect against all the cancer cell lines analyzed [
