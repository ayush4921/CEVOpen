<p>In 1973, Shilkina reported that Socotran pomegranate tree wood contains fiber tracheids, (water-conducting cells). She found that tracheids are the only characteristic that differentiates 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. from the rest of botanical and arboreal varieties of the order Myrtales. She stated that this unique characteristic is not shared by even 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. Therefore, she urged that 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. be not only the only member of its species, but also the only species of a new genera. It appears that, based on the anatomy of the xylem, 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. was suggested as an ancestor of the domesticated species 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> [

 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., 2n = 14, therefore, the haploid number of chromosomes is n = 7, unlike n = 8 in 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L.; this difference is considered as a primitive characteristic of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. from the evolutionary point of view, since n = 8 is a development factor [
