<p>Moreover, Muhammad et al., [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] studied the genetic association among the genotypes of the species of 
 <italic>Punica</italic> (20 genotypes of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., 20 of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf.), based on morphological and biochemical characterization. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the 40 genotype data matrix based on morphology to represent the similarity of the two species. The phylogenetic tree divided the two species in two lineages (Regions R-I and R-II). R-I holds the 20 genotypes of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., while R-II enclosed all genotypes of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. The similarity indexes were performed for the genotype of 2 species that was 53.84% for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. In the biochemical characterization, the total seed protein profiling was carried out on slab gel electrophoresis; 10 bands were recorded in both species (molecular weight 15 KDaâ€“180 KDa) intra locus contribution toward the genetic disagreement was 10% in 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. and 50% in 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. Inter species locus contribution toward genetic diversity was 50%.
