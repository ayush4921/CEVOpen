<p>In summary, this review supports the idea that the 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. species can be considered as a powerful source of different pharmacological activities. Taking into account that it has been widely reported that this species exhibits antiviral, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antioxidant and anticancer activities. It was shown that there is a relationship between 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic>. It is not entirely clear whether the species remains vulnerable, but there are efforts to conserve it. The presence of various bioactive compounds could justify their effect, however, it is necessary further studies to demonstrate its pharmacological actions and their possible adverse effects. Additionally, it is essential to consider clinical studies to establish adequate doses in humans to evaluate the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., whereas the use of traditional medicine and complementary or alternative medicine are increasingly used in developing and developed countries.
