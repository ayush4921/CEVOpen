<p>For this purpose, the main objectives of the present investigation were to assess for the first time the phytochemical profile of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract from the Hail region (Saudi Arabia) using HR-LCMS. The antimicrobial activities of germander extract against a wide range and types of clinical bacterial and fungal isolates were also tested. The antiviral activity was tested for the first time against CVB3 and HSV-2. Inhibition of the production of some virulence factors in 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 reporter strains were also investigated for the first time in the present work.
