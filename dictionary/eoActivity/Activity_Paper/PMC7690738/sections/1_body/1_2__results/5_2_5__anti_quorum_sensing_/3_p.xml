<p>Results demonstrated that this plant extract was able to inhibit the swarming and swimming activities in a concentration-dependent manner. The highest inhibition was recorded at 100 µg/mL with a percentage of motility inhibition about (35.25 ± 2.5%) for swimming activity, and (23.66 ± 0.5%) for swarming activity.</p>
