<p>The anti-quorum-sensing activities were tested using two starter strains (
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> wild and mutant strains) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. The results showed that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract has no effect on the violacein production in the microtiter plate assay using the mutant strain 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV026 at 5 mg/mL (

 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472, on Luriaâ€“Bertani Petri dishes of agar was observed (
