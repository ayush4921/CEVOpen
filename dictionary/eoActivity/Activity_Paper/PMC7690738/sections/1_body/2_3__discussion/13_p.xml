<p>Additionally, previous results using aqueous and ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> aerial parts have shown moderate anti-rinderpest virus [

 <xref rid="B81-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> was a rich source of rosmarinic acid (1.8%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>), weak cytotoxic activity (maximum non-toxic concentration = 1000 μg/mL), and anti-Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1)—affected by the exposure time and the concentration of the extract used. In fact, after one hour of cell infection, 93.1% of HSV-1 were inhibited by 50 μg/mL of plant extract. This percentage of inhibition reached 100% after one hour of exposure to 100 and 250 μg/mL of felty germander extract [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This activity was correlated to the high concentration of rosmarinic acid, a phenolic compound known to possess antiviral activity [
