<p>Many plant extracts and essential oils have been reported to possess high anti-quorum-sensing potential and play an important role in attenuating the secretions of many virulence factors in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> reporter strains [

 <italic>T. polium</italic> alcohol extract against the production of the purple pigment by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472, a phenomenon controlled by the quorum-sensing system. Results obtained reported that the tested extract had not showed a clearly visible white halo in the violacein bioassay [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that a 95% ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> leaves was able to reduce the biofilm formed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain on a polystyrene 96-well plate at 25 ppm [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. More recently, a crude extract from air-dried aerial parts of felty germander from Egypt was able to decrease the biofilm formation by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains at low concentration [
