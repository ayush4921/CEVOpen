<p>Similarly, Taheri et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] studied the effect of extracts from 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic>, which showed antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and prevented its growth. The results support the findings of our work. Indeed, the plant extract stopped the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Additionally, Gholampour-Azizi et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], studied the in vitro antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Cucumis melo</italic> and he demonstrated that it exhibited specific antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that aqueous and ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> showed an antifungal effect against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Furthermore, another study demonstrated that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> (2.5, 10, and 20 g/L) slows down the growth of 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>. In a recent study, Akbarzdeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] studied the sensitivity of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains against a 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> smoke product. The authors demonstrated that all the standard clinical samples of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> were sensitive. On the other hand, the result of the study of the antimicrobial activity of acetone and chloroform extracts from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> against four fungal species and eleven bacteria showed that the antibacterial effect is more significant than the antifungal activity, which is in concordance with our results [
