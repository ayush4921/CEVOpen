<p>Additionally, Alzeer et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] used various solvents, and the yields of extraction were estimated at 17% (90% ethanol), 20% (80% methanol), 7.4% (acetone), 23% acetic acid, 25% (apple vinegar), 9% (grape vinegar), and 53% (coconut water). Using boiling water (1:10,
