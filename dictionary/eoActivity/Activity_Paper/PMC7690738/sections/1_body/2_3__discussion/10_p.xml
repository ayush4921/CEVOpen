<p>The microdilution method is more sensitive and permits the quantification of extract biological activity by the determination of MICs and MBCs/MFCs concentrations. Regarding MIC values, many studies confirm that, if these values are below 8 mg/mL, the extract is considered to have antimicrobial properties [

 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> (clinical strain, 115) was 25 mg/mL. However, it was 6.25 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> ATCC 29245, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (environmental strain 3), 
 <italic>S. pyogens</italic> (clinical strain), and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (environmental strain, pf8). Moreover, it was 12.5 mg/mL for the rest of the tested strains. The result of the MBC/MIC ratio interpreted using the scheme of antimicrobial substances shows that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> aerial parts methanolic extract acts like a bacteriostatic agent for all tested bacteria, except against 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> where it acts as a bactericidal agent. This result was in agreement with other studies which demonstrated that methanolic extract inhibits bacterial growth and does not kill them [
