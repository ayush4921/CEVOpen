<p>Several solvents have been used to extract and evaluate the antibacterial activity of the aerial part of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>. Indeed, organic (ethanol, methanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and chloroform) or aqueous [

 <xref rid="B73-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] extracts were used to investigate the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>. The result indicated that the organic extract showed greater activity than the aqueous extract, which defends our choice in the use of methanol for the extraction of active compounds. Other study shows that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> exhibited antibacterial activities against several bacteria among them are antibiotic resistant strains [

 <italic>T. polium</italic> had antifungal activity against fungal species (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>). Furthermore, the results of Kremer et al. [

 <italic>T. arduini</italic> L. (Lamiaceae), showed that the plant had the antimicrobial properties against

 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and various other microorganisms.
