<p>The cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract was evaluated on VERO (African green monkey kidney) cell lines using the MTT colorimetric method. A decreasing concentration of the extract (from 3333 µg/mL to 1 µg/mL) diluted in MEM supplemented with 2%-FBS was applied on VERO cells in a 96-well plate. Cell controls were incubated under the same conditions without extracts. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, the extract dilutions were substituted with the MTT solution (5 mg/mL) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then dissolved by the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The plate was read on an ELISA reader at a 570 nm wavelength to measure the optical density. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by regression analysis in comparison with a negative control [
