<p>Violacein inhibition was also tested on 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472 as previously described by Noumi et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Overnight culture (10 μL) of the starter strain adjusted to 0.4 OD at 600 nm was used to inoculate sterile microtiter plates containing 200 μL of Luria–Bertani broth and incubated in the presence and absence of various concentrations of tested germander extract (MIC-MIC/16). All 96-well plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and observed for the reduction in violacein pigment production. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The absorbance was read at 585 nm. The percentage of violacein inhibition was calculated by following formula (Equation (1)):
 <disp-formula>Violacein inhibition (%) = [(OD
  <sub>control</sub> − OD
  <sub>sample</sub>)/OD
  <sub>control</sub>] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
