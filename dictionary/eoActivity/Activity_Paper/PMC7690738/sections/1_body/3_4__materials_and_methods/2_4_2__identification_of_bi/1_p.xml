<p>The HR-LCMS analysis of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> was analyzed by using a UHPLC-PDA-Detector Mass spectrometer (HR-LCMS 1290 Infinity UHPLC System, 1260 Infinity Nano HPLC with Chipcube, 6550 iFunnel QTOFs), Agilent Technologies, USA. For chromatographic separation, an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, equipped with a binary gradient solvent pump, HiP Sampler, column oven, and MS Q-TOF with Dual AJS ES Ion Source. Samples were separated on an SB-C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8-particle size; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), maintained at 25 °C. The solvents used were: water containing 0.1% HCOOH, and acetonitrile containing 10% water and 0.1% HCOOH. The following gradient elution program at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> was applied. MS detection was performed in an MS Q-TOF Mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Compounds were identified via their mass spectra and their unique mass fragmentation patterns. Compound Discoverer 2.1, ChemSpider, and PubChem were used as the main tools for the identification of the phytochemical constituents [
