<p>The antiviral activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract was evaluated on Coxsackievirus B-3 (CVB3) and HSV-2. The viruses were propagated on permissive VERO cells in MEM medium supplemented with 2% FBS at 37°C under humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The infectious titer of the stock solution was 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID50/mL (50% tissue culture infectious doses/mL) for CVB-3 and 8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL (plaque formation units/mL, PFU) for HSV-2. A multiplicity of infection about 0.01 for CVB-3 and 0.1 for HSV-2 was seeded into cells monolayers cultivated in 96-well culture plates (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/wells), with different concentrations of the extract starting from the CC
 <sub>50</sub> value. Plates without virus or extract were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 48 h incubation, the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) for CVB-3 and the plaque virus for HSV-2 was observed in an inverted microscope [
