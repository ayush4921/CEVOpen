<p>MICs and MBCs/MFCs values were determined by a microtiter broth dilution method as previously described by Snoussi et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The test medium was Mueller–Hinton Broth (MHB) for bacterial strains, and Sabouraud dextrose broth for fungal isolates. Bacterial/fungal suspensions (100 μL) were inoculated into the wells of 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of samples with different final concentrations (ranging from 0.039 mg/mL to 100 mg/mL). The inoculated microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract, which did not show any visual growth of tested organisms, was recorded as the MIC value (expressed in mg/mL). The MBCs/MFCs values are determined by streaking all wells after the MICs values on the correspondent agar media of the tested microorganisms. MBC/MIC ratio and MFC/MIC ratio were used to interpret the activity of the essential oil as described by Gatsing et al. [
