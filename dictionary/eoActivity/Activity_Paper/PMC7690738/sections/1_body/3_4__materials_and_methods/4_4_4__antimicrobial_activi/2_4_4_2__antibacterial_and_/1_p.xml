<p>The disc diffusion assay was performed on Mueller–Hinton agar plates for all bacteria, Sabouraud chloramphenicol agar for yeasts, and potato dextrose agar for 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains as previously described by Snoussi et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].10 μL of methanolic extract mother solution (300 mg/mL) was used to impregnate 6 mm sterile discs. The experiment was done in triplicate. All Petri dishes were incubated overnight at 37 °C and the diameter of the growth inhibition zone was recorded using a 1 cm flat ruler. The mean diameter was recorded and expressed as (GIZ mm ± SD). Results obtained are interpreted using the scheme proposed by Parveen et al. [
