<p id="p0065">The modified method described by Yang et al. (2014) was used for this assay [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this test, 0.3 mL solution of extract or standard (ascorbic acid) was mixed with 3 mL of reagent mixture (4 mM ammonium molybdate, 0.6 M sulfuric acid and 28 mM trisodium phosphate). This reaction mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 90 min followed by cooling to room temperature. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 695 nm. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by comparison with the absorbance of blank preparation.
