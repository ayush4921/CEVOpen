<p id="p0105">The activity of antioxidants is usually attributed to a number of mechanisms including reducing capacity, inhibition of chain initiation, radical scavenging and decomposition of peroxides [

In this study, the date extracts were evaluated for their reducing power through the transformation of Fe(III) to Fe(II) that is contributed through the reducing ability of the extracts i.e. ability to donate electrons in the transformation of Fe(III) to Fe(II). 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(A) shows the absorbance of different concentrations of the extracts recorded at 700 nm which reveals a direct correlation between concentration and reducing power for all the three date extracts. Safawy exhibited the maximum absorbance of 0.582 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL while Sukkari exhibited the minimum absorbance of 0.565 at 0.1 mg/mL. Results of areas under curve (AUC) demonstrate that Safawy possesses higher reducing power (AUC 2.15) than Ajwah (AUC 2.12) and Sukkari (AUC 1.93) date (

When compared to the positive control, i.e., ascorbic acid (absorbance 0.68 and 0.475 at 0.1 and 0.01 mg/mL, respectively; AUC 2.82), all the three date cultivars seems to possess moderate reducing activity meaning they may not contain high amount of reductants.
