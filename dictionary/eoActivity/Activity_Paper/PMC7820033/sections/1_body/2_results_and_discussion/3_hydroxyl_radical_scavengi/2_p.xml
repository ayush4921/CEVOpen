 <sub>50</sub> of the date extracts were calculated from the % inhibition vs log concentration curve. Ajwah date cultivar showed more potent hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity than the other two cultivars. Scavenging activity of the samples was in the following order: Ajwah &gt; Safawy &gt; Sukkari (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.1, 1.22 and 1.55 mg/mL) and the results were comparable to that of ascorbic acid (0.55 mg/mL). It can be concluded from this study that these dates can be beneficial to reverse the detrimental effects of hydroxyl radical in our body, provided that necessary in vivo studies are done to approve our hypothesis.
