<p id="p0120">Chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometer have always been desirable in analytical uses because of their high sensitivity, specificity and the ability to detect hundreds of analytes in a single run without complexity as compared to other analytical tools [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In our study, ethanol extracts of Ajwah, Safawy and Sukkari date cultivars were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS in positive ion mode. Previous studies revealed that the fruits of date palm possess a complex chemical system comprising of amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, phenolics, flavonoids, sterols, phytoestrogens, carotenoids and vitamins, [

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>]. Chemical constituents reported so far from different date cultivars were matched with the molecular ion peaks observed in the mass spectrums (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a, b, c) and the results show that these date palms contain different classes of phytoconstituents. The chemical compositions of all the three date cultivars seem to be more or less similar with some exceptions (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A total of 22 compounds were identified from the three date extracts under investigation. In addition to [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> peaks, we have taken [M+Na]
 <sup>+</sup> and [M+K]
 <sup>+</sup> peaks into consideration when analyzing the mass spectra since ESI + ionization technique can lead to sodium and potassium adduct peaks in high resolution mass spectrometry [

 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. S1-S18</xref>). We revealed a number of compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids, sterols and phytoestrogens in these date cultivars that can be related to their antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These compounds especially the phenolic acids and the flavonoids (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) are very common and well established dietary antioxidants with diverse health benefits [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, sitosterol among the identified sterols and all of the identified phytoestrogens are reported to possess antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>]. Though this analysis is merely an overview of the chemistry of these dates as it was a qualitative analysis, but the difference in their chemistry can be directly correlated to their different degrees of antioxidant as well as other biological activities. In our previous study, we measured some known polyphenols in these extracts and the results are in harmony with the current study. We found that the amounts of these polyphenols present in these date cultivars are in the order of Ajwah &gt; Safawy &gt; Sukkari [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, this result also supports the antioxidant potential of these date cultivars as well as their degree of activity.
