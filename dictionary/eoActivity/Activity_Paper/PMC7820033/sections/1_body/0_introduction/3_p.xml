 <italic>r</italic>
 <italic>a,</italic> commonly known as date palm, is a very popular fruit that grows in the arid regions with extreme environmental conditions. It is native to Africa and Persian Gulf region but the origin is not certain. Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Algeria, UAE, Oman, Libya, Pakistan and Sudan are the top producers of date palm in the world [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At present around 2000 cultivars of date palm are grown all over the world [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Date palm plays an important social, environmental and economic role in these regions as principle financial and food source. Use of date palm appeared in various ancient societies (e.g., Egyptian, Roman) and religious traditions (e.g., Jewish, Christian and Islamic) [

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Apart from the rich nutritional value, dates are used in ethnobotanical practices for a number of ailments including liver disorders, diabetes, constipation, diarrhea, asthma, bronchitis, respiratory disorders and headache [
