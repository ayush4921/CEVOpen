<p id="Par36">In recent years, the biological activities (such as anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory) of phenolic compounds and their flavonoid subclass have captured significant attention due to their unique structural and functional properties [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that the methanol and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>Monotheca buxifolia</italic> leaves and stems contained a significant amount of phenolics and flavonoids. The total phenolic content was higher in the methanol extract as compared to the chloroform extract. Methanol dissolves the polar constituents of plants, including phenolics [
