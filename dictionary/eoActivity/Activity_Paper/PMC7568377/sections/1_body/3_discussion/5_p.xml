<p id="Par40">PCA analysis suggested a firm positive correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. This positive association of phenolics with antioxidant activity is in accordance with previous studies showing such a trend [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the negative relationship in a few cases may be due to the antagonistic or synergetic effect of phytochemicals or the presence of some nonphenolic chelators [

The bioactive compounds and the biological activity showed a considerable eigenvalue, in accordance with the strong correlation between the various activities and the extract components determined through HPLCâ€“PDA.
