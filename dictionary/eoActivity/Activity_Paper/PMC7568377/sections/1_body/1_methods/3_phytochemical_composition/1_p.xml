<p id="Par27">The secondary-metabolite profiling of methanol and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> leaves and stems was assessed by utilizing standard reverse-phase (RP)-UHPLC–MS analysis as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, 22 polyphenolic components (gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-OH benzoic acid, vanillic acid, epicatechin, syringic acid, 3-OH benzoic acid, 3-OH-4-MeO benzaldehyde, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, rutin, sinapinic acid, 
 <italic>t</italic>-ferullic acid, naringin, 2.3-diMeO benzoic acid, benzoic acid, 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid, quercetin, harpagoside, 
 <italic>t</italic>-cinnamic acid, naringenin, and carvacrol; standards purchased from Sigma Aldrich Milan, Italy) were also determined in extracts using HPLC–PDA analysis following a previously reported protocol [
