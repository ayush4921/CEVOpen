<p id="Par29">The enzyme-inhibitory capacity of all the concentrates against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase was explored following previously reported standard in vitro bioassays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Galantamine was used as a reference for AChE and BChE, and the cholinesterase-inhibitory potential was estimated as mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g extract. The α-amylase- and α-glucosidase-inhibitory potentials are presented as mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g extract, while the tyrosinase-inhibitory potential was recorded as mg kojic-acid equivalent (KAE)/g extract.
