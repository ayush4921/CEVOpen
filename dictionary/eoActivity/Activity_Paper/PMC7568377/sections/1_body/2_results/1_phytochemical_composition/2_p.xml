<p id="Par32">The secondary-metabolite components of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> leaf and stem extracts were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. A typical chromatogram of the extracts with mass-spectrometric detection in negative ion mode exhibited complex patterns of peaks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–d). UHPLC–MS analysis of the methanol extract of leaves revealed the presence of 16 compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the majority of which were flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoid derivatives. The most abundant components identified were a diosgenin derivative (an alkaloid) and polygalacin D (an organooxygen). Flavonoids such as kaempferol derivatives and robinin acquired major peaks in the UHPLC–MS analysis of the chloroform extract of leaves. UHPLC–MS analysis of the methanol extract of stems revealed the presence of 10 different compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The alkaloid diosgenin had the greatest peak area (1353.63), followed by the flavonoid kaempferol. Moreover, the chloroform extract of stems depicted the presence of eight compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), including lucidumol A, 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>cis</italic>-coumaroyl maslinic acid (a terpenoid derivative), and mangostenone B (a benzopyran), as the major components. The results also suggested the occurrence of other important metabolites, the majority of which belonged to diverse classes including flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, alkaloids, and fatty-acid derivatives. HPLC–PDA analysis was carried out to gain insight into the polyphenolic profile of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> leaf and stem extracts (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The results show that the methanol extract of leaves and the chloroform extract of stems contained the most phenolic compounds. Epicatechin was detected in all samples with maximum quantification (1.29 μg/mg) in the methanol extract of stems. Rutin and catechin were also present in all samples except for the chloroform extract of stems and leaves. However, catechin was quantified in a higher amount in the methanol extract of stems as compared to the other extracts. Similarly, rutin was quantified in a significantly higher amount in the chloroform extract of leaves as compared to the other extracts.
