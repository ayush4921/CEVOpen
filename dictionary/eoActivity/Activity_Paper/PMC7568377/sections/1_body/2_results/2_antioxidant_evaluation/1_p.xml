<p id="Par33">Several different assays were performed including radical-scavenging (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), ferrous-ion chelation, and phosphomolybdenum assays (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The methanol extract of stems showed prominent free-radical-scavenging activity and reducing power. The DPPH and ABTS assays presented values of 145.18 mmol TE/g and 279.04 mmol TE/g, respectively, for the methanol extract of stems (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The chloroform extract of leaves showed significant (15.95 mg EDTA equivalent (EDTAE)/g) ferrous-ion-chelating activity. All four extracts showed a nonsignificant difference for the phosphomolybdenum-based total antioxidant response.
