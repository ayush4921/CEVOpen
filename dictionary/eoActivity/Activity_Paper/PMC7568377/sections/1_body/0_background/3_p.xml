<p id="Par24">Keeping in view the medicinal value of this plant, the present study was designed to evaluate the phytochemical composition (phenolic and flavonoid contents via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS) analysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection (HPLC–PDA)) and biological potential (including the antioxidant—2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelation—and enzyme-inhibitory—acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase—properties) of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> leaf and stem extracts. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) statistical studies were carried out to explain the association of bioactive contents with biological activities. These results will provide guidelines for isolating the active constituents from this plant to be employed in pharmaceutical studies.
