<p>Herbal plants have been widely used in traditional and folk medicine as an effectual solution to cure many diseases, being a big store for bioactive compounds, especially secondary metabolites [

 <xref rid="B2-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently, a priority was given to herbal plants in terms of enhancing the production of the economically important phytochemicals through the application of cultivation procedures under stimulated growth conditions [
 <xref rid="B3-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this aspect, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been regarded as one of the most important beneficial microorganisms that are able to associate with almost two thirds of terrestrial plants improving their growth and stress tolerance [
 <xref rid="B4-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In some cases, mycorrhizal symbiosis is essential as the host plant cannot grow normally and/or survive without it [

 <xref rid="B8-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this regard, several medicinal aromatic plants, such as pennyroyal and parsley, showed enhanced levels of bioactive metabolites when associated with AMF [
