<p>Experiments were carried out following a randomized complete block design. Data normality and the homogeneity of variances were checked using the Kolmogorove–Smirnov test and Levene’s test, respectively. Each experiment was done in five replicates (n = 5). All the data was subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test at probability levels of 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001 was used to test the difference between the treatment and control or between AMF alone and the combined AMF+eCO
 <sub>2</sub> treatment. All statistical tests were performed using the computer program PASW statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
