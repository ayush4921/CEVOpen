<p>Soil potting was mixed with sterilized sand (1:3) and inculcated with a pure commercial inoculum of 
 <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic> (MUCL 41,833 obtained from Glomeromycota in vitro collection (GINCO)) at a concentration of 50 spores per soil in a pot (25 × 15 cm). The control treatments were represented by non-inoculated soil. The seeds of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> were disinfected then sown in both treated and non-treated soils. Plants were grown in a controlled greenhouse at 21/18 °C, 16/8 h day/night, and 60% humidity, they were regularly watered. The pots inn each of the control and AMF-inoculated groups were equally subdivided into two sub-groups, one subjected to 410 ppm CO
 <sub>2</sub> (ambient CO
 <sub>2</sub>; aCO
 <sub>2</sub>) and the other subjected to 620 ppm CO
 <sub>2</sub> (elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>; eCO
 <sub>2</sub>,) through the time course of the experiment. The plants were harvested after 6 weeks, then the aerial parts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C to be used in different plant analyses. For determination of dry matter and mineral elements, plant shoots were washed with distilled water and dried at 75 °C for 72 h.
