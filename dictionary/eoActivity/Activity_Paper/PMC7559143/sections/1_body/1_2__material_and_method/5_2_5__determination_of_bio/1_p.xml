<p>Several methods were used to determine the total antioxidant capacities of the plant extract, including the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), inhibition of LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation (TBARS and conjugated dienes) and inhibition of hemolysis assays [

 <xref rid="B24-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For LDL oxidation, dialyzed LDL (100 μg protein/mL) was diluted in 10 mM PBS (phosphate buffered saline containing 0.01 Mphosphate-buffer and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C in presence or absence of 10 μM CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>. Oxidation was performed with or without the sample solution of colostrum proteins. After incubation, lipid peroxidation of the LDL was measured. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was determined at 532 nm/600 nm, using 1,1,3,3-Tetramethoxypropane as standard for calibration curve, while conjugated diene formation was measured at 232 nm of LDL solution (100 μg protein/mL) in PBS incubated with CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> (10 μM) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of bovine colostrums protein [
