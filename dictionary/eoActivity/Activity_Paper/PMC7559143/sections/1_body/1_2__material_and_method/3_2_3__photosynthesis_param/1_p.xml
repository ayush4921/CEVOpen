<p>The light-saturated photosynthetic rates (μmol CO
 <sub>2</sub> m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) of mature leaves were measured (LI-COR LI- 6400, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), according to AbdElgawad et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Dark respiration was determined as the absolute CO
 <sub>2</sub> exchange rate determined at photosynthetic photon flux density (μmolm

 <sup>−1</sup>).
