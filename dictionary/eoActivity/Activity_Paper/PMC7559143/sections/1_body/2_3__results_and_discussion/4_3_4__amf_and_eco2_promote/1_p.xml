<p>Mycorrhizal symbiosis with medicinal plants has been recognized to induce the accumulation of secondary metabolites, especially phenolic compounds which play an important role in curing several ailments [
 <xref rid="B63-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The present results showed that protocatechuic, p-coumaric and rosmarinic acids are the most abundant phenolic acids; while apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin and luteolin are the predominant flavonoid in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00168-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, previous studies revealed the presence of some phenolic acids such as cinnamic, carnosic and rosmarinic acids, and also flavonoids such as luteolin and apigenin derivatives in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. There was a significant increment in the levels of the majority of the detected phenolic acids and flavonoids in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> under AMF and/or eCO
 <sub>2</sub> treatments, however the combined treatment was much more efficient than the individual ones (

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>, whereas 1,8-cineol, carvacrol and p-cymene are the most dominant followed by less amounts of linalol, α- and β-pineno, α-Phellandrene, myrecene and thymol (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00168-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There is also a significant increase in the volatile oils of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>, under the individual and combined treatments.
