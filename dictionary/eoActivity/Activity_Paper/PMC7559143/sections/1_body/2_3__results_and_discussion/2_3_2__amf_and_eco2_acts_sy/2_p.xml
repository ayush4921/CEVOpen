<p>Similar to our results, the positive effects of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on biomass of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and some other medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, have been previously investigated [
 <xref rid="B38-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, the increased biomass production in plants inoculated with AMF was reported [
 <xref rid="B39-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Regarding the interaction between eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF, It is well known that eCO
 <sub>2</sub> stimulates the photosynthetic rate and plant growth [
 <xref rid="B40-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which in turn, affects the allocation of photosynthates to AMF, consequently makes more C available to AMF colonizing the roots [
 <xref rid="B13-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], thus, increasing sink strength in mycorrhizal plants, and eventually this leads to increased C storage in soils [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Such effect is hypothesized to create a balance between carbon cost and nutrient benefits, besides reducing the negative effects of down regulation of photosynthesis caused by acclimation of plants to long-term exposure to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this regard, it has been found that both eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF, when applied individually or in combination, improved biomass production of 
 <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> and lettuce [
 <xref rid="B32-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, it has been indicated that mycorrhizal plants have higher photosynthetic rate [
 <xref rid="B33-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] when grown under high CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels. However, such an effect might differ among variable cultivars [
 <xref rid="B44-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, it was supposed that eCO
 <sub>2</sub> may impair the beneficial effects of AMF on plant biomass, especially when the fungal community is dominated by 
 <italic>Glomus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B45-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This might be due to the difference among AMF taxa in their exchange of carbon and nutrients [
 <xref rid="B46-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
