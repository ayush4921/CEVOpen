<p>It has been known that the photosynthetic rate, and consequently biomass production, could be improved under the effect of AMF inoculation, as a result of the expected increased nutrients uptake [

 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere due to the enhancement of the carboxylation reaction of rubisco [
 <xref rid="B37-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Supporting this hypothesis, the current results revealed that eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF independently, and to more extent in combination, promoted photosynthetic rate and biomass production in
