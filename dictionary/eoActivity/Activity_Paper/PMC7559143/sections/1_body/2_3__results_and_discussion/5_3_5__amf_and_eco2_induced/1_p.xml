<p>Reactive oxygen species and free radicals have been recognized to induce harmful effects on living organisms. In this aspect, antioxidants, such as phenolic compounds and volatile oils, could act as free radical scavengers [
 <xref rid="B71-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The present results showed an increase in the total antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>, tested by different methods (FRAP, ORAC, inhibition of LDL oxidation (TBARS and conjugated dienes) and inhibition of hemolysis), under the effects of AMF and/or eCO

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> extracts have been attributed to their content of volatile oils, especially carvacrol and thymol [

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> and proved to inhibit oxidative hemolysis [
