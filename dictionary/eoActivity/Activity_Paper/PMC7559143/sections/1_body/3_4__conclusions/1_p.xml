<p>Based on the above results, it is clear that the tested plant, 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>, has benefited from the independent and combined effects of both AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, however their synchronous application is much more beneficial. Such positive impacts are being reflected on improved biomass production and higher accumulation of primary (sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and organic acids), and secondary (phenolic acids, flavonoids and volatile oils) metabolites. 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> plants grown under synchronous application of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> have taken much advantage over those grown under the individual effects of both factors in terms of improved growth and bioactive components. Thus, the current study clearly shows that co-application of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> is a promising approach to improve the growth and the nutritional and health promoting values of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>. Further, the robust monitoring of primary and secondary metabolites presented herein could support our understanding about the mechanisms behind the positive impacts of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on plants.
