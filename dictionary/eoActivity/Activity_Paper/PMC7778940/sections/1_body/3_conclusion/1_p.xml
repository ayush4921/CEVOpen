<p>Given the unique properties and potential advantages of PROTACs in the pharmaceutical sciences, data collection is necessary to address the challenge of the design of potent PROTACs. Therefore, we present a user-friendly PROTAC-DB server that enables researchers to easily query, browse and analyze the structures of PROTACs in the database. As the rapid development of PROTACs, we will constantly add new data, update the database and improve the usability of the web interface. We expect that PROTAC-DB can be served as a valuable resource and powerful tool for the rational design of PROTACs.</p>
