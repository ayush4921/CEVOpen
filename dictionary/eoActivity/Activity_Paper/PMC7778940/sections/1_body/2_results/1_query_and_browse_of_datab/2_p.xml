<p>The browsing tools summarize the data in PROTAC-DB through two categories: ‘Target browse’ and ‘Compound browse’. The target browse will display the list of the names of the targeted proteins under the class tabs of ‘PROTACs’, ‘Warheads’, ‘E3 ligands’ and ‘Linkers’. Then, clicking on the selected proteins in the list will jump to the list of all compounds corresponding to the protein. The compound browse is mainly utilized to visualize the 2D structures of all compounds under the class tabs of ‘PROTACs’, ‘Warheads’, ‘E3 ligands’ and ‘Linkers’. In addition, under the class tabs of ‘PROTACs’, ‘Warheads’ and ‘E3 ligands’, the biological activities will also be displayed.</p>
