<p>For warheads and E3 ligands, only the initial structures are shown in the searching results. The structures integrated into PROTACs after modification are summarized in their corresponding detailed information pages. Moreover, the biological activities of the initial structures are also displayed in the datasheet. Similarly, the datasheet can also be sorted according to these criteria.</p>
