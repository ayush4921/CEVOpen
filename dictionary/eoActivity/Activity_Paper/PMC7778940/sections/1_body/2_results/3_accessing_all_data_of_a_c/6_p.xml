<p>For warheads and E3 ligands, their detailed information pages are quite similar, and thus only those of warheads are described here. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, the summary tab shows the initial structure of the warhead, compound ID, name, target, and molecular weight. Similarly, users can also look up the similar compounds in the database through the ‘Similar Compounds’ button and the similarity threshold is also ≥0.80. In addition, the MOL and SDF files of the compound are also downloadable here. For the PROTAC tab (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), the first row displays the structure integrated into PROTACs after modification. Moreover, the PROTACs based on this warhead are summarized here to help users analyze the data easier. Users can also choose the PROTAC data for a specific target to display when this warhead targets multiple proteins. Besides, the detailed information page also contains the representation, calculated properties, activity data and external resources tabs which are not displayed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The representation, calculated properties, activity data tabs are similar to those of PROTACs. The external resources tab includes the links to external databases such as PubChem, ChEMBL and BindingDB.
