<p>The first PROTAC was reported by Sakamoto 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in 2001, and it consists of a covalent inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) and a ten-residue phosphopeptide fragment capable of recruiting an F-box protein β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP) (

 <italic>in vivo</italic>, researchers have increasingly focused on the development of potent small-molecule PROTACs. In 2008, Schneekloth 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported the first small-molecule PROTAC, which degraded androgen receptor (AR) through its recruitment to the E3 ligase, MDM2 (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7–13</xref>). Encouragingly, two PROTACs named ARV-110 and ARV-471, targeting AR and estrogen receptor (ER), respectively, have been advanced into phase I clinical trials (
