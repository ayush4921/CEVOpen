<p>Although there are some comprehensive databases that also collect some PROTACs information, such as GtoPdb (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), PubChem (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and ChEMBL (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the quantity and experimental information of PROTACs in these databases are still quite limited. Here, a newly developed database, PROTAC-DB, is therefore introduced with a user-friendly web interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online database that collects the diverse information related to PROTACs, including their chemical structures, biological activities, and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, to better facilitate user analysis, the structures of PROTACs are divided into three domains, including warheads, E3 ligands and linkers. The PROTACs with the same warheads, E3 ligands or linkers can be categorized into different detailed information pages, which can also be served as a valuable resource for the rational design of PROTACs. Moreover, all data of PROTACs, warheads, E3 ligands and linkers are available for downloading as either SDF or CSV files.
