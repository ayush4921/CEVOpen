<p>Despite the tremendous progress made over the past decade, designing PROTACs with desirable physicochemical, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties still remains a big challenge. Different from traditional small molecule drugs, PROTACs may not conform to the Lipinski's ‘rule of five’ due to their high molecular weight, which would limit their cellular permeability and other drug-like properties (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although the optimization of PROTACs should focus more on the whole molecule rather than the individual components, it is useful to consider them individually in preliminary PROTAC design (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the exploration of the linker designs is endless. In order to boost the rational design of PROTACs, it is quite essential to collect and annotate experimental data and structural information about PROTACs.
