  <italic>Mangifera longipes</italic> and 
  <italic>Quercus gomeziana</italic> both is an ethnomedicinally important Asian herb that has been known for numerous healing activity of tribal people. The present research aims to investigate the phytochemical analysis with 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> possibilities of the soluble ethanol extract of 
  <italic>M. longipes</italic> root (EEMLR) and 
  <italic>Q. gomeziana</italic> leaves (EEQGL) by an experimental approach. The plant extract of EEMLR and EEQGL was found secondary metabolites, notably steroids, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, gums, and alkaloids. Additionally, the extract showed significant activity in antioxidant, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, membrane stabilization, cytotoxic, thrombolytic, and analgesic activities while no response in antibacterial activity. Our findings reveal that soluble ethanol extract of EEMLR and EEQGL is safe, which can be an effective source for exploring new medicinal products. This research's outcomes may provide potentials for mitigating pyrexia, inflammation, pain, cellular toxicity, and coagulation.
