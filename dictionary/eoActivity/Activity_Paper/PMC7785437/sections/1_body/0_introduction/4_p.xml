There were some phenolic compounds discovered to inhibit oxidation on late 1940 has applied in food industry as synthetic antioxidants mentioned as BHA, BHT, gallates have several severe disadvantages due to highly volatile, highly sensitive to elevated temperatures, and they are all suspicious to have various toxic features (
