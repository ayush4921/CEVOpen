  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>Wild edible plants are good sources for bioactive compounds, vitamins, and minerals with various applications. They can play a role in supporting the immune system and are highly beneficial as resources. Suaeda monoica Forssk is a wild edible plant that grows in Iraq and it’s biological activities have not yet reported. </p>

  <title>Methods:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Saueda monoica Forssk</italic> bioactive compounds were extracted by a microwave-assisted extraction method using ethanol as a solvent, and its chemical composition was analyzed by GC-MS. The biological activities were evaluated via antioxidant, anti-liver-cancer, antibacterial, and toxicity tests in vitro.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The results of GC-MS analysis showed that there were about 20 bioactive compounds. The most abundant compound was N,N-Dimethylglycine methyl ester, followed by 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, n-Hexadecanoic acid, and N,N-Dimethylglycine. The antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract of the plant showed a significant IC
   <sub>50</sub>. The extract of 
   <italic>S. monoica</italic> against liver cancer cells (HCAM) showed significant toxicity. Flow cytometric analysis showed a significant induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrested at G1 phase.

  <title>Conclusions:</title>
  <p>The results indicated the significance of the components of Iraqi S. monoica Forssk by MAE method as a potential food supplement in nutrition systems to prevent liver cancer and enhance the liver’s defense against diseases.</p>
