 <italic>Crithmum maritimum L</italic>. was promised in prevent growth of Hepatocellular carcinoma (Gnocchi et al., 2020). Mariangela and her group found that 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare L</italic>. showed significant anti-proliferative against liver cancer cells HepG2 (Mariangel et al., 2015). Nasir and his group used percolation extraction method by ethanol and then used four solvent (dicholormethane, ethyl acetate,, hexane and n-butanol) for extract fractions of S. monoica. Among the four solvents, dichloromethane was the most active in cells proliferation of HepG2 and it subjected for isolation the four compounds from Saudi Arabic 
 <italic>Saueda monoica Forssk</italic> and found among them only two compounds showed a potential action against liver cancer cells HepG2 (Nasir et al., 2020).
