<p>The studies have shown that microwave-assisted extraction is an important method for the extraction of bioactive compounds because it is selective, fast, and economical, and it may replace other extraction methods to discover new natural compounds. The chemical composition of 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extracted by microwave-assisted extraction have not yet reported. Therefore, used an ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> prepared via MAE method in constant conditions for the first time, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 (a)</xref>. The compounds contain N and O in their structures as derivatives of amino acids, fatty acids, and phenol or toxic compounds such nitrites and oxalate. These are important for human health due to their biological functions and cannot be produced by the body. Compared the results to those of Elsharabasy and his group (Elsharaby et al., 2019), who used different solvents and extraction methods for wild Saudi Arabian 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic>. The results exhibited some similar and selective bioactive compounds. The environmental effects of the soil play an important role in the secondary metabolism of wild plant growth to produce bioactive compounds, and recommend using microwave-assisted extraction as an extraction method in future experiments for the isolation of natural molecules from medicinal plants.
