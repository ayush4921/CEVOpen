<p>Wild edible plants are an important source of edible healthy food due to the nature of the chemical components in the fruits, leaves, roots, tubers, and rhizomes, which could have applications in medical uses and daily diet (Bharucha et al., 2010). Common wild edible plants include amaranth, asparagus, burdock, cattail, clovers, chickweed, and chicory (Tariku and Eyayo, 2017). They are reported to be used as ointments for wounds and possess antiviral activity. Various countries have been using wild edible plants species, like India, China, and some Arab and African countries (Geng et al., 2016). A number of wild edible plants grow in Iraq, but few studies have reported on their chemical compositions. One report showed the bacterial activity of 22 Iraqi wild plants (Abdulameer, 2014). One of the most famous wild edible plants in Iraq is 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica Forssk</italic>, which belongs to the family 
 <italic>Chenopodiaceae</italic> and grows in hypersaline soil (Iwona et al., 2014). It is used by Iraqi people in the southern region as a vegetable food and is available in vegetable shops or markets. It is believed to have health benefits, it has a good taste, and is non-toxic (Ali et al., 2018). One study investigated the phytoconstituents of a methanol extract of the wild plant in Saudi Arabia (Elsharabasy et al., 2019). People are suffering from liver diseases due to viruses, drugs, poisons, alcohol, cancer, and inherited diseases (Xiong and Guan, 2017). The long tradition of medicinal plants that have been used liver disease treatment could help to discover new plants with new bio-functions to prevent liver diseases and understand the mechanisms of action (Li et al., 2018). Wild plants could play a role in hepatic protection due their antioxidant content, which could prevent damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit free radical generation (Guan and He, 2015). The phyto-nutrients discovered in wild plants are growing and can be explored using different extraction methods and solvents (Traka and Mithen, 2011). Saline soils and environmental factors play a role in the chemical composition of wild plants (Ceccanti et al., 2019). In addition, their toxicity has to be evaluated, and the compositions of toxic compounds have to be determined to identify the toxicity of edible species and the safety of high and low-toxicity compounds like nitrites and oxalate (Yang et al., 2020). Thus, examining the toxicity of wild edible plants is very important to demonstrate the limits or high benefits of the components, while taking into consideration the development of cultivation techniques, which can also control or reduce the toxic compounds in the plants (Cornanra et al., 2018). Hence, Few reports have been used microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) for wild plants components with various solvents and compared with other extraction methods such as maceration and soxhlet extraction methods (Li et al., 2017). MAE exhibited high selective efficiency for the bioactive compounds (Belwal et al., 2017). The biological properties of wild plants components extracted by MAE have not yet reported, and one report showed high antioxidant activity of three wild edible mushrooms extracted by MAE (Özyürek et al., 2014). Therefore, in the present research, used microwave-assisted extraction and ethanol solvent to investigate the bioactive compounds, antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-liver cancer properties of 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> (wild edible plant).
