<p>DPPH assay is a simple method for evaluating the scavenger activity of medicinal herb extracts. Here, used micro-plate reader (96 plate/well) with different concentrations of monoica extract (10-80) µl and mixed with a constant concentration of DPPH and kept in a dark place for 20-30 min. Color changed to transparent indicated the scavenger ability of extract against DPPH. The results showed significant antioxidant action: the color of the test solution changed from dark violet to transparent after storing it for 30 min. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 93.93 µg/ml, which was compared with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of vitamin C (79.69 µg/ml), as shown in (
