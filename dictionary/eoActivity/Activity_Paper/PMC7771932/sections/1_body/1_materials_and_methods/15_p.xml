 <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> on the viability of liver cancer cells HCAM as described in with some modifications (Ali et al., 2011). Briefly, liver cancer cells were plated at a density of 1x104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with 100 μl of complete culture medium containing (400, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1800) µg/ml of plant extract with an equal amount of DMSO as negative control. After incubation for 24 h, cell viability was determined, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) in phosphate buffered saline was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After removal of the medium, 150 μl DMSO was added to each well and shaken carefully, the absorbance was recorded by micro-plate reader (ELISA, Asyshitech., UK) at a wavelength of 620 nm, the inhibition ratio of compounds on cell growth was calculated using equation (2) (Al-Shammari et al., 2016):
