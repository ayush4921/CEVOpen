<p>The current study aimed to explore a new 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit essential oil chemical composition and its antioxidant activity, in order to provide more information about its health benefits. The oil exhibited higher antioxidant activity than the tested standards. In silico prediction and molecular docking studies showed good correlation between the observed inhibitory activity and the in silico molecular docking scores, with methyleugenol, eugenol, β-caryophyllene oxide, isocembrol, α-selinene, and viridiflorol, the main contributors of the antioxidant activity, sharing many common residues with the human peroxiredoxin 5 active site. Therefore, they may be potent inhibitors, in synergism effect with minor compounds. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil can be a new potential resource for future research to design new and more potent antioxidative agents.
