<p>Indeed, based on the above results, the higher antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil could be related to this synergistic effect. The high content of methyleugenol/eugenol (75.26%) associated with other constituents (major and minor components) also could have been responsible for their bioactivities. Eugenol possesses the ability to transfer electron or hydrogen atoms by neutralizing free radicals, which can block the oxidative process [

The presence of methyleugenol/eugenol as the principal chemotype of this oil gives him better antioxidant potency, and therefore good DNA damage protective effects, which can be manifested via direct trapping of the free radicals or inhibiting the propagation of radical chain reactions through transfers of hydrogen or electrons. Overall, the significant antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil confirms the uses of cubeba fruit as a source of antioxidants, which may provide health-promoting advantages to consumers.
