<p>Zawawi et al. explored β-glucuronidase inhibitors using structure based design of benzimidazole with 2,5-disubstitued-1,3,4-oxadiazoles. The investigation revealed that the aromatic side chains directly attached to the oxadiazole moiety influence the inhibitory potential of the benzimidazole derivatives. The structure activity relationship (SAR) study proposed the reliance of inhibition upon the aromatic ring residue and its derivatives. For instance, fluoro groups in compounds (
