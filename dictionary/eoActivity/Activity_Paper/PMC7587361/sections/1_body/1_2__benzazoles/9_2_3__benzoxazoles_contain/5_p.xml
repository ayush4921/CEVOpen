<p>Omori et al. reported a novel benzoxazole NPY Y5 antagonist to construct an SAR study to identify a hit for a lead compound suitable for in vivo study [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. From this SAR study, the replacement of 
 <italic>ortho</italic> trifluoromethyl (compound 
 <bold>43</bold>) caused a decrease in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> compared with the 
 <italic>meta</italic> &amp; 
 <italic>para</italic> position-substituted compounds 
 <bold>44</bold>,
