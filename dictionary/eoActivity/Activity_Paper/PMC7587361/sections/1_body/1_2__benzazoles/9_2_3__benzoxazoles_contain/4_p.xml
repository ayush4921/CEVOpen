<p>In their effort to obtain orally potent VLA-4 inhibitors, Setoguchi et al. disclosed the optimum replacement lipophilic moiety which is 7-fluoro-2-(1-methyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-indol-3-yl)-1,3-benzoxazolyl group (
 <bold>42</bold>) with (
 <italic>N</italic>â€²-phenylureido) phenyl group. The fluorine placed at position-7 in the benzoxazole skeleton provides a potent activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.7 and 156 nM (+3% HSA). The alteration of placing fluorine in the lipophilic moiety, made the compound easier to use with a certain serum protein as carrier, thus resulting in a high serum concentration. It also has excellent efficacy in a bronchial inflammatory model and favorable PK profile [
