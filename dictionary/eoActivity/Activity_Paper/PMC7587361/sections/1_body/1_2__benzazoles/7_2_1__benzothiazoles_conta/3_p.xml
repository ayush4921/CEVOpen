<p>In addition, Gill et al. developed a new series of N-alkylbromo-benzothiazoles with improved efficacy and selective action. Their findings [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] suggest that the benzothiazole bearing a strong electron-withdrawing atom such as fluorine at position-6, improves the cytotoxicity against particular cancer cell lines. Fluorine benzothiazole 
 <bold>15</bold> exhibits the highest potency against leukemia THP-1 cancer cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 and 0.9 μM) and was higher than that of mitomycin-C (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.5 μM) when compared to other non-fluorinated derivatives. Thus, this compound can be studied further to serve as a lead compound for anticancer drug development.
