<p>A new series of benzothiazole Schiff base derivatives was prepared by Al-Harthy et al. These derivatives were synthesized based on the most potent antibiotic fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, aiming to mimic its biological activity by bearing both fluorine and piperazine moieties. The fluoroquinolone directly inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis, resulting in cell death. The fluoroquinolone mechanism of action is believed to involve inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes, required for supercoiling replication and separation of bacterial DNA [
