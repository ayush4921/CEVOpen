<p>The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in a molecule e.g., fluorine increases the cytotoxic activity which was supported by several studies. For example, Li et al. prepared a new series of antitumor agents by the combination of different pharmacophores of 2-substituted-3-sulfonyl aminobenzamide with benzothiazole, orthiazolo[5,4-b]pyridine, or [1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-a]pyridine in an attempt to enhance the potency. As a result, nineteen structures were prepared, characterized and evaluated via MTT assay against four human cancer cell lines including HCT-116, A549, MCF-7 and U-87 MG. Among the prepared compounds, fluorinated compound 
 <bold>14</bold> displays potent activities against the four cancer cell lines and its anticancer effect was further tested in the nude mouse HCT-116 colon adenocarcinoma xenograft model in which BEZ235 (30 mg/kg) was used as positive drug. From the experiment, they noticed a weight loss of tested animal while using BEZ235, unlike in compound 
 <bold>14</bold> and that can be referred to its low toxicity [
