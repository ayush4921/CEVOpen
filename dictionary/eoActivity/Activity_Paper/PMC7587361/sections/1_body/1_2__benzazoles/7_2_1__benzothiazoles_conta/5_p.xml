<p>A novel series of aminobenzothiazole linked to pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine conjugates was synthesized by Kamal et al. and evaluated for their antitumor activities against five human cancer cell lines. The in vitro screening results disclosed that the 4-fluoro substituted derivatives exhibit a potent and selective anticancer activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.94–3.46 μM [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. It has been subjected to more detailed biological studies such as cell cycle analysis, tubulin polymerization studies, and Immunohistochemistry studies on tubulin. Out of these studies, compound 
 <bold>17</bold> showed G2/M cell cycle arrest and 65.9% inhibition of tubulin assembly in MCF-7 cells, which makes it a promising candidate for development of breast cancer therapy.
