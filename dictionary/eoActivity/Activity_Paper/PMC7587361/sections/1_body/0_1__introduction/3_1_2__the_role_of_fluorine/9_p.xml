<p>In drug design, the most crucial properties that control membrane binding are the lipophilicity and the cross-sectional area. Thereby, fluorine is a good choice as a lipophilic moiety in modulating lipophilicity for bioactive compounds. Lipophilicity is often expressed as log P, the logarithm of the partition coefficient of a compound between octanol and water. It is inaccurate to generalize the fact that fluorine substitution can always increase the lipophilicity of a molecule. Prediction of fluorine substitution and its effect on lipophilicity is not straightforward since it depends on the scaffold and proximal functionality. Monofluorination or trifluorination of saturated alkyl groups often decreases lipophilicity unlike in difluorination [
