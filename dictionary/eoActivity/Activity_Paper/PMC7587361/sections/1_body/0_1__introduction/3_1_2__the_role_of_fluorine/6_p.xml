<p>The fluorine influence on pKa has been studied systematically in order to improve pharmaceutical properties of a thrombin inhibitor by lowering the pKa. Upon fluorine substitution, the pKa follows the expected trend and the binding affinity against thrombin and trypsin (Ki) decreases as the pKa decreases. Utilizing the linear free energy relationships (LFERs) to find out the relationship between the binding affinity and pKa, it was revealed that the thrombin inhibition is more sensitive to pKa of the amidine functionality than the inhibition of trypsin [
