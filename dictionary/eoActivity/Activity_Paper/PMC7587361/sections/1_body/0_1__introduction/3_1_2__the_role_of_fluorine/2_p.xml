<p>Typically, fluorine substitution lowers the pKa of the nearby functionality in which protic groups become more acidic and basic groups become less basic. The pKa of an ionizable center of a drug molecule can alter its lipophilicity. The pKa can be tuned and this can manifest in the potency, selectivity, toxicity, as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which is things are manifested in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Besides that, it can also play an important role in reducing the potential toxicity. Thus, understanding the effect of fluorine substitution on the lead compound facilitates the journey of development of therapeutic agents. In acyclic aliphatic amines, as the fluorine substitution increases, the pKa decreases. Generally, the length of the chain does not shift the pKa of the amine [
