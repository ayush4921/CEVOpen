<p>It is worth mentioning that the emergence of fluoroquinolones in the 1980s, brought fluorine to the forefront in medicinal chemistry. Fluoroquinolones are classified as second generation quinolones and have made a paradigm shift in scientific and clinical considerations, compounds such as norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin are good examples [

The incorporation of fluorine at postion-6 resulted in enhancing Gram-positive activities compared to other analogues. Fluorine plays a vital role in increasing the antibacterial potency [
