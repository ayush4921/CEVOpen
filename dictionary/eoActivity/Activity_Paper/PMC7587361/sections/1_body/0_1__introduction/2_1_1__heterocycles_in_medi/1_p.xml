<p>Heterocycles are indispensable constituent molecules widely distributed in Nature and involved in many essential biomolecules. Heterocyclic organic compounds are involved in an exceptionally broad domain of reactions in Nature and their utility extends to different disciplines: like medicine [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fluorine was synthetically incorporated in many heterocycles in the 1970s and onwards when an appreciation of the significance of fluorine started to emerge in medicinal chemistry. Fluorinated compounds comprise about a quarter of commercially available drugs in the market [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The number of compounds containing fluorine has increased year by year during the past 50 years and the reputation of fluorine continues till today where among the 48 new approved drugs in 2019, there were 13-fluorine containing drugs. That is due to the unique features of fluorine, which are discussed later in details. In medicinal chemistry, since the journey of drug development is long, challenging and risky, choosing the proper moiety is highly crucial and fluorine has become a popular moiety used in small molecules to affect the biological activity.
