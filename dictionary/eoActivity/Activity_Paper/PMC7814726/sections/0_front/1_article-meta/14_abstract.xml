  <italic>Salvia macrosiphon</italic> Boiss. is an aromatic perennial herb belonging to the family Lamiaceae. Phytochemical studies and biological activities of this plant have been rarely documented in the literature. The current study aimed to investigate antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of different fractions of aerial parts of 
  <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic>. Also, we tried to isolate and identify cytotoxic compounds from the plant. In this respect, the hydroalcoholic extract of the corresponding parts of the plant was fractionated into four fractions. Then, antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of each fraction were examined. It was found that the chloroform fraction had a good antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The most potent cytotoxicity was also obtained by the 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction comparing with etoposide as the reference drug which was selected for the study and characterization of secondary metabolites. Accordingly, 13-epi manoyl oxide (
  <bold>1</bold>), 6α-hydroxy-13-epimanoyl oxide (
  <bold>2</bold>), 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone (
  <bold>3</bold>), and β-sitosterol (
  <bold>4</bold>) were isolated and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity. Among them, compound 
  <bold>1</bold> revealed significant cytotoxicity against A549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231. It merits mentioning that it showed high selectivity index ratio regarding the low cytotoxic effects on Human Dermal Fibroblast which can be considered as a promising anticancer candidate.
