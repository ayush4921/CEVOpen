<p id="Par17">NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance, as 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectra were recorded on an Avance III spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 400.20 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 100.63 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C. Solvents for the extraction and column chromatography (CC) were of technical grade and redistilled before use. Silica gel for CC (70–230 mesh) and precoated silica gel F254 (20 × 20 cm) plates for TLC, both supplied by the Merck were used. Deuterated solvents (100 atom %D) were from Armar Chemicals. TLC plates were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying with 0.5% anisaldehyde in MeOH, followed by heating at 150 °C.
