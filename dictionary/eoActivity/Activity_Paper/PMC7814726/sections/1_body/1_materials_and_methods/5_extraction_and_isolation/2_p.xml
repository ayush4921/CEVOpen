 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction (20.0 g) was then loaded on a silica gel column (700 g, 70–230 mesh, 10 × 30 cm) and it components were separated with a gradient mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and dichloromethane (100:0 to 0:100) as eluent, followed by increasing concentration of acetone (up to 100%) in dichloromethane. The effluents were combined to 25 fractions (F1–F25) based on TLC patterns (bands were detected on TLC under UV or by heating after spraying with 0.5% anisaldehyde in methanol).
