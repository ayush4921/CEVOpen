<p id="Par24">Fraction F6 [30 mg, eluted with dichloromethane-petroleum ether (50:50)] was separated over a silica gel CC (50 g, 70–230 mesh, 1.5 × 60 cm) with a gradient mixture of chloroform/acetone (100/0 to 80/20) as eluent, to afford seven subfractions (6a-6 g). Subfraction 6f was further purified by prep. TLC [chloroform-acetone (95:5)] to afford β-sitosterol (
 <bold>4</bold>). Fraction F7 [100 mg, eluted with dichloromethane-petroleum ether (60:40)] was subjected to silica gel CC (70 g, 70–230 mesh, 2 × 80 cm) and eluted with chloroform-petroleum ether (70:30) to give apigenin-4’,7-dimethylether (
 <bold>3</bold>). From fraction F15 [3 g, eluted with dichloromethane-acetone (80:20)], crude crystals were obtained which were recrystallized from chloroform to afford 13-epi manoyl oxide (
 <bold>1</bold>). Fraction F17 [200 mg, eluted with dichloromethane-acetone (80:20)] was subjected to silica gel CC (65 g, 70–230 mesh, 2 × 75 cm) with chloroform-acetone (70:30) as eluent and subfractions (17a-17d) were obtained. Subfraction 17b was further purified by prep. TLC [chloroform-acetone (80:20)] to afford 6α-hydroxy-13-epimanoyl oxide (
 <bold>2</bold>). Their structure was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in comparison to the literature for 13-epi manoyl oxide
