<p id="Par34">With these results in hand, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction was candidate for further phytochemical analysis leading to isolation and identification of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>. It worth mentioning that there is no report for the cytotoxicity of those compounds except β-Sitosterol which depicted no activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Cytotoxic evaluation of isolated compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) demonstrated much higher cytotoxicity of 13-epi manoyl oxide (
 <bold>1</bold>) against all cancerous cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed activity against A549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s = 19.37, 15.79, 22.24 µM comparing with etoposide with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s = 28.17, 37.51, and 34.49 µM, respectively. It should be mention that promising safety was obtained in the case of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> and SI ratio was calculated as 17.4, 21.4, and 15.2 on A549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 comparing with those calculated for etoposide with SI ratio of 5.6, 4.2, and 4.6. (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) indicating its high efficacy with negligible side effects on normal cells.
