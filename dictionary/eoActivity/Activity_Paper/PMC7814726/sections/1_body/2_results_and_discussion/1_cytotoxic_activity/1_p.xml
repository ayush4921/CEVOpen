 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water-soluble fractions were screened towards lung cancer cell line (A549) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) as well as normal cell, human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), using MTT assay comparing with etoposide as a standard drug (Table

 <sub>50</sub>) values (µg /mL) were calculated by linear regression analysis, expressed in mean ± SD.
