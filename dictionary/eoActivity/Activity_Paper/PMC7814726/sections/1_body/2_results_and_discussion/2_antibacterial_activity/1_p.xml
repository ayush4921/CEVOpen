<p id="Par36">The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate fractions of aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> was evaluated against gram-positive bacterium (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and gram-negative bacterium (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) based on the agar microdilution method (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). It was found that all fractions depicted moderate to good antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 0.61 to 2.5 mg/mL comparing with ampicillin with MIC values of 0.5 and 0.12 µg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Among fractions, the chloroform fraction exhibited more potent activity against both strains (MIC = 0.61 mg/mL) and ethyl acetate fraction showed lower activity than chloroform fraction against both strains (MIC = 0.80 mg/mL). However, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction with MIC values of 1.25 and 2.50 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively was the weakest antibacterial fraction.
