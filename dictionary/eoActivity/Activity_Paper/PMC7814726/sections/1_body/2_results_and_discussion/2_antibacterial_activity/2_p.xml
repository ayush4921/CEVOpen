<p id="Par37">Antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> has not been fully investigated, however, Javidnia et al. reported the activity of methanolic extract of the plant against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which showed MIC values of 1 and 0.5Â mg/mL, respectively. It seemed that chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions were more potent than the methanolic extract against

 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
