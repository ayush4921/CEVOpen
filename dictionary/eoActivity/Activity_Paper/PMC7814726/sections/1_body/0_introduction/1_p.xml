 <italic>Salvia</italic> is the largest genus among the Lamiaceae family members and possesses more than 1000 species which are widely distributed around the world. The Iranian flora comprises 61 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species, 17 of which are endemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A number of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genus with valuable biological activities are commercially important and used as a flavoring agent in foods, cosmetics, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The name of 
 <italic>Salvia </italic>comes from the Latin word “salvare” meaning “to heal”, endorsing its medical applications for thousands of years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species have been widely used since ancient times for the treatment of different diseases such as colds, bronchitis, tuberculosis, menstrual disorders, and haemorrhage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this respect, antiproliferative effects of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species on human tumor cell lines [

 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of essential oil of Turkish 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, and insecticidal activities of 
 <italic>S. mirzayanii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], acetylcholine esterase and melanin synthesis inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], potent cytotoxicity, antioxidant, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of essential oil of 
 <italic>S. syriaca</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>salvia officinalis</italic> against periodontopathogens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have absorbed lots of attention. Furthermore, different components isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species have shown desired biological activity, e.g. antioxidant activity of abietane diterpenoids from 
 <italic>Salvia barrelieri</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], antiprotozoal activity of triterpenoids from 
 <italic>Salvia hydrangea</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and cytotoxic activity of diterpenoids isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia hypargeia</italic> [
