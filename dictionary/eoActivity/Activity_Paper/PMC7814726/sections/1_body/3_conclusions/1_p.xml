<p id="Par39">In conclusion, we investigated phytochemical analysis and biological activities of aerial parts 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic>. Antibacterial evaluation of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate fractions of the plant against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> indicated good activity with MIC values ranging from 0.61 to 2.5 mg/mL. Further studies were devoted to the investigation of cytotoxic activity. Evaluation of all fractions against A549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231demonstrated very good efficacy of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction leading to phytochemical analysis and cytotoxic evaluation of this fraction for the first time. Among four isolated compounds (13-epi manoyl oxide 
 <bold>1</bold>, 6α-hydroxy-13-epimanoyl oxide 
 <bold>2</bold>, 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone 
 <bold>3</bold>, and β-sitosterol 
 <bold>4</bold>); compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was found as effective as etoposide against A549 and MDA-MB-231 and depicted higher activity than the reference drug, against MCF-7. Another good point comes back to the higher SI ratio of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> for all cancerous cell lines and normal cell (HDF) comparing with etoposide verifying its efficacy and safety. It seems that the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction and also chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> can be considered for comprehensive investigations to provide an herbal anticancer agent.
