<p id="p0185">In conclusion, 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaf extract curtailed the toxic effects of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin on the liver and kidney respectively. Histopathological examination established the ameliorative potentials of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaf extract as reflected in the restoration of both liver and kidney histoarchitecture that were initially distorted by the toxicants. Liver and kidney function biomarkers which were grossly altered following exposure to the toxicants, were also restored dose-dependently in a manner comparable to animals treated with silymarin. Hence, 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> has potentials that can be exploited in the management of liver and kidney diseases.
