 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract restored enzymatic activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase and creatine kinase which were initially lost after exposure to the toxicants (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Restoration was dose dependent and comparable to animals treated with standard drug (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively caused a marked derangement of lipid profile (triglycerides, low density lipoproteins (LDL), cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL)) in experimental animals (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract reversed the derangement to a level comparable with the negative control and animals treated with silymarin respectively. Biomarkers of liver (AST, ALT, ALP, Total bilirubin) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and kidney (creatine kinase, urea and uric acid) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) were significantly raised in the animals administered with CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin without treatment. Treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaf extract reversed the trend by restoring values of these biomarkers to that comparable with animals treated with silymarin (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Reduced glutathione (GSH) which was depleted by exposure to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively were raised back to values similar to negative control animals (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) after treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaf extract. Finally, lipid peroxidation was markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).
