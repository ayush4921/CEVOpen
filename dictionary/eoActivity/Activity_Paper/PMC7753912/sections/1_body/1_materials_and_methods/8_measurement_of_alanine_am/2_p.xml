 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reitman and Franke (1957)</xref>. Five hundred microliter of reagent 1 (R1) made up of 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 2.0 M α-oxoglutarate and 0.2 M L-alanine were added separately to 0.1 mL of serum and tissues homogenates in different test tubes and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Five hundred microliter of reagent 2 (R2) made up of 0.02 M 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was then added and the resulting solution re-incubated for 20 min at 20 °C. Finally, 5.0 ml of NaOH was added to the reaction mixture and left to stand for 5 min at 25 °C. Absorbance of the resulting solution was then read at 546 nm.
