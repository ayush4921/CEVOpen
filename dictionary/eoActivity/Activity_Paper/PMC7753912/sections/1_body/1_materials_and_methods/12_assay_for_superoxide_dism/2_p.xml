<p id="p0105">SOD activity was measured according to 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Misra and Fridovich (1972)</xref>. An aliquot of a 10 fold dilution each of serum, liver and kidney homogenates was measured into 2.5 mL of 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 10.2) and left to for equilibration in the spectrophotometer. 0.3 mM of freshly prepared adrenaline was added to the mixture agitated by rapid inversion to initiate enzymatic reaction. The blank contained all other components of the assay mixture except the enzyme (serum and tissue homogenates) which was replaced with distilled water. Absorbance of the mixture was monitored at 480 nm was monitored for 150 s at 30 s interval.
