<p id="p0045">Decapitation of animals was done under cold ether anesthesia and rapidly dissected to excise the liver and kidney which were separately trimmed of fat. The tissues were washed in distilled water, and blotted with clean filter paper, weighed and homogenized in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to obtain a 10% homogenate. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged separately at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and kept chilled by refrigeration. Whole blood was obtained by cardiac puncture into an EDTA bottle and left to stand for 1 h at room temperature. Serum was obtained from the whole blood by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 25 °C. The serum was then obtained as supernatant and refrigerated for subsequent estimation of serum biochemical parameters.</p>
