 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reitman and Franke (1957)</xref>. One milliliter of imidazole buffer containing: 2.0 mM nicotinamide adenine diphosphate, 10 mM imidazole pH 6.6, 20 mM glucose, 30 mM creatine phosphate, 20 mM N-acetyl-cysteine, 2.0 mM ethylene diaminetetraacetate, 2.0 mM adenosine diphosphate, 5.0 mM adenosine monophosphate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 μM DAPP, 2.0 ku/L glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 2.15 ku/L hexokinase was pipetted into a thermostatic cuvette and heated to 37 °C. This was followed separate addition of 50 μl each of serum and tissues homogenates and thorough agitation of the resulting mixture. Absorbance at 340 nm was read immediately for 5 min at 30 s interval, followed by the estimation of the change in absorbance per min.
