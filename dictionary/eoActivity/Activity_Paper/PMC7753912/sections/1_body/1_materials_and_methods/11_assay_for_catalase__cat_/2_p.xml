 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Sinha (1972)</xref>. Two hundred microliters each of five fold dilution of serum, kidney and liver homogenates serum was measure into a reaction mixture of 2 mL of (800 μmol) hydrogen peroxide and 2.5 mL of potassium phosphate buffer. Five hundred microliter of appropriate enzyme dilution was rapidly introduced to with the mixture and agitated by gentle swirling in a flat bottom flask at 25 °C. One milliliter aliquot of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and blown into 1 mL dichromate/acetic acid reagent at 60 s intervals. Catalase activity was estimated as the amount of hydrogen peroxide consumed per minute per mg protein (4).
