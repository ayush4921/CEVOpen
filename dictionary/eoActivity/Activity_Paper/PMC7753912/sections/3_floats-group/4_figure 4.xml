   <italic>liver photomicrograph of negative control animals (fed with normal feed and distilled water only):</italic> Histomorphology of the hepatic tissue normal with distinct hepatocytic nuclei well positioned in their cytoplasmic space. There is no observable histopathological alteration in the liver tissues.

   <italic>P. amarus:</italic> Normal liver histoarchitecture was noticed. There are no histopathological alterations in the histological presentation of the hepatic tissues.

   <italic>Silymarin:</italic> The nuclei of hepatocytes are well stained and properly positioned in the cytoplasm. There are no histopathological alterations in the histological presentation of the liver tissues. 
   <italic>E - kidney photomicrograph of animals exposed to distilled water only:</italic> There renal corpuscle was normal, with appropriate cellular delineation, distribution, density and staining intensity. No apparent histopathological alteration was observed. 
   <italic>F - kidney photomicrograph of animals administered with</italic> 250 mg/kg 
   <italic>rifampicin only:</italic> Normal renal histoarchitecture was distorted with glomerular atrophy. Renal tubular degeneration coupled with intraluminal exfoliation and granular cast formation as well as pyknosis of the nuclei were observed.

   <italic>rifampicin and treated with</italic> 100 mg/kg 
   <italic>bw of P. amarus:</italic> Normal renal corpuscle with typical cellular delineation, distribution, density and staining intensity. No apparent histopathological alteration.
