    "<i>Phyllanthus amarus</i> has been exploited for the management of several aliments in folkloric medicine. The present study therefore investigates the restorative potential of its leaves extract on hepatic and renal assault induced by CCl<sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively. Eight groups (I-VIII) containing five animals each were created for the experiments. Group I were fed with normal commercial pellet only, while group II were exposed to single intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml/kg b.w. of CCl<sub>4</sub> only. Groups III, IV and V animals were administered 3 ml/kg b/w of CCl<sub>4</sub> and treated with 50, 100 mg/kg b. w. of <i>P. amarus</i> and 100 mg/kg b.w of silymarin respectively. Group VI animals were orally exposed to 250 mg/kg b/w of rifampicin only while groups VII and VIII were treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg b. w. <i>P. amarus</i> respectively for 14 days after the initial exposure to 250 mg/kg b/w rifampicin <i>.</i> Liver and kidney function tests such as alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, urea and uric acid were determined in the serum and organs homogenates. Moreover, malonidialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) as well as lipid profile were also measured. Results showed that exposure to rifampicin and CCl<sub>4</sub> respectively caused a marked derangement in lipid profile as well as decrease in SOD and CAT activity relative to the negative control. Administration of both toxicants also caused a marked increase in serum ALT, AST, ALP, urea, uric acid and creatine kinase compared to the negative control. Treatment with <i>P. amarus</i> attenuated the toxicity imposed by rifampicin and CCl<sub>4</sub> on the liver and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. All biochemical indices measured were restored to values comparable with animals treated with silymarin. Histopathological results of the hepatic and renal tissues from the various groups of experimental animals gave credence to the curative effects of <i>P. amarus</i> leaf extract on damaged liver and kidney cells. Put together, <i>P. amarus</i> is a potential medicinal plant with similar potency to conventional drugs currently in use for the treatment liver and kidney diseases. Hence, it is a viable therapeutic alternative that can be exploited for the treatment of renal and hepatic diseases."
