<p>High fat-fed rats were used to study DPP-IV inhibitory activity of four medicinal plants (
 <italic>A. latifolia, A. marmelos T. foenum-graecum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica</italic>) 
 <italic>in vivo.</italic> Sitagliptin and vidagliptin were used in comparison as positive controls. Animals were fasted for approximately 6 h prior to experimentation. Blood samples were collected from the cut tip of the tail from conscious rats before and after oral administration of glucose with or without plant extract (250 mg/5 ml/kg) or an established DPP-IV inhibitor (10 μmol/5 ml/kg) at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360 and 480 min. Samples were collected in chilled fluoride/heparin-coated micro centrifuge tubes followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min. Plasma was stored at −20°C for measurement of insulin, DPP-IV activity and active GLP-1 (7-36). An Ascencia Contour glucose meter (Bayer, Newbury, U.K.) was used to measure blood glucose and insulin was determined by dextran-charcoal radioimmunoassay [
