<p>A fluorometric method was used to determine the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of plant extracts based on that described previously [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, a 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer was prepared and adjusted to pH 8.0 using 100 mM Tris-base. Reactions were performed in 96-well black-walled, clear-bottomed microplates (Premier Scientific Ltd, Belfast, U.K.) using 8 mU/ml of DPP-IV enzyme and 200 μM of fluorescent substrate (Gly-Pro-AMC) with or without plant extract, known DPP-IV inhibitor or selected phytochemicals. These included caffeine, catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, isoquercitrin, quercetin and rutin as well as the small molecule anti-diabetic drug nateglinide. DPP-IV assay was based on liberation of AMC (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) from DPP-IV substrate, Gly-Pro-AMC. Changes in fluorescence due to cleavage of the molecule by DPP-IV were measured with an excitation and emission at 370 and 440 nm with 2.5 nm slit width using a FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices, California, U.S.A.). The inhibition of DPP-IV activity was calculated as the percentage of inhibition by each plant extract at various concentrations. Neither the plant extracts nor plasma samples showed any loss of activity when stored for many months at 20°C. It was checked in control experiments that the extracts did not themselves cleave the substrate or interfere with fluorescence measurements at the concentrations employed.
