<p>Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Huntingdon, U.K., approximately 380–400 g) were fed a high-fat diet (45% fat, 20% protein and 35% carbohydrate; 26.15 kJ/g total energy percent; Special Diet Service, Essex, U.K.), 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 5–6 weeks to induce obesity and glucose intolerance. An additional 10 age-matched rats were maintained on standard rodent diet (30% protein, 10% fat, and 60% carbohydrate; 12.99 kJ/g total energy percent; Trouw Nutrition, Cheshire, U.K.). High fat fed rats exhibited increased body weight (398.7 ± 1.6 g versus 384.7 ± 1.8 g; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), impaired oral glucose tolerance and enhanced glucose-induced insulin responses, indicative of insulin resistance compared with the lean control rats fed normal diet (

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), measured by the point-of-care A1CNow+ kit (PTS Diagnostic, Indiana), indicative of mild diabetes. The animals were housed individually in an air-conditioned room at 22 ± 2°C with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and EU Directive 2010/63EU. All necessary steps were taken to prevent any potential animal suffering. The animal studies were approved by local Ulster Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) committee (01/10/2016), as well as being covered under a U.K. Home Office Animal project/personal licence numbers PIL450, PIL1822 and PPL 2804, approved on 06/05/2016. All animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and experiments were conducted in the Biomedical and Behavioral Research Unit (BBRU) at Ulster University, Coleraine, U.K. Blood was collected from the cut tip of the tail of conscious animals without need for anaesthesia. No animals were culled.
