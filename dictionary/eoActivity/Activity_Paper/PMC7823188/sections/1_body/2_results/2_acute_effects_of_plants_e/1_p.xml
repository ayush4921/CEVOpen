<p>Four plants (
 <italic>A. latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica</italic>), the most potent in inhibiting 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> DPP IV enzyme activity, were selected for evaluation of effects on DPP IV activity and oral glucose tolerance in high-fat fed rats. Hot water extracts (250 mg/5 ml/kg) substantially improved the glycemic excursion from 30 to 240 min and increased plasma insulin from 30 to 120 min as compared with oral administration of glucose alone (
