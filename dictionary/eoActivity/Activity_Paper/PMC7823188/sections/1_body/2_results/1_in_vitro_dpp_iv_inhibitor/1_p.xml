<p>The extracts from 22 different plants were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to assess their effects on DPP-IV activity. Established DPP-IV inhibitors namely sitagliptin, vildagliptin and diprotin A were used as positive controls (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A–C). These inhibitors decreased DPP-IV enzyme activity by up to 99 ± 2.0%, 99 ± 3% and 95 ± 3%, with IC

 <italic>A. latifolia</italic> (bark), enzymatic AMC liberation from Gly-Pro-AMC was inhibited by 20 ± 1% to 96 ± 1% (

 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> (leaves), 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> (seeds) and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> (seeds) significantly inhibited DPP-IV enzyme activity at concentrations ranging from 200 to 5000 μg/ml (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05–0.001, respectively, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E–G. The highest inhibitory effects of plant extracts were observed at 5000 μg/ml (44 ± 7%, 38 ± 4%, 31 ± 1% and 28 ± 2%, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) as compared with control. The other plant extracts were found to inhibit DPP-IV activity in between 9 ± 1% and 27 ± 2% (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05–0.001, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) when tested at a concentration of 5000 μg/ml. The phytochemicals responsible for the inhibitory action are unknown but several possible candidates known to be present in the plant collection were tested. These included caffeine, catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, isoquercitrin, quercetin and rutin. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A–G, each inhibited DPP-IV with the majority exhibiting lower effective concentrations of 125–200 μM. Isoquercitrin and quercetin inhibited at 25–50 μM whereas rutin was particularly effective with maximal inhibition of 45% and IC
 <sub>25</sub> value of 306 μM. The effect was similar to the established insulinotropic drug nateglinide (
