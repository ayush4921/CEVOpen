<p>These results suggest that many plants used traditionally to treat diabetes have orally available constituents that inhibit DPP-IV, thereby contributing to their spectrum of actions which in the case of some might be significant [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These observations suggest that these plant extracts exert part of their insulinotropic effects via inhibition of DPP-IV with resultant preservation of active forms of GLP-1 (7-36) and GIP (1-42) released from intestinal enteroendocrine cells by feeding. Overall, our results together with these previous studies indicate that net effects on insulin secreting cells reflect combination of direct actions of glucose and other nutrients compounded by potentiating effects of incretin hormones that are favored by the concurrent inhibition of DPP-IV. Further extensive studies will be required to measure active and total forms of GLP-1 and GIP following administration of the plants studied but the few reports in the literature suggest that some plants with reputed anti-diabetic activity increase circulating GLP-1 [
