<p>Based on these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results, the four most active plants were selected from the 22 initially screened for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of effects on oral glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and plasma DPP-IV activity using high-fat fed rats. This included 
 <italic>A. latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica.</italic> The first two were particularly effective in inhibiting DPP-IV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with up to 44-96% inhibition and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 754-790 μg/ml. This compares with almost total inhibition of DPP-IV by sitagliptin and vildagliptin with IC
 <sub>25</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.04 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 2.43 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> μg/ml and 2.04 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> to 1.70×10
 <sup>−2</sup> μg/ml, respectively. As expected, administration of either sitagliptin or vildagliptin orally to high fat fed obese-diabetic rats, together with glucose, induced a remarkable improvement in glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This was associated with a 70–72% decrease in plasma DPP-IV activity known to result in strong augmentation of the stimulatory insulin-releasing effects of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. Consistent with this, circulating concentrations of active GLP-1 (7-36) were increased by 81–89% at 60 min following administration of these DPP-IV inhibitors. Extracts of 
 <italic>A. latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> also significantly inhibited DPP-IV enzyme activity and increased active GLP-1 (7-36) but by lesser extents of 12–18% and 32–45%, respectively. Interestingly, the glucose lowering actions of the four plant extracts were very similar to the DPP-IV inhibitors despite a smaller plasma insulin response. This indicates that other factors such as a delayed glucose absorption make a major contribution to the acute anti-hyperglycaemic activity of these plants 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further long-term studies are required to determine how their effects compare with other plant-derived substances that exhibit anti-diabetic properties, such as metformin.
