<p>Having adequate bioactive insulin in the circulation is the key to control of glucose homeostasis as the hormone is unique in stimulating tissue glucose uptake and limiting hepatic glucose output. DPP-IV interferes with normal insulin action by degrading and therefore diminishing the insulinotropic and other β-cell actions of GLP-1 and GIP [

Over the years, many studies have revealed the anti-diabetic activity of plants used traditionally for the treatment of diabetes and defined their actions mediated via effects on the gastrointestinal processing of food and both the secretion and action of insulin [
