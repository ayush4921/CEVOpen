<p>Based on the estimated diuretic index, the diuretic potential of the HME and solvent fractions was ranked as ‘‘nil,” ‘‘least,” ‘‘moderate,” and ‘‘good,” if the calculated values were &lt;0.72, 0.72 – 0.99, 1.00 – 1.5, and &gt;1.5, respectively [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Consequently, the HME (at 400 and 200 mg/kg) and EAF at 400 mg/kg showed a ‘‘moderate” diuretic index. The CF at 400 mg/kg has a ‘‘least” diuretic index, while the AF elicited a ‘‘nil” diuretic index. Therefore, this clearly showed that the ingredient(s) presented in the HME and EAF might be considered as the responsible constituent for the observed superior diuretic index.
