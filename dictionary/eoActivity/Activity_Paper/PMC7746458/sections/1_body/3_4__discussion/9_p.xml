<p>The Na

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Accordingly, the HME and EAF showed a satisfactory natriuretic index. However, in the present study, none of the test doses of HME and solvent fractions showed a favorable natriuretic index and K
 <sup>+</sup> sparing activity. These findings are concurred with other previous diuretic plant studies (similar in the family), which have shown satisfactory natriuretic index and no K
 <sup>+</sup> sparing activity [
