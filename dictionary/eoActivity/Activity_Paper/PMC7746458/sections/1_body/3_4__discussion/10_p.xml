<p>The Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup>+K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio in a test substance can predict the modes of the diuretic mechanism of the CAIs effect [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. If the Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup>+K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio is between 0.8 and 1.00, it excludes the CAI effect, but if below 0.8, it is considered to have strong CAI activity [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, excluding the AF and CF, both the HME and EAF showed a strong CAI effect. This indicates that these fractions possibly have a different diuretic mode of action.
