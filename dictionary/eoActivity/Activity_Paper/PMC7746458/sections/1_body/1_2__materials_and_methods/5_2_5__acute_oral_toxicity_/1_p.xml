<p>The study was carried out by a limit test of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guideline No. 425 [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Five none pregnant female mice weighed between 25 g and 30 g and aged 8–12 weeks were used for this study. All mice fasted for food, but not for water, 4 hr before dosing and for 2 hr after administration of the extract. The dose was calculated according to the bodyweight of the fasted mice. Initially, one mouse was treated with a single dose of the extract, 2000 mg/kg. After a day, since the mouse survived, continued to administer a single dose (2000 mg/kg) for 4 mice. After administration of the extract, the mice were carefully observed for short-term toxicity profile up to 24 hr and up to 14 days for the mortality profile.
