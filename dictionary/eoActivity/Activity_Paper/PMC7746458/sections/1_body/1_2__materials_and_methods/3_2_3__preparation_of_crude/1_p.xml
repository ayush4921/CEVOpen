<p>After drying, 1500 g of the coarsely powdered root bark of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> was macerated in 7.5 liters of 80% of methanol for 72 hr with occasional agitation using the orbital shaker. The macerate was separated using a triple-layered muslin cloth followed by Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The marc was resoaked twice to obtain sufficient yield following the same procedure. The combined filtrate was concentrated in the oven dryer at 40°C.
