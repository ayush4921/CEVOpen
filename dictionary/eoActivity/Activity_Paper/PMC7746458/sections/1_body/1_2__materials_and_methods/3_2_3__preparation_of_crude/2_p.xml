<p>Then, 130 g of the hydromethanolic extract (HME) was allowed to suspend in 200 mL of distilled water. A 200 mL of chloroform was added into aqueous suspension and vigorously shaken in a separatory funnel and kept until a clear layer appeared. The bottom layer of the chloroform fraction was separated into a glass beaker. The aqueous residue was reshaken twice with the addition of the same volume of fresh chloroform following a similar protocol. The remaining aqueous residue was then mixed and shaken thrice with 200 mL of ethyl acetate following the above procedure (but the upper layer was ethyl acetate fraction). At the end, all the fractions were concentrated in the oven dryer at 40°C.</p>
