<p>Either sex of Sprague–Dawley rats having a weight range of 200–250 g and age of 12–16 weeks were distributed into fifteen groups randomly (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6/group). The groups were randomly assigned as two normal control groups, one standard group and the rest (group IV up to XV) as 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> treatment groups. Before commencing the experimentation, each rat was placed daily for 3 hr for a total of 3 days in the metabolic cage, for acclimatization [

The hydromethanolic extract and its AF were freshly prepared in distilled water, while the EAF and CF were dissolved in 2% tween 80 on the day of the experiment and administered orally. Accordingly, the first normal control group was treated with distilled water, and the second normal control group was treated with 2% tween 80. The standard group was treated with furosemide 10 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while groups IV–XV were treated with the three different test doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the root bark of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> HME and its solvent fractions.
