<p>The present study revealed that the rats treated with HME and EAF of the root bark of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> showed significantly delayed onset and dose-dependent prolonged diuresis, natriuretic effect, and CAIs effect. Both the medium and highest test doses of the HME showed remarkable diuresis. This could partly explain the traditionally claimed uses of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> as a diuretic agent. The CF produced lesser diuresis, while the AF devoid to show significant diuresis, but both showed the saliuretic effect at larger test dose. The HME and all of the solvent fractions were found to be safe up to 2000â€‰mg/kg. However, further studies are required to isolate, purify, structurally elucidate, and propose the possible mechanisms of diuretic action and to assess the long-term efficacy as well as safety profile.
