<p>The effect of HME on urine output is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. All test doses of HME caused continual urine output until the 24th hr compared to the normal control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Both 200 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 400 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) test doses of HME produced better urine output starting from the 6th hr compared to the normal control group. The HME at 400 mg/kg also showed better diuresis starting from the 6th hr and continued until the 24th hr compared to furosemide (F10 mg/kg) treated rats (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The 200 mg/kg dose also caused an increment of urine output at the last 24th hr compared to F10 mg/kg treated rats (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
