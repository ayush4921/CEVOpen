<p>The AF at 400 mg/kg caused increment of K
 <sup>+</sup> (

 <sup>−</sup> (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 400 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) showed substantial urinary Na
 <sup>+</sup> excretion compared to the normal control group and F10 mg/kg treated rats. The CF at 400 mg/kg caused increment of urinary Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> excretion compared to the normal control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the rats treated with larger test doses of AF, EAF, and CF were also found to have a higher saliuretic index than F10 mg/kg treated rats. In addition, rats treated with AF (at 100 and 200 mg/kg), EAF (at 200 and 400 mg/kg), and CF (at 100 mg/kg) showed higher natriuretic index (&gt;1). The least CAI index was observed at both 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses of EAF and that of F10 mg/kg treated rats.
