<p>The effect of HME and solvent fractions of the root bark of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> on urinary electrolyte excretion is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The HME at 200 mg/kg and F10 mg/kg treated rats has produced the highest urinary K
 <sup>+</sup> excretion (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Besides, the 200 mg/kg of the HME showed an increment of urinary Cl
 <sup>−</sup> excretion compared to the normal control group and F10 mg/kg treated rats (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The least urinary Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> excretion was observed at 400 mg/kg of the HME of the plant. Compared to the test doses of the HME, the 200 mg/kg showed comparable saliuretic index with the F10 mg/kg treated rats. The least saliuretic index and the highest natriuretic index values were observed at 400 mg/kg compared to the F10 mg/kg treated rats. All the test doses of HME have produced &lt;0.8 CAI index.
