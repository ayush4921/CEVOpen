<p>The rats treated with the 100 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of EAF were found to have higher serum Na
 <sup>+</sup> level compared to the normal control. When compared all the test doses of EAF, it was observed that the 200 mg/kg caused higher serum K
 <sup>+</sup> level compared to the 400 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The CF at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg treated rats also showed a substantial serum Na
 <sup>+</sup> level increment compared to the normal control and F10 mg/kg treated rats (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The minimal serum K
 <sup>+</sup> level was observed at both doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg compared to the normal control (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
