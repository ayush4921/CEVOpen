<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic> were collected from Longquan Mountain (coordinates: CHN, 26°11'41.26′'N, 107°49'10.32E''), Danzhai County, Guizhou province, China. The specimen was stored at College of life sciences, Sichuan University (specimen code LLM20001). Total genomic DNA were extracted with a modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) and sequencing was carried out by the Illumina pair-end technology to obtain bout 5.4 Gbp of high-quality reads of 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic> on the Hiseq2000 platform. Firstly, we obtained 10 million high quality pair-end reads using Trimmomatic v0.35 (Bolger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and custom Perl script for 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic>. With the chloroplast genome of all published Lauraceae chloroplast genomes as the reference sequences, we assembled the complete chloroplast genome from the clean reads by the GetOrganelle pipe-line (Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Secondly, we annotated the plastid genomes using PGA (Qu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and corrected the annotation with Geneious v11.1.5.0 (Kearse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Sequin v13.70 (

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Finally, a complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic> was obtained and submitted to Genbank (accession number MT472628).
