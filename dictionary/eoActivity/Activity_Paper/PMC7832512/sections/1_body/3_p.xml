<p>To further investigate its phylogenetic position, Cupressus gigantea was used as the outgroup, the phylogenetic analysis of 36 plastid genomes from published species of Lauraceae were analyzed using MEGA7.0 (with 1,000 bootstrap replicates) (Kumar etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The result indicated that 
 <italic>L. molis</italic> is more closely related to species of 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> genus than other genera in Lauraceae (
