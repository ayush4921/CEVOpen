 <italic>Litsea mollis</italic> Hemsl., a traditional edible spice and medicinal plant with a long history in China, is a deciduous shrubs or small trees in the 
 <italic>Litsea</italic> genus of Lauraceae. The seeds contain ca. 25% oil and are used as a main ingredient in soaps. The fruit is processed for its aromatic oil (3%–5%) (Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Ingredients from volatile oil of 
 <italic>L. molis</italic> can produce natural pesticides, grain and clothing anthelmintic storage agents and natural preservatives. Volatile oil in both fruit and leaf have obvious antibacterial and antifungal activity. In terms of medicinal value, the roots and fruit are used medicinally (Lin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Cai et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A variety of biological activities in 
 <italic>L. molis</italic> have beneficial effective on human health, such as roots and fruits can cure gas pain, strain injury, diarrhea, analgesia, schistosomiasis, allergy and disease of cardiovascular system (coronary heart disease, angina pectoris) and so on (Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, there are very few studies on the 
 <italic>L. molis</italic>, which greatly limit the development and utilization of 
 <italic>L. molis</italic>. Therefore, we assembled and analyzed the complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. molis</italic> for the first time, which can provide insight and evidence for its genetic background and evolution.
