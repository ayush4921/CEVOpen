<p>To assess trypanocidal activity as described by [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a fixed concentration of 25 µg/mL of crude extracts was mixed with cultures of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> in a 96-well plate, and the mixtures were incubated for 48 h. After incubation, the parasites that survived the treatment with the tested samples were enumerated by the addition of a resazurin-based reagent. Cells were considered viable when they were capable of reducing resazurin to resorufin (a fluorophore with Exc
 <sub>560</sub>/Em
 <sub>590</sub>). Results were expressed as percentage parasite viability of the resorufin fluorescence in compound-treated wells relative to untreated controls (pentamidine), determined by a Spectramax M3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Compounds were tested in duplicate, and standard deviations (SD) were evaluated. Extracts that reduced parasite viability to &lt;20% were considered for further testing (dose–response cytotoxicity assays). Pentamidine is a common drug used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis.
