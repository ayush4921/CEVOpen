<p>For each sample concentration, pLDH activity in sample-treated wells relative to untreated controls was estimated as percentage parasite viability. Samples were examined in duplicate, and standard deviations (SD) were calculated. Also, the standard anti-malarial drug chloroquine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range = 0.01–0.05 µM) was used for comparative purposes. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of crude extracts capable of causing 50 % inhibition of the parasite’s growth.
