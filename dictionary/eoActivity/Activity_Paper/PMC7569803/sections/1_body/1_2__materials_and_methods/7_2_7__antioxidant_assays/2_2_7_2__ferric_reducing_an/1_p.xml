<p>This was assessed following [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with some modifications. The FRAP reagent was constituted from a solution of 2.5 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer prepared from a mixture of 62.5% monobasic dihydrogen phosphate and 37.5% dibasic monohydrogen phosphate (pH 6.6) with 2.5 mL of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> (potassium hexacyanoferrate). The freshly prepared FRAP reagent was added to serially graded concentrations of aqueous extract and standard drugs in a series of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mg/mL. The resulting mixture was incubated for 20 min in a water bath set at 50 Â°C. Thereafter, 2.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (

The reducing capacity of the crude extracts was measured at an absorbance of 700 nm against the methanol blank, and ferric content was estimated from the standard linear graph as mg Fe (II) equivalent per gram (g) of crude extracts.
