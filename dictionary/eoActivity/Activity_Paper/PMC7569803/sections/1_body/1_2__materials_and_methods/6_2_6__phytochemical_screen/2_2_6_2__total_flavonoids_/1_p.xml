<p>The total flavonoid component was measured following the aluminum chloride spectrophotometric assay described by [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with slight modifications. The assay is based on the estimation of the yellow-orange color resulting from the reaction between AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> and flavonoids. The aqueous extract and standard (quercetin) stocks were prepared in methanol at a ratio of 1:1. The standard solution was graded in a series of 0.2–1 mg/mL of quercetin in methanol. Thereafter, plant extract (0.5 mL) and graded standard solution (0.5 mL) were pipetted into separate test tubes. Later, distilled water (2 mL) was added, followed by 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.15 mL). The mixture was vortexed and left for 6 min. After 5 min, the mixture was supplemented with 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.15 mL), followed by 1 M NaOH (1 mL). The solution was brought to 5 mL with distilled water, and the resulting mixture was incubated in a water bath set at 40 °C for 20 min. The solution’s absorbance was measured at 430 nm, and total flavonoid content was evaluated as mg of quercetin equivalent per gram of the extract (QE/g), evaluated from the standard curve y = 1.1829x + 0.0399 (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9929) by the equation
