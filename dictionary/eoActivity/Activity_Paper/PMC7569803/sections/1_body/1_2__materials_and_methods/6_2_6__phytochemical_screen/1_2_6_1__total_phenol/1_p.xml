<p>The total phenolic content of the aqueous extract was evaluated using the Folin–Ciocalteu’s technique described in [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with minor modifications. Gallic acid (standard) was prepared in methanol at an initial concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. This was later diluted and graded in a series of 1.0–0.2 mg/mL, prepared in separate test tubes. The crude extract was also prepared in methanol at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. To every 0.5 mL of graded concentration of standard solutions (0.2–1.0 mg/mL), 2.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu solution was added and, subsequently, 2 mL of anhydrous Na

The mixture was vortexed and incubated in a water bath set at 40 °C for 30 min; after incubation, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 765 nm using a UV-3000 PC spectrophotometer. The total phenolic component was estimated as milligram of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of crude extract extrapolated from the standard equation y = 0.1197x − 0.0008 (R
