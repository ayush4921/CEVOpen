<p>The polarity of solvents used for the extraction plays a crucial role in the biological activity of plants [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The solvents used for the extraction (water and ethanol) in this study are polar. Polar solvents are amphiprotic and can break covalent bonds by the acidâ€“base reaction. This can facilitate the dissolution of the polar component of plant phytochemicals, such as amines, phenols, polysaccharides, ketones, and other compounds with oxygen, capable of forming hydrogen bonds [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Only water was used for phytochemical screening in this study, as extracts derived from the two solvents had no significant difference in cytotoxicity, trypanocidal, and antimalarial assays.
