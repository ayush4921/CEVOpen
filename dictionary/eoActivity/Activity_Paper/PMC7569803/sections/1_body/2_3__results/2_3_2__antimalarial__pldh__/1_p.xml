<p>The pLDH activity measured in compound-treated samples was expressed as % viability of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7 in a mixture of plant extracts and parasite culture relative to untreated controls. The result showed that at a fixed concentration of crude extracts (25 µg/mL), the pLDH activity showed no significant reduction by at least 50%, as the viability of the parasite ranged between 65.86 ± 0.39% and 63.80 ± 2.90 % in aqueous and ethanolic extracts, respectively. Although the tested samples showed activity, a rise in the concentration of the crude extracts might push pLDH activity below 50% (
