<p>The acute toxicity of the compounds (
 <bold>I–VIII</bold>) and pemetrexed on the embryonic/larval stages of zebrafish was assessed for a period of 5 days after fertilisation. Every 24 h, the mortality, hatchability and developmental malformations among individuals derived from both control and treated groups were observed using a stereomicroscope (Zeiss, SteREO Discovery.V8, Göttingen, Germany). The half maximal lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the maximal non-lethal concentration (MNLC) values of each compound as well as a standard drug were calculated based on the mortality at the end of a five-day exposure of the developing zebrafish to different concentrations of compounds/pemetrexed in three independent experiments with similar experimental conditions. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> value (calculated by the probit method
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>30</sup>
 </xref>) means the lowest concentration of compound/pemetrexed that causes death of half (50%) of zebrafish embryos/larvae during the duration of the experiment. The MNLC value represents the maximal concentration of compound/pemetrexed that does not result in a statistically different mortality of zebrafish embryos/larvae compared to the control group.
