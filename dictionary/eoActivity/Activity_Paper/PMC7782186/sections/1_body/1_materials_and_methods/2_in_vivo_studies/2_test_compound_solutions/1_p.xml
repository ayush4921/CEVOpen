<p>To prepare each test solution, each pure compound in its solid state (
 <bold>I–VIII</bold>) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; POCH SA, Gliwice, Poland) and then diluted with the E3 medium (i.e. a purified water containing 5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.33 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>·6 H
 <sub>2</sub>O and adjusted to pH 7.2) to obtain the appropriate concentration in the range of 1–100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Concentrations 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> were selected on the basis of the initial screenings. DMSO – used as a solvent – had no embryotoxic effects on zebrafish at all the tested concentrations. Hence, there was no need to include a DMSO control group. In this experiment, an anticancer agent – pemetrexed (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at the same concentrations as test compounds served as a positive control, whereas the E3 medium – as a negative control. All the solutions were always freshly prepared just prior to the experiment.
