<p>There are no scientific reports on the influence of the title fluorinated compounds on the embryonic and larval development of zebrafish. Only 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been recently performed and their promising results have been published by our research group

 </xref>. Therefore, the main scientific objective of the present study was evaluating the effects of promising trifluoromethylated compounds (
 <bold>I–VIII</bold>) on the early-life stages of zebrafish and selecting the safest compounds for further research. To accomplish this – for the first time – the mortality, hatching rate and developmental abnormalities among embryos and larvae from the compounds-treated groups were assessed, while the half maximal lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the maximal non-lethal concentration (MNLC) values for each test molecule were determined. Simultaneously, the influence of the title compounds on the embryonic and larval development of zebrafish was compared with the effect (in the same animal model system) of pemetrexed – a clinically used anticancer agent. Due to the fact that the investigated trifluoromethylated molecules differ in substituents at 
 <italic>N</italic>8, the relationships between structure of the compounds and their toxicity for 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic> were determined. These explorations were undertaken in order to reveal the most favourable substitution patterns in test molecules, which would be safe for the normal development of zebrafish embryos/larvae. Moreover, the correlations between lipophilicity and toxicity of the compounds were established. The results of these pioneering studies on the title compounds, assessing for the first time their safety profile for vertebrates, are of the particular importance, novelty and originality. A toxicological characterisation of the compounds in this vertebrate model will be helpful in selecting the safest trifluoromethylated molecules for testing in mammals.
