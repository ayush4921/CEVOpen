<p>It was proven that the investigated molecules inhibit the activation of caspase-6 and -8 in normal Vero cells relative to the control. In turn, an activation of caspase-8 after incubation with test compounds was significantly enhanced in all the recruited cancerous cells (A549, HeLa and T47D), and a remarkable increase in caspase-6 level was observed in tumour cells of the lung (A549) and cervix (HeLa). The highest differences were observed for the trifluoromethylated molecule substituted by an

These results indicate that the cytotoxic effects of test compounds may be attributed to the activation of caspases being the inducers of both initiation and executive phases of apoptosis. Moreover, a reduced level of caspase-5 was noticed in tumour A549 and HeLa cells after incubation with compounds 
 <bold>II</bold> and 
 <bold>V</bold>.
