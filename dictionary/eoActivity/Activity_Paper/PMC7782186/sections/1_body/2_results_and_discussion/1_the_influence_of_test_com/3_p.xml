<p>It was found that the trifluoromethylated fused triazinones 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> at concentrations up to 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> (i.e. 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <bold>III</bold> and 
 <bold>VII</bold> – at concentrations up to 5 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> (i.e. 1, 2.5 and 5 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) did not exhibit any significant mortality in zebrafish embryos and larvae at the end of five days of exposure to the compounds, as the mortality rates in these groups do not differ significantly from that in the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Whereas, at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> the mortality rates were elevated and were found be the highest for the compounds 
 <bold>III</bold>, 
 <bold>VII</bold> and 
 <bold>VIII</bold> as well as pemetrexed. In turn, the highest concentration (100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) of compounds/pemetrexed resulted in 100% mortality of zebrafish embryos and larvae during the experiment. Based on this, we calculated the lowest concentration that caused death of half of zebrafish embryos/larvae (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each test molecule as well as a standard anticancer drug (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the vast majority of investigated compounds (i.e. 
 <bold>I–VI</bold>) are higher than the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of pemetrexed, indicating that these trifluoromethylated molecules are safer for zebrafish embryos/larvae than this anticancer agent.
