<p>Isolated chemical compounds such as cryptolepine and methyl gallate from 
 <italic>C. sanguinolenta</italic> and 
 <italic>Searsia chirindensis</italic>, respectively, have a strong antimicrobial activity. Given that 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. are rapidly gaining resistance to drugs currently in use, these compounds will need to be tested in further pharmacological studies in order to better understand the mechanisms of action and to test 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This testing may lead to the development of new and more efficient antibiotics to treat campylobacteriosis. Nevertheless, search on medicinal plants should be thorough in Sub-Saharan African region.
