 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. are a group of zoonotic bacteria among the leading causes of human bacterial gastroenteritis. They account for 5% to 14% of all diarrheal diseases in the world [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In humans, 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> and less often 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> cause watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. Enteritis caused by these bacteria is sporadic and self-limiting. However, complications such as bacteremia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, lung infections, brain abscesses, meningitis, and reactive arthritis may occur, and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk [
