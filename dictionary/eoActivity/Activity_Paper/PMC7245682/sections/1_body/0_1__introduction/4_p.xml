<p>Antibiotics may be considered for treatment of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. infections in severe cases [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The commonly used drugs to treat campylobacteriosis in humans are erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, or tetracycline [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although this antimicrobial treatment is generally not necessary, misuse of antibiotics is common in Sub-Saharan Africa and this is leading to increasing antibiotic resistance [
