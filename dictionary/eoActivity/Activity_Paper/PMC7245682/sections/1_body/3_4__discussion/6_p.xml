<p>In the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, cryptolepine activity was higher than that of prescribed antibiotics as co-trimoxazole and sulfamethoxazole. Moreover, 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. susceptibility to cryptolepine was equal to ampicillin [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is an interesting and important finding that proves that this compound has greater activity and is similar to antibiotics used in clinical practice. Thus, it has great potential as a precursor to a new effective drug. Cryptolepine has also antibacterial activity against other bacteria such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, probably because it causes morphological changes, cellular breakdown, and DNA intercalating and inhibits topoisomerase II [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Probably this mechanism of action is similar to what happens in 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp.
