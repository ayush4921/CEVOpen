<p>For the first time in 2005, the active compound present in the highest concentration in the leaves of 
 <italic>C. woodii</italic> was isolated, so called Combretastatin B5 (2′,3′,4-trihydroxy-3,5,4′-trimethoxybibenzyl). This compound was very effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC of 16, 125, and 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively), with the exception of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (&gt;250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). It is a stilbene, a bibenzylic compound with a potent antibacterial activity, which was greater or similar to that of ampicillin and chloramphenicol against the bacteria tested, except for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For 
 <italic>T. macroptera</italic>, the active compound of this plant has not been tested against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. However, this compound is presumed to have even greater antimicrobial activity than the extract, and this may explain the traditional use of 
 <italic>Combretum</italic> species in the treatment of diarrhea caused by 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp.
