<p>A high number of plants (41/47) were tested by the MIC alone or in addition to the inhibition zone through the disk diffusion method. The disk diffusion method does not provide sufficient detail about the concentration of the extract that inhibits bacterial growth. Moreover, many factors can influence the results in such method, such as concentration of the compound in the test solution; volume of the test solution; density of the inoculum; duration and temperature of the diffusion phase before incubation; and thickness and composition of the medium, as well as incubation temperature [
