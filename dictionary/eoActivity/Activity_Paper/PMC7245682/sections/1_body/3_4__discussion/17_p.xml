 <italic>Searsia chirindensis</italic> was one of the plants in which active principles were isolated and tested in South Africa. This plant is used in the South African traditional medicine to treat many diseases, one of which is diarrhea. From the five tested compounds isolated from the leaves of the plant, methyl gallate, a phenolic compound, presented the highest antimicrobial activity with a MIC of 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Methyl gallate was the second compound in addition to cryptolepine, with greater antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. in Sub-Saharan Africa. The other four tested compounds were flavonol glycosides that also exhibited a good antimicrobial activity ranging between 130 and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. This provides credence to the ethnomedicinal use of 
 <italic>S. chirindensis</italic> to treat diarrhea, as well as describing chemical substances that may be precursors of new drugs.
