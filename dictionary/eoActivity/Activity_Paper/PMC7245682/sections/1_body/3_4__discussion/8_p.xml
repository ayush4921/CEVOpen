<p>The activity of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. macroptera</italic> root against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. was similar to the antibiotic co-trimoxazole and higher than sulfamethoxazole, although smaller than other clinically used antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data are also very important and demonstrate the great antibiotic potential of this plant. The investigators have identified that a class of polyphenols called ellagitannins are the major compounds in the extract and active fractions [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, the plant was found to have flavonoids, triterpenoids, and other phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Unlike 
 <italic>C. sanguinolenta</italic>, the active compounds of this plant have not been analyzed for antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. However, the available study validates its use in the treatment of diarrhea caused by 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp.
