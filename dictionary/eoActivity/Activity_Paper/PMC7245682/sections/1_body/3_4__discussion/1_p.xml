<p>This study had the aim of identifying the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of medicinal plants from Sub-Saharan Africa against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. We found out that several plants were analyzed for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity. These results show that attention has been paid to the search for new plant-based antibiotic alternatives in the region, although no 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were performed to date.
