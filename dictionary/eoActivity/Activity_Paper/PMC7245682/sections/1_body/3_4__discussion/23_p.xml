<p>Despite the isolation of pure chemical products or compounds from medicinal plants with high antibacterial activity, the other main challenge now is also to elucidate the biological mechanisms of the isolated compounds and to perform pharmacological studies. These studies would include the following: 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity, rate of resistance, bioavailability, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic studies, stability of the compounds in formulation, spectrum of antibacterial activity, treatment duration, and route of administration. In the absence of serious liabilities, the candidate drug might be declared for entry into a preclinical development program [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and clinical trials could be further conducted according to the approved standards [
