<p>Another plant with a low MIC (62.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of the methanol and aqueous extracts was 
 <italic>Albertisia villosa</italic> (Menispermaceae). This plant is native to DRC, where root decoction is ingested to treat diarrhea and dysentery. Therefore, the traditional use of the plant against 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> was validated. This plant is also promising in the discovery of new antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A preliminary phytochemical testing detected alkaloids and saponins in the root of the plant [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Years later, bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids were isolated from the root bark, namely, cycleanine, cocsoline, and N-desmethylcycleanine. Cycleanine was the most abundant (85%) of all identified alkaloids. Through agar well diffusion, this compound was very effective against bacteria such as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and human pathogenic fungi such as 
 <italic>Trichophyton longiformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> [
