  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. are zoonotic bacteria that cause gastroenteritis in humans and may cause extraintestinal infections such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis, and bacteremia. Resistance to antibiotics is an increasing concern in the Sub-Saharan Africa; thus, search for alternatives such as plant-based active ingredients is important in order to develop new drugs.

  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p> To present a systematic review of 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the antibacterial activity of medicinal plants from Sub-Saharan Africa against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. 
   <italic>Methodology</italic>. Studies published until March 2020 on medicinal plants used against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. from each country of Sub-Saharan Africa were searched on PubMed, Science Direct, AJOL, and Google Scholar. Articles were selected based on the existence of information regarding 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of medicinal plants against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> A total of 47 medicinal plants belonging to 28 families were studied for 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. No plant was studied 
   <italic>in vivo.</italic> Plants from Fabaceae family were the most commonly studied. The plants with the strongest antimicrobial activities were 
   <italic>Cryptolepis sanguinolenta</italic> and 
   <italic>Terminalia macroptera</italic>. The root extracts from these plants were effective, and both had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Seven pure compounds were isolated and analyzed for activity against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. The compound cryptolepine from 
   <italic>C. sanguinolenta</italic> was the most effective with MIC values ranging between 6.25 and 25 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> Several native plants from the Sub-Saharan Africa region were studied for 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. Some plants seemed very effective against the bacteria. Chemical compounds from three plants have been isolated and analyzed, but further studies are needed in order to produce new and effective drugs.
