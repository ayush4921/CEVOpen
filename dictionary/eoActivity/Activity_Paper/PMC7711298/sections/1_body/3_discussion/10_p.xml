<p>The anti-inflammatory effects of the methanol extract and partitioned fractions of the stembark of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>on egg albumin-induced oedema in mice hind paw are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. These results indicate that the methanol extract as well as the hexane and DCM fractions demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory potential which were comparable to the standard, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). Specifically, the high dose (930 mg/kg) of the methanol extract demonstrated the same level of potency like the standard drug after one hour of pretreatment and showed a similar trend throughout the period of study.
