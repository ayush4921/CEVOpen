<p>The acute toxicity test indicated that the administration of the crude methanol stembark extract at a dose of 4000 mg/kg resulted in 100% mortality of the mice in the various groups tested, while no mortality was observed in the group administered with 2,000, 2,500 and 2,750 mg/kg of the sample. The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the stembark extract of 
 <italic>L. sericeus</italic> was calculated as 3,100 mg/kg and the various doses of the extracts used for the study were calculated as 310, 620 and 930 mg/kg of the lethal dose which represented the low, median and high doses of the extracts.
