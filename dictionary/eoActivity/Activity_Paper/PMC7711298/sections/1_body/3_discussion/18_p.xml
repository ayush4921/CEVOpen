<p>The effect of methanol stembark extract and partitioned fractions of
 <italic> L. sericeus </italic>on thermally-induced pain in mice, is presented in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The extracts showed a dose-dependent analgesia against thermally-induced pain in mice. The fractions showed improved analgesic activity but not as potent as ASA. The inflammatory pain produced by acetic acid acts by causing capillary permeability and thermally induced pain is indicative of the extracts, fractions and isolated compounds behaving like narcotics. Thus, the ability of reducing pain may be related to their intrinsic anti-inflammatory and narcotic effects (Nwafor and Okwuasaba, 2003
