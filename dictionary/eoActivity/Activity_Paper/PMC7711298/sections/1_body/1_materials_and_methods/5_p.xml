<p>The methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>stembark (100 g) was dispersed in 300 ml of distilled water and partitioned into hexane and dichloromethane using a separating funnel. All fractions were subsequently concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (WG-EV311-V, Wilmad-LabGlass, USA) at 40°C until they became completely dry. The hexane fraction (17.0 g) and Dichloromethane fraction (20.0 g) were kept in a sealed container and preserved in a refrigerator maintained at 4°C until analysis.
