<p>The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the plant extract administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), was assessed in albino mice by using the method of Lorke (1983)
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> â–¶</xref>. Twenty-one albino mice were selected and divided into groups of three mice per group. Prior to the experiment, animals underwent 24 hr starvation but they had access to water. The extracts were administered in a dose range of 500-3,500mg/kg body weight of animals. The animals were observed for physical signs of toxicity such as writhing, decreased motor activity, decreased body/limb tone, decreased respiration, and death. The number of deaths in each group within 24 hr, was recorded. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated as the geometrical means of the maximum dose producing 0% mortality (D
 <sub>0%</sub>) and the minimum dose producing 100% (D
 <sub>100%</sub>) mortality. That is,
