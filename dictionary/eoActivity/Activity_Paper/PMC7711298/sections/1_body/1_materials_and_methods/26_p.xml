<p>Writhing (abdominal constrictions consisting of the contraction of abdominal muscles together with the stretching of hind limbs), resulting from i.p. injection of 3% acetic acid, was induced according to the procedure earlier described by Santos et al. (1994)

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>. The animals were divided into five groups of five mice per group. Group 1 served as negative control and received 10 ml/kg of normal saline, while groups 2, 3 and 4 were pre-treated with 310, 620 and 930 mg/kg doses of 
 <italic>L. sericeus</italic> i.p., and group 5 received 100 mg/kg of acetyl salicylic acid. After 30 min, 0.2 ml of 2% acetic acid was administered i.p.. The number of writhing movements was counted for 30 min. Antinociception (analgesia) was expressed as the reduction of the number of abdominal constrictions in control animals and mice pretreated with extracts.
