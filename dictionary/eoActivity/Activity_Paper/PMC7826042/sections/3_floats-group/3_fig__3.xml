   <bold>SARS-CoV-2 structural and genomic organization.</bold> S, M, and E proteins are located in the viral envelope but the N protein interacts with the viral RNA and is present in the core of the viral particle, forming the nucleocapsid. S protein exists as two subunits (S1 and S2) on the viral particle due to cleavage of S protein by host furin‐like proteases during viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 genome has the following genes from 5’ to 3’: replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1ab; S; envelope (E); membrane (M); and N. The figure was made with the help of Biorender.com.
