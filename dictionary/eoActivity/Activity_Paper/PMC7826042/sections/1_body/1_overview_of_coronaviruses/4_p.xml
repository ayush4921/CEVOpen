<p id="par0060">The SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the coronaviridae family and can infect humans and several other animal species (
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus and mostly similar to bat coronavirus, with 96.2 % sequence homology (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020a</xref>). The appearance of symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs slowly over an incubation period of around 2 weeks. During this incubation period, the virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract, forming lesions (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020b</xref>). The common symptoms reported in the infected individuals are loss of taste, fever, cough, dyspnea and lesion in the lungs (
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The key proteases of the SARS-CoV namely 3C- like Protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and the Papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) are potential targets for the development of inhibitors against SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib0525" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Yap, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Anand et al., 2005</xref>). The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> are the key enzymes involved in the processing of the non-structural proteins of the virus (
 <bold>nsp</bold>s) required for the viral replication (

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Cascella et al., 2020</xref>). The surface of SARS-CoV is coated with the S proteins, which possess the potential to attach to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2). ACE2 receptors are expressed in the lungs, kidney, endothelium, heart, and intestine (
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). An alternative way to block the activity of the SARS-CoV is to target its S protein or blocking the human ACE2 from binding to the S protein.
