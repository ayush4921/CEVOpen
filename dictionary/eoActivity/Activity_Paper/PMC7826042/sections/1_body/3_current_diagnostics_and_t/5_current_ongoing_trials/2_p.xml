<p id="par0140">Different research institutes and companies worldwide have been working on clinical trials to repurpose existing drugs as well as to develop vaccines and drugs to combat the fast spreading and fatal SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">Rudra et al., 2017</xref>). For repurposing the existing drugs, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are being undertaken by various biotechnological companies and research organizations such as National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA to identify disease specific drugs. Clinical trials are underway for major drugs that have the potential to treat COVID-19. Research on traditional medicine is also being undertaken to utilize them in the treatment of COVID-19. Plants provide a natural source of anti-viral inhibitors that can be extended for treatment of diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2. Hence, by repurposing the compounds and extracts from medicinal plants, more innovative and effective drug options can be unveiled for eliminating this viral transmission.
