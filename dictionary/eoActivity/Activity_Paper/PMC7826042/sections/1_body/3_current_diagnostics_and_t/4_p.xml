<p id="par0135">The strategies used to halt the propagation of RNA viruses in host cells or tissues include inhibition of RNA transcription, RNA modification, virus packaging enzymes, and the capsid or surface proteins assisting the viral diffusion into the host cells (

Although vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 has been initiated, they are not available yet at the global level. Therefore, researchers are exploring the pool of natural and chemicals compounds that could inhibit the major proteases of the virus or downregulate the rate of propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cells.
