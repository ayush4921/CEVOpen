<p id="par0030">The Coronaviridae family comprises of enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that are generally causative agents of common cold, upper respiratory disorders and lower respiratory infections, especially in elderly persons and children, who have weak immune system. Currently, there is an outbreak caused by a novel subtype of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), which has resulted in a pandemic with millions of infections and deaths worldwide in humans. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health concern since December 2019 till date. In this context, it is extremely important to understand the mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogenesis to develop specific and effective drugs. Currently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shows sequence homology with the SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus (

Despite its similarity to SARS-CoV, its transmission efficiency and diagnostic methods are very different, and SARS-CoV-2 is much more virulent compared to SARS-CoV-1. This could possibly be due to the nucleotide changes in the spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (
