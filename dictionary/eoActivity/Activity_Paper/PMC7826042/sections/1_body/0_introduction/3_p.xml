<p id="par0025">Viruses survive and replicate in the host by hijacking the metabolic pathways of the host cells. Therefore, it is difficult to design an appropriate drug to attack the virus without triggering any adverse effects on the host. Consequently, the unique features of viruses (specificity, affinity, and self‚Äêdefense mechanisms), and the limitations of antiviral chemotherapy necessitate the dire need to develop new antiviral agents, which possess efficient selectivity, strength,
