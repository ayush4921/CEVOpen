<p id="par0245">SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the anti-viral phytocompounds identified from 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> studies also showed good drug-likeliness properties. Thus, the phytocompounds identified from 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> studies can be validated by 
 <italic>in vitro, in vivo</italic> and clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2. To assure public safety and control of infection in the event of a re-emergence of COVID-19, effective anti-SARS-CoV agents and treatments are highly desirable and imminent in the immediate and near future. The findings of this review will provide a reservoir of natural compounds for researchers world-wide focusing on drug discovery for COVID-19. The literature on anti-viral potential of phytocompounds will also pave way for experimental affirmation of several traditional and natural medicine in use for centuries in several sections of the world.
