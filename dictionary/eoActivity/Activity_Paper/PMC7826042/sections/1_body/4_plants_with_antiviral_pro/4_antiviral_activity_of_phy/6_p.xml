 <xref rid="bib0465" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al. (2007)</xref> screened 221 phytocompounds isolated from 
 <italic>Chamaecyparis obtuse, Juniperus formosana</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic> against SARS-CoV and found that certain abietane type di-terpenoids and lignoids have best anti-viral effects. Similarly, bioactive compounds isolated from six herbal extracts namely, 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra</italic> (dried rhizome), 
 <italic>Dioscorea batatas</italic> (tuber), 
 <italic>Cassia tora</italic> (dried seed), 
 <italic>Taxillus chinensis</italic> (leaf), and 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic> (dried rhizome) exhibited anti-SARS-CoV activity in a cell-based assay on infected Vero E6 cells at concentrations between 25 and 200 Î¼g/mL (
 <xref rid="bib0470" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2011</xref>). Several independent studies have shown that the compounds such as curcumin, caffeic acid, chalcones, cinnamic acid and betulinic acid isolated from different medicinal plants are potent inhibitors of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease of SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al. (2019)</xref> showed that flavonoids of 
 <italic>Litchi chinensis</italic> and herbacetin isolated and 
 <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> showed inhibition of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in MERS-CoV.
