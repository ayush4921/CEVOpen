 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">Sampangi-Ramaiah et al. (2020)</xref> explored the 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> binding of 27 phytocompounds (present in spices and condiments used in Indian and other cuisines) to SARS-CoV-2 6LU7 protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and 6Y2E protease, both of which are required for viral replication. Out of the 27 compounds, 15 showed binding affinity above threshold values for both the proteases. The key compounds with high binding affinity to 6LU7 and 6Y2E proteases include coriandrin (component of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> widely in Indian cuisines across both north and south India), ursolic acid of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, rosmarinic acid of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> and glucobrassicin of
