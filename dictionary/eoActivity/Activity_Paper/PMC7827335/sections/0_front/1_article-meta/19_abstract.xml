 <p>The genus 
  <italic>Parkia</italic> (Fabaceae, Subfamily, Mimosoideae) comprises about 34 species of mostly evergreen trees widely distributed across neotropics, Asia, and Africa. This review aims to provide an overview of the current status of the species from the genus 
  <italic>Parkia</italic> in terms of its relationship between its phytochemistry and medical uses. Comprehensive information on 
  <italic>Parkia</italic> species was retrieved from electronic databases, which were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review identified nine species from genus 
  <italic>Parkia</italic> with properties of medicinal use. They are used traditionally to treat several ailments, such as diabetes, diarrhea, wounds, hypertension, cough, chronic piles, conjunctivitis, and measles. The most common species studied are 
  <italic>P. biglobosa</italic>, 
  <italic>P. speciosa</italic>, 
  <italic>P. javanica</italic>, 
  <italic>P. bicolor</italic>, 
  <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic>, 
  <italic>P. filicoidea</italic>, and 
  <italic>P. clappertoniana</italic>. A considerable number of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids (aglycone and glycosides), and numerous volatile compounds have been identified in this genus, which are responsible for their diverse pharmacological activities. Their extracts, pure compounds and seed lectins have been reported for their anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antiulcer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, and antidiarrheal activities. The information gathered in this review might be of help for future studies in terms of the current knowledge on the link between the phytochemical components and medicinal uses. This could facilitate more discoveries on its potentials particularly in the pharmacological characteristics and potential to be developed into modern medicines.
