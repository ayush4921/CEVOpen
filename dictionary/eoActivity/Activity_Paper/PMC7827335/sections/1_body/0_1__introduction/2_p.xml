<p>From our extensive research regarding the biological, pharmacological, and phytochemical constituents of species from the genus 
 <italic>Parkia</italic>, only 12 species have been scientifically investigated so far. Out of these, nine were studied on phytochemical analysis and determination of biological activities, which include 
 <italic>P. bicolor</italic>, 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. filicoidea</italic>, 
 <italic>P. clappertoniana</italic>, 
 <italic>P. javanica</italic> (synonyms: 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic>, 
 <italic>P. timoriana</italic>), 
 <italic>P. pendula</italic>, 
 <italic>P. platycephala</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic>. The most frequently investigated over a wide range of ailments are 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic>. Studies on the remaining three species (
 <italic>P. velutina</italic>, 
 <italic>P. nitida</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. polyads</italic>) focused on morphological variations and environmental distribution. This review aims to collate the present state of medicinal uses and phytochemistry of the genus 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> for future studies. The link between the phytochemical components and medicinal uses of the current knowledge is discussed with the hope it would expedite more discoveries that have potentials to be developed into modern medicines.
