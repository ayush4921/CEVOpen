<p>In addition to polyphenolic and terpenoids, several other compounds that are mainly volatile including aldehydes, esters, pyrazines, ketones, fatty acids, benzenes, alcohols, amines, sulfides, alkanes, and alkenes have been reported from 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> species (
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00618-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These compounds are identified mainly from the seeds. Compound 
 <bold>81</bold> is identified from the natural product for the first time in pentane/dichloromethane fraction of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seed using GC/ToF-MS [
 <xref rid="B125-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. A greater number of these compounds is identified through phytochemical quantification using different spectroscopic methods. Seven constituents are detected from the fresh seeds of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> through GC/ToF/MS and the compounds are dominated by linear polysulfide, alcohol, and 3′-thiobis-didodecyl ester. Other major compounds include palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, linoleic acid chloride, and myristic acid [
 <xref rid="B124-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. However, cyclic polysulfides are the major constituents found in cooked 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00618-f005">Figure 5</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B125-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. In addition, some minor components, such as 
 <bold>82</bold>–
 <bold>84</bold> are also identified. Meanwhile, 
 <bold>132</bold> content in 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seed was reported to be 4.15 mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but that of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> in a recent study was found to be much higher (53.47 mg/100 g). Phospholipid content of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> seeds was about 451 mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B122-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The seeds also contain palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, arachidic acid, and linoleic acid, the most abundant fatty acid [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B121-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B130-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Similar fatty acids are also reported in the raw seeds of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> chloroform/methanol extract, in addition to total free phenol (0.56 g/100 g seed flour) and tannins (0.26 g/100 g seed flour) contents [
