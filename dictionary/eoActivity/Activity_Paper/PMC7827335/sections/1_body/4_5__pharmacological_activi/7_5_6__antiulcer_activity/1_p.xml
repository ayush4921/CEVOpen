<p>The gastroprotective effect of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants was seen in three species which were 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. platycephala</italic> and 
 <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00618-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The leaves and seeds of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats, observed by reductions in the gastric ulcer index and acidity of gastric juice [

 <xref rid="B198-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Lesser collagen and fibrotic ulcer were significantly diminished in the extract-treated group [
 <xref rid="B197-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. platycephala</italic> also showed protective effect in gastric mucosal injury models induced by ethanol, ischemia-reperfusion, and ethanol-HCl. However, the extract could not protect against indomethacin-induced gastric lesion [
 <xref rid="B199-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. These plants are rich in flavonoids. The compounds like catechin and quercetin confer antiulcer effects possibly by eradicating the formation of ROS and modulating mucin metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B201-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>,
 <xref rid="B202-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Other possible protective mechanisms could be by reducing gastric acid secretion, thereby decreasing gastric acid pH, as seen with cinnamic caffeic, p-coumaric or ferulic acidsâ€”the compounds that are present in the plants [
 <xref rid="B203-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Studies on other possible effects of the extracts or bioactive components such as proton pump inhibition could be of interest. In future, the compounds that are responsible for the protective effects should be identified and the possible protective signaling mechanisms should be elucidated. Moreover, clinical trials can be performed to assess the potential use of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> extracts as an antiulcer agent.
