<p>The fermented seeds of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> are a rich source of essential minerals such as iron, calcium, thiamine, and phosphorus [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] which are necessary in forestalling either iron or non-iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, the antianemic capacity of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> could be owing to its nutritional composition. The fermented seeds of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> in combination with other fermented products were reported to be beneficial in the management of anemia as it increased hemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, and packed cell volume [
 <xref rid="B204-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seeds were also investigated in NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>-induced anemic mice. At doses of 400 and 700 mg/kg, an elevation of hemoglobin levels was noted to 0.92 and 0.82 g/dL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B205-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. The exact mechanism of how 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> acts to decrease anemia is still unclear. It could be due to its rich source of the minerals, particularly the iron [
 <xref rid="B171-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Another possible mechanism would be stimulation of erythropoiesis process. Both extracts of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa P. biglobosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> can be developed as an alternative iron supplement. However, the effectiveness should be evaluated clinically.
