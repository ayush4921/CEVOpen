<p>The protective effects of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> is believed via its inhibitions on the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways [
 <xref rid="B206-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>], leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine [
 <xref rid="B208-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>], as well as increment on membrane stabilization [
 <xref rid="B209-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. While the 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> exerts its anti-inflammatory by downregulating nuclear factor kappa B cell (NF-ÎºB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [
 <xref rid="B187-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>,
 <xref rid="B188-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. It is obvious that the plant bioactive components attenuate inflammation by regulating inflammatory and MAPK signaling pathways, which could lead to reduced formation of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. To date, no study has identified the anti-inflammatory compounds from 
 <italic>Parkia</italic>, which warrants further studies on this aspect, either in experimental animals or human studies.
