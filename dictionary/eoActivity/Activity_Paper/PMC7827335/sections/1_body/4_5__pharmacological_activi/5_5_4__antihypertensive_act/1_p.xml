<p>Antihypertensive activity of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> seeds has been demonstrated in both animals and human. Only a clinical study was conducted which observed lower blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate, high level of magnesium as well as improved lipid profile in patients with hypertension consuming fermented seeds of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> in comparison with the non-consumption group [
 <xref rid="B178-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Administration of 1.9 mg/mL of seed extract of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> lowers the arterial blood pressure level in a rat model, possibly due to its ability to slow down the heart rate [
 <xref rid="B179-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] and to induce vascular relaxation [
 <xref rid="B180-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. The latter effect is also seen with roasted seeds of the plant [
 <xref rid="B180-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Other than the seeds, 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> stem bark aqueous extract also demonstrates good hypotensive effect in adrenaline-induced hypertensive female rabbits, which effect is comparable to antihypertensive drugs, propranolol and nifedipine [
 <xref rid="B181-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. The hypotensive properties of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> could be owing to its main phytochemicalsâˆ’phenolics and flavonoids. Catechin and its derivatives are among the most common compounds detected in the plant. These compounds promote vasorelaxation [
 <xref rid="B182-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>] by modulating nitric oxide availability [
 <xref rid="B183-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] and inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) [
 <xref rid="B184-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>], in addition to a reduction in oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B185-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>], leading to blood pressure-lowering effects of the plant extract. The fermented seeds also decrease plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels in Tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemic rats [
 <xref rid="B186-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], and platelet aggregation [
