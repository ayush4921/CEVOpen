<p>Acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic> stem bark were among the plant extracts that show the highest antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] as well as plant pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B153-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The methanol extract of the leaves also shows remarkable growth inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B154-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Investigation on 
 <italic>P. bicolor</italic> indicates that ethyl acetate, ethanol, and aqueous extracts of the leaves demonstrate a concentration-dependent growth inhibitory effect against some Gram-positive of bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, and a fungus, 
 <italic>C. utilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and water extracts of the root also exhibit different degrees of inhibition against some common human pathogenic bacteria including 
 <italic>C. diphtheriae</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The possible mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants are yet to be determined. However, terpenoids from the plants could induce lipid flippase activity in the bacterial cellular membrane which then enhances membrane damage for a better cell penetration [
 <xref rid="B155-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Other possible actions could be by damaging bacterial protein, inhibiting DNA gyrase and DNA synthesis, which are yet to be confirmed in further studies.
