<p>Substances that enhance mitogenesis of lymphocytes may be useful as antitumor or antiproliferative and immunomodulator agents [
 <xref rid="B171-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Lectin obtained from the 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seeds exerted mitogenic activity in both rat thymocytes and human lymphocytes by stimulating the incorporation of thymidine into DNA cell, which activity was comparable to the known T-cell mitogens like pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin [

 <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> have demonstrated antiproliferative effect on murine macrophage cancer cell lines—P 388DI and J774. The seed extract 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> also inhibits the proliferation of B-cell hybridoma cell line, HB98 [

 <bold>52</bold>–

 <italic>P. bicolor</italic> root also exhibit moderate antiproliferative effect IC

 <italic>Parkia</italic> extracts were only investigated in cell lines—limited to cell growth inhibition—not yet studied in in vivo models.
