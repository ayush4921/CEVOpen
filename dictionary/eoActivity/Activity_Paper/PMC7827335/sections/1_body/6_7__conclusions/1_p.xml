<p>Enormous reports demonstrate that plants from genus Parkia possess medicinal values, attributable to the presence of pharmacological active compounds. Taken together, two most studied species, 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic>, show potential as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial, to name a few. Phytochemical investigations indicated terpenoids (monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids), phenolics acids and flavonoids (flavonols, isoflavone, flavanone, and flavan-3-ols) are the major chemical constituents present in the species of this genus, which are responsible for their diverse pharmacological activities. It seems that certain phytoconstituents in 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> have their unique pharmacological effects. Î²-Sitosterol and stigmasterol, for instance, could be investigated further and be developed as hypoglycemic agents; cyclic polysulfides, such as antimicrobials; lectins and monosaccharide saponins for anticancer treatment; and polyphenols, most possibly catechin and its derivatives, and active peptides for blood pressure-lowering effect. The pharmacological properties studied in vitro and in vivo of these compounds should be confirmed in clinical studies. In order to carry out this, there is a need to develop a method, which is effective and cheap to isolate the bioactive constituents in bulks. The potential toxicity and safety of the compounds, as well as their possible protective mechanisms, should also be determined before administration into humans. However, research on other bioactive compounds should continue. It is hoped that discoveries of novel agents from these plants could provide an alternative to the current modern medicine.
