<p>This study filled in the gap of knowledge by bringing significant evidence of how occupational roles correlate with the development of lung cancer among Indonesian workers. It shows the excess risk of lung cancer among workers in Section F (construction) and Division A01 (crop, animal husbandry, and hunting) which could be an early hint of association of some carcinogens with lung cancer development among Indonesian workers. This study confirms the need for improved policy, monitoring, and control of occupational exposure for primary cancer prevention and workersâ€™ compensation purposes. It is needed to ensure that people with work-related lung cancer are diagnosed. Therefore, more training about workplace exposures risk to workers at high risk and training on diagnosing occupational lung cancer need to be provided to health care professionals. Our study results demand further investigations to unravel the possibility that there are even more risk factors for lung cancer among workers in Indonesia in existence. Moreover, this study succeeded in employing IndSIC 2015 as the proxy of occupational exposure to discover occupational disease which can be applied in future occupational health research in Indonesia.</p>
