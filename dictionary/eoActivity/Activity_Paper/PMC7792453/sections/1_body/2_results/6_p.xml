<p>The ANOVA showed that there was no statistically significant difference of the mean of ORs among the three models (F (4,103) = 0.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.78). The PAF for workers in Division A 01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) was 3.9% and for workers in Section F (Construction) was 5.4%. Two divisions in Section C (C17: pulp, paper, and paper products and C21: pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical, and botanical products) and a division in Section B (B610: oil and gas mining) were the only divisions that had cases without controls.
