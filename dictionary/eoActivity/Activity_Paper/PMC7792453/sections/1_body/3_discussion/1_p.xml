<p>The present study succeeds in bringing evidence of the excess risk of lung cancer for workers that can be classified under the IndSIC’s Division A01 (Crop, animal production and hunting) and Section F (Construction). The PAF for crop, animal, and hunting workers was 3.9% and construction workers was 5.2%, showing that the contribution of occupational carcinogens contributed to the lung cancer burden in Indonesia. Applying the PAF to the 30,023 incident cases of lung cancer in Indonesia in 2018, we estimated that 1,170 cases were attibutable to occupation in crop, animal, and hunting division and 1,561 cases were attributable to occupations in the construction section in 2018 [

They identified the increased risk of lung cancer among agriculture workers (OR = 1.89, 95% Cl = 1.17–2.98) and workers exposed to inorganic dust (ceramic and pottery workers, construction, and mining) (OR = 1.81, 95% Cl = 1.0–3.25) compared to office workers. They also discovered that the elevated risk for agriculture workers was associated with pesticide use [
