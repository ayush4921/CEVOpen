<p>There are some limitations in this study, especially of methodological nature. A major limitation is the explorative character of this case-control study, such as the lack of conducting multiple tests for different subgroups. As there are limited studies and data on the risks of lung cancer in Indonesia available, this explorative research has nonetheless added an important first insight into this public health issue, proving that further research in this area is indispensable. Unmatched subjects, possible misclassification of the subjects’ occupations, and recall bias were other limitations of this study. However, the increased chances for agriculture and construction workers to develop lung cancer found in this study were comparable to other previous studies of other countries and indicated no substantial effect of the limitations. Selection bias was also a concern for the hospital-based case-control study. However, almost all of the proportioning of subjects in each section of IndSIC were comparable with the proportion of Indonesian workers based on IndSIC, and this allowed us to assume that the subjects represented the Indonesian population [

Moreover, the study’s location was the national referral hospital for respiratory diseases and the most prominent center for lung cancer management in Indonesia. This allowed us to assume that we had obtained a representative sample of the lung cancer patients of Indonesia for our study’s aim.
