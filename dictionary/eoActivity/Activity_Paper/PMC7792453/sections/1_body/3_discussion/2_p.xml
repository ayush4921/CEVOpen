<p>Tse et al., after applying the ISIC rev.4 to investigate the risk of lung cancer in Chinese workers, reported that construction workers have a significantly increased risk of having lung cancer compared to workers from other sections (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01–1.89). Tse et al. further identified that occupational carcinogens associated with the development of lung cancer were caused by silica dust (1.75, 95% CI: 1.16–2.62), welding fumes (1.74, 95% CI: 1.13–2.68), diesel exhaust (2.18, 95% CI: 1.23–3.84), and man-made mineral fibers (7.45, 95% CI: 1.63–34.00) [

In addition to the increased risk of lung cancer, a study in California by Calvert et al. indicated that lung cancer in construction workers was diagnosed at an earlier age, at a more advanced stage, and had significantly lower survival rates by three years compared to non-construction workers. The odds ratio in this study was comparable with Calvert et al.’s findings [
