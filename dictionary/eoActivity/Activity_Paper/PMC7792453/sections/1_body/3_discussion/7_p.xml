<p>As far as we know, this is the first study in Indonesia to approach occupational lung cancer through the IndSIC classification system. This approach is most convenient since the country has insufficient data on the effects of exposure. For more detailed information, further investigations, to the level of division or even classes that may identify risk that had not appeared at the section level, should be performed. The approach could be extended further by increasing the number of subjects or directly investigating the occupational agents causing lung cancer by using a job exposure matrix.</p>
