<p>We calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for any section or division that had significant OR to estimate the proportion of lung cancer cases that would be prevented if the risk factor was eliminated [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our estimate was made by using the formula, PAF = P(EC) Ã— (OR-1)/OR where OR is the adjusted odds ratio and P(EC) is the proportion of exposed cases [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All test decisions were performed at a significance level of 5%. IBM SPSS Statistic for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyze the data.
