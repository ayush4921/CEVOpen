<p>Among the 21 sections of IndSIC, some sections include a variety of work processes, materials, and substances among their divisions or groups; whereas, in some other sections, they are almost similar. For example, Section C (manufacturing) has 33 divisions such as cement, plastic, chemical, and food industries that are very different when it comes to work processes and exposures, while Section F (construction) has only three nearly similar divisions. These differences can lead to different lung cancer risks among workers in the different divisions of the manufacturing section [
