<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidizes the biologically important macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, thus initiating structural and functional alterations in these molecules. Lipid oxidation produces a secondary product called malondialdehyde (MDA). Lipid peroxidation is a valuable target in the evaluation of oxidative stress and related complications because the hydroxyl radical produced is the most reactive form of ROS that can initiate lipid peroxidation by attacking polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oxidative stress is the major cause of diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities [
