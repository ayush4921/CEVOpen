<p>The effect of CTN administered in different doses on pancreas histopathology in STZ-induced diabetic rats is represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The histological pattern of the pancreas of the normal control group has shown clear lobular architecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). Islets of Langerhans were of normal diameter and structure, acinar cells were clear with prominent and centrally placed nuclei and interlobular spaces were also visible. The central cellular integrity and lobular structure of pancreas was retained. The effect of CTN on pancreas histopathology in STZ-induced diabetic rats indicates that a normal histological pattern of the pancreas was shown by the normal control group rats, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Acinar cells were clear with prominent and centrally placed nuclei, and interlobular spaces were also visible. The islet of Langerhans was of normal diameter and structure and the overall cellular integrity and architecture was maintained. The pancreas of Diabetic control group rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>B) showed a typical histological pattern with slight grade of congestion and dilated blood vessels with inflammatory cell infiltration. The diameter of islet of Langerhans was decreased with decreased cellular density. Shrined and pyknotic nuclei are also visible in the center of the islet. The boundary of the endocrine and exocrine portion of the pancreas was also indistinct. The presence of inflammatory cells can be observed in connective tissue spaces as well. The histological pattern of the pancreas of group III rats were treated with glibenclamide 5 mg/kg/orally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). The pancreatic tissue of this group of rats did not show any violation from the normal histological pattern during experimental period. No congestion or deterioration was observed in the in acinar cells. There was no reduction in the diameter of Islet of Langerhans and nuclei were also centrally placed. The boundary of endocrine and exocrine portion of pancreas was distinct and overall normal histological pattern was retained. The histological pattern of groups IV and V treated with CTN (2, 5 mg/kg/orally) did not show restoration of pancreatic tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,E). The diameter of the islet of Langerhans was declined with reduced cellular mass and the nuclei were not properly aligned. The presence of inflammatory cells and pyknotic nuclei were also observed to some extent, which showed that the CTN with dose 2, 5 mg/kg/orally was not effective to treat STZ-induced diabetes. Group VI-VII (CTN 10, 15 mg/kg/orally) has shown a little bit restoration of histological architecture of pancreas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>F,G). The size and number of Islet of Langerhans were recovered with low grade rejuvenation but still the distinction of septa between the islets and acinar is not prominent. The presence of inflammatory cells was negligible and the overall cytoplasmic integrity was retained to some extent. The groups VIIIâ€“IX (30 and 50 mg/kg/orally) show normal histological pattern of the pancreas with clear lobular architecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00137-f006">Figure 6</xref>H,I). The isslet of Langerhans was of normal diameter and structure, acinar cells were clear with prominent and centrally placed nuclei and interlobular spaces were also visible. The central cellular integrity and lobular structure of the pancreas was also retained. These results showed that the maximum efficacy of CTN to treat diabetes is obtained at a doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg/orally in STZ-induced diabetes.
