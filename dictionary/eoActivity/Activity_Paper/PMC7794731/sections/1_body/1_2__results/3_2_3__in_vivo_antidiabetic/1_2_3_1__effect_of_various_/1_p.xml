Treatment with STZ significantly increased fasting blood glucose level in rats of groups II (Diabetic control) on day 1st in comparison to the normal control (group I) group and CTN treated groups IV-IX. Blood glucose level of diabetic rats increased significantly (

Although CTN at lowest dose of 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight exerted a significant effect on blood glucose level in diabetic rats when compared to diabetic control rats but the effect was more pronounced when bioactive compound was administered in high dose range (15, 30 and 50 mg/kg) and fasting blood glucose level of diabetic rats were significantly (
