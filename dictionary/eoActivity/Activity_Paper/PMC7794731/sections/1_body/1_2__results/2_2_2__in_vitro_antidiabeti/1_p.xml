<p>Highest percent inhibitory potential of diabetic enzyme (α-amylase; 83 ± 1.5, α-glucosidase; 85 ± 1.1) were exhibited by CTN at highest concentration 1000 µg/mL (

 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by evaluating the plot of % α-amylase and % α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition as a function of CTN concentrations. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for α-amylase and α-glucosidase were 38 and 32 µg/mL respectively. These values are comparable to that of the standard acarbose was used as a positive control which causes percent inhibition 90 ± 0.4 and 89 ± 0.5 against α-amylase α-glucosidase at maximum concentration of 1000 µg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 30 and 26 µg/mL respectively (
