<p>For histopathological examination the pancreas portion were immediately removed, washed thoroughly with saline solution to remove the blood. Finally the pancreas tissue were fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated with ethanol-xylene mixtures and fixed with paraffin. Tissue blocks were sectioned with about 4.5–6.5 μm thickness through Microtome (ACCU-Cut
 <sup>®</sup> SRM
 <sup>™</sup>: 200 Sakura). Slides were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) dye by means of automatic slide stainer (Sakura Tissue-Tek
 <sup>®</sup> DRS
 <sup>™</sup> 2000; Salt Lake Utah, USA). The stained slides were cleaned properly and observed under microscope to see alteration in pancreatic tissues (architecture of STZ-induced diabetic group) and treated (glibenclamide/extract) groups. The samples were processed according to reported protocols [
