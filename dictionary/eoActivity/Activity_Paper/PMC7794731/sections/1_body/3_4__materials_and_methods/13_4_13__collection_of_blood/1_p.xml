<p>At the completion of in vivo antidiabetic activity on the 21st day, all animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 35 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium and euthanized by means of cervical decapitation according to the previously reported procedure illustrated in schedule-1 of UK, animal scientific procedure act; 1986. Blood collection was carried out through cardiac puncture, transferred to EDTA and non-EDTA containing tubes. Blood and sera were separated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min for analysis of glucose and biochemical parameters such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) [

The concentration of lipid profile parameters; total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and serum creatinine in serum were estimated using a biochemistry analyzer (PS-520; Shenzhen Procan Electronics, China) as per companies’ instructions using diagnostic kits (Reactivos, GPL Barcelona, Spain) [
