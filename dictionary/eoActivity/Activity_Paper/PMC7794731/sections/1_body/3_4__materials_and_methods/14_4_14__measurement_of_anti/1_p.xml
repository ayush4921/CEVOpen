Homogenates were placed at 4 °C for 20 min, and finally centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at −20 °C until assessed for different enzymes. According to the reported method [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total content of reduced glutathione (GSH) level in the supernatant obtained from liver and kidney tissues were analyzed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay was used for estimation of and malondialdehyde (MDA) level (lipid peroxidation) [
