<p>All the animals were divided into nine groups that were comprising of 8 animals each. The control group animals received tween-80 suspension, orally. All animals were then treated orally with different doses (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 500 mg/kg body weight) of CTN for acute toxicity study. Immediately after dosing, the animals were observed continuously for 4 h for symptoms of toxicity (respiratory aches, motor activity, convulsions, muscle spasm, tremors, sedation, diarrhoea, lacrimation, hypnosis, salivation, and loss of righting reflex) in animals. All animals were kept under observation and seemed healthy at 24 h to 1 week with no obvious alterations in appearance or behavior. No mortality was observed up to one week. The CTN remained safe and nontoxic up to 500 mg/kg body weight dose range. Therefore, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, CTN at dose 50 mg/kg body weight as 1/10th of the highest dose (500 mg/kg) for multiple dose investigation was selected to evaluate in vivo antidiabetic activity of CTN [
