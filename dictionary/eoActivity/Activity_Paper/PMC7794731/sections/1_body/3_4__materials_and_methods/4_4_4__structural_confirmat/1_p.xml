 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (METHANOL-d
 <sub>4</sub>,300MHz): δ = 6.73–6.62, signifies the aromatic protons at 15th, 20th and 21th carbon of the given structure, δ = 5.83 (s, 1H) this singlet could be the hydrogen atom at carbon number 11, δ = 5.76 (s, 1H) this singlet could be attributed to proton attached with carbon number 8 of the given structure, 4.76 (s, 4H) this broad singlet represents the four protons each one attached as a –OH group to the carbon number 6, 9, 16 and 18. Δ = 4.46 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 3.87 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 5.1 Hz, 1H) this duplet can be precisely represent by a proton attached to the carbon number 2 of the given structure, δ = 2.71 ppm (s, 1H) this singlet has been contributed by the protons attached to the carbon number 4 of the given structure (
