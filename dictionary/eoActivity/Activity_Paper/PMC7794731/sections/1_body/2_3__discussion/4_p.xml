<p>It was also observed that catechin in the dose of 30 and 50 mg/kg body weight can significantly improve the adverse metabolic effects in the serum of animals treated with streptozotocin. STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with catechin have significantly reduced serum glucose level, improved lipid profiles (TC, TGs, LDL, HDL, and cholesterol), liver profiles (SGPT, SGOT, ALP, AST, and serum creatinine), and body weight. The results of the current study confirm the previous outcomes reported by other researchers that catechin has significantly improved STZ damages in rats [

The current study also indicates the improvement in oxidative stress in the STZ diabetic rats that might be due to strong antioxidant potential of catechin against DPPH and ABTS free radicals. Our results are in line with the reported study that hyperglycemia in STZ treated group is due to the cytotoxic effect of STZ on insulin secreting β-cells of pancreas that are also accompanied with an increase in lipid peroxidation. Thus, destruction of pancreatic β-cells is related to the locally and systemically induced oxidative stress [
