<p>It was also observed that STZ-induced diabetic rats showed a considerable increase in the levels of hepatic enzymes such as SGPT, SGOT, ALP, AST, and serum creatinine. The improvement of STZ effects in rats after treatment with catechin might indicate a protective effect of it against STZ function due to decrease in oxygen free radicals production and also increase in antioxidant content. In the present investigation, SGPT, SGOT, ALP, AST, and serum creatinine activities were significantly reduced in catechin treated diabetic rats in comparison to the untreated diabetic rats which were in line with previous findings [
