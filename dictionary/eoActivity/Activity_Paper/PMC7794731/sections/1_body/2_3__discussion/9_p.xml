<p>Streptozotocin causes lipid peroxidation and increases the concentration of MDA in hepatocytes. Increases in MDA level is an important indicator of tissue damages. Administration of berries catechin (2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 50mg/kg body weight) markedly reduced the MDA content near to normal that has been validated by other studies on plant extracts [

STZ intoxicated rats exhibited a decrease in the total content of reduced GSH level, GPx activities, and elevated MDA level. Increased MDA level have been shown to be an important marker for in vivo lipid peroxidation. Oxidative stress results from a marked imbalance between free radical production and elimination by antioxidant system. Furthermore, berries catechin (2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 50 mg/kg body weight) significantly (

Such regulation of oxidative stress markers by the catechin may be well correlated with previous reports, where catechin have antioxidant and free radical scavenging ability [
