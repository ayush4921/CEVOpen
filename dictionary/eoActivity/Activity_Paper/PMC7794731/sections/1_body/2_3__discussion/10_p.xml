<p>A significant decrease in body weight was also observed after 21 days in STZ- induced diabetic rats. It is majorly due to decrease of carbohydrate reserve as an energy source and fats catabolism during diabetic conditions that usually cause excessive break down of tissue protein that leads to loss in body weight. However, oral administration of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> berries catechin at a dose range of 30 and 50 mg/kg body weight for 21 days to diabetic rats brings a pronounced increase in body weight. Similar effects have also been reported in other studies where restoration in body weight with extract of

 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> berries possessed the ability of body weight restoration and management of glucose levels.
