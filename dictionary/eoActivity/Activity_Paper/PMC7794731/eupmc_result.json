    "In this study, catechin (CTN) isolated from <i>Elaeagnus umbellata</i> was evaluated for in vitro antioxidant potential and inhibition of carbohydrate digestive enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase). The compound was also tested for its in vivo antidiabetic potential using Sprague-Dawley rats as experimental animals. The effects of various doses of catechin in STZ (Streptozotocin) induced diabetic rats on fasting blood glucose level, body weight, lipid parameters, hepatic enzymes, and renal functions were evaluated using the reported protocols. The CTN exhibited the highest percent antioxidant for free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, and inhibited the activity of carbohydrate digestive enzymes (with percent inhibition values: 79 ± 1.5% α-amylase and 80 ± 1.1% α-glucosidase). Administration CTN and standard glibenclamide significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose level and increased the body weight in STZ-induced diabetic rats. CTN significantly decreased the different lipid parameters, hepatic, and renal function enzyme levels along with Hb1c level in diabetic rats, while significantly increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level with values comparable to the standard glibenclamide. Further, the altered levels of glutathione and lipid peroxides of liver and kidney tissues were restored (by CTN) to levels similar to the control group. CTN significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, total content of reduced glutathione, and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in rat liver and kidney tissues homogenates, and also corrected the histopathological abnormalities, suggesting its antioxidant potential."
