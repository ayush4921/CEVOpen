<p>In an attempt to improve the bioactivity of medicinal plants, much research has focused on nanoparticles to reduce the size of particles and increase the surface area. Plant extracts are capping agents capable of reducing metal ion, resulting in the formation of nanoparticles with remarkable antibacterial activities (

 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. bark extract (TA-AgNPs) were synthesized eco-friendly. The antibacterial activity of TA-AgNPs against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was better than the extract (

 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> H. Perrier extract and 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> -AgNPs (TM-AgNPs) against 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> was reported to be 125 and 3.12 µg/mL, respectively. It was noted that the MIC values of the TM-AgNPs were 40 times lower than those of the extract (

 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. leaf gold nanoparticles (TC-AgNPs) showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The prepared TC-AgNPs were used on Nylon fabrics for future applying of medical materials.
