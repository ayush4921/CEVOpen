 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. is widely used to treat dementia, constipation, and diabetes in traditional Indian and Iranian medicine (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Jokar et al., 2016</xref>). Studies showed that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. has various biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor (
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It has been demonstrated that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. fruits are rich in phenolic compounds such as (3) gallic acid, (4) ellagic acid, and (5) corilagin, which hold potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardiotonic, antibacterial, and anticarcinogenic activities (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial indicated that dietary supplementation with a standardized extract of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. fruit (AyuFlex
 <sup>®</sup>) relieves the discomfort in osteoarthritis (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). Also, 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. is a potent cognitive enhancer for amnesia due to its antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). However, the safety assessment regarding the use of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. in amnesia is lacking (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">Suganthy et al., 2018</xref>). Active components such as (4) ellagic acid are reported to play essential roles in the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. reduces oxidative cell death induced by PC12 and OLN-93 caused by quinolinate, which suggests the neuroprotection and oligoprotection effects of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">Sadeghnia et al., 2017</xref>). Another study suggested that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extract attenuates inflammation in microglial cells; therefore, it can be used as a potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Rahimi et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. has been demonstrated in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models in previous studies (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>).
