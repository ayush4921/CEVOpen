 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Mopuri et al. (2015)</xref>, evaluated a different 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species, 
 <italic>T. paniculata</italic> Roth from India. The study tested the antiobesity effect of ethanolic extracts from barks of 
 <italic>T. paniculata</italic> Roth on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Of the evaluated parameters, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> extracts reduced body weight, lean mass, total fat, fat percentage, decreased glucose blood levels at 60 min, reversed insulin resistance, and lowered serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins. The authors concluded that the potential antiobesity effect of barks from 
 <italic>T. paniculata</italic> Roth might be attributed to the down-regulation of the expression of lipogenic genes and leptin; also, and up-regulation of adiponectin and AMPK-1α. The potential hypolipemic effect of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. has been assessed by 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al. (2015)</xref>. The authors used methanolic bark extracts of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. at concentrations of 5, 50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg. The toxicity of these extracts was evaluated using 8–12 weeks old female rats at the doses mentioned above. 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al. (2015)</xref>, report no observed toxicity effect with any of the tested concentrations. Furthermore, the administration of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. bark extract at 600 mg/kg significantly caused a hypolipidemic effect in high-cholesterol hyperlipidemic rats, which was evidenced by increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
