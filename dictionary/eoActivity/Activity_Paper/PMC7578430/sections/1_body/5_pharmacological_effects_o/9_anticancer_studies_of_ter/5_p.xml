<p>Another report attributes the antiproliferative activity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. to (53) chebulagic acid in a dose-dependent manner in retinoblastoma cells. The mode of action was suggested through modulation of MMP, induction of the release of cytochrome c, activated caspase 3, and modulated ratio of BAX and Bcl2 in cell death (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. (2014)</xref>, treated Y79 cells with different (53) chebulagic acid concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µM), which decreased the proliferation of the cells in a dose-dependent manner. Only at a concentration of 50 µM of (53) chebulagic acid, a 50% antiproliferative effect was observed, which was attributed to the capacity of (53) chebulagic acid to induce G1 arrest, inhibit NFκB and induce apoptosis in retinoblastoma Y79 cell lines by induction of the release of cytochrome c by modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential and altering BAX/Bcl2 ratio. Also, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts have shown antiproliferative potential against breast cancer, as it is reported by 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Ghate et al. (2014)</xref>. The authors showed that methanolic extracts from 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. at a concentration of 100 µg/mL had antiproliferative activity against human breast MCF-7 and human lung A549 carcinoma cell lines. 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts induced apoptosis by affecting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins, respectively) in both cell types. HPLC analysis of 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits methanolic extracts exhibited (35) quercetin, (3) gallic acid, (87) catechin, (88) reserpine, and (89) tannic acid as potential active constituents. A Summary of the anticancer studies with different 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species is presented in

  <bold>Figure 4(ii)</bold>
 </xref> shows the structures of some of the active constituents with potential antiproliferative and anticancer properties of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species.
