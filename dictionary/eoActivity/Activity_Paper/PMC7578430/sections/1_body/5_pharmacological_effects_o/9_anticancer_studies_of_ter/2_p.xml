 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2015)</xref>, evaluated the antiproliferative potential of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. using human lung cancer A and mouse lung cancer LLC cell lines. This report isolated five different fractions from the aqueous extracts and shows that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts inhibit cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest by regulating the mitochondrial pathway mediated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family, inducing the PARP cleavage, and promoting cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> Exell from Australia was studied by 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">Shalom and Cock (2018)</xref>; the authors evaluated methanolic, aqueous, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and hexane extracts. It was shown that all fruit extracts significantly had an inhibitory effect against Caco-2 cells; though, only methanol and aqueous fruit extracts showed HeLa antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative potential as determined in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values showed that the most potent extracts were ethyl acetate (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6 µg/mL) against MC3T3-E1 cells, methanolic extracts against MC3T3-E1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 µg/mL), and Jeg-3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 147 µg/mL) cells. As ethyl acetate extracts were the most antiproliferative, the authors only evaluated the phytochemical composition of these samples. It was revealed that this extract is rich in (5) corilagin, (48) luteolin, and (76) chebulic acid. Further studies showed that the mechanism of action was through elevation of the caspase-3 activity, indicating an apoptosis-induced effect.
