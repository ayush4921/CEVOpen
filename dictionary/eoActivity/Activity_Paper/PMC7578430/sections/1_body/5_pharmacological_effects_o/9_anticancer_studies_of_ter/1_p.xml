In 2018, around 9.6 million people died from cancer, and up to 300,000 new cases are registered per year.

Additionally, several chemotherapy agents that are currently used are of plant origin. Thus, studies are still evaluating natural products from new plant species searching for potential anticancer agents. Recent information from the Scopus and Web of Science databases (2010–2020) indicates an ongoing interest in evaluating the anticancer potential of
