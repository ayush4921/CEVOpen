<p>(58) Octyl gallate and (3) gallic acid isolated from 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. had an antiproliferative effect against MCF-7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 µg/mL) and MDA-MB-231 cell lines through induced apoptosis by altering the expression of the cell regulators cyclin D1, D3, CDK-4, CDK-6, p18 INK4, p21Waf-1, and p27 KIP. The extracts downregulated the overexpressed cyclin D/CDKs, molecules involved in the progression of the cell cycle through G1 to S phase, which contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, docking studies confirmed that (58) octyl gallate and (3) gallic acid have a strong binding affinity with the cell cycle regulators by hydrogen bonds. Another group of compounds with antiproliferative potential is furfuran lignans from 
 <italic>T. citrina</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Muhit et al. (2016)</xref>, tested these furfuran lignans at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 µM, and the compounds (77) terminaloside B and (78) terminaloside G exhibited antiproliferative effect for MCF-7 and T47D cell lines with suppression of nearly 90% at concentrations lower than 10 µM. Moreover, (79) 6-epiterminaloside K and (80) terminaloside C, (81) terminaloside F, and (82) terminaloside I showed antiestrogenic activity against MCF-7 cells. The antiproliferative potential of these compounds was mainly attributed to the metabolism of the gut microbiota, which produces mammalian lignan metabolites with estrogenic activity like (83) enterodiol and (84) enterolactone (
