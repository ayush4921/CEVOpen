 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species showed inhibitory activity against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, and lowered fasting blood glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. extracts showed the most potent inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, followed by 
 <italic>T. corticosa</italic> Pierre ex Laness, and 
 <italic>T. alata</italic> Roth, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.41, 1.42, and ≥ 4 mg/mL, respectively. The authors found a positive correlation between the polyphenolic content of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species (as evaluated by spectrophotometry) and the α-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of the extracts. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Makihara et al. (2012)</xref>, evaluated hot water extracts of fruits from 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. on obesity-related disorders. The authors suggest that 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. has a preventive effect on obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia in spontaneously obese type 2 diabetic mice. 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. treatment does not affect food intake; however, it slightly suppressed body weight gain (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Makihara et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. treatment significantly suppressed in a dose a time-dependent manner, the accumulation of visceral and subcutaneous fat after the 7th week. 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> treatment also improved plasma and hepatic lipid levels, as it was observed by the decreased LDL/HDL ratio from 0.28 to 0.23 in 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. at 3% treated mice. The authors managed to identified that gallic acid might be the responsible active compound for the inhibition of lipid absorption, as it is a potent pancreatic lipase inhibitor. As a follow-up of the study, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Makihara et al. (2016)</xref>, studied the anti-obesity mechanism of gallic acid of fruits from 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. by evaluating adipocyte3 differentiation using mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Gallic acid at concentrations of 10–30 µM enhanced the expression and secretion of adiponectin 
 <italic>via</italic> adipocyte differentiation, which is enhanced by 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. extracts. Gallic acid enhanced the expression of the mRNA encoding for the marker of adipocyte differentiation Fabp4.
