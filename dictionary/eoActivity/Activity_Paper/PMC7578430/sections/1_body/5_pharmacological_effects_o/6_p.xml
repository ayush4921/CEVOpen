<p>Another mechanism in which 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. has shown its antiobesity potential is through the inhibition of glucose metabolic enzymes such as α-glucosidase. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Pham et al. (2014)</xref>, evaluated 
 <italic>Terminalia macroptera</italic> Guill. &amp; Perr. extracts glucosidase inhibitory capacity. Chromatographic analysis showed the presence of the polyphenols (53) chebulagic acid, (73) chebulic acid trimethyl ester, (71) corilagin, (70) methyl gallate, (74) narcissin, and (118) rutin. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and butanol 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts were outstanding inhibitors of α-glucosidase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.47, 0.4, and 0.4 µM, respectively. Moreover, (53) chebulagic acid isolated from extracts showed an inhibitory rate with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.05 µM. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2016)</xref>, studied the enzymatic inhibitory potential of extracts of trunk-bark of three 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species, 
 <italic>T. alata</italic> Roth
 <italic>, T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. and 
 <italic>T. corticosa</italic> Pierre ex Laness.
