<p>Furthermore, studies using 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruit extracts to biosynthesize gold nanoparticles have been reported by 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Annavaram et al. (2017)</xref>, who evaluated their antifungal potential. The authors showed that gold nanoparticles against 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> exhibited maximum zone of inhibition of around 16 and 14 mm, respectively. This effect was partially attributed to the presence of (3) gallic acid, (4) ellagic acid, (70) methyl gallate, (37) β-sitosterol, and (53) chebulagic acid.
