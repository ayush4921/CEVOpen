 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2017)</xref>, reported the potential use of ethanol extracts from fruits of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. to prevent dental plaque bacteria-mediated periodontal disease for their 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> growth-inhibitory capacity. Moreover, concomitant with the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts, as exhibited by their inhibitory capacity of PGE2 and COX-2. A mixture prepared with 5 mg/mL 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> and 20 mg/mL 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> L. was evaluated for its antimicrobial properties against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
 <italic>and S. aureus</italic>, in vacuum packed ready-to-cook chicken, inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with 1.80, 2.13, 2.36, and 2.97 log CFU/g reduction in 3,6,9, and 12 days, and also decreased the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> with 1.22, 1.60, and 1.55 log CFU reduction at 6,9, and 12 days, respectively. These results may indicate the ability of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. catappa L.</italic> extracts to extend shelf-life of chicken meat in vacuum packed ready-to-cook chicken (
