 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts have been the center of studies regarding the biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles with therapeutic potential. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Sivamaruthi et al. (2019)</xref>, aimed to biosynthesize silver Palladium bimetallic nanoparticles from aqueous fruit extract of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz., as potential antimicrobial and anticancer agents. The nanoparticles exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacterial strains like methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MSRA 11 and MRSA56; and gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with a zone of inhibition from 12–16 mM at a concentration of 30 µg/mL. Further toxicity studies showed no cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even at the highest dose of nanoparticles of 200 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Sivamaruthi et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Akhter et al. (2019)</xref>, evaluated the antibacterial activity of biogenic synthesized nanoparticles of zinc, copper, and iron oxides using the extract of 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits, against gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and gram-negative 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Escheerichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. The zone of inhibition of the evaluated nanoparticles exhibited its maximum values for zinc oxide nanoparticles.
