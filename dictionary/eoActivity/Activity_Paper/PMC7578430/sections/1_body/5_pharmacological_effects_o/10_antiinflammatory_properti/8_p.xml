 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Anokwuru et al. (2018)</xref>, evaluated the antioxidant capacity of ethanolic extracts of fruit, leaf, stem, bark, and roots of 
 <italic>Terminalia sericea</italic> Burch. ex DC. from South Africa; moreover, free, conjugated, and bound phenolic-rich extracts were obtained. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the DPPH method. The authors reported that the free fruit extracts, ester bound of leaves and roots, glycoside bound fruit extracts, leaves, and stem insoluble bound extracts showed the highest antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.13, 4.58, and 4.89, 12.6, 15.4, and 17.8 µg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity was attributed mainly to the presence of (3) gallic acid and (113) resveratrol. Another evaluation of polyphenolic-rich extracts was performed by 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Saha and Verma (2016)</xref>, but with 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. fruit methanolic extracts at concentrations ranging from 50–500 µg/mL; the authors evaluated the antioxidant capacity of the samples by different methods. The total antioxidant capacity assay showed that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts had the highest antioxidant potential, in a dose-dependent manner, at a concentration of 150 µg/mL yielding an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 14 µg/mL. Moreover, 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts also inhibited nitric oxide with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30.51 µg/mL at a concentration of 500 µg/mL; the extracts also showed scavenging activity towards H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which is not a free radical but the precursor of some reactive oxygen species, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 265.53 µg/mL.
