<p>Crude extracts from 
 <italic>Terminalia phanerophlebia</italic> Engl. &amp; Diels, a species endemic to Africa, exhibit selective inhibition of COX-2 (92.4%). The bioactivity was attributed to the cholestane triterpenoids such as (37) β-sitosterol, (111) β-sitostenone, and (112) stigmast-4-ene-3,6-dione; which were further isolated and individually evaluated, this exhibited that the COX-2 inhibitory activity might be attributed to the triterpenoid (37) β-sitosterol (

 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. ethyl acetate from the aerial parts at concentrations of 100 and 300 mg/kg was orally administered to male BALB/cN mice following tetrachloride-intoxication.
