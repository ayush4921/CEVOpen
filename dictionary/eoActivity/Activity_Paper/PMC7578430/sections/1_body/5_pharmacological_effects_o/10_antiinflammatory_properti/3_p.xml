 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al. (2010)</xref>, evaluated the COX-2 inhibitory capacity of isolated (3) gallic acid from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits obtained by RP-HPLC. The authors report that (3) gallic acid has a concentration-dependent inhibitory capacity of COX-1 and COX-2, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.5 µM and 74 µM, respectively. Further biochemical tests showed competitive binding of (3) gallic acid for both COX-1 and COX-2 concerning substrate, and a time-dependent inhibition for both molecular targets. It is also reported that (3) gallic acid, binding to COX-2 is mediated 
 <italic>via</italic> the carboxylate moiety of (3) gallic acid with the amino acids Arg120 and Glu524 at the entrance of the active site.
