<p>Methanolic extracts of fruits of 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. from India were studied by 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Basu et al. (2017)</xref>. The extracts were further sequentially extracted with n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water to obtain different fractions. The obtained extracts were evaluated by the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity method, and the results showed that the butanol, water, and ethyl acetate extracts had the highest antioxidant capacity. Moreover, the ethyl acetate extracts showed the highest DPPH scavenging radical activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.11 µg/mL. The authors mention that the polar fractions showed higher antioxidant activity might be related to the presence of compounds like (114) purpurin, (87) catechin, (89) tannic acid, (88) reserpine, (4) ellagic acid, (70) methyl gallate, and (118) rutin (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Dawe et al. (2017)</xref>, showed that ethanolic extracts from roots of 
 <italic>T. glaucescens</italic> Planch. ex Benth. have scavenging activity against the DPPH radical, which may be attributed to the compounds (99) termiglaucescin; (100) β-D-glucopyranosyl 2α, 3β, 6β-trihydroxy-23-gallylean-12-en-28-oate; (101) arjunglucoside I; (102) sericoside; (103) arjungenin; (104) sericic acid; (105) arjunetin; (106) chebuloside II; (107) 3,3’4-tri-O-methylelagic acid; (108) 3,3’-di-O-methylelagic acid; (37) β-sitosterol; and (10) stigmasterol (
