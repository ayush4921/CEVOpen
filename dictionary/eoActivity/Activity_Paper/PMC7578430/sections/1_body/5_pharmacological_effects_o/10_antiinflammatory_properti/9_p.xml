<p>Studies on 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. collected in India and extracts prepared from fruits with 70% ethanol were reported by 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Bag et al. (2013)</xref>. The antioxidant capacity was measured by the liver lipid peroxidation and DPPH assays; 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts exhibited a dose-dependent antioxidant capacity with the highest inhibition of the DPPH radical at a concentration of 50 µg/mL with 58.40% antioxidant percentage and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 42.14 µg/mL. Moreover, the extracts also reduced the formation of MDA in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest activity at a dose of 250 mg/kg p.o.
