<p>A study by 
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2013)</xref>, evaluated fruits from two different 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz., and 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb., and an Ayurvedic formulation from the two species. The authors showed that the compounds (53) chebulagic acid; (5) corilagin; (54) 2,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-glucose; (55) 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl- β-D-glucose found in 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. and the formulation enhanced the signaling of 8Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα and PPARγ). A structure-dependent effect was shown when only the gallotannins, (56) 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl- β-D-glucose and (57) 1,2,3,4,5-penta-O-galloyl- β-D-glucose enhanced up to 9.92-fold the cellular glucose uptake in HepG2 cells and inhibited the rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis (

 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Shyni et al. (2014)</xref>, showed the potential of (53) chebulagic acid to enhance glucose transport in adipocytes using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to elucidate its PPARγ agonistic effect. To achieve this, the authors used (53) chebulagic acid from 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. using 3T3-L1 cells at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 µM. The importance of research for PPARγ antagonists from plant origin is to elucidate active molecules that partially inhibit these molecules, without the adverse side effects caused by conventional PPARγ antagonists (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Shyni et al., 2014</xref>). The authors concluded that (53) chebulagic acid from 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. enhanced the expression of C/EBPα, a PPARγ target in adipocytes, but not at the extent of rosiglitazone.
