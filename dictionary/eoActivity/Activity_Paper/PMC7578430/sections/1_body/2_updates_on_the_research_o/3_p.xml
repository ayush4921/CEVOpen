<p>It has been proved that the phytochemicals presented in the plant species have been the most popular research nitch investigated thus far (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figure 3</bold>
 </xref>). The plant species is worldwide distributed, with more than 250 species in Asia, Himalayas, Madagascar, Australia, and Southern Africa. Importantly, the ethnopharmacological use of the plant species is well-known in India named Ayurvedic medicine as well as in Chinese medicine. Also, some of the 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. fruits including 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. have been used as a polyherbal formulation in Ayurvedic and Thai folk medicine named Triphala (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Intharuksa et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. phytochemicals have been studied by many researchers. Several phytochemical groups including glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, saponin, carbohydrates, and proteins have been found in the plant species (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, pure new compounds and pure well-known compounds have also been isolated from several 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. (

 <italic>Terminalia</italic> plant species, a study on the phytochemicals of the 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. including the isolation of a new compound to be used as a novel drug for the treatment of diseases is an important area of research. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. is the second popular research determined by the researchers (

 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. has been used in traditional medicine to treat bacterial infectious diseases including diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and sore throats (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Eloff et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the trend of the bioactivity study on 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. is an important area of research. It has been reported that the growth of airborne pathogens including MDR 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. and MDR 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is suppressed when the microorganisms were treated with 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Dharmaratne et al., 2018</xref>) and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. (
