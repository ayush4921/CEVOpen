<p>Essentially, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> plants are yet to be actively explored on the molecular and docking scales, in this case, further exploration of the mechanisms involved in their enzymes modulation and radical scavenging abilities is worth considering. Also, there is little clinical research on the bioactivity of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species, which practically limits their potential use as a pharmaceutical against diseases. More preclinical and clinical studies are needed if extracts or isolated compounds from 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species want to be used as biopharmaceutical agents. There is still a need for pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies to be able to determine if 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. is suitable for the development of a drug or herbal-based remedy; there is also a huge lack of studies regarding the effective doses of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. for prevention/treatment of the pathologies mentioned above. Also, there is an important flaw in the diversity of studies presented here, as the reports lack reproducibility because bioactivity studies use different concentrations of fruit, bark, and leaves 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts, nor they use the same plant parts.
