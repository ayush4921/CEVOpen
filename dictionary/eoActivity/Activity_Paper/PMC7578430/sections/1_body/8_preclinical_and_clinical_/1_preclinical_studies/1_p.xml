<p>There are currently few preclinical and clinical studies of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species, as far as our literature research. Out of the few reports, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ekambaram et al. (2018)</xref>, evaluated the acute toxicity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. fruit hydrolyzable tannin-rich methanolic extract, which did not exhibit any toxicity even at a dose administration of 5000 mg/kg/p.o. for 14 days. Thus, 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. fruit extracts can be considered as safe. HPLC analysis showed the presence of (53) chebulagic acid, (5) corilagin, and (9) chebulinic acid. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts significantly affected some biochemical parameters in both male and female rats, which cause a reduction in body weight. This effect could be attributed to the relationship between high tannin content in 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts and their influence on decreased feed intake, growth rate, feed efficiency, net metabolizable energy, and protein digestibility (
