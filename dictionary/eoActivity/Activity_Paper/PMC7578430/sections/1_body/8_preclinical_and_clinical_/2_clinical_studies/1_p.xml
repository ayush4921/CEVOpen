<p>Clinical studies regarding the potential bioactivities of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species are scarce, which limits its potential use as a biopharmaceutical agent against several diseases. Here we briefly summarize the available reports. C. U. 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. (2015)</xref>, performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross over study to evaluate the analgesic activity and safety of a single oral administration of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. using a hot air pain model in 14 healthy human participants (18–45 years old). The authors administered a single dose of two capsules of 500 mg of an aqueous extract of fruits of 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz., which contained no less than 15% (9) chebulinic acid, 10% of (53) chebulagic acid and not less than 15% of other low molecular weight hydrolyzable tannins. 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. increased the mean percentage change of pain threshold time and pain tolerance time compared to placebo treatments. This effect was mainly attributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of (3) gallic acid, (4) ellagic acid, and (5) corilagin from extracts of fruits of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. and the anti-arthritic effect of the hydrolyzable tannins of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp.
