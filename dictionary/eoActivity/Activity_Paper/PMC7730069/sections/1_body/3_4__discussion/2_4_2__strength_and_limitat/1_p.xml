<p>This systematic review is among the first to describe in detail the in vitro and in vivo studies on the efficacy of baicalein extracted from 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> medicinal plant against various human communicable and non-communicable diseases. It prioritises the therapeutic potential of the selected active constituents (particularly baicalein only) whilst various other studies focus on the whole plant crude extract (mixture of different types of active compounds). Thus, this review has a huge advantage in providing the knowledge gap on the baicalein extracted from 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic>, which can be used as a reference for new research to support the efficacy of this particular active compound instead of the mixture of different unidentified active compounds as a novel therapeutic agent against human diseases. This review study also identified several limitations. Several articles reviewed in this study did not clearly state the proper methodology of the plant extraction and the final percentage of baicalein in the extract, and hence restricted future studies to reproduce the same extract. Furthermore, there is still insufficient clinical evidence to draw a definitive conclusion on the efficacy and safety of this active compound for patient usage.
