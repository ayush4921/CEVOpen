<p>Based on this review, we suggest for more in-depth clinical investigations of this complementary therapy to develop evidence-based medicine in the future. Moreover, detailed consensus on extraction method, phytochemistry as well as the toxicological aspects should be developed to maintain the reproducibility and accuracy of the overall development of this active compound as a novel lead agent for human diseases therapy. Last but not least, we also suggest that conservation of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> plant should be done on a large scale through both in-situ and ex-situ methods in order to save this precious plant for the benefit of mankind.
