<p>In their subsequent study, they described further detail regarding the effects of different extraction methods (ethanol extract vs. water extract) on the antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As reported, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> fruits ethanol extract against four types of clinical isolated bacteria namely: 
 <italic>S. intermedius, S. suis, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were 1.30, 7.81, 39.20, and 66.85 mg/mL respectively, while the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> fruits water extract against these four types of bacteria were 7.81, &gt;250, &gt;125, and &gt;250 mg/mL respectively. This indicated that ethanol extract showed higher potential as an antibacterial agent than the water extract. This was because the flavonoid content (including baicalein) was found to be significantly higher in the ethanol extract compared to water extract (based on the optimized and validated HPLC data). In brief, their findings highlighted that the antibacterial potential of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract was highly correlated to the biological activities of flavonoids such as baicalein. The higher the baicalein content, the higher the antibacterial potential exhibited by the 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extracts.
