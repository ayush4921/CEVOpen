<p>Furthermore, application of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> stem bark ethanol extract by Lalrinzuali et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] on deep dermal excision wound also proved the claim that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> aids in the wound healing process. Topical application of the extract reduced the mean healing time by approximately eight days for 5% and 10% ethanolic extract when compared to the non-treated group. Wound contraction for the 10% ethanolic extract-treated group was better than the standard drug-treated group and the rise of collagen synthesis was almost 3.5-fold higher for ethanolic extracts treated group when compared to a non-treated group. The DNA and collagen synthesis also increased significantly in the regenerating wound tissue, indicating rise in fibroblast proliferation. This led to earlier closure of the wound and reduced wound healing time. The western blot analyses also revealed that the 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract showed suppression of NF-ÎºB and COX-II (in a dose dependent manner up to 10% ethanolic extract when compared to non-treated control. These reports clearly shown that the increased wound healing ability by 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract could be due to its ability to suppress the expression of genes related to proinflammatory cytokines which would hasten the early healing and closure of excision wounds [
