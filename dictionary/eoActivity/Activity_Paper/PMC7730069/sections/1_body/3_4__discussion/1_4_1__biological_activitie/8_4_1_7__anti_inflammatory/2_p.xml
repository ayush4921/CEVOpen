<p>NF-κB is a transcription factor which regulates multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immune functions and serves as a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses. It participate in inflammatory response by inducing the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.), chemokines (e.g., IL-8, MIP-1α, eotaxin, etc.), adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM, VCAM, E-selectin), inducible enzymes (COX-2 and iNOS), growth factors, and immune receptors [
