 <italic>Limonia acidissima</italic> Groff (Kapittha), 
 <italic>Cassia siamea</italic> Lam. (Kassod), 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> (Roxb.) Buch.-Ham. (Kiratatikta), 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic> (L.) Kurz (Shyonaka), 
 <italic>Carissa carandas</italic> Linn. (Karamarda) and 
 <italic>Capparis decidua</italic> (Forssk.) Edgew. (Karir). Out of these six plant species, 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> which contained baicalein showed the highest pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity and lowest lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocyte culture, indicating the great potential of this plant to be developed as herbs against obesity.
