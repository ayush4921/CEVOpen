<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by high levels of glucose in blood (hyperglycemia). The effect of baicalein on glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity to prevent hyperglycemia was investigated by Singh and Kakkar [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] who reported that 50% aqueous ethanolic 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> stem bark which contained baicalein showed anti-hyperglycemia effects in vitro (3T3-L1 adipocytes cell line) and in vivo (diabetic rat models) via the inhibition of α-glucosidase activity. The main function of α-glucosidase enzyme is to catalyze hydrolysis of dietary carbohydrates and starches to produce glucose for intestinal absorption [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, inhibiting the function of these enzymes may delay the glucose production following dietary digestion, which in turn reduces hyperglycemia. In the study, it was found that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract exhibited α-glucosidase inhibition effect comparable to clinically used standard α-glucosidase inhibitor known as acarbose [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This finding was further supported by another study which reported that administration of 4 mg/kg acarbose (low dose) combined with 200 mg/kg 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> seed extract showed a blood glucose lowering effect in diabetic mice similar to animal group that received 20 mg/kg of acarbose (high dose) single treatment only [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These data indicated that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract could enhance the efficacy of acarbose by up to five-fold (as it could reduce acarbose dosage from high dose 20 mg/kg to low dose 4 mg/kg) when injected simultaneously (combined 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> + acarbose) into diabetic mice. Moreover, the synergistic effect of combined 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> + acarbose treatment also was observed in prediabetic mice model as reported by Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Prediabetes is defined as blood glucose levels above normal level but yet still below the diabetes threshold. It is an initial period of type 2 DM and up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes if left untreated [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The pathophysiological defect seen in prediabetes can be managed with lifestyle and diet modifications, thus it is essential to have a clearer understanding of the benefit of herbs diet such as 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> in preventing the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. In the study done by Sun et al., the effects of acarbose and 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> seed extract combination on glucose tolerance and diabetic complications were investigated in rat models at initial period of type 2 DM (the prediabetic model). The combination treatment showed higher synergistic hypoglycaemic activity than acarbose single treatment by reducing 80% of the acarbose dose and 75% of the diabetes risk [
