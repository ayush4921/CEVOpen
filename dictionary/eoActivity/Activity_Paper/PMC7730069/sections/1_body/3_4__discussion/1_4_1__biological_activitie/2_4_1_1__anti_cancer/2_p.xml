<p>Firstly, according to Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], baicalein treatment at doses of 5 mg/mL for 72 h inhibits bladder cancer cell viability via a marked reduction of anti-apoptotic genes such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and survivin. Bcl-2, encoded by the BCL2 gene, is a regulator protein that induces apoptosis (pro-apoptotic protein). Bcl-2 and its pro-survival relative, Bcl-xL, are known to protect cells from apoptosis [

These proteins are highly expressed in most types of cancer cell and are associated with a poor clinical cancer treatment outcome [

The overexpression of these four proteins in cancer cells may block or delay the onset of apoptosis by selecting and maintaining the long-living cancer cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, the ability of baicalein treatment to mediate the reduction of these anti-apoptotic gene expressions in bladder cancer cells as reported by Yang et al. [
