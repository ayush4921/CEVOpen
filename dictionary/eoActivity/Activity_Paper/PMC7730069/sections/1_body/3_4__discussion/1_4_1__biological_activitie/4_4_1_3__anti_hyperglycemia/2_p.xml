<p>The synergistic effect of the combined 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> and acarbose treatment is beneficial as this could reduce the toxicity side effects caused by large doses of single-use pharmaceutical acarbose drug in diabetes management. Although acarbose was the first efficient drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diabetic and pre-diabetic treatment, it was recently reported associated with several adverse effects. Hepatic side effects are the major side effects of acarbose [

 <italic>O. indicum</italic> + acarbose treatment which has low toxicity could hinder the side effects of increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as seen in the acarbose single treatment group [

Normally, ALT levels are low in blood, but when the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood and the level increases. Therefore, the detection of ALT level in blood is a reliable test for early detection of liver disease. Microscopically, the study also revealed that the combined treatment group has little liver cellular swelling or hepatic steatosis as compared to acarbose single treatment group, indicating that the combined drugs have the potential to restore and repair the liver structure and function significantly [
