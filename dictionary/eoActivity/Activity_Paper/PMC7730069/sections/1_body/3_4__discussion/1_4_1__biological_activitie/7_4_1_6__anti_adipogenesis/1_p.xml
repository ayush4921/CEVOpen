<p>Adipocyte formation, also known as adipogenesis, plays a central role in the development of obesity. Tanaporn et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> fruit pods which contained baicalein was able to inhibit lipid and carbohydrate accumulation in adipocytes. Treatment of 200 μg/mL 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> ethanolic extract significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation by approximately 52%, compared to the non-treated adipocyte (control). Staining with Oil Red O and hematoxylin revealed that untreated adipocytes displayed an increase in size and number of prominent lipid droplets while 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract-treated adipocytes exhibited smaller size and reduced number of lipid droplets. Furthermore, the study also found that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract showed potential to inhibit pancreatic lipase activity. Pancreatic lipase is an enzyme to mediate the digestion of dietary fats (triglycerides), the uptake of fats into various tissues, and the mobilization of fats inside cells. Dietary triglycerides must be cleaved into free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols before they are absorbed by cells. Thus, when lipase activity is inhibited, it will lead to a decrease in the uptake of lipids into the human body (anti-adipogenesis effect) [

More importantly, the researchers also confirmed the non-toxicity effect of this extract on pre- and mature adipocytes at low doses (50–200 ug/mL), assuring the safety of taking this traditional supplement as a diet plan for the management of overweight or obese.
