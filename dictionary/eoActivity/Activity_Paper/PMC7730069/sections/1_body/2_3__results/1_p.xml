<p>Study selection: The primary search identified 218 articles, including 31 from PubMed, 119 from Science Direct and 68 from Scopus. First 100 hits from the ‘Most Relevant’ option in Google Scholar were also added. Among these, 207 documents were published in languages other than English or not a research article and were therefore excluded from the review. In addition, 32 manuscripts were indexed in two or more databases and were considered only once, resulting in 79 eligible articles. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, followed by a full text analysis and validation, 20 articles were included in this systematic review. The year of publication for each of these articles is listed in
