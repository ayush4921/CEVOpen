  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>The present trial aimed to investigate invitro anthelminthic activities of selected tropical tanniferous plant extract on egg hatchability and larval development inhibition of 
   <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> in sheep. In view of that, three tropical tanniferous plants 
   <italic>Rhus glutinosa, Syzygium guineensa</italic> and 
   <italic>Albizia gumifera,</italic> were selected based on their relative high content of condensed tannins.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>In this study, eggs were collected from artificially infected with 
   <italic>H. contortus</italic>. Then the egg was directly subjected to invitro assay with these condensed tannin-enriched extracts using egg hatchability assay and inhibition of larval development assay.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The result showed that extracts from all three tropical tanniferous plants demonstrated statistically significant (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) dosedependent inhibition of both egg hatchability and larval development. According to IC
   <sub>50</sub> and IC
   <sub>90</sub> values, the condensed tannin-enriched extracts inhibiting egg hatching and larval development most potently were 
   <italic>Rhus glutinosa</italic> followed in descending order of activity by 
   <italic>Syzygium guineensa</italic> and 
   <italic>Albizia gumifera.</italic>

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>The result of this study showed that these condensed tanninenriched extracts were effective in inhibiting egg hatchability as well as larval development. Therefore, condensed tannin might be recommended as one of the options for the control of 
   <italic>H. contortus</italic> in sheep.
