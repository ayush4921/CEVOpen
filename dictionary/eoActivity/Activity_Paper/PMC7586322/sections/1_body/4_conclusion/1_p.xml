<p>All three condensed tannin extracts demonstrated various degrees, yet very close dose-dependent inhibition of both egg hatchability and larval development. According to IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub> values, the condensed tannin inhibiting egg hatching and larval development most potently was. 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> followed in descending order of activity by 
 <italic>S. guineensa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic>. The result of the present study suggests that condensed tannins might be used as an option for the control of
