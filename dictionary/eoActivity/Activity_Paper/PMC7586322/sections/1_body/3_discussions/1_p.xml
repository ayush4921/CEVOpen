<p>The present study was aimed at investigating the direct effects of condensed tannins on egg hatchability and larval development inhibition of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> of sheep. In view of that, three indigenous medicinal plants were selected for this study based on their relatively high content of condensed tannins. The effect of condensed tannin extracts which was demonstrated in our study is in accord with a series of in vitro studies that supported the anthelminthic property of condensed tannins.
