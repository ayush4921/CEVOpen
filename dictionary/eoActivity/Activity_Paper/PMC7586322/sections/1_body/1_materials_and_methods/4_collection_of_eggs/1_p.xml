<p>Briefly, fecal pellets were collected from the rectum of donor sheep and placed in a small bucket. Warm water was slowly added to the feces and the pellets stirred until a relatively liquid suspension was obtained. The suspension was mashed through a sieve with 3 mm aperture. The suspension that passed through the sieve was collected and washed through 100-mesh (150 im pore size) sieve. The suspension was then poured in to 15 mL test tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 RPM and the supernatant decanted. The tube was agitated by vortex mixer to loosen the sediment. Saturated sodium chloride was then added to the test tube until the meniscus forms above the tube on which the cover slip was placed. After 5 min the cover slip was carefully taken off the tube and the eggs washed in glass centrifuge tubes, filled with water and centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 RPM. Most of the water was then decanted and the number of eggs diluted to the required concentration for use in egg hatch assay (EHA), and larval development test (LDT).</p>
