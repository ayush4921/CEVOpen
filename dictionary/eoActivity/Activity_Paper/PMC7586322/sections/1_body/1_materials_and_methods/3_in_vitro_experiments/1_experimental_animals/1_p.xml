<p>Two sheep of a local breed (Menz sheep) were treated with a single dose of commercial anthelminthic Levamizole (Manufacturer and country of Producer) at a dose of 10 mg/mL body weight (REF) and kept indoors at the Bahirdar University College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine (BUCAVM) farm. The absences of gastrointestinal parasites in feces of treated sheep were verified microscopically. The animals were examined for nematode fecal egg production on the third and sixth days post anthelmintic treatment and all were negative for parasite eggs on the sixth day post treatment. Each animal was inoculated orally with 1750

 <sub>3</sub> on the seventh day. The infective larvae were obtained by culturing 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> eggs collected from the previously mentioned two mono-species infected donor sheep. Eggs were collected after 4 weeks of infection and the eggs per gram were determined daily. The concentrations of eggs were estimated by counting the number of eggs in aliquots of 50 ÂµL by the McMaster slide technique, as described by Cole.
