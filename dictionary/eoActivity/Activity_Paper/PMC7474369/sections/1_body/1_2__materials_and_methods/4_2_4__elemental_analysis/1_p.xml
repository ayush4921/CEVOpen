<p>Plants were collected, shade-dried, and ground to powder. For the quantitative analysis of macro- and microelements, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Model Perkin Elmer AA Analyst 700) was used which is installed in the Centralized Resource Laboratory, University of Peshawar. 0.5 gram of each plant powder was placed on stub, which was grip in the sample holder. The sample holder was laid inside the stage, and the elements' peaks were observed through display (

All the data in the raw data worksheet were copied to an edited worksheet where unnecessary data columns were deleted. Also, unnecessary element row lines were removed, leaving the calculated averages as the final concentration data.
