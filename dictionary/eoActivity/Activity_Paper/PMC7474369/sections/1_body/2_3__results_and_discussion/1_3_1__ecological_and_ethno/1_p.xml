<p>During the present research work, 5 plant species of Lamiaceae were collected from the study area which were investigated for their various biological aspects such as phenology, life form, leaf shape, leaf size, and ethnobotanical uses along with phytochemical and elemental screening. During collection time, the phenological stage of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species was pre-reproductive, while 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> were at reproductive and postreproductive stages (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sixty percent species were therophytes, and 20% were each chamaephytes and geophytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The biological leaf spectra showed that 60% species had nanophyllous and 40% had microphyllous leaves (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All the species had a simple leaf shape. Ethnobotanical profile showed that a majority of plant species were used in spices and had medicinal and ornamental importance (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Various parts of the plants contained active constituents such as menthol, menthone, and rosmarinic acids which are used as antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiuretic agents (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], where both reported that these species were used as antioxidant, antidiuretic, and antimicrobial agents.
