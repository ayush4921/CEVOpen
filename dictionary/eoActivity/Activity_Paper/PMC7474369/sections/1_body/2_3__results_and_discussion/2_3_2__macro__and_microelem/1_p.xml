<p>All the plant species had high mineral contents and can be used as a good source for medicines (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). A total of 13 different elements were quantitatively analyzed in all the five plant species. Among the major elements, carbon was maximum (70.25%) in 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and minimum (56.2%) in 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>, while only nitrogen was absent in 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>. In minor elements, chlorine was found highest (1.09%) in 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> and lowest (0.19%) in 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and

 <italic>. O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> had high calcium content which plays a key role in bone formation [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> had the highest potassium concentration which plays a key part of many enzymes' synthesis and plays a vital role in the activation of growth of enzymes [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Arika et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Gogoasa et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] had reported C, N, O, Mg, K, P, S, Ca, Al, Si, Fe, Cl, and Na elements in 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> species, and in 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> species.
