<p id="Par54">Hence, this study is an attempt toward the preservation of traditional ethnoveterinary knowledge. There are several medicinal plants, which are being used in the traditional herbal system for veterinary disorders. Some of these important plants are 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Berberis diaphana</italic>, 
 <italic>Sophora tonkinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Verbena officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Mahonia fortunei</italic>, 
 <italic>Ardisia crispa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aesculus chinensis</italic>. The ethnoveterinary uses of 
 <italic>Talinum paniculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aesculus chinensis</italic> were newly recorded from the prefecture. Compositae is the largest plant family in use for various livestock ailments. Thorough phytochemical and pharmacological investigations are required, by isolating its active compounds and testing for in vitro or in vivo efficacy of the abovementioned plants against the targeted veterinary diseases. Furthermore, critical toxicological investigations are also required to ensure safe and secure use of the documented ethnomedicines. In order to share and further maintain this knowledge, it is necessary to share and disseminate ethnoveterinary knowledge locally, both within and between communities. In some cases, inexpensive allopathic treatments may exist where no effective ethnoveterinary treatments can be verified. Finally, it is important to make ethnoveterinary medicine and knowledge an integral part of modern animal health care in the Buyi areas.
