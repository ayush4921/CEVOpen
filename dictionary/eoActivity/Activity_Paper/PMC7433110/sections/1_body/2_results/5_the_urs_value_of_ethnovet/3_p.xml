 <italic>Asarum heteropoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Alisma plantago</italic>-
 <italic>aquatica</italic>, and peel pomegranate (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>). Published literature has indicated that the plant is also used for fever, cough, hepatoma cells, and mycoplasma gallisepticum infections [
