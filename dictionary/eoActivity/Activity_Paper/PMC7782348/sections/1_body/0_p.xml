 <italic>Lindera pulcherrima</italic> (Nees) J. D. Hooker (Lauraceae), a dominant evergreen tree in shady forests, is an important medicinal plant distributed in southern China, Nepal, and India. The active compounds contained in 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> have good anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor pharmacological activities (Joshi and Mathela 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>hemsleyana</italic> is distinguished with other two varieties, 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>attenuate</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>pulcherrima</italic>, for its elliptic leaf blade, glabrous ovary, and glabrous young fruits (Tsui et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). The leaves and bark are used as a spice in cold, fever, and cough (Joshi and Mathela 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Its quality wood is widely used in furniture and architecture. Though phylogenic studies on Lauraceae were conducted, some taxonomic controversies on intra-generic relationship of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> as well as the inter-generic relationship with allied genera were still unsolved (Tian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
