<p>The whole chloroplast genome was extracted from the fresh leaves of a healthy

 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), it was collected from the natural habitats of Yongshan County (28°05′13.20″N, 103°35′38.40″E), Yunnan province, China. The voucher specimen (ELK-254) was deposited in the Herbarium of Yunnan Normal University (YNUB). Paired-end reads were sequenced by using Illumina HiSeq 2500-PE150 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All raw reads were filtered through NGS QC toolkit_v2.3.3 to get clean reads with default parameters (Patel and Jain 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The NOVOPlasty was used to de novo assemble the clean reads to form the chloroplast genome (Dierckxsens et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The assembled structures and genes of the complete cp genome were annotated with Geneious 20.0.3 (Kearse et al.
