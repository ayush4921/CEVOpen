<p>The chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>hemsleyana</italic> (GenBank accession no.: MT801093) was a quadripartite circular with 152,710 bp in size with total GC content 39.2%. A pair of inverted repeat (IR) region (20,073 bp) separated the large single copy (LSC) region (93,751 bp) and small single copy (SSC) region (18,813 bp). The GC content of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions is 38.0%, 33.9%, and 44.4%, respectively. There are 128 genes predicted, including 81 protein-coding genes, 36 tRNA genes, eight rRNA genes, and one pseudogene (
 <italic>ycf1</italic>). IMEx (Mudunuri and Nagarajaram 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) was used to identify the SSRs with minimum repeat number set to 10, 5, 4, 3, 3, and 3. A total of 90 SSRs were discovered, the numbers of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotides nucleotides SSRs were 66, 10, 4, 8, 1, and 1, respectively.
