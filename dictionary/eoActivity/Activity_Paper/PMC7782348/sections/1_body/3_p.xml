<p>In order to understand the phylogenetic relationship between 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>hemsleyana</italic> and related taxa of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic>, 19 taxa of 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> and five species of Subfamily Lauroideae that are downloaded from NCBI as outgroups were used to construct a molecular phylogenetic tree. Twenty-four cp genomes were aligned by MAFFT 7.308 (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed with RAxML 8.2.11 (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) under the nucleotide substitution model of GTR + G. The bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 replicates analysis. The phylogenetic topology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) of 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> is consistent with the morphological delimitation of this species. 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>hemsleyana</italic> and other two varieties formed one monophyletic clade with 100% bootstrap value. The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> var. 
 <italic>hemsleyana</italic> will provide useful genetic resource for further study on phylogeny of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> and Lauraceae.
