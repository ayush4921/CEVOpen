<p>The top two ligands showing interaction with Mpro (revealed through docking analysis) were further subjected to 20 ns MD simulation studies. The energy and structural properties of the ligand-receptor complexes were determined through Gromacs 5.1.4 simulation package using CHARMM force field. The protein-ligand complex was inserted into a cubic box of 10 Å dimension and solvated using SPCE water model and the system was neutralized by adding counter ions (0.15 M NaCl). An initial minimization of 1000-step was carried out by applying steepest descent algorithm followed by 2000-step using conjugate gradient minimization. The system was gradually heated to 300 K for 100 ps and then equilibrated using NVT ensemble for 100 ps and retained at constant temperature. Sequentially, the system was equilibrated using NPT ensemble for 1000 ps. MD production run for 20 ns was performed with a time step of 2 ps and the trajectories were recorded at every step (Beema Shafreen et al.,
