<p>The study focuses predominantly on bioactive ligands from ten traditional medicinal plants that are primarily used in the treatment of respiratory illness. The active components were selected and screened against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, spike (S) protein and host cell ACE2 receptor. The list of active leads used in the present study is shown in
