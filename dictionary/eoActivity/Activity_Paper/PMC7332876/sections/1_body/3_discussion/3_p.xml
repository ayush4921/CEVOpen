<p>Orientin possesses wide range of pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, antiaging, antibacterial, anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, cardioprotective, radioprotective, neuroprotective, antidepressant, anticancer and thrombocytopenia activities (Lam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Sharma et al., 2016; Yadav et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). It has also been documented for antiviral activity against parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV-3) (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Like Orientin, the compound Vitexin was also reported for multiple drug targets including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antihyperalgesic and neuroprotective effects (He et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It has also been reported for antiviral activity against several viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Hepatitis A Virus (HAV-H10), PIV-3 and rotavirus (Fahmy et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Knipping et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Bryonolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoids, exhibits biological activities such as antiallergic, antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (Gatbonton-Schwager et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Khallouki et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tanaka et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). An aporphine alkaloid, Magnoflorine, has been reported for antidiabetic and anticancer property (Patel &amp; Mishra, 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition, Magnoflorine has been previously reported for their antiviral effects against HSV-1 and poliovirus type-1 (Mohamed et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Berberine, an organic hetero pentacyclic compound has been reported for numerous therapeutic values such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrhea, antilipemic, antibiofilm, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective and glucose metabolism (Neag et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Zhang &amp; Shen, 
 <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Most importantly, it has been reported for antiviral activity against numerous viruses such as influenza virus (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), enterovirus 71 (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), human cytomegalovirus (Hayashi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), hepatitis C virus (Hung et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), HSV-1 (Dkhil &amp; Al-Quraishy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and chikungunya virus (Varghese et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Besides, it has been proven to be an antibacterial agent against multiple drug resistance bacteria such as methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (Chu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Peng et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and antifungal agent against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. (Xie et al.,
