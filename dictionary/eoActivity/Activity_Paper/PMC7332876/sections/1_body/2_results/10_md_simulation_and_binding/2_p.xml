<p>MM-PBSA is the most reliable method for predicting the binding interaction between protein-drug complexes. The binding free energy for Cucurbitacin E and Orientin was −152.96 and −123.62 kcal/mol respectively. The binding energies obtained from MD trajectories further confirms the accommodation of inhibitors into the druggable pocket of Mpro. Moreover, the binding pocket with polar microenvironment reinforces the strong hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with the drug molecule and seizes them in the active site of Mpro. Overall, the results were suggestive that Mpro maintains a stable binding state with the inhibitors (Cucurbitacin E and Orientin) for plausible interactions.</p>
