<p>Among the ligands screened through docking studies, Cucurbitacin E and Orientin revealed significant interaction with most critical residues of Mpro with high binding affinities. Therefore, these two compounds were selected as the best inhibitors and used for further analysis. MD simulation of 20 ns was performed for the two selected drug molecules to get deep insights into the stability of the Mpro-drug complex. The overall stability was determined through RMSD and RMSF analysis. The energy profile in the presence and absence of ligands were computed during 20 ns MD simulation. Wherein, the potential energy profile of the system was found to be stable throughout the simulation and the lowest energy profile in the presence of ligands indicates that the system is considerably stable than in the absence of ligand (

Mpro in the absence of drug molecule maintained the steady state throughout the simulation with an average RMSD value of 3.71 Å, indicating the convergence of the system during 20 ns simulation. However, Mpro in complex with drug molecules exhibited little variations during the simulation run (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Orientin presented an average RMSD of 4.6 Å whereas Cucurbitacin E presented an average RMSD of 4.9 Å. Although, the system started with increasing RMSD profile, it favored to equilibrium state after 2 ns and successfully maintained the stable state throughout the remaining simulation run (

In fact, these structural fluctuations reveal the binding and interaction of the drug molecules with the protein motif. RMSF analysis of Mpro in the presence of ligand unveiled the fluctuating residues at 1–12, 128–146 and 185–192 amino acid regions corresponding to the loop region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>) of Mpro. The average RMSF value for Mpro was found to be 1.53 Å revealing that there was little fluctuation in the loop region during MD run. However, Mpro in complex with Cucurbitacin E and Orientin was found to have high fluctuation in the druggable pocket with an average RMSF value of 2.10 Å and 1.79 Å, respectively. The Mpro-Cucurbitacin E complex was found to have significant fluctuation with the catalytic residues (Cys145) of Mpro in comparison to Orientin. Since, Cys145 resides in the loop region, the fluctuations are favorable and advantageous in accommodating the drug molecule at the receptor site.
