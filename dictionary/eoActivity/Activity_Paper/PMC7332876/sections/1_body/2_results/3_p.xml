<p>Vitexin, an apigenin flavone glycoside, was found to have the binding energy of −85.7 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and the dock score of −98.03 during the interaction with main protease. The strong affinity was explicable from six hydrogen bonds formed with six residues of main protease (Phe140, Ser144, Cys145, Asn142, Leu167 and Gln189). Vitexin-Mpro complex was stabilized by pi-anion (Cys145), pi-sulfur (Glu166), pi-lone pair (Asn142), pi-pi T-shaped (His41) and pi-alkyl (Met165) interactions. The van der Waals and H-bond energy was found to be −72.97 and −12.71 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Vitexin docked with spike protein reported −98.34 and −67.7 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> as docking and binding energy score, respectively. It formed four hydrogen bonds with four residues (Tyr28, Asn30, Phe59 and Asn61) and one carbon hydrogen bond with Thr29. The conformation had the van der Waals and H-bond energy of −57.78 and −9.93, respectively. ACE2 receptor with Vitexin had a docking and binding energy score of −85.24 and −68.1 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Conformational stability of the complex (Vitexin-ACE2) is maintained by hydrogen bond (two hydrogen bonds from Glu22 and Asn90), van der Waals (Lys26, Leu29, Gln89 and Gln96) and pi-alkyl interactions (Val93 and Lys 94). H-bond and van der Waals energy was found to be −57.61 and −10.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
