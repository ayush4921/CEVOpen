<p>Besides, the compound Cucurbitacin E, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B and Piperine had strong binding affinity to main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Cucurbitacin E was the top scorer among the main protease inhibitors. It had the highest binding energy score of −91.0 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> with a dock score of −113.4. The H-bond and van der Waals interactions energy was found to be −19.48 and −71.53 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It formed two conventional hydrogen bond interactions with Asn142 and Cys145 and one carbon hydrogen bond with Ser46. Besides, it had alkyl and pi-alkyl interaction with Met49, His41, Cys44 and His163. The compounds Cucurbitacin B and Isocucurbitacin B had similar kind of pi-alkyl and alkyl interactions as Cucurbitacin E. But in case of conventional hydrogen bond interactions both lacked Cys145 interactions. In addition, Isocucurbitacin B lacked carbon hydrogen bond interaction with Ser46. Notably, Cucurbitacin B formed a specific conventional hydrogen bond with Thr25.
