<p>Magnoflorine docked with main protease showed a binding energy score of −77 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and a dock score of −92.41. It formed six hydrogen bonds with four amino acids (Leu141, Asn142, Ser144 and Cys145). Besides, it also forms carbon hydrogen bond with Phe140, His163 and Glu166 and pi-donor hydrogen bond with Cys145. The extra stabilizing interaction associated with ligand and main protease complex includes pi-cation interaction with His41, pi-alkyl interaction with Leu27 and Cys145 and pi-sigma interaction with His41. The van der Waals and H-bond interaction energy was −64.02 and −12.98 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Magnoflorine with spike protein has a dock score of −90.88, binding energy score of −65.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>and van der Waals and H-bond interactions score of −57.44 and −8.02 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It formed conventional hydrogen bonds with Asn61 and carbon hydrogen and pi-donor hydrogen bond with Tyr28. Other significant interactions comprise pi-sigma (Tyr28) and pi-pi stacked (Tyr28) interactions. Magnoflorine with ACE2 receptors exhibited a docking score of −95.46, binding energy score of −64.4 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, H-bond and van der Waals interaction scores of −15.52 and −48.90 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It formed two hydrogen bond interactions with Thr27 and Leu29 and carbon hydrogen bond with Val93 and Glu22. Other energetic contribution includes pi-cation (Lys26 and Glu22) and pi-alkyl (Leu29 and Val23) interactions. In addition, it formed electrostatic interaction with Lys26 and Glu22, thereby stabilizing the complex formed.
