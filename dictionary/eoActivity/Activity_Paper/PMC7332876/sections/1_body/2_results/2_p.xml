<p>Among 47 bioactives used in the study, Orientin, a C-glycosyl compound, showed the highest binding affinity with main protease with a dock score of −134.14 and binding energy of −90.2 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>-IB). It formed seven conventional hydrogen bonds with five residues (Thr26, His41, Gly143, Cys145 and Glu 166). These hydrogen bond interactions indeed enhance the binding affinity of the complex by stabilizing the ligand at the active site of the target and thereby help in increasing the biological activity of the complex. Notably, among the active site residues the catalytic dyad of main protease (His41 and Cys145) was mainly involved in hydrogen bond interactions. These interactions are expected to prevent the virus from processing polyprotein which consequently hinder the viral replication. The other interactions that stabilizes the Orientin and main protease complex includes pi-pi stacked interaction with His163, pi-pi T-shaped interaction with His41, pi-alkyl interaction with Cys145, pi-sulfur interaction with Met49. In addition, the residue Asn142 formed a pi-donor hydrogen bond with the ligand molecule. The conformation had the van der Waals and H-bond energy of −63.65 and −26.58 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. All these crucial interactions facilitate in augmenting the efficacy of the drug molecules by stabilizing the binding structures. Orientin docked with spike protein (6VYB) revealed the docking and binding energy score of −110.05 and −72.3 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Besides, it formed six hydrogen bond interactions with four amino acids (Tyr28, Asn30, Phe59 and Asn61) and one carbon-hydrogen bond with Thr29. H-bond and van der Waals interaction energies were found to be −13.23 and −59.02 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Similarly, Orientin docked with ACE2 receptor revealed the docking and binding energy score of −101.17 and −70.6 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The binding affinity was associated with five hydrogen bond interactions formed by three residues (Glu22, Lys26 and Asn90), one carbon hydrogen bond interaction with Glu22 and pi-alkyl interaction with Lys94. The structure possesses van der Waals and H-bond interactions energy of −58.84 and −11.76 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
