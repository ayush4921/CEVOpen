<p id="Par14">Previous reviews have described the in vitro and in vivo potencies of compounds that have been isolated from African floral matter published data before 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These reviews had previously described over 500 NPs, within the major NP classes, including alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, phenolics, polyacetylenes, xanthones, quinones, steroids, and lignans. These compounds were described in the literature as exhibiting from weak to very good in vitro anti-malarial activities, based on well-established cut-off values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Besides, a cheminformatic analysis of the aforementioned dataset, with a focus on molecular descriptors related to “drug-likeness”, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and some rules of thumb such as the Lipinski “Rule of Five” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], showed that over 50% of the anti-malarial compounds had physicochemical properties that fell within the range of “drug-like” molecules [
