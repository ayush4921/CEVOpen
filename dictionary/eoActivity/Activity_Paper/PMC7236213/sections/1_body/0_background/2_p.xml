<p id="Par13">Plants are known to be a rich reservoir of bioactive secondary metabolites (or natural products, NPs), for example, the anti-malarial drugs quinine and artemisinin (AT) are both of plant origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The benefits of plants containing bioactive anti-malarial compounds, particularly the bitter principles (alkaloids and terpenoids), include their use in the preparation of traditional remedies against malaria, fever, and inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, more than 80% of the local populations of most tropical countries, including African populations, are dependent on medicinal plants for the treatment of most diseases, including malaria, despite the current wide availability of standard malaria treatments for populations in the rural areas, as well as those in cities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has become of interest to summarize the major findings regarding the most promising secondary metabolites with proven in vitro and in vivo potencies, so as to pave the way for further development with compounds from African sources as leads for anti-malarial drug discovery. Recent reviews have either emphasized plants used in specific countries or regions for the treatment of malaria [
