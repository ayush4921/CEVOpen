<p id="Par81">Although recently published reviews have described the activities of anti-malarial secondary metabolites of terrestrial and marine origins, input data from African sources has not been the focal point. Tajuddeen and van Heerden recently published a review of 1524 natural compounds from around the world, which have been assayed against at least one strain of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, out of which 39% were described as new NPs, with 29% having IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ≤ 3.0 µM against at least one of the tested plasmodial strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. However, the study was limited to the period between 2010 and 2017 and did not include data from 2018 to 2019. Although the ability of NPs to block the transmission of malaria is still in the early stage, the current review, along with the previous studies that covers data for antiplasmodial compounds from African flora [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], could serve as the baseline data for the discovery of new anti-malarial compounds from Africa.
