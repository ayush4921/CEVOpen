<p id="Par80">In this review, an attempt has been made to document the anti-malarial/antiplasmodial activities of NPs derived from African medicinal plants in their various compound classes and source species, published between 2013 and 2019. A description of the in vitro and available in vivo activities for 187 compounds is shown, as well as their classification into the various known NP compound classes and plant families of origin. From the collected data, the most active compounds belong to the same compound classes as the malarial drugs of natural origin, e.g. the alkaloid class for quinine and the terpenoid class for artemisinin. A previous report from Titanji et al. [
