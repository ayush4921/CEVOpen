<p id="Par79">Raw data retrieved from the literature showed activities reported in diverse units. A classification of the compounds by potencies (after all measured IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were converted to μM), and taking a cut off of 10 μM for the most promising secondary metabolites most likely to be lead compounds. The most active compounds within this range for at least one plasmodial strain, i.e. 25 out of 66 NPs were alkaloids ~ (38%), while 23 of them were terpenoids ~ (35%) and 11 were quinones ~ (17%). Taking a cut off IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of at most 1 μM left us with 19 compounds, 14 of them being alkaloids. Besides, the majority of the 187 NPs were terpenoids (30%), followed by flavonoids (22%), alkaloids (19%) and quinones (15%), the rest of the compound classes only represent a negligible part of the current collection.
