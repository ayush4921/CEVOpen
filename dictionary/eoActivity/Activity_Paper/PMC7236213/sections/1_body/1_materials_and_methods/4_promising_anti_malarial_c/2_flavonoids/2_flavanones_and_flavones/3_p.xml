<p id="Par36">Azebaze et al. investigated the antiplasmodial activities of whole plant extracts of 
 <italic>Allanblackia floribunda</italic> from Cameroon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The biflavonoids 
 <bold>47</bold> and 
 <bold>48</bold> were isolated from the plant extract and exhibited in vitro antiplasmodial activities against the F32 and FcM29 strains. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 24 h and 72 h against the both strains were 21.13 and 6.03 µM; 22.59 and 8.61 µM for compound 
 <bold>47</bold> and 1.83 and 2.18 µM; 1.44 and 1.75 µM for compound 
 <bold>48</bold>, respectively [

 <bold>49</bold>) was isolated from the whole plant of 
 <italic>Peperomia vulcanica</italic> by Ngemenya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. This compound showed antiplasmodial activity against the multidrug-resistant W2mef and Dd2 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 19.36 and 3.18 µM.
