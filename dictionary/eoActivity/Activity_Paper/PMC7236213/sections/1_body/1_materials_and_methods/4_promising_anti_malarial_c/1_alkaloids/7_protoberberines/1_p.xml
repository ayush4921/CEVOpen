<p id="Par29">Maleba et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] showed that against the CQ-resistant K1 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protoberberine alkaloids are a subclass of promising anti-malarials. The in vitro testing of compounds 
 <bold>30</bold> to 
 <bold>33</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) showed that compound 
 <bold>30</bold> (palmatine) was the most active, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.23 μM. Jatrorrhizine (
 <bold>31</bold>) exhibited an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.71 μM, whereas a mixture of compound 
 <bold>31</bold> and columbamine (
 <bold>32</bold>) inhibited the plasmodial strain with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 μg/mL, and a mixture of compound 
 <bold>26</bold> and tetrahydro-palmatine (
 <bold>33</bold>) inhibited the parasite strain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.098 μg/mL, probably explaining the synergistic activity of this plant extract. This justifies its use in African Traditional Medicine for the treatment of malaria [
