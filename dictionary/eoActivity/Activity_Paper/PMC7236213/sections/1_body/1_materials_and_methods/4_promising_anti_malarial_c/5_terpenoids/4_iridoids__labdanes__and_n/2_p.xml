 <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref>) was isolated from the methanol leaf extract of the species by Endale et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The isolated compound 125 displayed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) anti-malarial activity at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg with chemosuppression values of 50.13, 65.58 and 73.16%, respectively. The previously reported norcassane furanoditerpene, norcaesalpin D (

 <italic>Caesalpinia bonducella</italic> (Caesalpiniaceae) from Tanzania by Nondo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. This compound was active with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.20 and 4.16 µM against the 3D7 and Dd2 strains, respectively [
