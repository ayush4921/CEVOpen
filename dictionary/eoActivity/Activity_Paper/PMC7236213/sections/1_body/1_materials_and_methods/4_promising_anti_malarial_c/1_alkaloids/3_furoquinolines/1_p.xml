<p id="Par22">Four furoquinoline alkaloids (

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were isolated from the fruits and leaves of 
 <italic>Teclea nobilis</italic> (Rutaceae) and tested on the chloroquine (CQ)-resistant FcB1/Colombia strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> by Lacroix et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This species from Uganda has been used to treat a range of ailments from pain and fever to malaria [

 <bold>3</bold>), and the known montrifoline (
 <bold>4</bold>), maculine (
 <bold>5</bold>), and skimmianine (
 <bold>6</bold>), were less potent than the reference drug CQ, showing inhibition against the tested parasite strain at &lt; 300 μM [
