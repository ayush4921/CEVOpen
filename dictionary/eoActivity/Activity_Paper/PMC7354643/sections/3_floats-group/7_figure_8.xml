  <p>Structures of dual BuChE/IDO1, ChE/PARP-1, and ChE/PDE inhibitors. While structure 
   <bold>22</bold> is inspired by Miconazole, Olaparib has been taken as the reference structure in the synthesis of MTDL 
   <bold>23</bold>, while Donepezil and Rivastigmine, coupled with the pyrazolopyrimidinone structure of a known PDE9A inhibitor led to the identification of compounds with general structures 
   <bold>24</bold> and 
   <bold>25</bold>.
