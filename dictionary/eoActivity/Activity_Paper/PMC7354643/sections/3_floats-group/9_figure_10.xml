  <p>The discovery of Donecopride (
   <bold>30</bold>) inspired by the 5-HT
   <sub>4</sub>R agonist RS67333 (
   <bold>29</bold>) and the structurally related MTDLs acting as ChE inhibitors and/or serotonin 5-HT
   <sub>4</sub> and 5-HT
   <sub>6</sub> receptor modulators (
   <bold>31</bold> and 
   <bold>32</bold>). The general structure 
   <bold>33</bold> has been added as a further modification of the scaffold of RS67333 and Donecopride, although its activity shifted from 5-HTRs to 
   <italic>Ïƒ</italic>1R.
