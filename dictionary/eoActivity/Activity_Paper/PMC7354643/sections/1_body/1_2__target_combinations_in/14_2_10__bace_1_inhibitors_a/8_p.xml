<p>Another nice example of quinoxaline-based molecules acting as BACE-1 inhibitors and useful to modulate inflammation has been reported by the same authors (
 <bold>50</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The new compounds were rationally designed to interact with BACE-1 over BACE-2 and to increase binding affinity for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thanks to the introduction of thiazole rings that could establish H-bonds with these enzymes' residues. All the analogues inhibited BACE-1 in the micromolar range, especially those with the unsubstituted amino functionality (R
 <sub>2</sub>=H). The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in carrageenan- and formalin-induced rat paw edema studies, respectively. At doses of 50â€‰mg/kg, the best performing compound showed an inhibition of the edema up to 69% and 55% in the two animal models, even though no 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 was measured. Having the required activity profile, the compounds were evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in behavioral tests, such as the Y-maze, conditioned avoidance response, and elevated plus maze. In all the tests, there were significant effects with reduction of the amnesic effect aroused from AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> injections, significant decrease in conditioned avoidance response, and improvement in spatial working memory. Additional antioxidant activity and a promising free radical scavenging effect were confirmed by lipid peroxidase (LPO) and SOD assays in rat brains, with a reduction in MDA levels compared to the control. For their potential as COX inhibitors, the safety on the gastrointestinal tract was checked, evidencing no damages but a minimal lesion in the gastric section. Merged together, BACE-1 inhibition and anti-inflammatory activity can promote beneficial effects on AD and the concomitant antioxidant and antiamyloid potentials observed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> made these structures interesting MTDLs.
