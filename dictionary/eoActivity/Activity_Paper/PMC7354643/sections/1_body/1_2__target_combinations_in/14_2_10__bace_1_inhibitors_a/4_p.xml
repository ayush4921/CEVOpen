<p>As additional modifications to the triazine core, compounds with general structure 
 <bold>48</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>) were reported [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Here, the introduction of the aryl phenoxymethyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety added further potential to display metal-chelating and antioxidant effects. In these hybrids, substituted phenyl groups replaced the two thiophene rings and the pendant aryl attached to the hydrazone functionality was also O-linked to the 1,2,3-triazole group. The compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit BACE-1, and when the Ar group was a propylisoindoline fragment, the highest potency was achieved, corresponding to an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 18 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (67.09% inhibition at 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). These tool compounds were evaluated in the DPPH and MTT assays, showing only mild activity as antioxidants and a moderate neuroprotective activity in PC12 cells treated with A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>25-35</sub>. However, the compound containing a pendant 4-nitrobenzyl group showed a higher antioxidant effect and was also able to chelate Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry.
