<p>In the series of triazine-based compounds [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], an interesting set of analogues was reported, bearing di-(thiophene-2-yl) substitutions and different aryl hydrazone moieties (
 <bold>47</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). Inspired by other previously reported cyclic guanidine MTDLs, the authors exploited the use of the thiophene rings to modulate the lipophilic characteristics of the compounds and to increase the interactions within the BACE-1 active site, while varying the aryl pendants linked to the hydrazone functionality in the search for antioxidant and radical scavenging potential. The series had good to moderate inhibitory activity against BACE-1, and after a nice evaluation of the SAR around the aryl pendants, the 2-indole-substituted analogue resulted in the most potent inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.69 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Also the hydroxylphenyl-substituted compounds were of interest, especially for the higher scavenging potential displayed in the DPPH assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, compared to quercetin, whose IC
 <sub>50</sub> value is 4.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The abovementioned 2-indole-substituted analogue resulted to be noncytotoxic in the PC12 neuronal cells in concentrations of up to 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and was selected for testing the metal-chelating activity, showing the ability to chelate Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+/3+</sup>, and Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>in different stoichiometries.
