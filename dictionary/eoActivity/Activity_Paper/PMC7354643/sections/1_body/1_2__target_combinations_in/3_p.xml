<p>In addition to the cholinergic deficit, the presence of extracellular A

 <italic>β</italic>-secretase beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) in the rate limiting step. Over the years, a great variety of BACE-1 inhibitors have been proposed and have entered clinical trials, highlighting the central role of this protease in AD [
