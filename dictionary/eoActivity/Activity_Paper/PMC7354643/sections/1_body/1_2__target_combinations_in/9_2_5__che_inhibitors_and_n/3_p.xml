<p>In both of the series, the new compounds retained the activities of the parent analogues on the primary targets, being AChE and BuChE inhibitors in the subnanomolar and submicromolar ranges, respectively, and binding to NMDA receptors in the micromolar range. Nevertheless, there was no activity on other proteins or targets associated with AD, as it was originally expected for the association of the two moieties. However, the increased potencies of some agents compared to the reference compounds represent a valid reason for a more in-depth evaluation in the anti-AD drug discovery field.</p>
