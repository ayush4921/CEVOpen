<p>In line with this hypothesis, a new series of benzohomoadamantane-chlorotacrine hybrids has been proposed as novel ChE inhibitors and brain penetrant antagonists for NMDARs. Following their previous knowledge in the development of THA-based AChE and BuChE inhibitors and polycyclic amines as antagonists of NMDA receptors, the authors exploited different linkers, varying their lengths and linkage positions, to connect the benzohomoadamantane motif with a 6-chlorotacrine (

 <bold>26</bold>) or by an additional amino group on the same system (
 <bold>27</bold>). This resulted in the identification of novel MTDLs, potentially able not only to inhibit ChEs and to antagonize NMDA receptors but also to interfere with BACE-1 activity and A
