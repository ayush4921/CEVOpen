<p>Structurally related to Donepezil on the benzylpiperidine side, compounds with general structure 
 <bold>17</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) represent another recent example of MTDL, where the properties of the parent compound on AChE have been retained and then extended to BACE-1 with the introduction of properly decorated aryl groups, linked via aminic- or iminic bonds [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. When this aryl group is represented by a 4-CF
 <sub>3</sub> substituted ring, both the amine and the imine resulted in submicromolar inhibitors of the human enzyme isoforms and were selected for further characterization. The 4-CF
 <sub>3</sub> substituent added higher potential to permeate through membranes, as confirmed with the PAMPA-BBB assay. The amine-based compound had also a significant effect in displacing propridium iodide from PAS-AChE, hence being more interesting for further progression. Probably due to its capacity to bind PAS-AChE, 5-20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M concentrations of this compound had antiaggregation properties not only on self-induced A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation but also on the AChE-induced one (50% and 89%, respectively). AFM studies confirmed the reduction of A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregates after the incubation with this agent. No neurotoxic effect was observed in concentrations of up to 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>M in SH-SY5Y cells, and the effects on cognition were tested in a scopolamine-induced amnesia animal model at the maximum dose of 10 mg/kg. Both the elevated plus maze and Y-maze experiments confirmed the potential for this compound to improve spatial and immediate memory, thus having an impact on cognitive impairment. 
 <italic>Ex vivo</italic> analysis evidenced attenuated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in compound-treated animals compared to the scopolamine-treated group, suggesting antioxidant properties. A robust improvement in cognitive and memory function was also observed when the compound was evaluated in the Morris water maze experiment with an A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1-42</sub>-induced ICV rat model.
