<p>Wang et al. presented some novel isoflavone derivatives bearing amino or THA groups linked to the 7-position of the isoflavone core by different chains, along with some diamino-substituted analogues inspired by known H
 <sub>3</sub>R antagonists (
 <bold>37</bold> and 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. A preliminary analysis of the H
 <sub>3</sub>R antagonist profile made on isoflavone-based compounds with known AChE inhibitory activity guided the identification of the appropriate linkers and amines for SAR studies. Even if the monoamino substituted derivatives (
 <bold>37</bold>) showed good activities on the selected targets, the analogues bearing a second amino functionality (
 <bold>38</bold>) resulted as the more potent low micromolar antagonists of H
 <sub>3</sub>R. They also displayed pronounced dual AChE and BuChE inhibition at the low- or submicromolar level, with the best inhibitor having IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.08 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 2.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. These compounds also showed antioxidant activity in the ORAC-FL test and possessed an anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells, suppressing the production of IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> without affecting cell viability. Moreover, they were not cytotoxic in SH-SY5Y cells in concentrations of up to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and in the SH-SY5Y-APPsw cell line (overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human APP), they significantly prevented copper-induced A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregate toxicity, increasing cell viability. Acute toxicity was assessed in mice, resulting in the toleration of up to 1000 mg/kg, and the favorable PK parameters and drug-like properties prompted the authors to test the compounds in animal models of cognitive deficits. In mice, there was a significant prolongation of the scopolamine-induced latency of step-down in a dose-dependent manner (10 to 30 mg/kg) and an increase in brain cholinergic activity, ameliorating cognitive deficit. All together, these results highlighted an exquisite multitarget profile for these compounds and the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis suggested an interesting potential for the treatment of AD.
