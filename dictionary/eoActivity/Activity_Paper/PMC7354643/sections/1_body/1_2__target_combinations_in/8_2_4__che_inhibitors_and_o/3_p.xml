<p>Phosphodiesterases have recently gained interest for their potential to ameliorate cognitive functions in AD patients. These enzymes can be involved in the regulation of cAMP and cGMP levels [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and their inhibition can offer a valuable tool to increase the levels of the two second messengers in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, with a consequent improvement in the memory and learning processes. Phosphodiesterase-9 (PDE9), which exerts its hydrolytic activity against cGMP, is now being studied as a potential target for CNS disorders [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], including AD, and the recently developed inhibitor PF-04447943 [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] has been tested in Phase II clinical trials for AD treatment (
