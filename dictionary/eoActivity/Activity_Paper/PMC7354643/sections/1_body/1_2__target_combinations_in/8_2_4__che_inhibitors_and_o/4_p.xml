<p>To assess the effects of dual PDE9A/AChE inhibitors, Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] exploited the benzylpiperidine moiety of Donepezil in combination with the pyrazolopyrimidinone structure (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Although different amidic or (cyclic)amine chains were explored as linkers for the two pharmacophores, the best results were obtained with 4-member ethereal or carbon tethers, resulting in compounds with submicromolar inhibitory activity against PDE9A and AChE. The type and length of the linkage played a pivotal role in the inhibition of PDE9A and was also responsible for the mixed type of inhibition of AChE, allowing the binding to both catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme. No effect was observed on SH-SY5Y cell viability at concentrations between 10 and 20

Despite the moderate metabolic stability, acute toxicity was evaluated and, following the lack of detrimental adverse events, the compounds were tested

These analogues could significantly improve spatial memory and cognition in the Morris water maze tests; thus, they were also investigated in a mice model of spatial learning and memory deficits produced by an ICV injection of A
