<p>Following a similar approach, hybridization of the pyrazolopyrimidinone skeleton with Rivastigmine led to the identification of another series of promising MTDLs (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Even if various groups were used to replace the carbamate functionality of Rivastigmine and different chains were employed to create the linkage between the two pharmacophoric elements, compounds with general structure 
 <bold>25</bold> resulted as the most promising and efficacious analogues of the series. Interestingly, these agents were behaving as selective inhibitors of BuChE, with IC

 <italic>μ</italic>M, and were also potent PDE9A inhibitors in the nanomolar range. A little study on the selectivity over the PDE superfamily was also reported, confirming a good degree of selectivity for the PDE9A enzyme. Nevertheless, carbamate compounds were not active as antioxidants, and only the replacement of this functionality with hydroxyl groups restored the antioxidant potential. In addition, some of the tested compounds were not cytotoxic in SH-SY5Y cells in concentrations of up to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and were able to inhibit A
 <italic>β</italic> self-aggregation to some extent at a concentration of 50
