<p>With the aim of merging the anti-ChE activity and the modulation of 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>/5-HT
 <sub>6</sub> receptors, different structural combinations have been explored. Recently, the same group that discovered Donecopride (
 <bold>30</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) was able to develop a novel class of MTDL able to inhibit AChE, activate 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R, and block 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R. Donecopride [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] is an AChE inhibitor with partial 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R agonist activity inspired by the 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R agonist RS67333 (
 <bold>29</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which showed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> procognitive and antiamnesic effects in NMRI mice and promoted sAPP
 <italic>α</italic> release in C57BL/6 mice [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Through minor structural modifications of the benzyl analogue of Donecopride, a few derivatives were obtained with very promising 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> triple effects (
 <bold>31</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] with R=3-Me substitution (as a fumarate salt), the compound possessed an interesting profile with 
 <italic>K</italic>i
 <sub>(5 − HT4R)</sub> = 210 nM and 
 <italic>K</italic>i
 <sub>(5 − HT6R)</sub> = 219 nM and IC
 <sub>50</sub> on AChE = 33.7 nM, acting as a partial agonist towards 
 <italic>h</italic>5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R (similar to Donecopride) and as an inverse agonist towards 
 <italic>h</italic>5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R. Moreover, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation on an NMRI mice model demonstrated an antiamnesic effect at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, with no detrimental effects at concentrations higher than 100 mg/kg, thus representing a quite promising MTDL candidate for AD treatment.
