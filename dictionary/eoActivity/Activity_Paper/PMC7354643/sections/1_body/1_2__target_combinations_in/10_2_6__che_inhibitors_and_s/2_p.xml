<p>5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>Rs belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family and are localized both in peripheral areas and in the CNS, with a high density in the substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. Here, they act as modulators of hippocampal synaptic responsiveness and plasticity, thus playing a central role in information storage and cognition [

 <sub>4</sub>R agonists have the potential to be therapeutically useful in AD not only for the effects on memory and behavioral performances, but also because 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>Rs influence the cholinergic system and ACh release, and are linked to APP activity and A

 <sub>6</sub>Rs are also G-protein-coupled receptors whose expression is restricted to the CNS. Although the information regarding their pharmacology is still limited, the presence of 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R in brain areas responsible for cognitive functions, memory, and learning (such as hippocampus and cerebral cortex) made them another interesting target in AD [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Antagonists of these receptors become attractive therapeutics to address some of the AD-related dysfunctions [
