<p>When the THA moiety (
 <bold>35</bold>) was in the place of the phthalimide one, the R=H compounds showed a higher nanomolar activity against AChE and, to the same extent, on BuChE, becoming nonselective and noncompetitive ChE inhibitors, but still deserving further development for AD treatment. The antagonist activity on 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R was also conserved, and the 5-C atom chain gave the best 
 <italic>K</italic>i value of 72 nM. The thioflavin-T (ThT) assay on A
 <italic>β</italic> self-aggregation revealed equal or better inhibitory potency (over 92%) than resveratrol used as a reference, and PAMPA-BBB prediction determined a favorable potential to diffuse across the membranes.
