<p>As already discussed, the combination of the cholinesterase inhibitory activity with the MAO inhibition may represent an attractive approach to treat some neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD or AD. In a similar manner, the combination of MAO inhibitors with histamine receptor H
 <sub>3</sub>R antagonists may open up the way for the development of interesting MTDLs [
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. To this extent, two compounds arising from the combination of the 3-piperidinopropyloxy moiety with Rasagiline (MAO inhibitor) have been proposed by Stark et al. (
 <bold>57</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), with the only structural difference represented by the anchoring point on the aminoindane skeleton. The two analogues showed low nanomolar affinity for H
 <sub>3</sub>R, and only the 5-linked one had inhibitory activity on MAO-B in the nanomolar range, thus demonstrating a preference for linear vs. branched structures. This compound had also a preference for H
 <sub>3</sub>R over H
 <sub>1</sub>R and H
 <sub>4</sub>R and dopamine D2 and D3 receptor subtypes. Moreover, both of the structures showed low cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells and were optimal candidates endowed with drug-like properties. No further evaluations were performed, not even regarding the chiral nature of the compounds and the possible separation of the two enantiomers. However, there is a relevant perspective for these analogues to serve as lead structures for the design of MTDLs useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
