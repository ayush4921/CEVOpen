<p>Amongst the triazole-bearing compounds with general structure 
 <bold>53</bold>, the R=
 <italic>o</italic>-CF
 <sub>3</sub> substituted analogue was the best performer of the series and displayed the most potent inhibitory activity against self-mediated A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation in the ThT fluorescence binding assay, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.065 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (even better than the reference curcumin). The significantly reduced formation of A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> fibrils was also confirmed by TEM assay. Moreover, the coincubation of preformed fibrils with a 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>M solution of this agent for 24 h had the capability of reducing the amount of A
 <italic>β</italic> fibrils in the TEM assay, highlighting a disruptive effect on preformed A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> fibrils. The compound also showed metal-chelating ability, as assessed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, thus inhibiting Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>-induced A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation and promoting the disaggregation of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>-induced A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> fibrils at a concentration of 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Furthermore, the multifunctional ligand influenced the generation of ROS by preventing the copper redox cycle in a Cu-ascorbate redox system. The compound was not cytotoxic and did not influence the viability in SH-SY5Y cells in concentrations of up to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Noteworthy, it was also able to inhibit the toxicity induced by A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> aggregates in the same neuronal cell line. Taken together, all these activities make this compound a promising neuroprotective candidate, worthy of further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>/
 <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation.
