<p>A very detailed research involving several quinoline-indole-based derivatives pointed out the ability of these compounds in promoting cell proliferation in the adult murine hippocampus, as a result of their neuroprotective effect against A
 <italic>β</italic>-related toxicity and oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Although there would be more than one analogue that may be worthy of investigation, the optimized compound 
 <bold>59</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>) has been identified as the most promising candidate of the series and arose from the combination of the Clioquinol structure with the substituted indole fragment. The ORAC-FL test revealed that the compound had higher antioxidant efficacy (ORAC value = 5.0) compared to Clioquinol, and the PAMPA assay confirmed the potential to be BBB penetrant by passive diffusion. In the ThT assay for A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1-42</sub> self-induced aggregation, it showed higher inhibitory activity than parent and reference compounds and it had a significant effect in disaggregating preformed fibrils. The new derivative was able to chelate Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> generating Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>/compound complexes in a 1 : 2 stoichiometry. Following this chelating potential, the effect on metal-induced A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation was also evaluated, demonstrating a substantial rate of inhibition for Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>-associated A
 <italic>β</italic>-aggregation and disaggregation of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>-promoted preformed fibrils. The compound had no neurotoxicity in the PC12 cell line in concentrations of up to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, but rather revealed the ability to increase the number of cells, possibly via a MAPK-dependent mechanism. There was also a clear effect in reducing the production of ROS in SH-SY5Y stimulated cells. The HCl salt formulation displayed a considerable metabolic stability in liver microsomes (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 116 min), and no acute toxicity or significant alteration was observed in adult C57BL/6 mice (up to 2000 mg/kg). In the same animal model, following ICV injection of the hydrochloride salt, there was a clear effect in inducing hippocampal cell proliferation from the reservoirs of neuronal stem cells in the subgranular zone, and from the neural precursor in other hippocampus regions, as confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of the mice brains. Double transgenic APP/PS1 mice (a model of AD) were used to assess the cognitive and memory strengthening effect in the Morris water maze test, where the treatment with the compound demonstrated a significant amelioration of memory impairment and cognitive dysfunctions. Daily doses of 30 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated, and the chronic oral treatment also lead to a remarkable reduction in A
 <italic>β</italic> plaque deposition, in correlation with the positive effects on learning and memory. In conclusion, this analogue is a nice example of an MTDL with optimal 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> properties and proven 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity which makes it an attractive agent to be further pursued for AD treatment.
