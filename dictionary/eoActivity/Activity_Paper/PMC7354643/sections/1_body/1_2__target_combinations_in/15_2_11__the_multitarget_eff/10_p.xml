<p>In the search for agents targeting AD-inducing processes, a new class of compounds acting on Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> VGC and preventing the inhibition of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been reported (
 <bold>58</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. As already observed, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> overload due to an altered VGC opening is common in several neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], but PP2A downregulation has also been linked to the progression of AD [
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], since this enzyme plays a role in the phosphorylation of pTAU. Inspired by the structure of natural alkaloid Gramine, whose derivatives have already been evaluated as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative disease [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], Gonzales et al. used the indole core to create a new series of 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzyl-substituted compounds able to prevent PP2A inhibition and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> overload. The preincubation of these analogues with SH-SY5Y cells subjected to high K
 <sup>+</sup> concentration prevented the cytosolic increase of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, proving the blockade effect on cell depolarization and VGC opening, and showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.8 to 4.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. A mild antagonist effect was also reported on NMDA receptors in rat cortical embryonic neurons, even if this may be ascribed to an indirect interaction with PP2A. In fact, this latter can form stable complexes with NMDA receptors [
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], leading to receptor dephosphorylation and desensitization, with a lower influx of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. To demonstrate this hypothesis, PP2A activity in SH-SY5Y cells treated with okadaic acid (a known PP2A inhibitor) was evaluated, as this represent a common AD model to study PP2A dysfunction and to assess the effects of the new compounds on restoring the enzyme activity. The loss in PP2A activity was prevented by pre- and coincubation with most of the compounds at 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, confirming their ability to act as PP2A-activating drugs. At the same time, okadaic acid had a detrimental effect on cell viability and the treatment with these agents increased SH-SY5Y cell viability up to an extent of 70%, resulting nontoxic 
 <italic>per se</italic> at concentrations 30-fold higher than the one necessary to induce neuroprotection. All these results confirmed how this pharmacological combination could represent a valuable tool to address AD-related dementia.
