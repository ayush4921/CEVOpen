<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have attracted attention for their roles in AD brains. HDACs are a class of enzymes that catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of both histone and nonhistone proteins [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The 18 existing isoforms can use either a zinc- or a NAD
 <sup>+</sup>-dependent mechanism to accomplish the deacetylation process. Classes I (isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 8), IIa (isoforms 4, 5, 7, and 9), IIb (isoforms 6 and 10), and IV (isoform 11) are zinc-dependent metalloamidases, while Class III HDACs (sirtuine) are the NAD-dependent enzymes. Several inhibitors of selected isoforms have already been successfully tested as promising anticancer agents [
