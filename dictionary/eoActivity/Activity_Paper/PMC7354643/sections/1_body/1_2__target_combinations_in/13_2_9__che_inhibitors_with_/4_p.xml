<p>Another recent research work evaluated the possibility of using different tethers to combine the THA motif with (poly)phenolic or methoxy-substituted rings, generating novel MTDLs potentially useful for AD treatment (general structures 
 <bold>44</bold> and 
 <bold>45</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In more detail, the new analogues were designed to overcome classical THA-derived side effects and to provide access to other significant therapeutic targets, such as neuronal redox status, deposition of amyloid plaque, leading to neuroprotection. The linkage strategy, guided by molecular docking analysis, envisaged the formation of imino-, amino- (
 <bold>44</bold>), or ethereal (
 <bold>45</bold>) bonds, coupled with the variation of the tether length by increasing the number of carbon atoms. The best performing analogue of series 
 <bold>44</bold>, bearing a 9-atom ether-type chain and a dimethoxy-substituted ring, behaved as an extremely potent (subnanomolar range) and selective BuChE inhibitor, with an 85-fold increase of activity compared to THA, and displayed a good ability to interfere with A
 <italic>β</italic> self-aggregation, lacking neurotoxicity at concentrations of up to 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Its neuroprotective properties were assessed in primary rat neurons, inducing neuronal damage by serum and K
 <sup>+</sup>-deprivation, where it showed neuroprotection at concentrations of up to 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. All these activities, combined with a low hepatotoxicity and good stability under physiological conditions, pointed out to this lead compound as a promising pharmacophore combination deserving further analysis and progression in the list of AD treatment.
