<p>From the combination of a known GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and the THA moiety as AChE binder, some thiazole-based compounds were synthesized (
 <bold>18</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with the potential to be a novel class of dual GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic>/AChE [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An amidic bond served to link the two pharmacophoric elements, spaced by a 2- or 3-C chain, and a few substitutions on the THA aromatic ring were also assessed. The introduction of the THA moiety did not affect the potency of GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> inhibition, and the new compounds displayed nanomolar activity against this latter enzyme and 
 <italic>h</italic>AChE, with almost all of them being also selective over 
 <italic>h</italic>BuChE. However, the series showed remarkable antiproliferative effects on SH-SY5Y cells and only the analogue with the unsubstituted THA moiety and a 3C-linker progressed, having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M against the neuroblastoma cell line and being safe in hepatocytes, with low impact on these latter cells' viability at the same concentration. This compound also showed a moderate activity against A
 <italic>β</italic> self-oligomerization. It was then tested in mouse neuroblastoma N2a-TAU cells at increasing concentrations to assess its effect on pTAU hyperphosphorylation, where it displayed a significant inhibition of this process. In the animal model of cognition impairment induced by scopolamine, the compound-treated mice displayed a significant ameliorated memory performance in the Morris water maze test, confirming the compound 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity.
