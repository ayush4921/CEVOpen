<p>Another new series of compounds as dual inhibitors of ChEs and GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> (
 <bold>19</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) was recently reported [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Here, the structure of THA (the ChE inhibitor side) and the scaffold of Valmerin (isoindolone, GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> inhibitor side) were hybridized. The analysis of the crystal structures of the new MTDLs in complex with 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE, combined with molecular docking studies, allowed the identification of the 1,2,3-triazole group as the best linker to retain or increase the inhibitory potency amongst both of the enzymatic systems. Together with the final hybrid compounds, the THA- and isoindolone-based fragments have also been tested for their ability to inhibit the enzymes, to give further information on the contribution of the single parts on each enzyme inhibition. The best performing compounds were able to inhibit both human AChE and GSK-3
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> in the nanomolar range, and the triazole ring undoubtedly played a pivotal role in enhancing the inhibitory potency towards the GSKs, even though the compounds were not displaying high selectivity over other kinases. Interestingly, the new analogues were less cytotoxic than the corresponding THA and isoindolone fragments in several cell lines (including the liver HuH7 cell line); however, when tested at concentrations of up to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M in SH-SY5Y cells, a reduction in cell viability was observed after 24 h. The viability of MDCK-MDR1 cells was not affected in the same way, so the MDCK-MDR1 cell line expressing P-gp was used as a BBB model to predict brain penetration. The new compounds displayed good permeability through this system and showed no interaction with P-gp.
