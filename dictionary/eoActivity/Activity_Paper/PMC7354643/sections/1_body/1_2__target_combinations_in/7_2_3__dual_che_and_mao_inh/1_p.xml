<p>Another combination for a multitarget purpose arises from the dual inhibition of ChEs and Monoamino Oxidases (MAOs). In the CNS, MAOs terminate the action of several monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, and MAO-B, the predominant isoform in the human brain, is already a validated target for neurodegenerative diseases, with its inhibitor Rasagiline being approved to treat PD symptoms [

 <italic>γ</italic>-secretase [
