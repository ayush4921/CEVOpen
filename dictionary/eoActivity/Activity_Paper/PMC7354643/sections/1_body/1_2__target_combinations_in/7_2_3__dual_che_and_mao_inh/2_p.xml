 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The new compounds are designed to combine the interesting biological activities of chalcones [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with the well-known AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity of Rivastigmine. The addition of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the chalcone carbonyl group confers the potential to be metal-chelating agents. The combination of L1=Me and L2=Et with R=H or N(Me)Et as substituents gave the best results in terms of expected properties. The compounds were selective BuChE and MAO-B inhibitors, active in the 
 <italic>μ</italic>M range for both of the enzymes, and they could inhibit the self-induced aggregation of A

 <sub>42</sub> with values higher than 50% (63.9% for the most active). A potent antioxidant activity in the Oxygen Radicals Absorbance Capacity by Fluorescence (ORAC-FL) method was observed, with the compound bearing the hydroxyl group (R=H) being more potent than its carbamate counterpart. The same hydroxyl analogue was also a selective metal chelator that could chelate Cu

 <sup>3+</sup>. Thus, its capability on Cu

 <sub>2</sub>-induced PC12 cell injury using MTT assays, where they were demonstrated to increase cell viability in correlation with their ability to capture hydroxyl radicals. Being also permeable through artificial membranes in the PAMPA-BBB assay, the compounds were finally tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in the scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment assay. The hydroxyl-derivative was effective in improving short-term working memory in mice, even though at the highest dose (23.4 mg/kg) it showed some neurotoxic effect.
