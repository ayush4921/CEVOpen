<p>Xu et al. have also presented a nice example of propargylamine-modified scaffolds (
 <bold>21</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) as ChE and MAO inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In more detail, they combined the imidazole-substituted pyrimidinylthiourea moiety (AChE inhibitor pharmacophore) with the propargylamine group of Selegiline (MAO-B inhibitor pharmacophore), spaced by different linkers. All the compounds resulted in submicromolar inhibitors of AChE with negligible activity on BuChE, and the R=H or Me substitutions were the most appropriate for an efficient inhibition, especially when coupled with a single carbon atom linker (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1). Following these encouraging preliminary results, MAO inhibition was tested, revealing that the abovementioned compounds efficiently inhibited the enzymes in the micromolar range, and with the R=Me compound being selective for MAO-B. It also showed good antioxidant activity in the ORAC-FL assay, and the thiourea fragment worked as the metal-chelating part, resulting in a selective chelation for Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and inhibition of the ROS produced by Cu(II)-related redox. This compound had no effect on the A
 <italic>β</italic> self-aggregation but could efficiently inhibit Cu-mediated A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation, as expected. It was safely tolerated on rat primary cortical neurons at concentrations of up to 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, showing mild neurotoxicity at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and it could protect neuronal cells from Cu-induced A
 <italic>β</italic> toxic damage, increasing cell viability. The PAMPA assay indicated a good potential to cross the BBB, and the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effect in the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficit in mice was evaluated. The HCl salt was dosed orally at 30 mg/kg, and it could ameliorated learning and memory deficits, with the treated mice showing shorter escape latency and less frequent errors compared to the scopolamine group.
