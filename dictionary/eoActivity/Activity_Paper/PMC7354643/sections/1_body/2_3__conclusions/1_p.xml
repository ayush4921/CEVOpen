<p>The multifaceted and complex nature of AD has triggered tremendous research efforts towards developing multitarget therapeutic strategies. These strategies are mainly developed to target multiple factors involved in the progression of AD such as mitochondrial dysfunction, deposition of amyloid aggregates in the brain, oxidative stress, and altered brain glucose metabolism. This review focused on the development of small molecules that were rationally designed to interact with multiple targets directly related to the etiology of AD. In addition, structural modification of the lead compounds enabled introduction of key features such as metal chelation and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities which have proven to be beneficial properties in the identification of potential therapeutics of AD. The design of dual inhibitors of enzymes involved in the progression of AD is one of the most common strategies implicated in the development of MTDLs. Inhibitors of ChEs have been widely used in the design of dual enzyme inhibitors mainly through molecular hybridization. The majority of research in this area focused on using scaffolds of AD drugs such as THA and Donepezil with reported ChE inhibitory activity. Hybridization with scaffolds with known inhibitory activities against GSK-3

 <sub>6</sub>R antagonists evolved as a promising approach for the development of MTDLs. BACE-1-centered MTDLs have received growing attention from researchers in the previous years. Numerous MTDLs have been reported that combine BACE-1 inhibition with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
