<p>The other main pathological event leading to neurodegeneration is oxidative stress. Even if the human brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass, it consumes 20% of the oxygen brought by the respiratory system [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This feature renders the brain more vulnerable towards oxidative stress. Thus, oxidation of the main constituents of neurons (lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) leads invariably to neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In other words, the constant accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) leads to the ineluctable damage to neurons. This oxidative stress is caused by various underlying factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], dyshomeostasis of metal ions (e.g., redox-active Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and Cu
 <sup>+</sup>/Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>) and their role in promoting the deposit of aggregation-prone peptides (e.g., A

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There is a global consensus on the fact that these etiologic mechanisms coexist simultaneously, influencing each other at multiple levels [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Consequently, these pathological features are responsible for neuronal cell death and dysfunction in neurotransmission translating into progressive cognitive impairment and/or ataxia. Based on their intertwined roles in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, they represent crucial therapeutic targets. Current treatments available in the market for neurodegenerative diseases are mainly palliative and poorly ameliorate the day-to-day life of patients. For instance, the treatments available now in the market for AD consists of three inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChEIs, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which maintain the levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and thus the neurotransmission [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), has been approved for moderate-to-severe AD [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Tacrine (THA, 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was the first AChEI to be marketed for AD treatment but was rapidly discontinued due to its hepatotoxicity [
