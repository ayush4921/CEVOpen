<p id="p0140">Angiotensin-converting enzyme is a key enzyme which is known to catalyze the conversion of angiotensin I into the active vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors are one of the mechanistic therapeutic strategies targeted for stabilizing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The anti-hypertensive activities of medicinal plants act through the inhibition of ACE. A wide range of medicinal plants with ACE inhibitory activities have been reported in the past (

 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The ACE inhibitory activities of extracts might be because of flavonoid, alkaloid, and tannin contents, possibly through sequestration of enzyme metal co-factor, protein precipitation or through other mechanisms.
