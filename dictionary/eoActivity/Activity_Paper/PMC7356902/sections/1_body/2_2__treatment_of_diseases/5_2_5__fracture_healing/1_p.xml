<p>Green tea is a popular drink that benefits human health, including having positive effects that increase bone mineral density and bone volume, while also diminishing osteoporotic fractures. Based on previous reports, a bioactive compound of tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) could promote bone defect healing in the distal femur, and this may be partly through the effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Lin et al. further studied the effect of EGCG on tibial fracture healing in rats, and they concluded that the local treatment of EGCG accelerated fracture healing at least partly via BMP-2 [
