<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic intestinal and colorectal inflammation, which is highly capable of developing into colorectal cancer (CRC). Zheng et al. evaluated bioactivities of a clerodane diterpene, 16-hydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide (HCD) using an IBD mouse model and two human CRC cell lines [
