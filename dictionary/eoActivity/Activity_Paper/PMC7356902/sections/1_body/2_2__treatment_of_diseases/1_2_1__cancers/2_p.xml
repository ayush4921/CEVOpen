<p>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer and is the major cause of death by cancer in the world. Oh et al. investigated the anti-cancer potential of licochalcone D (LCD), a flavonoid isolated from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC cell line [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They found that LCD inhibits the activity of EGFR and hepatocyte growth factor receptor, induces reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptotic cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells.
