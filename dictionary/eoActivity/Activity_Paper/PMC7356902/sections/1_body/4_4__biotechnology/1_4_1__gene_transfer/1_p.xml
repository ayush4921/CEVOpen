<p>Black nightshade (
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>) is regarded as an herb that possesses bioactive compounds, particularly those with anti-tumor activities. Chhon et al. used transgenic black nightshade that overexpressed 
 <italic>AtPAP1</italic> (
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> production of anthocyanin pigment 1), to investigate the effect of transgene on anthocyanin biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They found that transgenic plants produced a higher content of anthocyanin when compared to the control, and thus suggested that it could be a suitable platform for further studying AtPAP1-induced anthocyanin accumulation in response to environmental stress.
