<p>Green synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) is an emerging field that is regarded as “green chemistry” due to the use of biological reducing agents including plant sources. Abbasi et al. made zinc oxide NPs that conjugated with the leaf extract from 
 <italic>Geranium wallichianum</italic> (GW), namely GW-ZnONPs [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They tested a number of bioactivities, as well as the biocompatibility of GW-ZnONPs, and finally confirmed that it has considerable potential in biological applications.
