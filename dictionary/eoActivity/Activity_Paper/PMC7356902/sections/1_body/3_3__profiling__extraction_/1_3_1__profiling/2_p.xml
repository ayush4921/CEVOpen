<p>Chinese sage (
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>) has been used as medicine for thousands of years for the treatment of a number of disorders, particularly by benefiting blood circulation systems. In a previous report, the polysaccharide fraction (PSF) of a symbiont, 
 <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic>, was found to have a positive effect on the accumulation of tanshinones in the hairy root culture. Peng et al. further profiled the proteomic responses of the symbiont relationship, and they proposed that the PSF-induced accumulation of tanshinones may contribute through defense-related signaling involving jasmonic acid, leading to leucine-rich repeat protein synthesis [
