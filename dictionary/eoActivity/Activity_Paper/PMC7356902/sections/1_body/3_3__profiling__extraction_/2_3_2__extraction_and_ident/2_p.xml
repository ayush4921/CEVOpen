<p>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are homogeneous solutions of quaternary ammonium salts, which have advantages including easy preparation, ecological friendliness, and so on. Zeng et al. tested the performance of six DESs in combination with five macroporous resins on isolation and purification of flavonoids and 20-hydroxyecdysone from

 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They found the best combination of DES (choline chloride/urea) and macroporous resin (D101). Subsequently, three flavonoids and 20-hydroxyecdysone were successfully purified, and their chemical structures were identified.
