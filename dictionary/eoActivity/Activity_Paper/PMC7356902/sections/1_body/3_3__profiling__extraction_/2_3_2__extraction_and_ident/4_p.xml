<p>To solve the excess structural information in the isolation of metabolites from natural products by high-resolution mass spectrometry, Lee et al. applied the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform together with hierarchical clustering analysis on the selectively isolate of lignans from 
 <italic>Trachelospermum asiaticum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Using this combined tool, eventually, they efficiently identified five dibenzylbutylrolactone-type lignans that possess cytotoxic activities against cancer cells.
