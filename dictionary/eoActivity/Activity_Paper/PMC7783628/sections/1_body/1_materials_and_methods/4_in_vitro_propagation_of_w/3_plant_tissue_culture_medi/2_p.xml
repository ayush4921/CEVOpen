<p id="p0035">The MS medium (1962) was used with 6 stock solutions individually; macro, minor, micro, iron and vitamins were equipped and stored. Auxins, cytokinins and 
 <italic>meso</italic>-inositol, stock solutions were freshly prepared and used every month. Freshly prepared sucrose (30 g
 <sup>−1</sup>; 3%), 
 <italic>meso</italic>-inositol (100 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>; 0.1%), solidifying agent agar (0.8%; 8 g/L), obligatory amount of plant growth hormones in additional to MS medium. Facing autoclaving (121 °C), 1.06 kg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> pressure (20 min), the MS medium was buffer with 1 N HCl and 1 N NaOH to regulate solutions pH (5.6–5.8). Subsequently, medium prepared was reserved beneath refrigerator situation awaiting additional use. The 25 ± 2 °C cultures were incubated with a 70–80% qualified humidity and (16/8 h Light/Dark) photoperiod under photon flux compactness (50 µE mol/m
 <sup>2</sup>/s
 <sup>2</sup>) (
