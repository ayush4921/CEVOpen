<p id="p0085">In the current study, resourceful procedure for the Brahmi plant regeneration established through somatic embryogenesis. Plant tissue culture considered to be an appropriate coordination for great level production of medicinal plants. The present 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation method was found successful for the huge amount calluses production in water hyssop plant. Accordingly, the current micropropagation of PTC techniques are extremely significant for rewarding its marketplace requirements through micropropagation production, it increased without disturbing its natural environmental habitats.
