    "<i>Bacopa monnieri</i> (Linn.) Wettst. commonly known as waterhyssop, Brahmi plant, traditionally used for memory enhancement, nerve tonic, epilepsy, central nervous system (CNS), antidepressant, anxiety, blood pressure and antioxidant activities. Due to pharmaceutical demands its lost natural habitat. At this juncture we describe a resourceful protocol for micropropagation of water hyssop plant. Surface sterilized leaf and nodal explants were inoculated on basal MS semi-solid medium added with PGRs; auxins, cytokinins. Highest calli formation from leaf explants was obtained on NAA (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>) and showed (94.22%) accompanied via 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>; 82.43%), maximum calli formation in nodal explants was obtained on 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>; 71.14%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>) showed (62.15%), in internodes explants uppermost calli formation was obtained from 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>; 65.21%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>) showed (52.14%). The maximum somatic embryogenic callus, calli induction and formation (84%) was observed on 2,4-D + KIN (2.0 + 1.5 mg<sup>-1</sup>) amended solid medium. Uppermost shoot formation was observed in combination of IAA + BAP (1.0 + 1.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) showed (78.54%) shoot formation followed by IBA (2.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) alone showed (75.37%). The maximum shoot elongation was noticed from NAA + BAP (3.0 + 3.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) with 21.21 cm followed by NAA (2.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) showed (15.22 cm) although, chief root formation was obtained from IBA (2.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) with 83.75% root formation along higher number of roots (47.43%) per shoot. Followed by IAA (2.0 mg<sup>-1</sup>) showed root induction (73.43%) and no of roots (38.54%) per shoot. In hardening under pot condition plants survivability (100%) was observed under glass house conditions, the present <i>in vitro</i> PTC techniques is extremely significant to gratifying its natural conservation."
