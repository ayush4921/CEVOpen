<p>In the excision model, the 10% (w/w) extract ointment treated group showed significant wound area contraction from day 6 to day 16, whereas the 5% (w/w) extract ointment treated group showed significant wound area contraction beginning from the 8th day on wards. Besides, the epithelialization period was significantly reduced from 20 days (negative control) to 16 days (5% w/w extract) and 14 days (10% w/w extract). Hence, a faster rate of wound contraction and shorter period of epithelialization of the extract ointments may be due to the synergistic effects of different secondary metabolites present in the plant. This finding is strengthened by previous reports of a review on health promoting bioactive phytochemicals from 
 <italic>Brassica genus</italic> viz 
 <italic>B. nigra</italic>, 
 <italic>B. juncea</italic>, 
 <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. rapa</italic> showed that high content of poly phenols and flavonoids are found in the seeds, and these phytochemicals contribute to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property. Particularly, sinapic acid, an isolated phenolic compound and kaempferol and quercetin, the flavonoids isolated from Brassica vegetables were reported to have anti-oxidant activity.

Topical application of brassinosteroid significantly reduced wound size and accelerated wound healing in treated animals in the mouse model of cutaneous wound healing.

 <italic>B.carinata</italic>, was studied for a number of activities such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, and wound healing effects.
