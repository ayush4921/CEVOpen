<p>In excision wound model, despite all fractions showed varying degrees of wound area contraction compared to the negative control at both dose levels, better activity was observed for 10%w/w aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among all fractions, aqueous 10% w/w fraction showed better wound healing activity. This finding may indicate the phytochemicals responsible for wound healing activity are largely polar compounds and are found in large amount in the aqueous fraction. Phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and glucosinolates that are found in Brassica species, and which were explained for their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity, are usually polar and highly soluble in water because the naturally occurring glycosides sugar moieties elevate their hydrophilicity.
