<p>A better wound healing effect of the crude extract was further evidenced by the tensile strength in incision wounds. In this model, there was a significant increase in wound breaking strength (tensile strength) in 10% extract, 5% extract ointments, and the standard drug as compared to the negative control. This fact is evidenced by the antigenotoxic effects of 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> and its protection of DNA damage that can be caused by oxidative stress. Further, the present finding can be supported by published literature stated that 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> showed maturation of the extracellular matrix in skin wounds of wistar rats as evidenced by significant levels of total collagen and glycosaminoglycans found to occur starting from the 8th day compared to negative control. The tensile strength indicates how much the repaired tissue resists to breaking under tension, which is related to an increase in collagen synthesis and maturation, formation of stable intra and intermolecular cross-link, matrix deposition, and cell migration, and may indicate the quality of repaired tissue.
