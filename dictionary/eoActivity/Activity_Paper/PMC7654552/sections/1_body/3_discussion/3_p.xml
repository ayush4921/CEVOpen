<p>The results of the present study indicated that the crude extract and the solvent fractions significantly increased wound healing effects with both 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract ointment treated groups at varying degrees both in the excision and incision models. The enhanced wound contraction and shorter period of epithelialization induced by the crude extract as well as fractions of 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds might be associated with increased collagen synthesis and facilitate proliferation of epithelial cells, which might be ascribed to its potent antioxidant activity as revealed in the present study. This fact can be further supported by a study reporting that the leaves of 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> have antigenotoxic and deoxyribo nucleic acid (DNA) damage protective effects.
