<p>To evaluate the wound healing activities of extract ointments, mice were grouped into four treatment groups each consisting of six mice in each model. We used a power calculation to estimate the sample size and number of groups.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Then, group one was treated with simple ointment (negative control), the second and third groups were treated with 5% and 10% of crude extract as well as fractions ointments, respectively, and the fourth group was treated with 0.2% nitrofurazone skin ointment (positive control). 0.2% nitrofurazone topical ointment was used as a positive control because it is effective for the treatment of bacterial skin infections, wounds, burns, and cutaneous ulcers, particularly for animal use, and it has been proven to promote the wound healing process.
