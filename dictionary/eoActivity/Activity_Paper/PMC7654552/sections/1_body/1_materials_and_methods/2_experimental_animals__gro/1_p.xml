<p>Healthy adult Swiss albino mice of either sex (25–30 g, and 6–8 weeks of age) or female adult albino rats (Rattus albus) (200–300 g, 8–12 weeks of age) were obtained from the animal house of the Department of Pharmacology, University of Gondar. Female adult rats were used since female rats are more susceptible to chemical toxicity. The animals were placed in cages under standard conditions with 12 hours light and dark cycles. They were provided with a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum throughout the experiment and acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 1 week before the experiment. The internationally accepted laboratory animal use, care, and guidelines were applied in all experiments.
