<p>Seeds of the plant were ground to coarse powder using wooden mortar and pestle. The coarse powder was weighed (2 kg) and macerated in Erlenmeyer flasks with 80% methanol (6.250 L) for 72 hours with occasional shaking at room temperature. Then, the extract was filtered by gauze (muslin) and re-filtered using Whatman No 1 filter paper. The marc was re-macerated twice in the same manner. Then, the filtrates were combined and evaporated on a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) under reduced pressure and dried in an oven at 40Â°C (Gallenkamp, UK). The extract was put in a refrigerator until used for further activities.</p>
