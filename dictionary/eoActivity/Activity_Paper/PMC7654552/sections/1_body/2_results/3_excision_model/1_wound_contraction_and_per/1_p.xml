<p>Topical applications of ointments of the 80% methanolic extracts and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B.carinata</italic> seeds showed a significant wound healing effect in mice. The plant extracts facilitated significant wound contraction at both dose levels from the 6th day to the 16th day as compared to the negative control group (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). Mice treated with 10% (w/w) extract exhibited a significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) wound contraction effect starting from the 6th day of treatment, while 5% (w/w) extract showed a significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) effect at the 8th day onwards as compared to the negative control. Groups treated with 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract preparations healed completely at the 16th and 18th days of post-wounding, respectively.
