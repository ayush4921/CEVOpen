<p>The 10% (w/w) extract preparation produced 96.6% (12th day), 99.1% (14th day), and 100% (16th day) of wound closures, which was comparable with the positive control (92.2%, 12th day; 98.4%, 14th day, and 100%, 16th day). On the other hand, the percentage wound closures induced by 5% (w/w) extract on the 12th, 14th, and 16th days of post-wounding were 87.6%, 96.0%, and 99.5%, respectively (
