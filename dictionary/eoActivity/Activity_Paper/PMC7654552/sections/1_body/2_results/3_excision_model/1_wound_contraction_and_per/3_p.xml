<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, all fractions produced wound healing activity at varying degrees. The 5% (w/w) and 10% (w/w) preparations of ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions produced significant wound contraction (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) beginning from the 4th day of post-wounding as compared to negative control. The 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) chloroform fraction showed significant wound contraction beginning from the 6th and 8th post-wounding days, respectively. Besides, all fractions produced a significant reduction (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) in epithelialization period as compared to negative control, though there were observable differences among them (
