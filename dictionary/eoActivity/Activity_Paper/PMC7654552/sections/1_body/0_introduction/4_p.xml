<p>The genus 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> under the mustard family (Brassicaceae) contains important species such as 
 <italic>B.carinata</italic>, 
 <italic>B.juncea</italic>, 
 <italic>B.oleracea</italic>, 
 <italic>B.napus</italic>, 
 <italic>B.nigra</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. rapa</italic>, which have been well known for their pharmacological and agricultural uses. Among mustards, 
 <italic>B.juncea</italic> and 
 <italic>B.oleracea</italic> have been extensively studied for their proven wound healing effects. Different secondary metabolites are isolated from mustard leaves and seeds contributing to promotion of wound healing. For instance, a wound healing lipid called lysophosphatidic acid was identified from consumption of cabbage leaves.

 <sup>Â®</sup> prepared from 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> active ingredients was used for treatment of cutaneous wounds.

 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> plants have also been studied for their anti-oxidant activities. Polar compounds like vitamin C and phenolic compounds, as well as non-polar chemicals like vitamin E and carotenoids, are some of the natural anti-oxidants present in Brassica vegetables.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The substantial anti-oxidant effects of these plants were evaluated in terms of various assays such as metal reducing, metal chelating, lipid reducing, and free radical scavenging activities. They also produced a positive effect on antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Not only for their free radical scavenging activities, they do produce significant anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities from previous reports.
