 <p>The 
  <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus is a kind of flowering plant in the family of Araliaceae that encompasses approximately 91 to 95 species. Several 
  <italic>Dendropanax</italic> species are used as traditional medicinal plants, extensively used Korea and South America and other parts of the world. Almost every part of the plant, including the leaves, bark, roots, and stems, can be used as traditional medicine for the prevention and management of a broad spectrum of health disorders. This paper sought to summarizes the ethnopharmacological benefits, biological activities, and phytochemical investigations of plants from the genus 
  <italic>Dendropanax,</italic> and perhaps to subsequently elucidate potential new perspectives for future pharmacological research to consider. Modern scientific literature suggests that plants of the 
  <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus, together with active compounds isolated from it, possess a wide range of therapeutic and pharmacological applications, including antifungal, anti-complement, antioxidant, antibacterial, insect antifeedant, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and anti-hypouricemic properties. The botanical descriptions of approximately six to 10 species are provided by different scientific web sources. However, only six species, namely, 
  <italic>D. morbiferus, D. gonatopodus, D. dentiger</italic>, 
  <italic>D. capillaris</italic>, 
  <italic>D. chevalieri,</italic> and 
  <italic>D. arboreus</italic>, were included in the present investigation to undergo phytochemical evaluation, due to the unavailability of data for the remaining species. Among these plant species, a high concentration of variable bioactive ingredients was identified. In particular, 
  <italic>D. morbifera</italic> is a traditional medicinal plant used for the multiple treatment purposes and management of several human diseases or health conditions. Previous experimental evidence supports that the 
  <italic>D. morbifera</italic> species could be used to treat various inflammatory disorders, diarrhea, diabetes, cancer, and some microbial infections. It has recently been reported, by our group and other researchers, that 
  <italic>D. morbifera</italic> possesses a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing agent. A total of 259 compounds have been identified among six species, with 78 sourced from five of these species reported to be bioactive. However, there is no up-to-date information concerning the 
  <italic>D. morbifera</italic>, its different biological properties, or its prospective benefits in the enhancement of human health. In the present study, we set out to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the botany, traditional medicinal history, and medicinal resources of species of the 
  <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus. In addition, we explore several phytochemical constituents identified in different species of the 
  <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus and their biological properties. Finally, we offer comprehensive analysis findings of the phytochemistry, medicinal uses, pharmacological actions, and a toxicity and safety evaluation of the 
  <italic>D. morbifera</italic> species and its main bioactive ingredients for future consideration.
