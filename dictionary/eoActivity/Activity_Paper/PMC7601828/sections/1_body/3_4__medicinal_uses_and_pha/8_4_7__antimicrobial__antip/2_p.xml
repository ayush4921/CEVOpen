<p>Chung et al. assessed the antiplasmodial activities of oleifoliosides A and oleifoliosides B methanol extracts from 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> stem bark, using an in vitro, semi-automated micro-dilution assay that was observed using a chloroquine-sensitive strain of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (D10). Artemisinin and chloroquine were used as the normal standard drugs for the antiplasmodial activity assay. Results from the in vitro antiplasmodial activity assay confirmed that oleifoliosides A and oleifoliosides B showed significant antiplasmodial activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.2 and 5.3 mM, respectively [
