<p>Several studies have previously revealed the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts on gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains. Kim et al. previously evaluated the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts, using chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-hexane, and butanol solvent using a paper disc test against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. Both the n-hexane and butanol solvent fractions among the four types showed potential antimicrobial activity at 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extract concentrations of 40, 80, and 100 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, while observations made at a 20-μg/mL concentration did not show a clear antibiotic effect against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> [
