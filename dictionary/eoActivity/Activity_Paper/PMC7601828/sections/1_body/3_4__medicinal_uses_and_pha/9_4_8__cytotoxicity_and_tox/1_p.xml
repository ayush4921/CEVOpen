<p>Kim et al. evaluated the cytotoxicity of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaves against different tumor cell lines, including endometrial, colon, ovarian, and cervical cancer cell lines. Treatment with the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 50 and 100 μg/mL had cytotoxic effects on these four types of cancer cell lines showed cytotoxicity of more than 93% at doses greater than 100 μg/mL and 6 to 11% of cytotoxicity at doses of less than 50 μg/mL, as compared with in normal cell lines [
 <xref rid="B100-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Wang et al. evaluated the cytotoxic activities of synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaf extracts for potential anti-cancer activity in a human keratinocyte cell line and A549 human lung cancer cell line and, in this context, both synthesized nanoparticles exhibited anti-cancer activities. D-AgNPs 100 µg/mL showed potent cytotoxic effects after 48 hours on the lung cancer cells but not the human keratinocyte cell line, whereas D-AuNPs did not exhibit cytotoxic effects on either cell line at the same concentration [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts by analysis with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, using normal human HNOK cells. Treatment with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts 2.5 to 10 μg/mL retained a high level of cell viability of 60% to 100%, without affecting the cell survival rate relative to in the control group. Concentrations of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts ranging from 25 to 40 μg/mL demonstrated a cell survival rate of approximately 70% [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaves against HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells left otherwise untreated as well as the toxicity induced by glutamate using the MTT assay. The exposure of the HT22 cells to 4 mM of glutamate for 24 hours resulted in a decrease in cell viability. The extracts exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values exceeding 50 µg/mL per the MTT assay. Concentration-dependent pre-treatment with extracts resulted in the maintenance of up to 80% of cell viability induced by glutamate neurotoxicity [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaves against BV-2 cells left otherwise untreated, as well as the toxicity induced with LPS using the MTT assay. Exposure of the BV-2 cells to 200 ng/mL of LPS alone or in combination with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 100, 250, and 500 μg/mL did not show any significant toxic effects. Interestingly, however, inclusion of a higher concentration of 500 μg/mL of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> similarly showed no toxic effects, but maintained up to 100% of the cell viability induced by LPS toxicity [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Separately, Yun et al. evaluated the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in a two-week and the other a 13-week repeated-dose toxicity study using Sprague–Dawley rats. The rats were given oral doses of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg body weight. An assessment of the sub-chronic toxicity of these 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts given by oral administration in the rats showed potentially treatment-related results, with respect to mortality, hematology, body weight, organ weight, food/water consumption, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, necropsy, and histopathology, at varying doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight. Meanwhile, no adverse effects of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts in the 13-week sub-chronic toxicity study were observed, which was considered to be the result of the use of only up to a 2000 mg/kg body weight dose in the rats [
