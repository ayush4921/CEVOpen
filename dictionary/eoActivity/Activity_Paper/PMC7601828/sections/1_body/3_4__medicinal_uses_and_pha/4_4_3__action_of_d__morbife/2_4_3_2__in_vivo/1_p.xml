<p>Kim et al. reported the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in the context of cadmium-induced hippocampus neurotoxicity in a rat model. Their study suggests that 100 mg/kg daily of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> for 28 days by oral administration attenuates cadmium-induced cognitive dysfunction via an increase in AChE activity, cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the hippocampus [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> given at 100 mg/kg daily for four weeks significantly reduced mercury levels in hippocampus homogenates, lessened ROS generation, and reversed hippocampal activities in a dimethylmercury-induced rat model [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar findings also demonstrated that treatment with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 100 mg/kg effectively restored the hypothyroidism-induced changes in the levels of thyroxine (T4), serum triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormones in the hippocampus of rats [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Lee et al. evaluated the effect of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 100 mg/kg daily given orally for 10 weeks to D-galactose-treated mice and observed a significantly greater enhanced in swimming speed, escape latency, and spatial memory preference. In addition, this treatment significantly attenuated the microglial activation and decrease in inflammatory cytokine expression in the rat hippocampus. The same study also observed that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administration significantly increased IL-4 expression, but did not result in significant changes in the IL-10 levels in the rat hippocampus [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in a mouse model of neurodegeneration induced by MPTP. Specifically, the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 200 mg/kg given orally triggered improved behavioral function, inhibited neuroinflammation mediated by microglial activation, significantly attenuated neuronal loss, and subsequently restored tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in MPTP-induced PD mice [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Kim et al. found that pretreatment with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 100 µg/mL reduced the levels of intracellular ROS and cognitive damage, and protected against neuronal cell death induced by A
 <italic>β</italic>1–42 peptide. In addition, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> given at 100 and 300 mg/kg enhanced the cholinergic system and antioxidant levels and altered the expression of both phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, in an A
 <italic>β</italic>1–42 peptide-induced Alzheimer’s model [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the hippocampus, diabetic mice treated with 20 and 50 mg/kg ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> showed significantly improved glucose tolerance status, reduced behavioral impairments (e.g., Morris water maze, Y-maze and passive avoidance test), and appeared noticeably recovered, according to observations of modulating cholinergic systems, such as ACh level and the inhibition of AChE, and antioxidant systems. Additionally, significant protection against mitochondria damage was also achieved by inhibiting p-Akt, p-IRS, p-JNK, and p-tau protein expression levels [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Kim et al. evaluated the anti-amnesic effect of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts 300 mg/kg daily administration for 11 weeks improved the behavioral function and significantly diminished serum insulin, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels that had been increased as a result of streptozotocin-induction in a rat model. In addition, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> treatment potentially inhibited AChE activity and increased the ACh level in the hippocampus in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In cesium chloride-induced Sprague–Dawley rats, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> was orally administered at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg daily for four weeks, and the results suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administration significantly and concentration-dependently reduced the inflammatory response in the kidneys, and increased the antioxidant enzyme levels in the hippocampus, although it did not decrease the accumulation of cesium in the blood, kidney, or liver [
