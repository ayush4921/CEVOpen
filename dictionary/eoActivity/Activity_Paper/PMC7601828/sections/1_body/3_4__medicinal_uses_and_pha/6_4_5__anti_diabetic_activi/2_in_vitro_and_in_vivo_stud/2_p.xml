<p>Sachan et al. recently confirmed the protective effects of leaf and stem extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> against streptozotocin-induced renal fibrosis. However, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> water extracts at 25 mg/kg administration protected body and organ weight loss and significantly increased serum BUN and creatinine levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, and oxidative stress parameters in diabetic rats. In addition, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts protected against histopathological damage in the kidney and pancreas in a diabetic rat model, and caused a subsequent significant reduction in microalbumin, KIM-1, SBP1, and PKM2 levels in the urinary excretion of diabetic rats following the administration of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>. Additionally, the water extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines and fibrosis markers in the kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 30, 60, and 100 mg/kg daily given orally for 14 days achieved significant and concentration-dependent hypoglycemic activity, by significantly decreasing the total cholesterol, serum glucose, urea, triglyceride, creatinine, uric acid, and alanine amino transferase (ALT), and aspartate amino transferase (AST) levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Interestingly, the anti-diabetic activities of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> was more effective than that observed with the use of glibenclamide 600 µg/kg, a known anti-diabetic agent [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administered at 20 and 50 mg/kg, which significantly enhanced glucose tolerance, and regulated antioxidant enzyme levels in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice. The study suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> treatment protected against abnormal activity of mitochondria, improved p-JNK, p-IRS, p-Akt, and inhibited p-tau protein expression. Finally, luteolin-7-O-rutinoside, rutin, isoorientin, and orientin were identified as the main phenolic compounds of ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) analysis [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other studies reported that the administration of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg concentration-dependently stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, leading to the development of protein and gene expressions related to insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in db/db mice [
 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Interestingly, Young et al. showed that the four extracts, including the water extracts of the leaves and stem and ethanol extracts of the leaves and stem, of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administered at 25 to 100 µg/kg maintained body weight, enhanced insulin concentration, and reduced the glucose concentration in the blood in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The overall study results support that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and its bioactive ingredients show potential as anti-diabetic active agents for inclusion in anti-hyperglycemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies (
