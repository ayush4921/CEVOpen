<p>Liver disorders are a leading cause of concern worldwide and available medical treatment options are potentially insufficient. As such, a huge number of plant extracts and their bioactive compounds have been proposed to have significant hepatoprotective activity or to be treatment agents [
 <xref rid="B90-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The ethanolic root, leaves, and stem extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL exhibited strong antioxidant properties, showed hepatoprotective activity against t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced HepG2 cells, reduced ROS generation, and lowered the mRNA level of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated Raw246.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Elsewhere, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and its isolated compounds, chlorogenic acid and rutin, were investigated against alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity in the human liver cancer HepG2 cell line model. 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at different concentrations 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL was reported to protect from liver injury by scavenging the ROS generation in chronic alcoholism, and was proven to be useful as a functional food product supplement to stop liver injury caused by excessive alcohol consumption [
 <xref rid="B91-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The in vivo experimental results showed that the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administered at 100 and 300 mg/kg resulted in the prevention of ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity due to reductions in serum AST and ALT levels, and by maintaining enzymatic oxidant status and suppressing cytochrome P-450 2E1 expression. In addition, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activities and reduced blood ethanol concentrations in alcohol-induced hepatocyte-injured rats [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The results suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and its primary active constituents were a source of antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties, and indicated their potential as therapeutic agents.
