<p>Most chemically synthesized anti-cancer agents are extremely toxic, not only to cancer cells, it is also highly toxic to normal living cells as well. Considerable recent attention has been given to using plants as natural sources of medicinal components, especially to their bioactive compounds which may exhibit their therapeutic effect by destroying cancer cells with minimal deleterious effects to the normal cells. At present, more than 60% of currently used anti-cancer drugs have been formed from natural sources, such as medicinal plants, marine organisms, and microorganisms [

Meanwhile, vinca alkaloids, vincristine, and vinblastine have also been used to treat cancer and the developed as possible anti-cancer agents based on previous scientific studies that revealed that different classes of medicinal plant products, including flavonoids, polyacetylene, and alkaloids show potential as anti-cancer agents [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaves with potential anticomplement and anti-cancer effects have showed cytotoxic activity against different tumor cell lines (L-1210, H-4IIE, Hep-G2, and A-431), but not against normal hepatocytes [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> species and its active components in various cancer experiments is presented and discussed (
