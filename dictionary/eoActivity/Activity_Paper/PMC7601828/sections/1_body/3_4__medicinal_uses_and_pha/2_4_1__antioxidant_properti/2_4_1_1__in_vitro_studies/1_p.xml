<p>Previous preclinical studies have shown that 
 <italic>D. moribifera</italic> displays potential antioxidant activities and enhances cellular antioxidant defense systems by acting as a direct free-radical scavenger, thus reducing lipid peroxidation and various oxidative insults. Moreover, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts displayed 2,2-dipheny-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical scavenging activity patterns, similar to those of butylated hydroxytoluene and vitamin C, within a range of 31.3–62.5 µg/mL. However, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts exhibited the potentially higher DPPH-radical scavenging activity of 82.92 ± 0.49% compared to butylated hydroxytoluene, at 56.71 ± 6.34%, and vitamin C, at 90.11 ± 0.13%, respectively, in the positive control groups, at the highest concentration 500 µg/mL. These results support the existence of DPPH-radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 82.92 ± 0.49% to a similar degree as that of vitamin C 90.11 ± 0.13%, at the same concentration of 500 µg/mL [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>, using DPPH-free radical scavenging, and 2, 2’-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) assay. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values for the DPPH assay for hot water, 30% ethanol and 60% ethanol were 6.89 mg/mL, 5.70 mg/mL, and 5.59 mg/mL, while those for ABTS for hot water, 30% ethanol and 60% ethanol were 3.79 mg/mL, 3.75 mg/mL, and 3.58 mg/mL, respectively [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in a 10 to 200 µg/mL treatment inhibited intracellular active oxygen production against hepatocellular injury induced by 
 <italic>t</italic>- BHP. These results suggest that active component acting as an antioxidant is present in the extract; it can be shown that various parts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts significantly and concentration-dependently suppressed ROS production in HepG2 cells [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>, using DPPH and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay in HS68 skin fibroblast cells. These results suggest that stem parts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>, potentially obtained concentration-dependently, enhanced the antioxidant activity through increased the DPPH-radical scavenging activity and SOD activity [
