<p>To summarize, this study provides first time up-to-date information on the potentially active phytochemicals, plant parts, extraction method, and number of active compounds present in the raw materials of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and other 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> species. This review presented the most recent in vitro and in vivo studies on 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> to provide greater accessibility to the established experimental and clinical data. Finally, this review elucidates the importance of 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> spp., and provides guidance for the future development of the compounds with medicinal value. The medicinally active compounds found in 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> parts such as roots, dried barks, leaves, and stem, as a novelty, this review focuses on the collection and preparation of plants, the extraction of active compounds, and the bioactive molecules present in the plant raw material. Moreover, the study claims its advantage by providing comprehensive references for the new drug lead research from 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and other species.
