<p>In the present investigation, the potential of plants of the 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus to yield several bioactive samples, both from pure compounds and crude extracts, may authenticate a degree of effectiveness concerning the impacts of their biological activities. Herein, a critical evaluation of the molecular basis of cellular and animal models of pharmacological activities, the mode of actions, toxicology and ethnomedicinal uses of the 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> species is presented. This study ultimately aims to offer a well-designed summary and possible recommendations for existing studies to consider that might direct future research. The total number of 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus-related publications registered in Pub Med literature database is shown in (
