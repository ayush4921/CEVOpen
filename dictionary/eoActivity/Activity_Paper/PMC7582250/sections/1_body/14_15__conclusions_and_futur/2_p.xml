<p>Due to the diversified pharmacological properties of plant-derived bioactive compounds, many researchers are focusing on developing plant-derived products for cancer treatments. Stem cell therapy by using plant-derived bioactive compounds and targeted biomarker development will replace the current synthetic ones. There are many anticancer phytochemicals without a clear mechanism of action, hence many of these compounds have to be subjected to clinical trials. Clinical trials are important, because they help in validating efficacies and adverse effects associated with those compounds. Combining traditional medicinal practices with modern treatments is one of the suggested approaches in the treatment and management of various types cancer for improved effectiveness.</p>
