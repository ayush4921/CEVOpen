<p>β-sitosterol is an important plant-derived bioactive compound used for the treatment of different medical conditions. It has diversified medicinal benefits such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antifertility, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. β-sitosterol inhibits tumor cell proliferation and activates the apoptotic pathway of various cancer cell lines. Cancer cell lines through which β-sitosterol exerts its anticancer activities include, breast, colon, lung, gastric, and prostate cancers [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. β-sitosterol anticancer activities have been explored and induce endoreduplication in HL60 and U937 cell lines via PI3K/Akt and Bcl-2 pathways. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, β-sitosterol inhibits tumor cell growth, inducing G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic activities, downregulates NF-kB activities, upregulates the expression of Bax, and downregulates the expression of Bcl-2 protein [
