<p>The possible mechanism of action of plant-derived phytochemicals are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04435-f003">Figure 3</xref>, which involves either the activation or inhibition of cellular pathways. Bioactive compounds extracted from natural sources promote apoptotic pathways, immune responses, and autophagy and inhibits different phases of cell cycle as well as the migration and invasion of cancerous cells. It is scientifically evident that scutellarein phytocompounds possess anticancer properties against a broad spectrum of cancers, including breast, colon, lung, prostate, renal, and tongue cancers. These phytocompounds induce tumor cell death through multiple cellular pathways. The molecular targets include apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferative inhibition pathways [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Scutellarein play an important role in tumor suppression in prostate cancer cells. They induce tumor cell death through upregulation of caspase 3, 9, G2/M-phase cell cycle arrests and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as shown in

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Scutellarein are also able to induce apoptotic activities in liver cancer cell line HepG2 through activation of caspase-3 enzymes and STAT3 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This phytochemical is also able to suppress the invasion and migration of human hepatocellular carcinomas via inhibition of Akt-STAT3/Girdin activities [
