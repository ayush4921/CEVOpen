 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04435-f002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates various steps involved in tumor development and its fate. The first step involves the interaction of carcinogenic agents and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. Once inside, the carcinogens will interact with the genetic material of the cell leading to mutations. On the other hand, ROS interfere with the proteins and enzymatic activities of the cell. In step 6, the normal cell transforms into a cancerous cell, and step 7 shows the proliferation of cancer cells. The continuous proliferation of cancer cells leads to the formation of a tumor (step 8).
