<p>There are many studies conducted in the past decades. These studies reported that the in vitro activities of medicinal plants have originated from Egypt and Asian countries [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04435-f002">Figure 2</xref> (steps 9 and 10), the bioactive compounds are extracted from different parts of the plant and administered on the cancer cells. Once the cancer cells are treated with bioactive compounds, the cancer cells will then have two fates, as shown in steps 11 and 12, respectively. Under step 11, the cancer cells become normal after the treatment with bioactive compounds or the cells may enter in the apoptotic cell death phase by the action of phytochemicals (step 12) [
