 <italic>D. schinzii</italic>, 
 <italic>D. capensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. anomala</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. zeyheri</italic> have been investigated for medicinal use and were classified based on their phytochemical composition. However, only one species (
 <italic>D. schinzii</italic>) out of the four exhibited similarities in terms of bioactive compound composition. These compounds are classified into different groups: acetylenic compounds, phenolic acids, flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and phytosterols. These natural compounds derived from plants are seen to be non-toxic to non-cancerous cells or normal cells, and these compounds are used in the treatment of different cancers such as breast, ovarian, prostate, and kidney [
