<p>The FT-IR spectrum of 
 <bold>A3</bold> illustrated intense carbonyl band (C=O) of chalcones at 1695 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and strong stretching band at 1573 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> accounting for vinyl (CH=CH) double bond. In addition, the other absorption bands were seen at wave numbers 3230 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (-NH in indole) and 1263 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (-CF
 <sub>3</sub>). Two doublet peaks at 7.77 ppm and 8.13 ppm with the coupling constant value around 16 Hz in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum confirmed the formation of chalcone bridge of 
 <bold>A3</bold> with trans geometry. The indole -NH proton showed a peak at 8.78 and the other nine aromatic protons showed two multiplets around 7.94–8.14 and 7.05–7.61, respectively. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of compound 
 <bold>A3</bold> demonstrated three peaks at 189.93, 128.60, and 142.02 corresponding to the three carbons of the propenone moiety. The other 
 <sup>13</sup>C peaks include 140.11 (C-1′), 128.60 (C-2′ and 6′), 125.59 (C-3′ and 5′), 137.30 (C-4′), 123.77 (C-4,′), 129.52 (C-6′), 112.06 (C-1″), 125.30 (C-2″), 130.30 (C-4″), 114.06 (C-5″), 120.71 (C-6″), 122.02 (C-7″), 117.44 (C-8″), 125.56 (C-9″). The mass spectrum of 
 <bold>A3</bold> recorded in positive mode has given an [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> peak at m/z 316.30. In the 
 <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectrum, 
 <bold>A3</bold> showed signal at 63.27 ppm corresponding to -CF
 <sub>3.</sub> The above spectral data confirmed the compound 
 <bold>A3</bold> as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-3-(1″H-indol-3″-yl)-1-[4′-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]prop-2-en-1-one.
