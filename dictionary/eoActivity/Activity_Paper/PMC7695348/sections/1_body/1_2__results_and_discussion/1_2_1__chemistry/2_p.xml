<p>All the compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, whereas the compounds 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold>, were additionally characterized by 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR and mass spectral methods. The elemental analysis and spectroscopic data were consistent with the expected structures of the chalcones. All the compounds in their FT-IR spectrum showed two characteristic stretching absorption bands corresponding to the propenone linkage including C=O and C=C around the wave numbers 1656–1695 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1502–1514 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for the ten compounds in series-A and 1640–1656 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1502–1532 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for series-B compounds, respectively. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra showed two diagnostic doublet signals corresponding to 
 <italic>α</italic>- and 
 <italic>β</italic>-protons resonating between the chemical shift values of 7.32–7.75 ppm and 7.76–8.04 ppm (series-A) and 7.51–7.65 ppm and 7.60–8.18 ppm (series-B). The coupling constant value, 
 <italic>J</italic>, for these doublets ranged between 15 to 17 Hz, and such large coupling constant values indicate that the synthesized compounds have 
 <italic>trans</italic> geometry at the olefinic bond of the propenone linkage.
