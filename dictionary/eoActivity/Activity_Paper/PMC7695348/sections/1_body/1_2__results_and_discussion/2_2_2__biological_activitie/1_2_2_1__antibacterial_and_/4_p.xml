<p>Except 
 <bold>B3</bold>, all the other compounds displayed intermediate-to-low activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> compared to the standard drugs. When the activities of other compounds against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were compared with the standard drugs, the compounds 
 <bold>A1(B1)</bold>, 
 <bold>A4(B4)</bold>, 
 <bold>A5(B5)</bold>, 
 <bold>A6(B6)</bold>, 
 <bold>A7(B7)</bold>, 
 <bold>A8,</bold> and 
 <bold>A9</bold> were found to be more active. Further, among the above 12 compounds, 
 <bold>A1</bold> and 
 <bold>A7</bold> containing 2,3-dichlorophenyl and 2-furfuryl rings were next in potency to 
 <bold>A3</bold> in series-A and 
 <bold>B1</bold>, 
 <bold>B4</bold>, and 
 <bold>B5</bold> containing 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 2-nitrophenyl, and 3-nitrophenyl scaffolds after 
 <bold>B3</bold> in series-B. The chalcones 
 <bold>A1(B1)</bold>, 
 <bold>B2</bold>, 
 <bold>A4(B4)</bold>, and 
 <bold>A5(B5)</bold> were more active than benzyl penicillin against 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, and the compounds 
 <bold>A1</bold> (2,3-dichlorophenyl), 
 <bold>A4</bold> (2-nitrophenyl), 
 <bold>A5</bold> (3-nitrophenyl), 
 <bold>B2</bold> (3-chlorophenyl), 
 <bold>B4</bold> (2-nitrophenyl), and 
 <bold>B5</bold> (3-nitrophenyl) showed equal activity with a ZOI value of 20 mm, whereas the compound 
 <bold>B1</bold> containing 2,3-dichlrophenyl moiety showed activity similar to 
 <bold>B3</bold> (ZOI = 21 mm). These results suggest that presence of an electron-withdrawing group like chlorine or nitro at 2nd and 3rd positions of aryl ring are essential for the activity. The compounds 
 <bold>A2</bold> and 
 <bold>A7</bold> bearing 3-chlorophenyl and 2-furfuryl rings showed equal activity as benzyl penicillin (ZOI = 19 mm) against 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <bold>B1</bold> exhibited equal potency as fluconazole against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> with a ZOI of 19 mm. All the other compounds including 
 <bold>A8(B8)</bold> and 
 <bold>A9(B9)</bold> containing 4-chlorophenyl and 4-nitrophenyl rings as well as 
 <bold>A6(B6)</bold> and 
 <bold>A10(B10)</bold> containing heteroaromatic 2-thienyl and 2-pyrrolyl rings, respectively, showed intermediate-to-poor activity relative to the standard drugs. Based on these results, we can summarize that either in series-A or B, the conditions of the ring B-portion of chalcones being either an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups in the ortho and meta positions or a bicyclic heteroaromatic scaffold are essential to the promising antimicrobial activity of the fluorinated chalcones.
