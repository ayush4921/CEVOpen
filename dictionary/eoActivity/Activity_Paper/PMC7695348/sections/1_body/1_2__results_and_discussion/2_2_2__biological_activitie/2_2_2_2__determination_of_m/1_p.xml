<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent that inhibits the visible growth of a microorganism after an overnight incubation. MICs are used to determine the resistance by the diagnostic labs mainly to confirm the resistance. However, frequently MIC is a research tool to determine the in vitro activity of novel natural and synthetic compounds. The two most potent compounds that emerged out of this study, i.e., 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> were further evaluated against all the six microbial strains by serial tube dilution to assess their minimum inhibitory concentration by serial tube dilution method (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00375-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Both the compounds showed MIC lower than the standard drugs benzyl penicillin and fluconazole against the tested bacterial and fungal strains and were in agreement with the zone of inhibition values. However, compound 
 <bold>A3</bold> showed less activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC = 101 µM) than benzyl penicillin (MIC = 95 µM). Both 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> exhibited nearly equal activity to that of fluconazole against the fungal strains and superior activity compared to benzyl penicillin. Compound 
 <bold>A3</bold> (MIC = 51 µM) and 
 <bold>B3</bold> (MIC = 48 µM) were 1.86- and 1.97-fold more active than benzyl penicillin (MIC = 95 µM) against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> (MIC = 24 µM) was 3.95 times more active than benzyl penicillin against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <bold>A3</bold> was 7.64 times more active than benzyl penicillin whereas 
 <bold>B3</bold> was 7.95 and 3.97 times more active. These results show that the activity of 
 <bold>A3</bold> containing a trifluoromethyl group favored the Gram-negative bacteria and 
 <bold>B3</bold> with a trifluoromethoxy group favored Gram-positive bacteria. The obtained results were interesting and called for a synthesis and evaluation of other analogues to improve the potency.
