<p>All the 20 target compounds (
 <bold>A1</bold>–
 <bold>A10</bold> and 
 <bold>B1</bold>–
 <bold>B10</bold>) were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities on selected pathogenic Gram-positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>) bacterial (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00375-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and fungal (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>) strains (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00375-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The compounds were tested at 0.1% concentration. Benzyl penicillin was employed as standard drug against the bacterial isolates and fluconazole against the fungal strains. The compounds were partitioned into three different categories based on the type of ring-B portion of chalcones. Among the 20 target derivatives, 
 <bold>A2(B2)</bold>, 
 <bold>A4(B4)</bold>, 
 <bold>A5(B5)</bold>, 
 <bold>A8(B8)</bold>, and 
 <bold>A9(B9)</bold> represents chalcones bearing a monosubstituted aryl ring, 
 <bold>A1(B1)</bold> denotes compounds with a disubstituted aryl ring, and 
 <bold>A3(B3)</bold>, 
 <bold>A6(B6)</bold>, 
 <bold>A7(B7)</bold>, and 
 <bold>A10(B10)</bold> designate the compounds containing an unsubstituted heteroaromatic ring.
