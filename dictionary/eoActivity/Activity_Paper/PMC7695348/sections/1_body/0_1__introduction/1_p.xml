<p>Infectious diseases in human beings are caused by microbes including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These diseases are treated by employing a range of antimicrobials available in the market. The utility of antimicrobials in therapy is ever-increasing, which is leading to the most dangerous problem, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [

 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Resistance to antimicrobial agents is a major threat to public health and is responsible for significant rise in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization. Keeping this in view, World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a preamble “
 <italic>no action today no cure tomorrow</italic>” to counteract the trouble of AMR [

 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The limitations of current antimicrobial agents like AMR, untoward side-effects, lengthier treatment period, and improper therapeutic outcomes compel the development of more effective novel antimicrobial chemical entities that can be employed as drugs. Scientists are in a continuous search for novel antimicrobial agents employing different strategies. One common strategy followed by researchers is the design and synthesis of small molecules for testing them as prospective antimicrobial drug candidates. Small molecule drugs play a significant role in treating different types of diseases. In recent years, according to United States-Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA), the development of small molecules has reduced to some extent (74% in 2017 and 71% in 2018). However, in 2019, nearly 70% of the total of approved targeted drugs were small molecules [

Small molecules bring chemical diversity in less time and with ease compared to isolation, structural elucidation and biological testing of natural products. Additionally, screening of small molecule libraries derived through laboratory synthesis is widely employed in the pharmaceutical industry to identify lead molecules with potential drug-like properties [
