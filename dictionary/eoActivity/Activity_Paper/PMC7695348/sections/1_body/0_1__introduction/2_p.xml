<p>Chalcones are bichromophoric natural open-chain flavonoid small molecules containing a reactive propenone linkage connected to two aromatic rings. The propenone moiety of these molecules is highly reactive and is not only responsible for the assorted biological activities of chalcone derivatives [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but also for the preparation of different heterocyclic derivatives from the chalcones. Chalcone is a privileged scaffold of interest to organic and medicinal chemists because of its ease of synthesis and multiple biological activities. Chulin et al. have published a critical and comprehensive review on this privileged scaffold [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Chalcone derivatives containing fluorine and or other types of substituents were reported to possess excellent anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, cancer chemopreventive, antibacterial, and antifungal activities [

 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a difference in the biological potency of different chalcones, which is majorly attributed to the type of aromatic ring as well as the nature of the substituents present thereof. Literature survey and results from our own studies proved that fluorinated chalcones possess remarkable antibacterial and antifungal properties (

 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The potent antimicrobial properties of the chalcones may be due to extra lipophilicity created by the fluorine atoms. With few exceptions, most of the antimicrobial fluorinated chalcones reported typically possess one or more fluorine atoms on the two aryl rings of the chalcone scaffold but not either a trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy group. For instance, out of the eight compounds displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref>, only compound 
 <bold>7</bold> possesses a trifluoromethyl group. Hence, in the present study we considered synthesizing and evaluating novel chalcones with trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy groups as prospective antibacterial and antifungal agents.
