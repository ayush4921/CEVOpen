<p>After 24 h of incubation, the lymphocytes were treated individually with different concentrations of EAP (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/mL), CPA (100 μg/mL), and also co-treated with CPA+EAP (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/mL). The normal controls (untreated cultures) were also run simultaneously. The culture vials were incubated for 48 h. One hour before (after 47 h), 0.2 mL of colchicine (0.01%) was added to each vial and incubated at 37°C for 45 min. After incubation, the cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,200 rpm and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was added with 5 mL of prewarmed (37°C) potassium chloride hypotonic solution (0.075 M). Cells were resuspended and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After hypotonic treatment, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The lymphocytes were fixed by adding ice cold fixative solution comprised of methanol and acetic acid in the ratio of 3:1. The slides were prepared using standard method described by

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Moorhead et al. (1960)</xref>. During observations and for calculating CAs, the gaps were not included according to 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Mace et al. (1978)</xref>. The number of CAs was obtained by calculating the percentage of metaphases from control, individually treated and co-treated, and for each concentration tested that showed structural alterations. The CA was classified according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Paz-y-Miño et al., 2002</xref>). CAs were evaluated in 200 well spread metaphases per concentration (a total 100 metaphases per donor). The results were expressed as the number of CAs/cell and % of abnormal cells.
