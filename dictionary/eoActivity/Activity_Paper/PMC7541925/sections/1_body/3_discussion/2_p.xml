<p>The phytochemical screening methods are of supreme importance in identifying new sources of pharmacologically important compounds having therapeutic values and to make the best and sensible use of available natural resources (
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Mungole et al., 2010</xref>). This study examined the phytochemical composition of ethanol extract from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>. The results revealed that the extract is rich in tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroids. The phenolic compounds are one of the largest and most ubiquitous plant metabolites reported to have potential health benefits due to their antioxidant nature. The total phenolic content of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> was found to be 35.66Â±3.42 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g of extract. The high amount of total phenolic content observed in the extract justifies its health promoting effects owing to antioxidant activities. A total of 11 major bioactive compounds including 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid, 
 <italic>tert</italic>-decanoic acid, phytol, oleic acid, octadecanoic acid, stigmasterols, and sitosterols were identified in the extract using GC-MS analysis.
