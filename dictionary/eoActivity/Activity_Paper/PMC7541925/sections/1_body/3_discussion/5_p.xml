<p>From the above results, it can be inferred that EAP was non mutagenic and not genotoxic at all five concentrations tested. Furthermore, EAP exerted an excellent beneficial effect against genotoxic impacts of the known mutagen and chemotherapeutic agent CPA. Our results corroborate previous studies on antigenotoxic effect of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>, in which the plant has been reported to ameliorate the aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub>-induced toxicity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study has reported that the 70% ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. panicu-lata</italic> increased the life spans of mice injected with thymoma cells (

Therefore, the search for antimutagenic compounds from natural sources and divulging their mechanism of action represents a fast-growing field of cancer research (
