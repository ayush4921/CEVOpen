<p>In summary, the findings from this study show that 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract is rich in flavonoids, phenolic contents, and other bioactive constituents. The results of the study clearly indicated that 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> is antimutagenic in nature and had a protective effect against CPA induced genotoxicity. From the results, it is reasonable to conclude that the consumption of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> is safe and can protect cells from a variety of environmental mutagens and carcinogens. However, further studies on isolation and characterization of specific bioactive principle(s) and their mechanism of action in other 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models are warranted and under progress in our laboratory. 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> can be used in reducing the risks of cancers and also as a supplement with chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce their toxic side effects.
