<p>Similar results (as that of CAs) were obtained for SCE and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The lymphocyte cultures exposed to 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract (50âˆ¼250 mg/mL) did not show any changes in SCE, when compared to normal control. However, the cells co-treated with CPA +EAP showed a significant reduction (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 or 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01) in SCEs per chromosome and mean SCEs/cell compared to CPA treated cells. The results again reaffirm the antimutagenic nature and antigenotoxic potential of the extract against CPA.
