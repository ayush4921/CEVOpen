<p>Based on the pharmacological properties of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> collected through our literature survey, particularly the antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties desirable for antimutagenic activity, this study was performed on the antimutagenic and antigenotoxic consequences of this plant extract against CPA induced genotoxicity on human peripheral lymphocytes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Qualitative phytochemical screening, quantitative estimation of total phenolic contents (TPC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the extract were also observed to shed light on its phytoconstituents and bioac-tive principles.
