<p>Similarly, the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay of triterpenoids from 
 <italic>E. pedroi</italic> against human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo320), the sensitive cell line (Colo205), and the human embryonic fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5) was investigated and reported. While no appreciable activity (IC50 &gt; 10 μM) was observed for all of the tested triterpenoids (
 <bold>61</bold>, 
 <bold>62</bold>, 
 <bold>103</bold>–
 <bold>105</bold>), oleanolic acid (
 <bold>106</bold>) exhibited better activity against resistant mouse lymphoma cells. Also, cycloart-25-ene-3β-24-diol (
