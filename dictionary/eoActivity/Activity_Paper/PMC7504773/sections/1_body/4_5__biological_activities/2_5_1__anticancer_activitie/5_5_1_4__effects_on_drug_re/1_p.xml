<p>Drug resistance occurs mostly in microbial pathogens, where in some way, they (microorganism) reduce the effectiveness of a given drug. Certain proteins commonly recognized as cluster of differentiation 243 (CD243) are known to cause multidrug resistance (MDR). This has been the reason behind the failure of many cancer therapies. However, the glycoprotein (P-gp or Pgp), which is normally programmed with multidrug gene 1 (MDR1) pumps out of the cell any foreign materials/substances [
