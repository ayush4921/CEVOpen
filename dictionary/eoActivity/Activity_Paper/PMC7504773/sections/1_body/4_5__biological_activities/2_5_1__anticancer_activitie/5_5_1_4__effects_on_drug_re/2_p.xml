 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. While the compounds alatavoic acid (
 <bold>121</bold>), 3,2-seco-taraxer-14-en-3,2-lactone (
 <bold>117</bold>), and 3-hydroxy-4,4,8,14-tetramethyl-18-norpregnan-20-one isolated from 
 <italic>E. alatavica</italic> exhibited potent cytotoxicity. However, 3-hydroxy-4,4,8,14-tetramethyl-18-norpregnan-20-one exhibited highest potent cytotoxicity against A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cells, with IC50 values of 6.5 ± 3.1 μM, 1.9± 0.9 μM, 8.6 ± 3.5 μM, respectively, better than the positive control doxorubicin (DOX) (IC50 values: 4.2 ± 0.3 μM, 7.2 ± 2.6 μM, 15.7 ± 4.2 μM), while the compound alatavoic acid (
 <bold>121</bold>) showed better cytotoxicity than other isolated compounds, with IC50 values of 16.4 ± 3.2 μM [
