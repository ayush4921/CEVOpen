<p>Emerging evidence has further demonstrated that 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species exhibit various pharmacological activities such as anticancer properties in vitro because of the rich production of bioactive constituents [

These constituents are thought to be cytotoxic via different mechanisms of action such as cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis and inhibition of metastasis, excessive production of reactive oxygen, and effects on angiogenesis [
