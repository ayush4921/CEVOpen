<p>The cytotoxicity effects of a given targeted therapy against cancer cells can be achieved through several pathways. Cycloartanes tetracyclic triterpenoids, including; 25-hydroperoxycycloart-23-en-3β-ol (
 <bold>67</bold>), cycloartenol (
 <bold>74</bold>), 24-hydroperoxycycloart-25-en-3β-ol (
 <bold>76</bold>) and taraxerone (
 <bold>120</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma (HCT 116), a human cancer cell line. The triterpenoid 25-hydroperoxycycloart-23-en-3β-ol (
 <bold>67</bold>) and 24-hydroperoxycycloart-25-en-3β-ol (
 <bold>76</bold>) showed good activity with an IC50 value of 4.8 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, while taraxerone (
 <bold>120</bold>) and cycloartenol (
 <bold>74</bold>) were inactive against HCT 116. However, 
 <bold>67</bold> and 
 <bold>76</bold> were tested for cytotoxicity against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (A549) with an IC50 value of 4.5 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In addition, taraxast-12-ene-3β, 20, 21(α)-triol, cycloartane-3β, 25-diol (
 <bold>119</bold>), and cycloartane-3β, 24, 25-triol isolated from 
 <italic>E. denticulate</italic> exhibited cytotoxic effects, with IC50 values of 12.2 ± 2.9, 27.5 ± 4.9, and 18.3 ± 1.4 μM, against prostate cancer cells, respectively [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Furthermore, eupha-8, 25-diene-3, 24-diol-7,11-dione (
 <bold>5</bold>), eupha-8,24-diene-3β,11β-diol-7-one (
 <bold>6</bold>), and eupha-8-ene-3β,11β-diol-7,24-dione (
 <bold>7</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>E. resinifera</italic>, exhibited various degrees of cytotoxic effects against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and cellosaurus (C6) cancer cell lines. However, (−)-(24
 <italic>R</italic>)-tirucalla-8,25-diene-3
 <italic>β</italic>,24-diol (
 <bold>8</bold>) displayed the highest potency against MCF-7 and C6, with IC50 values of 56.2 μM and 49.6 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Later on, the cytotoxic activities of triterpenoids (
 <bold>49</bold>, 
 <bold>50</bold>, 
 <bold>53</bold>) from 
 <italic>E. schimperi</italic> were evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay against MCF-7, HepG2, and HCT-116 cancer cell lines. Cycloart-25-en-3-one (
 <bold>53</bold>) and 26,27-dinor-3β-hydroxy cycloartan-25-al (
 <bold>50</bold>) showed the highest cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 0.18 μM and 0.60 μM, respectively, when compared to an IC50 value of 0.20 μM for doxorubicin [
