<p>Anti-influenza activities of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> constituents have also been reported. For instance, a novel anti-influenza molecule 1,3,4,6-tetra-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-Î²-Dglucopyranoside, was identified from the extracts of 
 <italic>E. humifusa</italic>. The identified compound was then evaluated by measurement of its inhibition ability of the influenza viruses by utilizing a high-throughput image assay method. The results showed that the molecule possessed anti-influenza activities against seasonal influenza A strains as well as seasonal influenza B strain. Further studies revealed that it inhibits the nuclear export of influenza nucleoproteins (NP) associated with early stages of the infection [
