<p>If the squalene-2,3-oxide is folded into a chair-chair-chair-boat conformation on the enzyme surface, an intermediate dammarenyl cation is produced. A series of cyclization of the cation followed by a chain of Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements of 1,2-hydride shift, deprotonation and 1,2-methyl migrations leads to formation of different triterpene scaffolds of various skeletal structures such as euphane, tirucallane, lanostane, as well as other tetracyclic triterpenoids.</p>
