<p>Consequently, the 1,2-alkyl shift in the dammarenyl cation leads to the formation of bacharenyl cation, which undergoes further cyclization, ring expansion, hydride shifts, rearrangement, and methyl shifts to form various skeletal intermediates of pentacyclic triterpenoids like lupane, oleanane, ursanes, taraxanes, and friedelane [
