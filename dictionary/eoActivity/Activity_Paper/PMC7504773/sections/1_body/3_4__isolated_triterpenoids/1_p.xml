<p>The phytochemistry of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> genus is complex with a variety of chemical constituents of different classes. Among them, the structural diversity of cyclic triterpenes is incredible. At least over 130 different types of triterpenoids have been isolated to date from different 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species. Reported evidence shows that tetracyclic triterpenoids are the major triterpenoids in 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species and occur in three main classes; tirucallane (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>19</bold>), euphane (
 <bold>20</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold>), lanostane (
 <bold>85</bold>–
 <bold>94</bold>), and cycloartanes (
 <bold>40</bold>–
 <bold>84</bold>). Cycloartanes (9,19-cyclolanostanes) are some of the main tetracyclic triterpenes that contain the side chain and a characteristic cyclopropane ring. They are the major key intermediates in the phytosterols biosynthesis and are used as specific chemotaxonomic markers in 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> genus.
