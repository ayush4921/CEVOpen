<p>In addition, other unusual pentacyclic triterpenoids, such as eupulcherol A, with an uncommon carbon skeleton, have been isolated from 
 <italic>E. pulcherrima</italic> extracts of the whole plant. It was observed that the AB ring intersection without the methyl groups is very uncommon, though it is common in some hopanes from oils and sediments [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] described the isolation of a tetracyclic triterpenoid with an unusual spiro scaffold for the first time, which was named spiropedroxodiol. While Chao et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported for the first time, the isolation of two nor-triterpenoids from the root extracts of 
 <italic>E. ebracteolata</italic>, which were named ebracpenes A and B. Ebracpenes A was found to possess a rare C-seco ring probably occasioned through cleavage reactions, while ebracpenes B possessed an additional uncommon aromatic ring D.
