<p>As for the traditional uses of this species, no particular class of triterpenoid has been identified to a certain morphological group or linked precisely to a known medical condition. However, tirucallane, euphane, and cycloartanes triterpenoids have been identified and isolated in most of the species utilized for medicinal purposes, such as 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic>, 
 <italic>E. thymifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. mili</italic>; hence, it could be considered as the marker compound of the genus. In contrast, the highly hydroxylated pentacyclic triterpenoids, such as oleanane which are known to confer various pharmacological properties have been isolated and identified in only a few of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species.
