<p>In addition, several reviews on 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species have mainly reported their pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], ethnomedicinal usage [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the structural diversity of isolated diterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as essential oils [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, in order to promote more targeted future research of this species, consolidation of scientific reports/evidence of their ethnomedicinal uses, the chemical constituents, and the identification of possible knowledge gaps need to be addressed. In view of this, the current review reports the ethnomedicinal uses and triterpenoids isolated from 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, highlighting their anticancer activities and areas for future studies. Therefore, it is envisaged that 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> triterpenes will offer interesting scaffolds that can be used for drug discovery. It is also our hope that this review will provide a resourceful reference for the necessary information that will inform future studies on the therapeutic potential of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species and their constituents.
