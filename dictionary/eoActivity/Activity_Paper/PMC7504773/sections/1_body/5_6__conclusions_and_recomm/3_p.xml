<p>However, some studies reported no significant inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines. Furthermore, very little has been achieved in advancing these studies to clinical trials. For the many isolated triterpenoids, it is surprising that little has been done in the evaluation of their toxic effects, which is of prime importance for any drug. In addition, from the reported information, it is evident that some of the isolated triterpenoids for the first time have not been evaluated yet could be potential lead compounds for drug discovery. Therefore, for an in depth analysis of the medicinal relevance of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, detailed and extensive in vitro and in vivo studies of isolated compounds, their mode of action, and their toxicities against a wide range of pathogens need to be conducted. Furthermore, the utilization of advanced throughput screening of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> plants extracts will possibly explain the observed synergisms, as well as other mechanisms of actions of this natural products from which better new drugs will be discovered and inspired. This will also improve the available knowledge about the phytochemistry, chemical constituents, toxicity, and efficacy of the bioactive compounds, which can give scientific credence to the ethnomedicinal use of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species. In addition, the structural diversity exhibited by some rare compounds requires further studies about their potential bioactivities and their chemotaxonomic roles.
