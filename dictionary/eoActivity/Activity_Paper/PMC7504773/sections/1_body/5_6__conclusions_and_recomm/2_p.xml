<p>The biological studies reviewed in this report employed mostly in vitro studies, while some conducted in vivo studies using rodent models. Hence, the studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. Most findings from these studies reported promising anticancer activities of the isolated triterpenoids with high IC50 values. The pharmacological activities of these triterpenoids have further been associated with important functional groups on the ring. Indeed, the biological activities of highly hydroxylated pentacyclic triterpenes have been associated with the number of hydroxyl groups in the ring. Hence, hydroxylated triterpenoids could be promising anticancer agents for cancer treatment.</p>
