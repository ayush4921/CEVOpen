 <p>Heterocyclic moieties, especially five and six-membered rings containing nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms, are broadly distributed in nature. Among them, synthetic and natural alike are pharmacologically active compounds and have always been at the forefront of attention due to their pharmacological properties. Heterocycles can be divided into different groups based on the presence of characteristic structural motifs. The presence of β-amino acid and heterocyclic core in one compound is very interesting; additionally, it very often plays a vital role in their biological activity. Usually, such compounds are not considered to be chemicals containing a β-amino acid motif; however, considering them as this class of compounds may open new routes of their preparation and application as new drug precursors or even drugs. The possibility of their application as nonproteinogenic amino acid residues in peptide or peptide derivatives synthesis to prepare a new class of compounds is also promising. This review highlights the actual state of knowledge about β-amino acid moiety-containing heterocycles presenting antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial compounds, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, as well as agonist and antagonists of the receptors.</p>
