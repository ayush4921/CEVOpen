<p>Heterocyclic β-amino acids can be divided into two types, including 1-aza-polycyclo-2-acetic acid and 1-azapolycyclo-3-carboxylic acid derivatives [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although such compounds and their derivatives are not very common in nature, some examples such as homoproline, capreomycidine, tubulysine or streptolidine are known to exist. The most well-known heterocyclic β-amino acids include the 5-membered pyrrolidine and 6-membered piperidine derivatives. They are present in some alkaloids, peptides and other biologically active compounds.
