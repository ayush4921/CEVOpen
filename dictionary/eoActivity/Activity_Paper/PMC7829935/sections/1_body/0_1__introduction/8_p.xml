<p>Î²-amino acid-containing heterocycles are present in several drugs that act by being either agonists or antagonists of the receptors that respond to neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers. It is known that the selective agonism of A
 <sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors is associated with anticancer [
