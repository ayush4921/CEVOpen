<p>Heterocycles with a β-amino acid moiety can be found in compounds exhibiting antiviral properties. Some known structures act against the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Neuraminidase, a glycoprotein expressed on the influenza virus’ surface, is crucial for virus replication and infectivity by breaking the linkage between the progeny virus on the surface of the host cells’ sialo-receptors. This is a key factor in discovering new anti-influenza drugs that can inhibit neuraminidase, like tri- and tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine derivatives [
