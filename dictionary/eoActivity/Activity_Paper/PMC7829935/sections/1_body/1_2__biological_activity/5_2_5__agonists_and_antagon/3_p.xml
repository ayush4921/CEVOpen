<p>Based on the previous investigations, DeNinno et al., discovered a highly potent and selective series of adenosine A
 <sub>3</sub> agonists [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The obtained compounds, containing a β-amino acid moiety, were highly soluble in water (necessary for the intended parenteral administration route) due to the presence of one or two basic amine functional groups. Among a series of compounds, an analog of CP608039—Compound 
 <bold>35</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>)—was shown to be a potent, full agonist of the A
 <sub>3</sub> receptor (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.1 nM in the test of inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP in HEK293 cells expressing the appropriate human receptor).
