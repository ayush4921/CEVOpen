<p>It is known that there are some modifications to the adenosine scaffold that increase A
 <sub>3</sub> binding affinity and selectivity among adenosine agonists: a 5′-uronamide moiety (as in Compound 
 <bold>37</bold>, 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and N

 <sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor.
