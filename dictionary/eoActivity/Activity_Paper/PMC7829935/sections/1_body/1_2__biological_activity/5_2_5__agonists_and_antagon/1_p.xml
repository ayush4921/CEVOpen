<p>Adenosine contains endogenous purine nucleoside that occurs naturally in body cells and regulates the functioning of the heart. Adenosine opens the potassium channel and prevents the opening of a free calcium channel, serving as an indirect calcium antagonist. As a result, conduction in the atrioventricular node of the heart is slowed down, and the function of the sinus node is inhibited. The drug regulates the work of the heart and prevents atrial fibrillation [

 <sub>3</sub> agonists are useful for the prevention of perioperative myocardial ischemic injury. Additionally, noncardiovascular surgeries involving patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors also carry an increased incidence of mortality and morbidity, which is associated with ischemic injury [

 <sub>3</sub> receptor agonists are cardioprotective without inducing hemodynamic effects in a rabbit model of ischemic injury [
