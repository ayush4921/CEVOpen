<p>Van Rompaey et al., investigated the influence on affinity, selectivity and intrinsic activity of combined modifications at the 3′- and 5′-positions of the ribofuranosyl moiety with purine modifications at the 2- and N
 <sup>6</sup>-positions. Among the obtained synthetic analogs, Compound 
 <bold>37</bold> containing a β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid moiety, displayed good selectivity and moderate-to-high affinities to the adenosine A
 <sub>3</sub> receptor (K
 <sub>i</sub> = 41 nM, K
 <sub>i</sub> = 60 nM, respectively). However, the ability to tune the efficacy depending on the substituent introduced at the 3′-position was very interesting. A 3′-amino function (as in Compound 
 <bold>38a</bold> and 
 <bold>38b</bold>) resulted in strong partial agonist activity, whereas modifying the amino group to azide converted these analogs into antagonists.
