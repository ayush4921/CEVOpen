<p>The idea that 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a key role in causing seizures led to clinical studies of NMDA receptor-blocking drugs in epilepsy. Finally, it was discovered that another type of an ionotropic glutamate receptor, the AMPA receptor, is the predominant mediator of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system [

 <xref rid="B99-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and other competitive AMPA receptor antagonist classes, are generally poorly soluble and thus difficult to formulate for clinical use.
