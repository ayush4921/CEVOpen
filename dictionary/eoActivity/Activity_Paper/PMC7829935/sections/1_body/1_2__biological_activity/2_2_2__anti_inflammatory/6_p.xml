<p>A set of new isoxazole derivatives with expected immunosuppressive activities was derived [

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) (ethyl 
 <italic>N</italic>-(4-{[(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-carbamoyl}-3-methyl-1,2-oxazol-5-yl)ethanimidate) in mouse in vivo models was evaluated. In vitro tests included evaluation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) viability, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced PBMC proliferation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α) production in whole blood cell cultures. MZO-2 suppressed LPS-induced production of TNF α. The compound, administered intraperitoneally, inhibited carrageenan-induced footpad edema and contact sensitivity to oxazolone in mice after ointment application, with a potency that was comparable to tacrolimus (Protopic
 <sup>®</sup>). The compound also inhibited the expression of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in Jurkat cells [
