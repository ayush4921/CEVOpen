<p>Other examples of heterocyclic β-amino acid-derivative agents to be used against viruses were designed by using a chiral cinchona alkaloid-squaramide catalyst. Bai et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] obtained a series of both enantiomers of novel aminopyrimidine derivatives in an enantioselective three-component one-pot Mannich reaction. Additionally, chiral compounds—Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> and Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)—exhibited higher antiviral activities against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in vivo than the commercial agent ningnanmycin (concentration of 500 μg/mL, with a curative activity of 56.8% and 55.2%, a protection activity of 69.1% and 67.1%, and an inactivation activity of 91.5% and 94.3%, respectively). The antiviral mechanisms and enhanced antiviral activities of these chiral derivatives are interesting subjects for future research.
