<p>The retrovirus-designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (strains HIV-1 and HIV-2) have been etiologically combined with this immunosuppressive disease and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Initially, HIV seropositive patients are asymptomatic but typically develop AIDS-related complex followed by AIDS. The individuals affected exhibit high immunosuppression, which makes them extremely susceptible to debilitating and ultimately fatal opportunistic infections. The replication of HIV by a host cell follows the integration of the viral genome into the host cellâ€™s DNA. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase (RT, enzyme that catalyzes the transcription of retrovirus RNA into DNA) inhibits HIV replication in infected cells. There are two classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors: one is non-nucleoside active site competitive RT inhibitors, such as Nevirapine, and the other is active site RT inhibitors, which comprise nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NsRTIs) and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), collectively referred to as NRTIs (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) [
