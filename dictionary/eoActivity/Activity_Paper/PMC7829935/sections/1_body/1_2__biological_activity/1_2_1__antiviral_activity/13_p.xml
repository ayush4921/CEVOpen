<p>In other research to identify new HIV-1 inhibitors, Corona et al., obtained some new 4-amino-5-benzoyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-2-(substituted-amino)-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrrole-3-carbothioamide derivatives (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Compound 
 <bold>11</bold>) and tested them against RNase H activity [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the group of the synthesized compounds, some exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range. The authors concluded that the 4-methylbenzoyl moiety in the 2-amino group led to compounds that showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6 to 8 μM (Compound 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>A1</bold>–
 <bold>A6</bold>), except for 4-chlorophenylamino and 3,4-dichlorophenylamino derivatives. Since only the 4-phenylamino derivative 
 <bold>A8</bold> among the Compound 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>A7</bold>–
 <bold>A13</bold> retained some RNase H inhibition properties (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 19 μM), the replacement of the 4-methylbenzoyl group with a 4-methoxybenzoyl group caused a loss of activity. However, the presence of 4-chlorophenylamino group in the case of the 4-chlorobenzoylpyrrole series (
 <bold>A14</bold>–
 <bold>A17</bold>) did not affect inhibition of RNase H. Finally, the replacement of the aroyl moiety with a small alkylamino group (
 <bold>A18</bold>) or a pyridylamino moiety (
 <bold>A20</bold>) was detrimental for the anti-RNase H activity in the pyrrole derivatives bearing an unsubstituted benzoyl moiety, while its replacement with a phenyl acetyl moiety (
 <bold>A19</bold>) preserved the activity.
