<p>Salem et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] used a facile one-pot four-component reaction to obtain 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitryle as a substrate to design new heterocyclic systems and evaluated them as antiviral agents. Some of the synthesized heterocycles demonstrated promising antiviral activities toward the rotavirus Wa and adenovirus type 7 strains. Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> showed a 60% and 53.3% reduction in viral titer with rotavirus Wa strain and adenovirus type 7, respectively.
