<p>G. P. Suresha et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] synthesized a series of novel urea/thiourea derivatives of quinazolinone–lysine conjugates as β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid derivatives (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Compound 
 <bold>30</bold>) and screened them for in vitro antimicrobial activity. The activity analysis results showed that compounds containing urea and thiourea derivatives increased biological activity compared to the standard ones. It is worth noting that the fluoro group attached to the phenyl ring of the conjugates acts as an active moiety in arresting the growth of the microbes so that the nature of the substituent was found to be vital to improving the antimicrobial activity.
