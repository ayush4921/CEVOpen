<p>Serpins (
 <bold>ser</bold>ine 
 <bold>p</bold>rotease 
 <bold>in</bold>hibitors) are the greatest family of protease inhibitors that inhibit enzymes by conformational change. They play a crucial role in controlling important proteolytic cascades, including the mammalian coagulation pathways. Serine protease inhibitors are conformationally labile, and many of their disease-linked mutations result in misfolding or pathogenic, inactive polymers [

Serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors and protease-activated receptors have been investigated for their effects in coagulation, hemostasis and hemodynamics, inflammation and wound healing. It was observed that serine proteases, their zymogen precursors and endogenous inhibitors, as well as protease-activated receptors substrates, have an impact on synaptic function and behavior. Furthermore, the unnatural activity of these molecules contributes to many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury [
