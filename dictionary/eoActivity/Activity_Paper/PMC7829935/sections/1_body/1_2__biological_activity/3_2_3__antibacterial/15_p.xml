<p>Shoichet’s group published its findings [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] concerning the field of boronic β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid-based β-lactamase inhibitors, and based upon this previous experience, illustrated that the closer the boronic acid resembles the natural substrate, the better its potency. An example of such an inhibitor is Compound 
 <bold>29</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), which can inhibit some different serine β-lactamases, including 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> β-lactamases KPC-2 and SHV-1, by interacting with the conserved features of these active sites, which includes forming the bond with catalytic serine via the boron atom, positioning one of the boronic acid oxygens in the oxyanion hole, and utilizing its amide moiety to perform conserved interactions across the width of the active site [
