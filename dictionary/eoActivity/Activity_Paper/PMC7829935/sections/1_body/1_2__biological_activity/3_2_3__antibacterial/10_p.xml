<p>Among all of the obtained β
 <sup>3</sup>-amino acid heterocyclic derivatives, the highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by compounds containing bromothiophene, pyrrole and furan substituents (oxytetracycline as a reference drug), whereas a derivative with a tiophene moiety did not show antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. Mickevičienė and colleagues converted 3-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)-amino]-butanoic and 3-[(2-hydroxy-5-methyl-(chloro)-phenyl)-amino]-butanoic acids into a series of derivatives containing hydrazide, pyrrole and chloroquinoxaline moieties [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The compounds obtained exhibited good antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium luteum</italic>, whereas some compounds showed significant antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida tenuis</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus Niger</italic>. Vancomycin was used as a control in the tests of antibacterial activity of the compounds synthesized, and nystatin was used in the antifungal activity tests. At lower concentrations, Compounds

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), Compound 
 <bold>25</bold> and Compound 
 <bold>26</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) are active against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteum</italic> Gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 
 <bold>24</bold> showed inhibition activity against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial strain at concentrations of 62.5 µg/mL, 31.2 µg/mL and 31.2 µg/mL, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>25</bold> was active at 31.2 µg/mL, and Compound 
 <bold>26</bold> at 62.5 µg/mL. Only Compound 
 <bold>24c</bold> and Compound 
 <bold>27</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) showed inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> (concentration of 500 µg/mL). Some compounds inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>M. luteum</italic>: Compounds 
 <bold>24a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> at 62.5 µg/mL, Compound 
 <bold>25</bold> at 31.2 µg/mL, Compound 
 <bold>26</bold> at 62.5 µg/mL, Compound 
 <bold>27</bold> at 62.5 µg/mL. Antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. tenuis</italic> was observed only for three compounds (e.g., Compound 
 <bold>25a</bold>) and some inhibited growth of 
 <italic>A. Niger</italic> microorganisms (e.g., Compound 
 <bold>24</bold>, Compound 
 <bold>26</bold> and Compound 
 <bold>27</bold>).
