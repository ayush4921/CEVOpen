<p>Due to the second strategy, boronic acids that act as transition-state inhibitors have proven to be the most effective reversible inhibitors, presenting a greater intracellular efficacy than phosphonate inhibitors [

The boron atom (electrophile) mimics the carbonyl functionality of the β-lactam; the boron forms a tetrahedral geometry with the catalytic serine, imitating the transition state of the enzyme-adduct complex, and hence, blocking access to the active site of the drug molecule β-lactam ring. Boronic acids act as competitive inhibitors and have not been shown to be hydrolyzed by any β-lactamase to date [
