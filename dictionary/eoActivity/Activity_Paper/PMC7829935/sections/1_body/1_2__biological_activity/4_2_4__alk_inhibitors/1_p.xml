<p>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In most NSCLC patients with an advanced or incurable disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy usually results in low response rates and only modest improvements in overall survival. Researchers from Japan identified anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as another potential target in NSCLC. ALK-positive (anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive, or ALK+) lung cancer occurs in 1 out of 25 non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Generally, patients under 55 years of age who have never smoked are most likely to be diagnosed with ALK+. The ALK mutation is a genetic alteration of lung cell DNA that causes such cells to grow abnormally, and ultimately, behave as cancer cells. ALK inhibitors are anticancer drugs that affect tumors with variations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, such as an EML-ALK translocation [
