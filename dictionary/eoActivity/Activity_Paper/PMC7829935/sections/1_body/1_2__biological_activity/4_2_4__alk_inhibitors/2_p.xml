<p>Since crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer) showed a substantial objective response rate and remarkable progression-free survival, it was the first-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Still, the acquired resistance to crizotinib—particularly observed in the central nervous system, which remains the most common site of relapse—remains a major problem. Searching for new active compounds led to the discovery of numerous next-generation ALK inhibitors, and surprisingly, most of them are 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine analogs (named DAAPalogues) [

 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid derivatives; CEP-28122 mesylate salt, CEP-37440 (and its analogs) and NVP-TAE226 are some examples of ALK inhibitors (
