   <bold>Author contributions:</bold>
   <italic>All authors developed inputs and recommendations for the manuscript design, contributing to the approach of this review and to set the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were involved for writing and reviewing the manuscript. In addition to that, the work was divided among each author. FBM centred the topic for reviewing on AMD and the effects of medicinal plants and natural products and, with IMS, they coordinated together the work and carried out the harmonious and unified development of the manuscript based on the contributions and inputs from authors. NA and DMM developed the introduction part and reviewed the references’ section. EC and MEG mainly concerned with the section on the medicinal plants’ use for AMD. VV and TO investigated background on natural products’ use for AMD. MAS, PS and IMS were responsible for the section available for discussion and reflection based on background. All authors approved the final manuscript.</italic>
