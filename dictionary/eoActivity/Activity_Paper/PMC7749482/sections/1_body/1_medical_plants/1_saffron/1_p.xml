 <italic>Crocus sativus</italic> L. (Iridaceae), commonly known as saffron has been used as a herbal medicine, and as a coloring and flavoring spice, since ancient times (Evans, 2009). In the last 10 years, growing evidence has highlighted the pharmacological profile of saffron and its constituents, including potential therapeutic applications on the central nervous system (WHO, 2007; Melnyk et al., 2010; Poma et al., 2012; Christodoulou et al., 2015; Nassiri-Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2015; Bagur et al., 2018; Bukhari et al., 2018; Leone et al., 2018; Hatziagapiou et al., 2019; Heitmar et al., 2019; Moratalla-López et al., 2019; Mykhailenko et al., 2019). The neuroprotective activity of saffron has also been investigated in AMD. Thus, pharmacological studies on saffron supplementation therapy provide important evidence about its neuroprotective actions, and several research works attribute saffron’s therapeutic properties to its main components crocins, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal (

 </bold>). Most studies indicate that saffron has a potent antioxidant activity, mainly due to saffron carotenoids (Christodoulou et al., 2015; Rahaiee et al., 2015; Broadhead et al., 2016; Di Marco et al., 2019). Furthermore, the binding capacity of saffron metabolites to biomolecules protects them from free radicals (Kanakis et al., 2009; Christodoulou et al., 2015). Although, saffron’s antioxidant activity is attributed mainly to crocin, the synergistic effect of all bioactive constituents should be considered (Di Marco et al., 2019). It is interesting to note that many authors have reported that saffron components possess antinflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, possibly by the inhibition of caspase-mediated apoptosis after retinal damage (Nam et al., 2010; Yamauchi et al., 2011; Ohno et al., 2012; Tamaddonfard et al., 2013). It is also known that crocin and crocetin increase oxygen diffusion and improve ocular blood flow in the retina and choroid, factors that play an important role in the disease (Xuan et al., 1999; Giaccio, 2004). Later Corso et al. (2016) described a novel mechanism responsible for saffron’s neuroprotective effect through the regulation of P2X7 receptors, which are affected in AMD. Nevertheless, further research is required to clarify the exact mechanism as peculiar characteristics of saffron components support the hypothesis that saffron does not act as a simple antioxidant, but has complex mechanisms of action that range from antioxidant activity to direct gene expression control (Natoli et al., 2010). In addition to animal models that have demonstrated the protective effects of saffron and its components (Fernández-Sánchez et al., 2012; Di Marco et al., 2013; Bisti et al., 2014), promising from clinical trials results have been reported (

Seven published clinical studies have assessed the impact of oral saffron supplementation (daily dose range: 20–50 mg) on vision-related parameters in AMD patients, of which four were randomized controlled trials (Falsini et al., 2010; Lashay et al., 2016; Riazi et al., 2017; Broadhead et al., 2019), and three were longitudinal interventional studies which reported pre- 
 <italic>versus</italic> post-intervention comparisons with no control (placebo) group (Piccardi et al., 2012; Marangoni et al., 2013; Di Marco et al., 2019). Both objective and subjective vision-related measures were evaluated. Short-term studies and longer-term follow up demonstrated that saffron supplementation improved visual functions. However, a direct quantitative comparison is not possible because formulation, dose, intervention duration, test methods and outcome measures varied in the cited studies. Toxicology research currently considers saffron safe for human consumption as the dose of 30 mg/day seems efficacious and toxic effects have been reported with 5 g and more, with a lethal dose of approximately 20 g (Mohamadpour et al., 2013; Christodoulou et al., 2015). However, long-term and large-scale research works are required to elucidate the effect on human health.
