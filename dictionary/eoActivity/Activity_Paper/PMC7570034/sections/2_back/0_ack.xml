 <p>We are grateful to the four of Phu Tai traditional healers Khun Por Thongsa Jareunta, Khun Por Sopa Sumsaard, Khun Ta Boonhou Wangkahard, and Khun Ta Pan Petprai. The last mentioned passed away after we finished our field survey just one year ago. We want him to know that his knowledge has been passed on to the world and that it will be useful for other people forever.</p>
