<p>Data and plant specimens were collected from April 2015–April 2016. The traditional healers were selected by purposive sampling [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The healers were visited in their homes and informal meetings were held in Isan or Phu Tai languages. Semi-structured interviews were performed to collect qualitative and quantitative data on the medicinal plants. All four healers were interviewed about their knowledge, training, ailments, treatment techniques, and method of preparation, and the interviews were supplemented by direct observation. Field walks searching for the medicinal plants were made to review and document the availability of medicinal plants in different habitats in and around the villages. We recorded information about local names of the plants, plant parts used for treatments, method of preparation, route of administration, and the habitats of medicinal plants. Voucher specimens were collected to document botanical identification. Preliminary identifications of medicinal species using vernacular names were made by the healers in the field. Species were initially identified on the basis of their common names, following Tem Smitinand′s Thai Plant Names [

Subsequently, some of the voucher specimens were brought to the herbarium of the Queen Sirikit Botanical Garden (QBG) for taxonomic confirmation based on the Flora of Thailand. Comparison with existing collections was performed by W.T. The voucher specimens were collected in forested areas adjacent to the villages and in home gardens. The vouchers are kept in the Department of Science and Technology, Roi Et Rajabhat University, Roi Et province, Thailand.
