The Isan people are very religious and influenced by nearby Cambodia and Laos, and, relative to the rest of Thailand, Isan culture and food is unique.

Rice is the main crop occupying 60% of the cultivated land. However, farmers are increasingly diversifying into cash crops such as sugarcane and cassava, which are cultivated on vast scales, and to a lesser extent, rubber [
