<p>The medicinal plants were prepared and administered using a variety of methods. The most common preparation method used was decoction in water followed by oral ingestion. In this respect, our results agree with those obtained in many other ethnomedicinal studies [

 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In general, water is the most commonly used solvent for extracting medicinal compounds from plants [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and because it allows the practitioner to adjust the taste of the medicine. For example, in the case of very bitter medicine, the healer may add sugar or honey to make the ingestion more pleasant [

Similar to our observations, the crushing or grinding method is commonly used elsewhere when the medicine must be applied directly to an affected organ [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A particular method of preparation that we observed was to grind stems or bark with water or lime juice and drink the solvent.
