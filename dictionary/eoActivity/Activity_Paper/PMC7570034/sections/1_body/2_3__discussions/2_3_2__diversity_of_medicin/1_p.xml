<p>Together the healers knew 162 species of medicinal plants, the most popular ones belonging to Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, and Zingiberaceae. Another study of the same ethnic group, but in Nakhonphanum province, reported 176 plants that were used for medicinal purposes [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], 53 of which were the same as in our study. In Nakhonphanum province, the most commonly used plant family was again Leguminosae, which was followed by Euphorbiaceae. Elsewhere in Thailand and among other ethnic groups, Leguminosae is the plant family with the most species used as medicine and with the most records of use [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and they are common and species-rich in Thailand. Species of Leguminosae are commonly used as medicinal plants for treating fever, tonic, and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Caesalpinia sappan</italic> L. is used in Thailand and elsewhere to treat a large number of medicinal conditions. It is used in Kerala as a part of a herbal drink to quench thirst, as a blood purifier, an antidiabetic, and to improve complexion and several other conditions [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another important medicinal plant family is Zingiberaceae, which is widely used in traditional medicine in many Asian countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Thailand [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Thailand and Laos, species of Zingiberaceae (mainly species of 
 <italic>Kaempferia</italic> and 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic>) have strongly aromatic rhizomes and are commonly used medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In northeastern Thailand, especially in Roi Et, traditional healers have cultivated or collected these plants in their home garden. Species of Zingiberaceae are considered to be very powerful medicinal plants. Their medicinal functions have been broadly discussed and accepted, and are used in many traditional recipes [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] including, for instance, species such as 
 <italic>Alpinia zerumbet</italic> (Pers.) B.L. Burtt and R.M. Sm. and 
 <italic>Alpinia galanga</italic> (L.) Willd. In this survey, the traditional healers used Zingiberaceae rhizomes for digestive disorders. Finally, Rubiaceae is used as an anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several pharmacological studies have confirmed that plants from these families are efficient in the treatment of a variety of health conditions and symptoms [
