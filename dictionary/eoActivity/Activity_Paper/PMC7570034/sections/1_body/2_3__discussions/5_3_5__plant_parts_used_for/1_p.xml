<p>Many ethnomedicinal studies include information about the plant parts used for medicine. In a meta-analysis of 64 ethnomedicinal studies from all over Thailand, the most commonly used parts were stems and leaves followed by roots, and entire plants [

The use of different plant parts should be taken into account when estimating the effects of medicinal plants on plant populations, especially because the use depends on differences in quantities of phytochemical compounds in different parts of a plant [

In wetter areas, plants produce more leaves, and therefore harvesting leaves could be less detrimental to the plant. In contrast, it may be more difficult to get enough leaves to make medicine in the dryer areas, so bark, wood, and roots would be preferred. Some medical conditions can be treated by whole plants because several parts of the plant contain similar active compounds and pharmaceuticals or have similar bioactive properties that are useful in the treatment of a particular symptom [
