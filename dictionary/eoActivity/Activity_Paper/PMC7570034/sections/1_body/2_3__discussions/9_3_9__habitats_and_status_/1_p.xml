<p>The majority of medicinal plants known by the healers were collected from community forests. Some of them were cultivated as a medicinal plant in the home-gardens or on their farm when the natural habitat was located far away from their village. In addition, the majority of exotic medicinal plants in this study were found in the home-gardens. The use of exotic plants may be because they are widespread and easy to access in their community [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, in this study, the healers always cultivated medicinal plants because they could not be found in the forest, such as 
 <italic>Agave sisalana</italic> Perrine (Asparagaceae) and 
 <italic>Ananas bracteatus</italic> (Lindl.) Schult. and Schult. f., and some were used as food, such as 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. Some studies have shown that habitats are the most important for the collection of medicinal plants. For instance, in nearby Nakhon Phanom, cultivated fields were more important than natural forests [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as we found in our study. Today, medicinal plants are also threatened by habitat destruction and the change from subsistence farming to cash crops. Especially in northeastern Thailand, cash cropping was widely introduced to the agricultural system, cultivating such species as rubber (
 <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> MÃ¼ll.Arg., Euphorbiaceae), cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz, Euphorbiaceae), and sugarcane (
 <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> L., Poaceae). Therefore, the medicinal plants and the traditional knowledge of their uses are currently endangered.
