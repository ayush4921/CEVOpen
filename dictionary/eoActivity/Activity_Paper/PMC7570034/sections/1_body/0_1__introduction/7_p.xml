<p>The primary objective of this study was to identify and document the medicinal plants and associated ethnobotanical knowledge of traditional healers. It is hoped that the plants they use will be further studied in the future, especially their phytochemistry and pharmacology. The present study focuses on documenting the diagnosis of diseases in general, details of the utilization of medicinal plants, and the criteria for selecting medicinal plants. The ethnomedicinal information presented here was collected from four highly experienced traditional healers and we hope that it will benefit people who are interested in traditional medicine and many associated aspects of medicinal plants. In this context and departing from the Roi Et experience, we aim at answering the following specific questions: (1) What is the traditional knowledge used by Phu Tai healers for treating their patients? (2) How many medicinal plants do they know and use for treating patients in their community? (3) Which species are most used? (4) How many ailments are treated with traditional medicinal plants? (5) Which plant parts are commonly used for medicine? (6) How many preparation methods are available? (7) What is the similarity of medicinal plant species used among traditional healers? (8) What are the habits and habitats of medicinal plants?</p>
