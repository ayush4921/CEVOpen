<p>Diabetes mellitus, being a major global health threat nowadays [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], is seeking for studies to discover new therapeutic agents from various origins. Medicinal plants are among the most common sources and mainstay options of medicines for about 75–80% of world population [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the use of synthetic medicines for the treatment of various diseases, free radicals are often generated in the body which may result in an additional disease. Free radical mediated reactions are terminated by plants and drugs of plant origin that have abundant antioxidants, thereby preventing the body from oxidative damage and stress [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The antidiabetic activity of hydromethanolic root extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> root was evaluated in a variety of animal models. In the acute oral toxicity study at the limit dose of 2000 mg/kg 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> root extract, mortality of mice was not seen during the study period. This safety profile is consistent with a report by Tafese et al. and with the toxicity study of leaf extract of the same plant [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the oral median lethal dose (LD50) of the AIRE can be considered to be more than 2000 mg/kg. No toxicity incidences have been reported related to 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> in particular and the genus 
 <italic>Ajuga</italic> in general so far [
