<p>Male mice were used in all mice models (normoglycemic, oral glucose loaded, one dose treated diabetic, and repeated dose treated diabetic mice) because female mice are less sensitive to insulin [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and STZ compared to male mice [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mice were randomly divided into five groups (6 mice per group) in the normoglycemic, oral glucose loaded, and one dose treated diabetic mice models. Working to the all cases, group 1 used as negative control was treated with 10 ml/kg distilled water (DW). Experimental groups 2, 3, and 4 received 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg root extract of the plant, respectively, whereas group 5 used as positive control was treated with glibenclamide (GLC) 5 mg/kg, which was a standard drug. In single dose of the three solvent root fraction treated diabetic mice model, mice were randomly divided into 11 groups (each group comprised 6 mice). Group 1 (negative control) was treated with 10 ml/kg DW; the 9 experimental groups received solvent fraction of the root extract of the plant (groups 2, 3, and 4 received three different doses of aqueous fraction of the root extract of the plant; groups 5, 6, and 7 received three different doses of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction of the root extract of the plant; and groups 8, 9, and 10 received three different doses of chloroform fraction of the root extract of the plant). Group 11 received 5 mg/kg GLC. GLC was used as a standard drug on basis of previous reports on earlier literatures [
