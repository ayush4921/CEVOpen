<p>Significant difference in baseline BGL was not found throughout groups prior to the start of DW, AIRE, and GLC administration (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Between groups analysis revealed that 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg AIRE significantly decreased hyperglycemia at the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr compared to the BGL at 30 minutes and the negative control group, whereas 5 mg/kg GLC showed a significant reduction of hyperglycemia at 1
 <sup>st</sup> hr and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr of glucose administration compared to the negative control group and 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg AIRE-treated groups. A mouse receiving 400 mg/kg crude root extract showed a statistically significant reduction in BGL at 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr compared to 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg treated groups. Within groups analysis revealed that oral glucose loading caused a statistically significant increment in BGL after 30 minutes in all groups compared to the baseline fasting BGL regardless of the treatments given. Besides, in all groups including the negative control, there was a significant reduction in BGL at 60 and 120 minutes when compared to the respective BGL at 30 minutes after glucose administration. At 120 minutes, all AIRE-treated groups showed blood glucose reduction to a level comparable to their respective baseline values.
