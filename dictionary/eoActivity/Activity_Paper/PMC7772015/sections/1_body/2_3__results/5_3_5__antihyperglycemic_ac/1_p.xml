<p>Between and within group analysis were performed to notice difference in BGL throughout various groups and time points, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Significant difference in baseline fasting BGL was not observed throughout all groups. Likewise, a significant reduction in fasting BGL was not noticed in all AIRE received groups compared to the GLC-treated groups at all time points. When AIRE-treated groups were compared to the negative control, they did not show a statistically significant reduction in BGL at all time points except at the 8
 <sup>th</sup> hour. There was a significant reduction of BGL in 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg AIRE received groups at 8
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to the 100 mg/kg AIRE received group when within a group comparison was performed. The reduction of fasting BGL in percentage was recorded as 15.14% in 100 mg/kg, 15.8% in 200 mg/kg, and 20% in 400 mg/kg AIRE at the 8
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to the respective baseline fasting BGL. GLC 5 mg/kg reduced BGL significantly at 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr (
