<p>According to between groups' analysis, groups treated with repeated daily doses of aqueous fractions of 100, 200, and 400â€‰mg/kg AIRE resulted in a considerable BGL reduction at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day compared to their baseline values (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Moreover, there was a statistically significant (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) reduction of BGL in the GLC-treated group at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day, respectively, compared to baseline values with around 61.30% and 64.10% reduction, respectively.
