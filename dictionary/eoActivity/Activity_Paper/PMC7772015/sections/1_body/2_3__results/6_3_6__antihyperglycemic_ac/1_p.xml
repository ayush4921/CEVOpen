<p>Within groups' analysis of data revealed that fasting BGL was reduced in groups that received crude extract compared to the respective baseline values at all time points. The doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg AIRE reduced fasting BGL with a magnitude of 16.10%, 21.6%, and 26.4% after 7
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment and 18.5%, 24.6%, and 28.8% after 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment compared to the respective baseline BGL. The fasting BGL of the diabetic control was increased on the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment compared to the baseline value. The fasting BGL of the normal control groups, however, did not exhibit remarkable change throughout the study period. Fasting BGL was significantly reduced in the group that received GLC (

 <sup>th</sup> day with percentage reduction of about 60.80% and 65% at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment, respectively, compared to the baseline values. Between groups analysis discovered that groups that received different doses of AIRE revealed a significant reduction in fasting BGL compared to the diabetic control group at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatments, and treatment with GLC showed that there was a significant reduction in fasting BGL (
