<p>In comparison to the normal control, STZ caused a significant loss of bodyweight in the diabetic control at 7

 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment. According to between groups analysis, it was observed that 100 mg/kg AIRE did not improve bodyweight at the7

 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment compared to the diabetic control, but at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, AIRE improved significantly the bodyweight of the mice (
