<p>From 750 g of the plant material used for extraction, 164 g of dried grey extract was collected after completing the extraction process with a percentage yield of about 21.9% w/w. The extract was more appreciably soluble in water than in organic solvent producing yields of hexane (12%), chloroform (17%), aqueous (69%), and remaining olegenous residue (2%).</p>
