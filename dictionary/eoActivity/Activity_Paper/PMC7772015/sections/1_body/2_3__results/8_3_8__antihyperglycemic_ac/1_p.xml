<p>When within group analysis was performed, the difference in reduction of fasting BGL was not significant at all time points compared to both the diabetic control and the respective baseline values of all fractions. The reduction of fasting BGL in the GLC-treated group was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with a reduction of 24.19%, 37.8%, 48.4%, and 65.2% at the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr, 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr, 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr, and 8
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to their baseline values. It reduced fasting BGL considerably at these time points compared to the diabetic control as well. Between groups analysis revealed that aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg showed virtually significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduction in BGL by decreasing with 16.8% and 21.10% at the 8
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to hexane and chloroform fractions of the same dose. Compared to both the baseline and negative control values, the doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg chloroform and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fractions revealed no significant difference in BGL (
