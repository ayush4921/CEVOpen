<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a cluster of metabolic diseases occurred as a result of insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, or both that result in hyperglycemia [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Long-term damage and failure of the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels were evident in chronic hyperglycemia [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Development of DM involves different pathogenic processes, and these range from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells that result in absolute insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in insulin resistance. The basis of the abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in diabetes is insufficient action of insulin on target tissues [

The worldwide prevalence of DM is estimated to rise to 578 million in 2030. The prevalence of diabetes in this age group was expected to be increased by 143% in Africa from 2019 to 2045, which is higher than other parts of the world. Diabetes and its complications caused significant deaths which are estimated to be 4.2 million in 2019. The annual worldwide health cost on diabetes is estimated to be United States Dollar (USD) 760 billion. It is expected that cost will be USD 825 billion by 2030 and USD 845 billion by 2045 [
