    "In this study was conducted the in vitro antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, antigenotoxic and anticancer activities investigations on the moss <i>Bryum capillare</i> Hedw (<i>BC</i>). Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity were tested by MIC and microplate biofilm methods on antibiotic resistant bacteria. While the antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by DPPH, metal chelating, plasma lipid peroxidation and total phenolic content, the antigenotoxicity and cytotoxicity were established by Comet test and the WST-1 Cell proliferation assay kit respectively. The MIC values were found to be ≥ 125 µg.mL<sup>-1</sup> and a biofilm inhibition of 3-5% against only <i>S. epidermidis</i> was observed. Total phenolic compounds were determined as 23.26 mg/g. The results of DPPH assay, chelating and plasma lipid peroxidation activity were found to be 15%, 3% and 4% respectively. The extract was observed to decrease the affect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that cause DNA damage. The <i>BC</i> was also determined 60 ± 5% anticancer activity against SKBR 3 and 76 ± 5% anticancer activity against HeLa cells, where this concentration had only 18 ± 5% cytotoxicity against MCF-12A cells. Also, these results have indicated the potential of <i>Bryum capillare</i> for the first time in novel natural compounds search."
