<p id="p0085">In this study, antimicrobial activity of the extracts was identified by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). A concentration range of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, 250, 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was established against each microorganism and MIC values identified for each microorganism were given in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. According to the results all MIC values of the extracts against three strains were ≥ 125 µg.mL
