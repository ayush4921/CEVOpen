 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Inhibition percentage of DPPH scavenging ability by the extract was found to be changing between 2% and 15%, where the highest inhibition was observed for 1.00 mg.mL

 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the extract’s percentage of metal chelating activity. Our extract exhibited weak chelating ability with a IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 49.67 ± 0.32 mg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. However, EDTA, which was used a positive control showed very good chelating activity, which is about 94% for the concentrations tested Also the capacity of the extract to inhibit lipid peroxidation was determined in our study too. The generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) was substantially controlled by the extract. The extract exhibited in high inhibition activity (33.56 ± 1.12%) against plasma lipid peroxidation (
