<p id="p0130">Most people believe that pharmaceutical plants are harmless when compared to the synthetic drugs (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Celik, 2017</xref>), but scientists proved that most of the plants having enthnopharmalogical uses have a potential of being cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira-Machado et al., 2004</xref>). In this context, any natural product presenting anticancer properties should be tested for their toxicity potential. Anticancer properties of mosses have been studied by several researchers (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Onbasli et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Yağlıoğlu et al., 2017</xref>); however no detailed reports have been published until now either about the toxicity of 
 <italic>BC</italic> or the toxicity of other mosses in the literature. For this reason, the positive anticancer properties of mosses published until now include false-positive potentials and in addition these studies are lack of toxicity information (
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Cos et al., 2006</xref>). Antigenotoxic activity of natural products has been increasingly interested in by researchers in last few decades (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Hayder et al., 2004</xref>) because such products are thought to be beneficial against some mutation-related diseases and cancer (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">De Flora, 1998</xref>). There are several studies regarding antigenotoxic properties of some plants, but all of them are for higher plants. 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al. (2011)</xref> analysed the antigenotoxic activity of 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> leaf extract in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Hayder et al. (2004)</xref> studied the antigenotoxic activity of 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> PQ37 and 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Leite-Silva et al. (2007)</xref> used 
 <italic>Fucus vesiculosus</italic> to observe its antigenotoxic activity in human lymphocytes. 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al. (2011)</xref> observed ~ 85% decrease in tail length compared to positive control (10 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) after incubating yeast cells by a mixture of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> extract. 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract presented ~ 30% decrease in tail length for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract and ~ 45% decrease in tail length for 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The extract is also observed to lower the affect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on human lymphocytes that cause DNA damage. As a conclusion it is possible to propose further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests to be conducted especially for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract. 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Hayder et al. (2004)</xref> found up to 99% inhibition of genotoxicity by 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> extracts depending on the concentration and solvent used for extraction. The inhibition of genotoxicity by the extract was 39% for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 55% for 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Onbasli et al. (2019)</xref> used 
 <italic>Hypnum andoi</italic> to observe its antigenotoxic activity in human lymphocytes. The inhibition of genotoxicity by the extract was 35% for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 53% for 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. According to the results it is obvious that 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract has some antigenotoxic and anticancer potentials. Although the results are still promising, according to the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity tests it is possible to propose an increase in the concentration up to 5 folds for better anti-infective activity. It is known that 
 <italic>S. epidermis</italic> has a potential of causing skin infections. It is possible to recommend that with an increase in the concentration, 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract can be used in cosmetics that could have a potential of inhibiting skin infections caused by biofilm formed by 
 <italic>S. epidermis</italic>. According to the results it can be concluded that 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract presented notable anticancer activity against SKBR 3 and HeLa cells, while having relatively very low cytotoxic activity against MCF-12A cells. The extract is also observed to lower the affect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on human lymphocytes that cause DNA damage. As a conclusion it is possible to propose further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests to be conducted especially for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract (
