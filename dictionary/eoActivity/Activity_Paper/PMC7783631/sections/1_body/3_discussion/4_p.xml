<p id="p0125">Today it is known that free radicals often damage biomolecules leading to cellular senescence, cancer and even cell death (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Mantle et al., 1998</xref>). The best way to reduce the amount of free radicals is using compounds presenting antioxidant activities (
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Souri et al., 2008</xref>). Exogenous and endogenous antioxidants can be used to prevent free radical formation (
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Cesquini et al., 2003</xref>). As a reason of this, studies about novel antioxidants from natural origins are under investigation. Plants are one of the sources for natural antioxidants. Although no reports have been published about antioxidant acitivities of 
 <italic>BC</italic>, several studies regarding the antioxidant activity of other bryophytes are available (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Dey and De, 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Onbasli et al., 2019</xref>). Antioxidants, which are natural, such as total phenols, tocopherols and ascorbic acid were found to be in the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>BC</italic> in our study. However, folic acid was not detected. Ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol were found in lower amounts (1.87 and &lt; 0.5 µg.g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively) in the extract. Thus, the antioxidant activity can be related to the total phenols. The TPC value is higher than some of the mosses which were analysed by 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Chobot et al., 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Pejin and Bogdanovic-Pristov, 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>. But when the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for antioxidant activity were analysed by comparing the results published by previous studies, it is obvious that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were quite high for 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract. For example, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were previously found to be between 0.170 ± 0.001 mg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 0.487 ± 0.001 mg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for 
 <italic>M. marginatum</italic>, 
 <italic>L. glaucum</italic>, 
 <italic>D. scoparium</italic>, 
 <italic>D. polysetum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. purpureus</italic> by DPPH assay (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Chobot et al., 2006</xref>), where in our study this value is 8.41 mg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The main question which can be posed here for the extract could be about its relatively low antioxidant activity with having a relatively average TPC content. 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Chobot et al. (2006)</xref> has also observed such a case and concluded that there is no significant correlation with TPC concentration and antioxidant activity (α = 0.05). As a result, they pointed out that antioxidant activity can be modulated by several components having antagonistic or synergistic activities. Our results also supported this observation.
