 <p>
  <italic>Washingtonia filifera</italic> seeds have revealed to possess antioxidant properties, butyrylcholinesterase and xanthine oxidase inhibition activities. The literature has indicated a relationship between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Keeping this in mind, we have now evaluated the inhibitory properties of 
  <italic>W. filifera</italic> seed extracts on 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
  <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzyme activity and the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP) fibrils formation.
 </p>
 <p>Three extracts from seeds of 
  <italic>W. filifera</italic> were evaluated for their enzyme inhibitory effect and IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were calculated for all the extracts. The inhibition mode was investigated by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis and the inhibition of IAPP aggregate formation was monitored.
 </p>
 <p>
  <italic>W. filifera</italic> methanol seed extract appears as the most potent inhibitor of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and for the IAPP fibril formation.
 </p>
 <p>Current findings indicate new potential of this extract that could be used for the identification or development of novel potential agents for T2D and AD.</p>
