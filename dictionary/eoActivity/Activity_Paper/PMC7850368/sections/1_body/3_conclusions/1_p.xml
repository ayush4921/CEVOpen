<p>Controlling the response of carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes (
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glycosidase) is an effective strategy in facing and/or managing postprandial hyperglycaemia. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Amylase is endoglucanase, which hydrolyses the internal α-1,4 glycosidic linkage in starch and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase is one of the glucosidases located in the brush border surface membrane of intestinal cells, key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion.
