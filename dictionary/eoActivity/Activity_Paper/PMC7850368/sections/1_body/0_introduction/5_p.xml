The pathological hallmark common to both diseases is local amyloid deposition, where aberrant aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and IAPP is implicated in AD and T2D, respectively. It is also evident that patients with T2D are at a higher risk of developing AD, which is why the concept of metabolism-dependent neurodegeneration mechanisms is gaining importance. Moreover, the phenomenon of oxidative stress is known to play an important role in both AD and T2D due to the neurodegeneration and diabetic complications, respectively, promoted by ROS.
