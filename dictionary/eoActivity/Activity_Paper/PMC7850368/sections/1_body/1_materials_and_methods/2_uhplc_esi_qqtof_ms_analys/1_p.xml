<p>Kinetex 150 × 2.1 mm ID 2.6 µm, options: 1) F5 (pentafluorophenyl) 2) C18 was used (injection volume 5 µL, 0.5 mg/mL). The elution gradient established was isocratic 0–10% B over 0.8 min, 10–14% B over 14 min, 14–15% B over 23.5 min, 15–60% B over 28.7 min, 60–100% over 37 min and re-equilibration of the column, where the elution buffers were formic acid 0.1% on aqueous solution (A) and formic acid 0.1% on acetonitrile solution (B). Double online detection was carried out as in the DAD using 210, 280, 330 and 370 nm as the preferred wavelengths. Compact QqTOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics) was operated in negative and positive mode and calibrated with the sodium formate clusters. The calibration segment was introduced at the beginning of every run. The main MS parameters were following: scan range 50–1400 m/z, nebuliser pressure 1.5 bar, dry gas (N2) 7.0 L/min, temperature 200 °C, capillary voltage 2.2 kV (negative mode) 4.5 kV (positive mode), ion energy 53 eV, collision energy 8 eV. The analysis of the obtained mass spectra was carried out using Data Analysis software (Bruker Daltonics).</p>
