<p>A reaction mix containing 60 µL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 20 µL of 1 M NaCl and 40 µL of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase from porcine pancreas (1 mg/mL) (EC 3.2.1.1) was used. The solution was incubated in the absence or presence of seed extracts at 37 °C for 10 min. After incubation, 80 µL of a 2.5 mM 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-α-D-maltotrioside (CNPG3) solution was added as the substrate and 2-chloro-nitrophenol released by the enzymatic hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm. Different concentration ranges were used for the assays: 0–12 µg/mL for alcoholic extracts and 0–40 µg/mL for aqueous extracts.
