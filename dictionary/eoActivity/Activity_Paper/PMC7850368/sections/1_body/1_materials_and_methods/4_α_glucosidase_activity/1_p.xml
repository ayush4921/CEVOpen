 </xref>. The enzyme (0.125 U/mL) (EC 3.2.1.20) solution was dissolved in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Twenty microliters of test samples at various concentrations (0–2 µg/mL) were mixed with the enzyme solution in microplate wells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 20 µL of 5 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl 
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 µL of 0.2 M sodium carbonate solution. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Glucosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm on 96-well microplate reader by measuring the amount of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol released. DMSO control was used whenever required and the final concentration of DMSO was maintained below 8% v/v, which was found that it is not affecting the enzyme activity. Acarbose was used as a reference inhibitor for both enzymes. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the concentration giving 50% inhibition of enzyme activities, were determined by the interpolation of dose–response curves.
