<p>IAPP stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 2 mg of synthetic amylin in 250 µL (2 mM) of hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP). This stock solution was stored at −20 °C. All solutions for these studies were prepared by adding a PBS buffered (1 mM) thioflavin-T solution to IAPP peptide (in lyophilised dry form) immediately before the measurement. The final concentration of IAPP solution was 40 µg/mL. When compounds were present, the IAPP to compound ratio was at 1:10, 1:5, 1:1, 1:0.1 and 1:0.01 by weight (400 µg/mL, 200 µg/mL, 40 µg/mL, 4 µg/mL, 0.4 µg/mL). 0.5% DMSO was present in the solution. ThT fluorescence was monitored at 480 nm with 440 nm excitation at 37 °C on a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. The experiments performed as sextuplicates were repeated three times.</p>
