<p>The binding affinity of the compounds ranges from −4.5 to −7.8 kcal/mol towards IAPP, from −5.2 kcal/mol to −8.5 kcal/mol for the α-amylase and ranging from −4.9 kcal/mol to −8.1 kcal/mol regarding α-glucosidase. Among the four compounds, catechin displayed better binding energy values for all the three protein targets.</p>
