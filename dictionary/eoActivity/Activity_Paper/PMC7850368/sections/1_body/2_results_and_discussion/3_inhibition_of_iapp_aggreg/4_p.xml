<p>In addition, negative staining was made for analysis by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), a useful technique for assessing the morphology of

Negative staining typically generates the sample with good contrast and well-preserved morphology. The stain forms a coating over the sample that appears light and the surrounding stain appears dark.
