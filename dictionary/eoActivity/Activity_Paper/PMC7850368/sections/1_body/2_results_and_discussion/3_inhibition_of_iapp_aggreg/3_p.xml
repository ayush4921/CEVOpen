<p>Congo red staining was performed to visualise the presence of amyloid fibrils. The cotton dye Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils, that appear red-orange. When observed with crossed polarisers in the polarisation microscopy, stained amyloid exhibits bright green birefringence, often referred to as “apple green birefringence”. Congo red staining of solution 1:5 (IAPP 40 µg/mL:MES 200 µg/mL) was negative and confirmed that inhibition of IAPP fibrillation was occurred.</p>
