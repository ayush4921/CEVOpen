 </xref> many studies that have reported inhibition mode or IC
 <sub>50</sub> for metabolites such as procyanidin B-type dimers, catechin, protocatechuic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid, against α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes. It is worth pointing out that each compound showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value higher than that shown by the MES.
