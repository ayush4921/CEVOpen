<p>The extracts with higher inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, EES, and MES, behave with an uncompetitive inhibition, since the kinetic analysis of these extracts, produces a family of parallel lines for increasing extracts concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figures 2(a,b)</xref>). The equilibrium constant for binding with the enzyme-substrate complex (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub>) was calculated from the replotting of the intercepts (1/
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) versus the inhibitor concentration, resulting in a value of 2.47 and 3.66 µg/mL for EES and MES, respectively (
