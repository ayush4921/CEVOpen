<p>All extracts exhibited potent inhibitory activity on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are statistically lower than that of the reference inhibitor, ranging from 0.53 ± 0.014 to 1.63 ± 0.23 µg/mL. In particular, the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the MEG was found to be ∼170 times more active than acarbose.
