  <p>Congo red and Electron microscopy analyses of the material recovered after ThT analysis. In (a), amyloid exhibiting green birefringence after Congo red staining and (b) long unbranched amyloid fibrils are present in solution of IAPP 40 µg/mL. In (c), no Congophilc material can be detected and in (d) an amorphous material is present in solution containing IAPP 40 µg/mL with MES 200 µg/mL. Samples in a and c are stained with Congo red and samples in b and d are negatively contrasted with 2% Uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol.</p>
