<p>The total flavonoid content was determined by the colorimetric method of Marinova et al., 2005, and Sultana et al. [

 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The principle of the method is based on the coloration of flavonoid compounds with AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> in an alkaline medium. One gram of fresh leaf sample was crushed homogeneously in liquid nitrogen, then extracted with absolute ethanol at the ratio of 1:3. The sample was further extracted on an ultrasonic machine for 30 min, then centrifuged to recover the ethanol solution. The extracted ethanol obtained from 3 repeats were combined and adjusted to equal volumes (10 mL) with ethanol. We shook well the mixture of 1 mL of the obtained extract, 4 mL of water and 0.3 mL of 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, left the mixture at room temperature for 5 min, then added 0.3 mL of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>. After 6 min, we added 2 mL of 1 M NaOH solution, mixed well, and adjusted the volume with water to 10 mL. The absorbance of the mixtures was recorded at 510 nm by UV/VIS Spectrophotometer Camspec M108. The total flavonoid contents were calculated based on the quercetin calibration curve, performed under the same conditions. The results were expressed in mg/g of fresh leaf [
