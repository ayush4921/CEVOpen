<p>Recently, Ho et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> water extract showed effects of antitumor, hypoglycemic, anti-HBV, and hypotensive. 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> extracts showed a high anti-inflammatory effect on xylene-induced mice [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It also inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> extracts significantly promote hepatoprotective activity in experimental mice as well as reduce the formation of early liver fibrosis [

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> can decrease liver injury consequences via inhibiting liver and spleen enlargement [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The major compounds responsible for the liver protection effects possibly are flavonoids, which proved to be involved in the anti-oxidation activities including the removal of free radicals in liver cells, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and stabilization of cell membranes’ processes [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Flavonoids belong to polyphenol, one of the most important groups’ secondary metabolites in plants. Polyphenol compounds are responsible for plant defenses against both biotic and abiotic stresses and even light irradiation [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some major chemical constituents belonging to flavonoids, triterpenes, polysaccharides, alkaloids, nucleosides, steroids, glycosides, volatile compounds, and organic acids have been isolated and identified from the different parts of this plant. Many of them have been considered as the bioactive compounds related to the pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antilipemic, abirritant, sedative, liver and renal protectives, immunomodulatory, and antineoplastic effects [
