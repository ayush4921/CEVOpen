<p>Flavonoids are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, which is regulated by numerous enzymes such as 
 <italic>pal</italic>, 
 <italic>chs</italic>, 
 <italic>chi</italic>, and 
 <italic>fls</italic> etc. These enzymes are induced by light conditions in both direct and indirect mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Some recent reports showed that each plant species has often independently absorbed a specific light requirement for its maximum secondary metabolites including flavonoids. For example, a high amount of flavonoids of

 <italic>Labisa pumilar</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] were accumulated under lower light intensity, while soybean (
