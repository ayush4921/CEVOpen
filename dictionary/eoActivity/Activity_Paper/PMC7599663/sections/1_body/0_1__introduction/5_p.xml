<p>Due to its high valuable medicinal properties and significant beneficial effects on human health and negligible side effects, 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> is being overexploited in nature and largely depleted. This plant was listed in the Red Book in many countries, including Vietnam, as an endangered species that is urgently conserved and protected. Much worldwide effort has been focused on 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> research and its products such as tissue culture and cultivation techniques. However, the wild 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plants are often degenerated due to its specific growth conditions, delayed germination, and growth rates [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, to meet increasing the global market demands for its herbal and functional food properties as well as to conserve and protect the wild resource of this species, it is an imperative work to simultaneously improve both yield and secondary metabolites of this plant. To the best of our knowledge, no studies are available so far on the responses of various LED light sources on the gene expression activities and flavonoids accumulation of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> in the acclimatization stage during in vitro propagation. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of using the various LED lights on the growth and morphological characteristics, production of total flavonoid contents, and expressional characteristics of several flavonoids-synthesis-related genes of this medicinal plant.
