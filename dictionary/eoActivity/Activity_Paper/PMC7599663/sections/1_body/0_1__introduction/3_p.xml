<p>Light is an indispensable environmental factor for plant growth and development. The application of artificial light is more useful than using chemicals to manage plant architecture and simultaneously reduce environmental impacts [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The prompt development of lighting technologies using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has led to increasing the application of this technology for lighting in closed horticultural systems [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Various effects of LED light on morphology and development were observed in many plant subjects. Numerous studies showed that a combination of red and blue light at the appropriate ratio is more necessary for plant growth and development than a monochromatic red or blue LED light [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, the characteristics of LED (light wavelength, intensity, and light duration) also significantly affect the accumulation of metabolites in plants [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An increase in primary and secondary compounds such as sugars, starches, vitamin C, proteins, and polyphenols, etc., was obviously seen in red or blue LEDs compared with fluorescent lamp [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Monochromatic red LED stimulated anthocyanin accumulation in 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic> Borkh more significantly than monochromatic blue LED, which has been identified as due to an increased expression of anthocyanin synthesis gene (
 <italic>MdMYB10</italic> and 
 <italic>MdUFGT</italic> gene) under the influence of the red LED [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The phenol content, total isoflavones, and antioxidant capacity of soybean germ when grown under LED blue light (470 nm) were also higher than those of LED green (530 nm) and florescent light [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. LED blue light (440–540 nm, peak wavelength of 469 nm) had a positive impact on 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. After 40 days of planting under LED Blue light, the harvested 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plants had significantly higher biomass, chlorophyll content, and secondary metabolites (flavonoids and total polyphenols) compared with the non-illuminated formula and other LED formulas in the experiment [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The lowest total flavonoid content was in the formula yellow light (540–620 nm, peak wavelength 592 nm), while the total polyphenol content was the lowest in the green light treatment (460–600 nm, peak wavelength 519 nm) [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The green LED (510 nm), yellow LED (595 nm), and LED combination of red LED with white LED also increased the antioxidant properties and anthocyanin accumulation of many different crops [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The coordination ratio of blue and red LEDs less than 1 is optimal for anthocyanins accumulation in plants, whereas for flavonols accumulation, the amount of blue light can be reduced to zero depending on the specific phenolic compounds and specific plant types [
