<p>In summary, light source influenced not only plant growth and morphogenesis but also metabolites accumulation. This paper showed that 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> required both blue and red wavelengths for normal development. Plants grew under BR light (1 blue diodes with 4 red diodes) obtained the highest stem diameter, leaf area, and biomass. Especially, BR light could promote the accumulation of flavonoid properly due to enhancing expression of several critical genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. This paper provides an effective method that uses LED light to improve the development and flavonoid accumulation in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic>.
