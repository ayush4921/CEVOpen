<p>Plant species show different responses to light quality through the photoreceptors system. Generally, red and blue light exert the greatest effects on plant growth. For instance, the plant height of 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and 
 <italic>Tagetes erecta</italic> was more stimulated under the blue light than red and fluorescent white light condition [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; meanwhile, the red light was exerted a suppressive impact on leaf area, fresh weight, and plant height of cucumber seedlings [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, the leaf area of 
 <italic>Alternanthera brasilianna</italic> was significantly enlarged [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] but induced shorter stems and roots of 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> seedlings under the blue light treatment [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Contrarily, the red light was reported to significantly stimulate the height and weight of 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The phenomenon of the different growth responses to red or blue light reflects the ability of plants to reciprocate changes in the light environment to complete their life cycle, and also due to the different action different actions of phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, cryptochromes and phototropin are either sensitive to blue or red wavelengths [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Most research showed that mono-wavelength might cause several drawbacks to a plantâ€™s development. Therefore, in this study, in order to maintain the balance between regular developments and secondary compounds accumulation, the different wavelengths were combined.
