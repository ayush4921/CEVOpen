<p>The chalcone naringenin formed by the 
 <italic>chs</italic> enzyme is an open-chain and needs to be closed by the chalcone isomerase (
 <italic>chi</italic>) enzyme. Therefore, the transcription, as well as the enzyme activity of 
 <italic>chi</italic>, play an essential role in the synthesis of the basic aglycone of flavonoids after which this product will be used to synthesize different flavonoid branches by responsive genes evaluated the correlation between 
 <italic>chi</italic> mRNA accumulation and anthocyanin concentration in 
 <italic>Ophiorrhiza japonica</italic>. The authors reported that transcription of 
 <italic>chi</italic> is one of the factors that directly affected the anthocyanin content in 
 <italic>Ophiorrhiza japonica</italic>. This hypothesis is also supported by the previous study, which inactivated or increased the 
 <italic>chi</italic> expressional level led to changes in anthocyanin and flavonoid contents in many plant species [

 <italic>fls</italic> gene also plays a vital role in flavonoid biosynthesis. 
 <italic>fls</italic> encodes for flavonol synthase enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction transforming Dihydrokaempforol into Kaempferol (the major aglycon in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> flavonoids) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01344-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d showed that among tested lights conditions, BR LED showed the highest expressional level in both 
 <italic>chi</italic> and 
 <italic>fls</italic> gene (respectively, 1.18 and 1.21 times compared with FL). This might be one of the main reasons for the increasing of flavonoid contents in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> cultured under BR LED light in comparison with those under FL or other LED lights (
