<p>Biological rhythms work based on the participation of many environmental induction factors, including light-sensing receptors. In particular, these receptors are affected by the lighting cycle as well as the characteristics of the lighting spectrum [

In this experiment, the different lighting conditions could influence the activity of those receptors and indirectly impact the activity of some genes that are controlled by circadian rhythms. However, further studies are required to reveal the correlation between light spectrum, light receptors, biological rhyme, and the flavonoid synthesis process in
