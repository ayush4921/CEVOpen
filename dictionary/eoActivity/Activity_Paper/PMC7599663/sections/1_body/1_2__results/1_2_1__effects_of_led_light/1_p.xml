<p>In this study, the different treatments of LEDs influenced the growth and morphological characteristics as well as cell anatomy of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> were investigated. The average height of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> was higher in the red, blue, and mixed BR treatments than in FL and BRW151 or BRW142 light (

The red light caused the most inhibitory effects on the stem diameter, while no significant difference in stem diameter was detected in all light treatments. They induced smaller and weaker stem diameter than under the fluorescent or other LED lights (

Interestingly, the highest cell width was identified in blue treatment (36.87 µm), the next was BRW151 (33.11 µm), and the lowest was BR (30.31 µm). Contrarily, the cell width was inhibited under the red and BRW142 treatments. The highest cell length was in the red and BR by 44.33 µm and 44.2 µm, respectively. Meanwhile, the blue light remarkably suppressed the cell length and no significant difference was identified in BRW151 and BRW142 (

 <sup>2</sup>) than the other light treatments. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in leaf area among the blue, BRW151, and BRW142 treatments. Only the red light induced an inhibitory effect on the leaf area (1.99 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) in comparison with the FL treatment (3.36 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01344-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The number of roots per plant was significantly increased in the blue and BRW142, while the other treatments showed negligible enhancement. The highest average of root length was in BRW142, and no significant difference was found in three treatments of red, BR, and BRW151.
