<p>As the above mentions, the obtained results indicated that the material biomass, including the stem cell anatomy of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> showed broad variation responses under the different LED light treatments. The relative influence percentage of LED lights on each morphological and development indexes compared to FL were theoretically transformed from the average value when the value of each index of FL was assumed to be 100% (

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plants was calculated from nine transformed data. Interestingly, we have found that the highest total average influence was in the BR treatment, while a slight inhibition was in the red treatment. All other light treatments showed negligible effects compared with the FL (
