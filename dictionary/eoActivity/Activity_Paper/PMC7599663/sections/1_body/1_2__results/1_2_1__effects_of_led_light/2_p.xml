<p>The stem cell anatomy of this plant was significantly affected by the LEDs. Specifically, under the blue light, the highest cell width value was detected (36.87 µm), followed by BRW151 (33.11 µm) and BR (30.31 µm), while the lowest value of cell width was found under the red light (25.37 µm) and BRW142 (27.64 µm), which was lower than that of FL (28.58 µm). Interestingly, remarkable differences in cell length were found under the red and BR lights of which red light immensely promoted cell development in longitude direction; whereas, the blue light strongly inhibited the development (

Compared to the control (FL) light, leaf area was dramatically reduced under the red light treatment, whilst the blue light, BRW151, and BRW142 exerted no significant effects. However, only BR was found to strikingly enhance the leaf area (
