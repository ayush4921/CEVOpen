<p>For the CDK2 protein structure (PDB ID: 1FVT); water molecules were first removed, as for the GSK-3β protein structure (PDB ID: 1Q41); Chain B and water molecules which are not involved in binding were first removed, whereas, two conservative water molecules near chain A Thr138 that serve a functional role in the co-crystalized inhibitor binding were kept

 </xref>. Then, the proteins were prepared for the docking study using 
 <italic>LigX</italic> protocol in MOE with default options. The co-crystalized ligands were used to define the active site for docking. Triangle Matcher placement method and London dG scoring function were used for docking. Self-docking of the co-crystallized ligands in the active site of the kinase domains was first performed to validate the used docking protocol giving a docking pose with an energy score (S) = −10.63 kcal/mol and an RMSD of 0.894 Å in CDK2 (PDB ID: 1FVT) and energy score (S) = −12.00 kcal/mol and an RMSD of 0.471 Å in GSK-3β (PDB ID: 1Q41),
