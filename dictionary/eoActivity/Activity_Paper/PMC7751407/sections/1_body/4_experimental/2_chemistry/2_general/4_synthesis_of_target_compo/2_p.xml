<p>5-Bromobenzofuran-2-carbohydrazide 
 <bold>3</bold> (0.3 g, 1.2 mmol) was added to a hot solution of equivalent amount of the appropriate isatin derivative (
 <bold>4a–g</bold> or 
 <bold>6a–h</bold>) in ethanol (15 ml) with catalytic amount of ethanoic acid. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 4–7 h with TLC monitoring, once the reaction completed, the reaction mixture was left for cooling then was filtered-off. The produced solid was washed with water, diethyl ether and recrystallized from dioxane/propanol mixture to produce target compounds 
 <bold>5a–g</bold> and 
 <bold>7a–h</bold>, respectively.
