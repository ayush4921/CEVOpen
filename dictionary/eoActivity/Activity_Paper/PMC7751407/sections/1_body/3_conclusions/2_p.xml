<p>In the present study three series of oxindole-benzofuran hybrids were designed and synthesised as dual CDK2/GSK-3β inhibitors targeting breast cancer (
 <bold>5a-g</bold>, 
 <bold>7a-h</bold>, and 
 <bold>13a-b</bold>). In MTT assay on the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D, the 
 <italic>N
  <sup>1</sup>
 </italic>-unsubstituted oxindole derivatives, 
 <bold>series 5</bold>, showed moderate to potent activity on both breast cancer cell lines. Compounds 
 <bold>5d-f</bold> showed the most potent cytotoxic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.41, 3.45 and 2.27 μM, respectively, on MCF-7 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.82, 4.53 and 7.80 μM, respectively, on T-47D cell lines, in comparison to the used reference standard (staurosporine) IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.81 and 4.34 μM, respectively. On the other hand, the 
 <italic>N
  <sup>1</sup>
 </italic>-substituted oxindole derivatives, 
 <bold>series 7 and 13</bold>, showed moderate to weak cytotoxic activity on both breast cancer cell lines except for compound 
 <bold>7 h</bold> which showed potent antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.32 and 1.72 μM on MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines, respectively. CDK2 and GSK-3β inhibition testing of the potent 
 <bold>series 5</bold> indicated that compounds 
 <bold>5d</bold> and 
 <bold>5f</bold> exhibit potent dual CDK2/GSK-3β inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 37.77 and 52.75 nM, respectively, on CDK2 and 32.09 and 40.13 nM, respectively, on GSK-3β. The most potent hybrids 
 <bold>5d-f</bold> triggered cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase as a consequence of their dual CDK2/GSK-3β inhibition. Moreover, compounds 
 <bold>5d-f</bold> induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as indicated by the percent of the total apoptosis of 13.75, 19.74, and 26.10%, respectively, in comparison to the untreated cells which showed 0.82% total apoptosis. The molecular docking study showed that the newly synthesised 
 <italic>N
  <sup>1</sup>
 </italic>-unsubstituted oxindole hybrids have comparable binding patterns in both CDK2 and GSK-3β. The oxindole ring is accommodated in the hinge region interacting through hydrogen bonding with the backbone CO and NH of the key amino acids Glu81 and Leu83, respectively, in CDK2 and Asp133 and Val135, respectively, in GSK-3β. Moreover, through hydrophobic interaction the fused phenyl ring of the oxindole nucleus interacts with the hydrophobic side chains of the surrounding amino acids; Val18, Ala31, Val64, Phe80, Leu134, and Ala144 in CDK2 and Val70, Ala83, Val110, Leu132, Leu188, and Cys199 in GSK-3β. The hydrazono linker NH interacts through hydrogen bonding with the backbone CO of Leu83 and Val135 in CDK2 and GSK-3β, respectively, projecting the benzofuran moiety outward towards the bulk solvent which is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic side chains of the surrounding amino acids lining the gate of the hinge region; Ile10, Phe82, and Leu298 in CDK2 and Ile62, Tyr134 and Pro136 in GSK-3β. In series

 </italic>-substitutions on the oxindole nucleus hinder the compounds from achieving the key interactions with hinge region amino acids; Glu81 and Leu83 in CDK2, and Asp133 and Val135 in GSK-3β what rationalises their moderate to low antiproliferative activity.
