 </italic>-substitutions on the oxindole nucleus hinder the compounds from achieving the key interactions with hinge region amino acids; Glu81 and Leu83 in CDK2, and Asp133 and Val135 in GSK-3Î² what rationalises their moderate to low antiproliferative activity (For further details, see supporting materials). Molecular docking simulations show their non-selective bindings and random binding patterns what rationalise their low activity despite of their good docking binding scores (
