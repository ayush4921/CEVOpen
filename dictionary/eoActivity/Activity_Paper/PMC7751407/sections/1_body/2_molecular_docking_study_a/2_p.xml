 </xref>, respectively, which are co-crystallized with potent CDK2 and GSK-3β oxindole-based inhibitors, respectively. Molecular docking was carried out to investigate the interaction of the designed hybrid compounds with CDK2 and GSK-3β kinase domain to rationalise their biological activity, to reveal their probable binding pattern and to elicit their SAR.
