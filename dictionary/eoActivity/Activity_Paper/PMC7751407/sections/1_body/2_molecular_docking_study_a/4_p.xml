<p>In the CDK2 active site the docking pose of the oxindole derivative reproduced the key interactions of the co-crystalized ligand with the active site; it interacts in the hinge region through hydrogen bonding with Glu81 backbone CO and Leu83 backbone NH and CO. Furthermore, its sulfonamidophenylhydrazone group projected outward towards the bulk solvent with the sulphonamide group interacting with Asp86 backbone NH and side-chain carboxyl group and Lys89 side chain NH
