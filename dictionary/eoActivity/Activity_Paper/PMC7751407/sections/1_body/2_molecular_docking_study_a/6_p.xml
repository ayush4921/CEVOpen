 </italic>-unsubstituted oxindole hybrids showed comparable binding patterns in both kinases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figures 9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">10</xref> and for further details, see supporting materials). The oxindole ring is accommodated in the hinge region interacting through hydrogen bonding by its NH and CO with the backbone CO and NH of the key amino acids Glu81 and Leu83, respectively, in CDK2, and Asp133 and Val135, respectively, in GSK-3Î².
