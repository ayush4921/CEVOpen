<p>Initially, self-docking of the co-crystallized ligands in CDK2 and GSK-3β active sites was performed to validate the used molecular docking protocol. The self-docking step stimulated the binding pattern of the co-crystallized ligands accurately indicating the suitability of the used docking setup for the planned simulations. This was demonstrated by the small RMSD between the docked and the co-crystallized ligand poses in CDK2 (0.894 Å) and GSK-3β (0.471 Å), and by the ability of the attained docking poses to simulate the main interactions achieved by the co-crystallized ligands with the key amino acids in CDK2 and GSK-3β active sites (
