<p>Moreover, through hydrophobic interaction the fused phenyl ring of the oxindole nucleus interacts with the hydrophobic side chains of the surrounding amino acids; Val18, Ala31, Val64, Phe80, Leu134, and Ala144 in CDK2 and Val70, Ala83, Val110, Leu132, Leu188, and Cys199 in GSK-3β (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">10</xref> and for further details, see supporting materials). Therefore, increasing the substituent hydrophobicity on the oxindole nucleus enhances the binding affinity which is well reflected in the docking binding score and further in the biological activity (Br,

 <xref rid="t0001 t0002 t0006" ref-type="table">Tables 1, 2 and 6</xref>). The remarkable binding affinity of the relatively polar methoxy group (OCH
 <sub>3</sub>, 
 <bold>5f</bold>) is attributed to the fact that it is directed towards the bulk solvent and so decreased the solvation penalty during the binding scenario resulting in a considerable increase in the binding affinity. On the other hand, despite of its relatively higher hydrophobicity, the dimethyl substituted hybrid 
 <bold>5 g</bold> does not show significant predicted binding score or experimental biological activity what could be attributed to the C
 <sup>7</sup> methyl substituent which sterically clashes with the bottom of the hinge region hindering the key interaction of the NH and CO of the oxindole ring with the key amino acids; Glu81 and Leu83 in CDK2, respectively, and Asp133 and Val135 in GSK-3β, respectively (For further details, see supporting materials).
