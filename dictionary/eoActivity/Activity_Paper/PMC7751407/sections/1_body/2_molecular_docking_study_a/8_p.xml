<p>The hydrazono linker NH interacts through hydrogen bonding with the backbone CO of Leu83 and Val135 in CDK2 and GSK-3β, respectively, projecting the benzofuran moiety outward towards the bulk solvent which is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic side chains of the surrounding amino acids lining the gate of the hinge region; Ile10, Phe82, and Leu298 in CDK2 and Ile62, Tyr134 and Pro136 in GSK-3β (
