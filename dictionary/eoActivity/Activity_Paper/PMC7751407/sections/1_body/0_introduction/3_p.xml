<p>The prominent and critical importance of PKs dictates strict regulation of their cellular levels and activities, therefore, PKs dysregulation contributes to several diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders (such as diabetes), cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease), inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis)
