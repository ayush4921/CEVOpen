<p>The complex nature of cancer mandates the implementation of multitarget treatment strategies

 </xref>. Moreover, in several cancer types especially solid tumours, such as breast cancer, more than one PK is upregulated and contributes to carcinogenesis

 </xref>. Thus, the use of multiple PK inhibitors is an emerging and appealing trend to overcome cancer development, progression, and resistance. A possible drawback of this approach is the pharmacokinetics (ADME) interference among the co-administered inhibitors, another concern is the potential toxicity of the used combination. To avoid these drawbacks, the design of small-molecules that are intentionally tailored to target more than one PK (multikinase inhibitors) was considered
