<p>Benzofuran is another privileged scaffold that demonstrated several desirable biological activities among which are analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antihyperglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-oxidant, as well as anticancer activities

 </xref>. Benzofuran derivatives mediate their anticancer activity through several mechanism such as farnesyltransferase, angiogenesis, oestrogen receptor, human peptide deformylase, tubulin polymerisation, and carbonic anhydrase inhibition
