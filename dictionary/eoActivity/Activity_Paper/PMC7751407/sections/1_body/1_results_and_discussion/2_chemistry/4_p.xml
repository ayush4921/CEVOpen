<p>In the last scheme, the ester moiety of 5-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate 
 <bold>2</bold> succumbed to acidic hydrolysis to afford the acid analogue 
 <bold>8</bold>, which was chlorinated with oxalyl chloride in toluene to get the acid chloride derivative 
 <bold>9</bold> that reacted with NaN
 <sub>3</sub> in acetone to produce 5-bromobenzofuran-2-carbonyl azide 
 <bold>10</bold>. The azide derivative 
 <bold>10</bold> was subjugated to Curtius Rearrangement through heating in anhydrous toluene to furnish isocyanate analogue 
 <bold>11</bold>. On the other hand, isatin derivatives 
 <bold>6c</bold> and 
 <bold>6e</bold> were condensed with hydrazine hydrate to release their hydrazone analogue 
 <bold>12a</bold> and 
 <bold>12â€‰b</bold>, respectively, which reacted with isocyanate analogue 
 <bold>11</bold> to get the final target compounds 
 <bold>13a-b</bold>.
