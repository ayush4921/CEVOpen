<p>The synthetic strategies designed for the preparation of the target final compounds (
 <bold>5a-g</bold>, 
 <bold>7a-h</bold> and 
 <bold>13a-b</bold>) were illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001 s0002 s0003">Schemes 1â€“3</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001">Scheme 1</xref>, bromobenzofuran-2-carbohydrazide 
 <bold>3</bold> was prepared 
 <italic>via</italic> reaction of ethylbromacetate with 5-bromosalicylaldehyde 
 <bold>1</bold> in acetonitrile to furnish ethyl 5-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate 
 <bold>2</bold>. Thereafter, the ester functionality was subjected to hydrazinolysis via refluxing hydrazine hydrate to afford the key intermediate hydrazide 
 <bold>3</bold>, further; this key intermediate 
 <bold>3</bold> was condensed with different isatin derivatives 
 <bold>4a-g</bold> in absolute ethyl alcohol with catalytic drops of glacial acetic acid to get the final novel compounds 
 <bold>5a-g</bold>.
