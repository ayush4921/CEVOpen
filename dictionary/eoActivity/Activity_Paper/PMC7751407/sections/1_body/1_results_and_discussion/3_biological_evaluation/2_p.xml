<p>All the newly synthesised compounds were initially tested for their anti-proliferative activity against breast cancer cell lines T-47D and MCF-7 in MTT assay. Compounds showed promising anti-proliferative activity were tested for their PK inhibitory activity on the target kinases CDK-2 and GSK-3Î². Furthermore, compounds showed prominent activity at cellular level and on enzymes were further evaluated for their effect on cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.</p>
