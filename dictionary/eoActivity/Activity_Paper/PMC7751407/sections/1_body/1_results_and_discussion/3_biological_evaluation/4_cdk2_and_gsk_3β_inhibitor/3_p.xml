<p>On CDK2, the tested compounds showed potent sub-micromolar inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 37.80 to 177 nM in comparison to that of the used reference standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 38.50 nM). The bromo isatin derivative 
 <bold>5d</bold> showed the most potent inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 37.80 nM comparable to that of staurosporine. Compounds 
 <bold>5 b</bold>, 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5f</bold> showed two-digit nanomolar inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 52.50, 85.40 and 52.80, respectively (
