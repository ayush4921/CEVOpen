<p>Compounds showing promising antiproliferative as well as kinase inhibitory activity 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold> and 
 <bold>5f</bold> were further investigated for their influence on the cell cycle progression by flow cytometry analysis using propidium iodide (PI) stain. Cell cycle parameters were compared for the breast cancer MCF-7 cells with DMSO as control and after treatment with the compounds of interest and incubation for 24â€‰h, and the results were presented in
