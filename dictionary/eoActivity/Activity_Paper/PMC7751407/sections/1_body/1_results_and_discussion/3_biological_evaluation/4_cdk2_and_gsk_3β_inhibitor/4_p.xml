<p>On GSK-3β, the tested compounds showed potent sub-micromolar inhibitory activity as well with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 32.09–212.30 nM in comparison to the used reference standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.38 nM). The bromo isatin 
 <bold>5d</bold> and the methoxy isatin 
 <bold>5f</bold> derivative showed more potent inhibitory activity than that of staurosporine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 32.09 and 40.13 nM, respectively). Compounds 
 <bold>5e</bold> and 
 <bold>5 g</bold> showed two-digit nanomolar inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 75.54 and 80.75 nM, respectively (
