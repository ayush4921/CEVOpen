<p>From the obtained results 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, it is noticeable that there is an increase in the percent of cell distribution in the G2/M phase, from 11.30% in control to 30.26, 29.21 and 37.82% in treated cells with 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold> and, 
 <bold>5f</bold>, respectively, indicating a G2/M phase arrest which is the expected consequence from CDK2/GSK-3Î² dual inhibition confirming the mechanism of action of the designed compounds on the target kinases. Furthermore, an increase in the percent of cells accumulated in the sub-G1 phase, from 1.29% in the control to 13.27, 17.73 and 22.02% in the treated cells with 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold> and, 
 <bold>5f</bold>, respectively, as a result of cell apoptosis.
