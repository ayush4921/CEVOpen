 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show that the percentage of the total apoptotic cells in MCF-7 cell line increases after treatment with compounds 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, and 
 <bold>5f</bold> (13.75, 19.74, and 26.10%, respectively) relative to control cells (0.82%) which is a significant indication of the apoptotic effect of the compounds of interest. Compounds 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, and 
 <bold>5f</bold> produced an increase in the early apoptotic phase, from 0.63 to 3.61, 4.66, and 3.94, respectively, and an increase in the late apoptotic phase, from 0.19 to 10.14, 15.08, and 22.16, respectively.
