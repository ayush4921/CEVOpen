<p>Co-crystalized ligand acarbose of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase was used as standard in this study. The chemical structure of the co-crystalized ligand (PDB Ligand ID: ACR) extracted from the enzymesâ€™ active sites was converted to a PDBQT file using the PyRx tool to generate atomic coordinates, and energy was minimized by optimization using the optimization algorithm at force field set at mmff94 (required) on PyRx.</p>
