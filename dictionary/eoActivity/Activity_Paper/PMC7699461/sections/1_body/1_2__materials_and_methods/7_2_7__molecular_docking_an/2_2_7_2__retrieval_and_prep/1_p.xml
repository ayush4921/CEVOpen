<p>The three-dimensional crystal structure of alpha-amylase Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3BAI and resolution 1.9 Å) and alpha-glucosidase (PDB ID: 2QMJ) in complex with co-crystallized ligand (acarbose), an inhibitor of both proteins was retrieved from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) PDB (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do</uri>). The proteins were prepared using PyMol tool. While preparing the proteins, the bound complex molecules with the proteins and non-essential water molecules were removed. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 was employed to eliminate entire heteroatoms. The co-crystallized ligand was extracted from the protein’s active site so as to reveal the grid coordinate around the binding pocket when viewed on PyMol and Discovery Studio 2017 R2 visualizer.
