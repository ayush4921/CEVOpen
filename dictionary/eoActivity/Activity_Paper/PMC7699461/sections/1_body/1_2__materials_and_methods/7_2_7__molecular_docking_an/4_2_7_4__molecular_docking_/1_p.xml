<p>Following drug target and ligand preparation, molecular docking analysis was performed using PyRx, AutoDock Vina option based on scoring functions. After the docking process, the grid box resolution was centered at 8.3860 × 28.6135 × 50.1812 for alpha-amylase while it was −29.930 × 7.7002 × −17.8920 for alpha-glucosidase along the x, y, and z axes, respectively, at a grid dimension of 25 × 25 × 25 Å to define the binding site. The standards were first docked within the binding site of the enzymes and the resulting interactions were compared with that of isolated compounds into the same active sites using the same grid box dimension.</p>
