<p>Main fraction XIII (1040 mg) was applied to repeated silica gel column chromatography using hexane and ethyl acetate in order of rising polarity ((from Hex [70%]:EtOAc [30%] to 100% EtOAc)), followed by sephadex (95% methanol). Sub-fraction XIII-5 (154.3 mg) was injected into the preparative high-performance column chromatography (HPLC) and eluted using a gradient of methanol and de-ionized water (70:30 to 100% MeOH in 45 min), which showed a prominent peak, that produced a single spot labeled as
