 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (pNPG), di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Cape Town, South Africa. The organic solvents used in this study were supplied by Merck, Cape Town, South Africa. The NMR spectra were carried out on an Avance 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) using deuterated chloroform. Preparative HPLC was utilized for the purification of compounds using HPLC-grade methanol and distilled water.
