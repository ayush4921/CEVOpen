<p>Diabetes mellitus involves oxidative stress in both etiology and pathogenesis pathways. However, oxidative stress happens when the generation of free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical, overpowers the inherent cellular antioxidant defense system leading to oxidative stress and eventual damage to macromolecules related to the release of insulin [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The disruption of physiological metabolic process by diabetes causes leakage and overproduction of superoxide anion in mitochondrial energy metabolism. The excessive production and seeping of superoxide anion is essential for diabetes complications such as insulin resistance, Î²-cell dysfunction, and weakened glucose tolerance [

The usage of medicinal herbs in the management of diabetes and oxidative stress is well known, and these herbs contain bioactive constituents such as flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, carotenoids, vitamins, and numerous other phytochemicals, which can act as antidiabetics and/or antioxidants/radical scavengers [
