<p>Abietane type diterpenes are well reputed to exhibit powerful radical scavenging activity because of the existence of ortho-dihydroxyl groups in the benzene ring, serving as hydrogen atom abstracting and/or electron donating agents and metal ion-chelators [

Antioxidant property is beneficial because of the ability to scavenge free radicals, while prooxidation promotes the oxidation reaction, which is lethal. The phenoxyl radical produced from phenolic compounds can be soothed by either addition of protons or loss of electrons to another molecule [
