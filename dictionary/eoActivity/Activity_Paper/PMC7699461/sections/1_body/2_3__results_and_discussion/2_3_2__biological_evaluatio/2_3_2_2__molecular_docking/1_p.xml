<p>Molecular docking analysis shows that there is no leading compound among the isolated compounds docked against alpha-amylase. All the compounds have binding energy lower than standard acarbose with −8.5 Kcal/mol (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01149-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The result is in accord with the observed in vitro experiment with acarbose having the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> compared with that of other compounds. Contrarily, however, the docking results of alpha-glucosidase show that 7-methoxyrosmanol is the leading compound with the highest binding energy of −14.9 Kcal/mol while standard had −14.5 Kcal/mol. This result is in consonance with what is obtained in the in vitro experiment, with 7-methoxyrosmanol having the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, which implies the highest inhibitory activity as compared to that of other compounds. The docking complex of 7-methoxyrosmanol with alpha-glucosidase was stabilized by four hydrogen bonds and fourteen hydrophobic interactions as presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01149-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The amino residues of alpha-glucosidase that are common to both acarbose and 7-methoxyrosmanol in providing hydrogen bonds are ALA 537 and PHE 535 with a distance of 2.75117 and 3.11041 Å, respectively, for acarbose and 2.97128 and 3.03951 Å, respectively, for 7-methoxyrosmanol. In addition, ALA 536, ALA 537, and ILE 523 residues that provide hydrophobic interaction for acarbose are also part of the residues involved in 7-methoxyrosmanol hydrophobic interactions. This indicates that 7-methoxyrosmanol binds to alpha-glucosidase in a space close to where the acarbose binds to the protein. Acarbose is a known competitive inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, which means that it binds to the active site of the protein [
