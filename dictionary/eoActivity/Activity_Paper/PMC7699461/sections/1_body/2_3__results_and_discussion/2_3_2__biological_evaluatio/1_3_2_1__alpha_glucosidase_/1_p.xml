<p>The main enzymes involved in the digestion of carbohydrates are alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, together with lipids [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Their mechanism of action involves the breakdown of carbohydrates by alpha-amylase, while alpha-glucosidase breaks down starch and disaccharides to glucose [

 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One of the therapeutic ways to combat DM is to delay postprandial hyperglycemia by reducing the absorption of glucose through the inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase) in the gastrointestinal canal [

 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, suppressors of these enzymes delay carbohydrate digestion, which causes a reduction in the rate of glucose absorption and, consequently, reduces the postprandial increase of plasma glucose [

Hence, many efforts have been made to look for more effective and safe inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase from natural sources for the development of physiologically functional drugs for the prevention and management of diabetes [

 <italic>S. aurita</italic> against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase was performed, and the results demonstrated that 
 <bold>3</bold> exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory capacity with an IC

 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.96 ± 1.0 and 28.74 ± 0.9 µg/mL, respectively, while 
 <bold>4</bold> displayed the highest alpha amylase inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 16.2 ± 0.3 µg/mL followed by 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 19.8 ± 1.4 and 40.9 ± 1.2 µg/mL, respectively, as showed in
