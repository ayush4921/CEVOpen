<p>According to the pre-established criteria, five clinical studies were included in this review: 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> in three formulations. The main methodological characteristics and outcomes of selected studies are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. An experimental gel containing 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> EO healed completely (34%) or partially (56%) patients with prosthetic stomatitis as compared to those who received only the gel with a placebo. In addition, the gel was effective in reducing the fungal load as well as in decreasing erythema in patients with prosthetic stomatitis as compared to those treated with the placebo. Another experimental gel containing 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> EO was also effective in reducing the fungal load in participants' saliva and denture samples as well as 
 <italic>n</italic> reducing local inflammation.
