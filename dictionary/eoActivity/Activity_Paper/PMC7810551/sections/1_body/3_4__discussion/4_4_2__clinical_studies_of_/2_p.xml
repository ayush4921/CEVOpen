<p>Sabzghabaee et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] evaluated the clinical efficacy of a gel containing 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> EO for the treatment of prosthetic stomatitis. This study presented a low risk of bias for aspects related to randomization and blinding and showed high methodological quality according to Jadad's scale [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another clinical study, conducted by Amanlou et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], showed that 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> EO is also effective to treat prosthetic stomatitis. Denture wearers applied the gel containing 0.1% of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> EO four times a day for two weeks. The presence of erythema on the palate surface of participants was significantly reduced as well as CFU counts of yeast strains. Although limitations related to randomization were observed in the study by Amanlou et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it showed a low risk of bias, which suggests that 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> EO may be a favorable therapeutic alternative for the treatment of prosthetic stomatitis.
