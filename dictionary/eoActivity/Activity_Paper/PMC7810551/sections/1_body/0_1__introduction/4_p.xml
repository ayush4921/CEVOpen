<p>This scenario has encouraged the search for novel substances capable of controlling and treating yeast infections while having low toxicity to the host. Some naturally occurring products are considered an important source of new molecules with biological properties, displaying antifungal efficacy comparable or stronger than that of drugs currently available for clinical use. Essential oils (EOs) are a class of natural products with pharmacological properties, which include antimicrobial, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These compounds are described as a mixture of volatile constituents produced as secondary metabolites by aromatic plants. With the chemical characteristic of lipophilicity, EOs have the ability to interact with fungal cell membranes and lipid structures. Among their mechanisms of action, EO can disrupt the activity of enzymes involved in ergosterol synthesis or complex with membrane ergosterol, thereby creating pores in the membrane and disrupting permeability [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, EO can affect cell wall biosynthesis, interfere with protein synthesis or cell division, and stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species, causing growth inhibition or cell death [
