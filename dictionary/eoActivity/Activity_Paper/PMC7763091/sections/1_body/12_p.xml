<p>Arbutin is the β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside of hydroquinone, which occurs in the leaves of a number of medicinal plants—for example, in “bearberries” of the 
 <italic>Ericaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Saxifragaceae</italic> families. The leaves of these plants have been traditionally used as folk medicines both in China and the Americas, especially for wound healing and treatment of urinary tract infections. The review by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] covers the previous syntheses of arbutin as well as its biosynthesis. The review culminates in biocatalytic synthesis of arbutin through a one pot production which circumvents the use of hydroquinone. This unusual approach starts with benzene which is first chemo- and regioselectively dihydroxylated with a mutant cytochrome P450-BM3. The in situ formed hydroquinone is glycosylated by an appropriate arbutin synthetase. The one pot whole cell cascade in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> leads from benzene to arbutin in yields of 80–83%.
