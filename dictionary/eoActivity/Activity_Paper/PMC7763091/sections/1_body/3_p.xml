<p>Rhizoxins are 16-membered macrolides responsible for the rice seedling blight, a plant disease that leads to cell cycle arrest and ultimately death of the plant. Rhizoxins are produced by an endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and passed on to the plant by a 
 <italic>Rhizopus</italic> fungus. The research group of Karl-Heinz Altman has a longstanding interest in macrocyclic natural products, and in [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] presented they detail carefully various synthetic approaches based on ring closing metathesis (RCM) targeting rhizoxin F. However, the RCM approaches eventually failed. Ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) pioneered by Fürstner eventually came to rescue and rhizoxin F was obtained in ≈1.5% overall yield from 1,4-butanediol in a sequence of 24 steps in the longest linear sequence. Additionally, a highly 
 <italic>Z</italic>-selective reduction method for alkynes was developed.
