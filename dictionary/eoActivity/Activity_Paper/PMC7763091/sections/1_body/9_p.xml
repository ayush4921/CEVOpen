<p>Pyranones with a long carbon chain at carbon atom 6 are natural compounds, which exhibit varied biological activities including anticancer, antiviral, antifungal, antituberculotic, and antimicrobial effects. The review by Avula et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] sums up the stereoselective syntheses of ten of these intriguing natural products. Many of the compounds have surrendered to several syntheses within the past decade or so; for instance, there are nine syntheses of dodoneine and 12 syntheses of rugulactone. For introduction of the chirality in the molecules, enantioselective allylation as well as the use of chiral pool starting materials are the most prominent approaches. Ring closing metathesis finds a special role for the formation of the pyranone ring and cross metathesis is prominent for the introduction of the sidechains. The value of total synthesis in proving the structures of isolated natural product is again highlighted by the fact that the structures of synargentolide A and passifloricin A have been corrected on the basis of syntheses.
