<p>Uncontrolled excessive acute inflammation, which by nature is self-resolving, and chronic unresolved inflammation may develop into several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurological disorders—e.g., Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to understand the processes inducing the resolution phase of inflammation and homeostasis (return to the normal physiology). A number of endogenously formed compounds have been coined specialized pro resolving mediators (SPMs), and in this paper [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Hansen’s research group describes the synthesis, structural confirmation, and biosynthesis of 22-OH-PD1
 <sub>n-3 DPA</sub>. The key reaction in the synthesis is a Sonogashira coupling of a vinyl bromide with a terminal alkyne followed by 
 <italic>Z</italic>-selective Boland reduction of the triple bond. Subsequent cellular studies revealed that 22-OH-PD1
 <sub>n-3 DPA</sub> is formed from n-3 docosapentaenoic acid in human serum and that 22-OH-PD1
 <sub>n-3 DPA</sub> is a secondary metabolite produced by ω-oxidation of PD1
 <sub>n-3 DPA</sub> in human neutrophils and in human monocytes.
