<p id="p0115">Methanolic extract fraction exhibited broad spectrum activity (inhibiting the growth of Gram-negative, Gram-positive, acid-fast bacteria, and fungi (Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>)). Additionally, it was easier to get more materials from this extract fraction for further analysis. Therefore, we subjected this fraction to GC-MS analysis to identify the specific bioactive compounds that could be partly associated with the activity of this fraction (
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We detected six compounds from the extract fraction, four alkanes, and two fatty acid esters. Based on the mass spectral library databases, these compounds were tentatively identified as hexadecane, octadecane, eicosane, 2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester-hexadecanoic acid, tetracosane, and 2,3-dihydroxy propyl ester-octadecanoic acid (
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The fatty acid esters represented by peaks at retention times 28.61 min (2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester-hexadecanoic acid) and 30.23 min (2,3-dihydroxy propyl ester-octadecanoic acid) were the most abundant compounds detected (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and it is highly possible that on their own or in combination with other secondary metabolites contributed wholly or in part to the bioactivity of this extract fraction.
