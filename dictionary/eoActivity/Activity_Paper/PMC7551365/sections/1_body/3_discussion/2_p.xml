<p id="p0120">Increasing demand for effective antimicrobials to lessen antimicrobial drug resistance burden and accelerate prompt prevention and treatment of microbial infections necessitates the discovery of new pharmaceutical molecules. This calls for a collaborative approach involving the herbal practitioners and scientific community in search of pharmaceutical molecules from traditionally-claimed active plants and scientifically validating their bioactivity. This comes at a time when most pharmaceutical industries seem reluctant and/or slow to develop novel antimicrobial agents, prompting an overreliance on the limited available antibiotics. This has consequently led to the emergence of superbugs insensitive to available antibiotic regimes [

Flashing back to before the advent of first-generation antibiotics in 1928, humans were using and are still using herbal preparations to manage, treat, and cure various ailments. Herbal medicine thus provides a solid foundation for the discovery of new agents against these health-threatening pathogens [
