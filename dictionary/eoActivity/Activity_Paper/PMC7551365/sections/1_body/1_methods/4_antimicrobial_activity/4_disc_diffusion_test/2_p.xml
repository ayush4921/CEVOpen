 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL using 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard and aseptically inoculated onto Muller Hinton agar (MHA) and Sabouraud Dextrose agar (SDA) plates, respectively. Sterilized Whatmann 1 filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm) were impregnated with 10 μL of stock extract solutions (1.0 g/mL crude methanol and water extracts, 500 μg/mL for petroleum ether, dichloromethane, methanolic fractions, and 250 μg/mL for ethyl acetate fraction (inadequate amounts)). Three standard drugs were used as antibiotics positive controls; Oxacillin at 10 μg/disc (Oxoid Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) for Gram-positive bacteria, Gentamycin at 10 μg/disc (Oxoid Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) for Gram-negative bacteria, and Nystatin at 100 μg/disc (Oxoid Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) for all fungi. Whatmann filter paper discs loaded with 10 μL of 1% DMSO (for solvent extract, and solvent extract fractions), and 10 μL of sterile physiological saline (for water crude extract) served as negative controls. Air-dried discs were carefully placed on the agar plates at equidistance points using sterile forceps, including both positive antibiotic control and negative control discs into each plate. Subsequently, the plates were initially incubated at 4 °C for 2 h to allow pre-diffusion of extracts into media and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Antimicrobial activity was assessed in triplicates by measuring the size of the inhibition zone to the nearest mm. Fractions exhibiting strong antimicrobial inhibitory potential were considered for further MIC and minimum microbicidal concentration analysis (MMC) determination [
