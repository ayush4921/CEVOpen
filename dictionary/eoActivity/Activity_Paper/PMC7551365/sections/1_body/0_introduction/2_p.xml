<p id="p0010">Infectious diseases are a primary cause of global human and animal mortality, which is further aggravated by frequent emergence and re-emergence of opportunistic infections [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, one of the major global health challenges is attributed to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortalities from a single infectious agent, which claimed the lives of over 1 million people, besides making an additional over 10 million people ill in 2018 [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In humans, TB is an airborne infection primarily caused by MTB [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. MTB thrives in the hostile environment of the human lungs, despite a sustained immunological onslaught of the host that prevents the growth of nearly all other bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MTB effectively survives host defenses because of a highly impermeable cellular envelope that covers it. The mycobacterial cell envelope is a complex heteropolymer composed of peptidoglycan covalently attached to arabinogalactan terminated by mycolic acids, specific to mycobacteria. Also, MTB can manipulate the host immunological defense mechanisms to foster its survival in a harsh environment [
