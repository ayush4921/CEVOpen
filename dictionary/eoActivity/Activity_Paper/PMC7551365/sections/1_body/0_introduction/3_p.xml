<p id="p0015">Effective management of MTB is hampered by a number of factors such as; (1) The widespread development of drug resistance (for example, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) which does not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) which is resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, plus fluoroquinolones and one of the injectable second-line drugs such as amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin used in MDR-TB treatment regimens) [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], (2) The manifestation of asymptomatic latent TB infection in nearly a fourth of the global population, (3) Expensive and lengthy treatment regime, (4) Drug toxicity and associated adverse effects, and (5) Slow phase discovery of new antitubercular agents among other factors [
