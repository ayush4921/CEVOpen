<p id="p0025">Although it is widely accepted that drug discovery is an expensive and time-consuming venture, exploration of certain plant species as an alternative source of pharmaceutical molecules, guided by traditional/indigenous knowledge has been very promising [

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The pharmacological activities of plant species are attributed to their phytochemicals such as terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, steroids, among others [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The traditional/folk knowledge on medicinal plants has been heavily relied on since ancient times in search of new pharmaceutical molecules, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutics, as well as antitubercular agents [

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Folk medicine has been applied to treat a wide range of diseases and infections, and reports are suggesting that plant-derived compounds exhibit fewer side effects, are less toxic, have low propensity to develop resistance, and are associated with improved efficacy [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Herbal medicine is additionally prevalent in under-developed and developing countries where infectious diseases are common, compounded by poverty, poor hygiene and sanitation, and inaccessibility or high cost of good healthcare [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, it is estimated that 80% of the under-developed and developing world population rely on plant-derived remedies for alleviating various ailments [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This fact is reinforced by the findings that plants are a rich source of bioactive molecules as efficacious as synthetic pharmaceutics or that can either be chemically modified to enhance their potency or act as templates for new pharmacophores [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, plant extracts have multitargeting capacity since they contain multiple small biomolecules in low concentration, but showing synergistic and additive effects. In theory, plant extracts function in a 'polypharmacology' paradigm, entailing the use of a single product against multiple targets. This paradigm is touted as a game-changer against drug-resistant microbial strains, besides being associated with low toxicity and low side effects [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the integration of traditional medicine into modern medicine is under serious consideration so as to ease drug resistance challenges and provide an alternative source for affordable, safe, and effective drugs [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, implementation of such herbal derived medicines requires in-depth scrutiny of their efficacy and identification of specific bioactive constituents [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This would provide rational scientific validation and justification for utilization and possible integration into conventional medicine, a measure that could strongly contribute to affordable, improved public health [
