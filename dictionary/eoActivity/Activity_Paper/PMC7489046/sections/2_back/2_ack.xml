 <p>I am grateful to Charlie Brian (Kodjok), traditional owner of Buluhkaduru Outstation, for his continuing support of my work on his lands. I thank Associate Professor Robert Mailhammer for inviting me to be a Visiting Fellow at the MARCS Institute of Western Sydney University. Fieldwork for this project was carried out while I was based at WSU. I also acknowledge the help provided by Maningrida College, in allowing me to use their facilities during fieldwork.</p>
