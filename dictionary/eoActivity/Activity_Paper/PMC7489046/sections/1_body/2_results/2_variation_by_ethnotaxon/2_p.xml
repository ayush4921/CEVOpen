<p id="Par17">The plants that were known to only one respondent (invariably the 80-year-old) were more varied in nature, and included species, from large genera, that are similar in appearance (e.g. 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> spp.) or plants not regarded nowadays as having any particular use (e.g. 
 <italic>Alphitonia excelsa</italic>, 
 <italic>Hakea arborescens</italic>). Most of the younger respondents did not distinguish between the various species of 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> or 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>, whereas they were given distinct names by the 80-year-old respondent (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Younger speakers tended to label all 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> spp. using the general terms 
 <italic>kun</italic>-
 <italic>kod</italic> and 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>djoh</italic> respectively. For the oldest respondent, the name 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>djoh</italic> only applies to the species 
 <italic>Acacia difficilis</italic>. The word 
 <italic>kun</italic>-
 <italic>kod</italic>, used as a general term by younger speakers for the various 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> species, also refers to the papery bark of the trees. A similar, but weaker pattern was seen for 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp. While the 80-year-old respondent was able to produce 8 different labels for various species of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, the younger peopleâ€™s responses ranged from 1 to 6 labels.
