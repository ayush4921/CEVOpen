<p id="Par15">As mentioned above, age did not have a statistically significant effect on the respondents’ ability to name birds. In spite of the significant correlation in the plant naming task, only part of the variation here can be explained by age. This is made apparent by the fact that removing the last data point in the series (that of the 80-year-old speaker; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) renders the correlation for the plant data non-significant (Spearman’s Rho = 0.49, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.10). This implies that factors other than respondent age among the younger (19–56 years) respondents must be affecting their ability to name birds and plants from the picture stimuli. Gender is likely to play a role here—it can be hypothesized that men tend to be more knowledgeable about birds than women, and a tendency in this direction can be seen in the current data. However, the low sample size precludes a systematic investigation of gender as a variable.
