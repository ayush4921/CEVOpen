<p id="Par14">There was much variation in the total number of plants and birds that could be named by individual participants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The following analysis takes into account the total number of unique plant and bird names offered by each participant on being presented with the stimulus sets. It does not take into account the accuracy of respondents’ plant or bird identifications. In the case of plant identification, age was significantly, and positively, correlated with the number of unique names recorded from individual respondents (Spearman’s Rho = 0.60, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Accordingly, the youngest respondents, aged 19–25 years old, were able to provide unique names for roughly 20–30% of the plants shown to them, whereas the oldest respondent, aged 80, was able to identify close to 80% with unique names. In the case of the bird stimuli, there was no statistically significant correlation between age and the number of names recorded (Spearman’s Rho = 0.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.24). Here too, however, it was the oldest respondent who was able to name the most birds (around 75%). Consistent with the lack of a significant correlation between age and performance is the finding that some older adults were outperformed by their younger relatives. This is evidenced by the jagged line linking the data points in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. A further key finding is that the bird and plant scores correlated very well across respondents (Spearman’s Rho = 0.86, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00012), indicating that individual respondents were able to name plants and birds to a similar degree.
