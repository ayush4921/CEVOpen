<p id="Par7">Since the language spoken by a community is inextricably linked with its culture, and since language forms a unique repository of a community’s traditional knowledge [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it is not surprising that calls for safeguarding the continued transmission of small, endangered languages have gained momentum in recent decades, with the aim of halting the decline in biocultural diversity worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The importance of language in maintaining TEK is recognised by linguists and ethnobiologists alike, and there is a general consensus that both need to be kept at healthy levels for biocultural diversity to flourish. However, the precise nature of the links between these phenomena are often not clearly articulated, but only indirectly implied. This is probably due to a lack of sufficient empirical data from local-scale studies from around the world, an urgent need that has been recognised for some time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For instance, Pretty et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], list ‘language erosion and loss’ as a threat to both biological and cultural diversity (p. 105), but also state elsewhere in the same paper that ‘diverse languages and knowledge bases are threatened today by the dual erosion of biological and cultural diversity’ (p. 104). Both statements are by themselves unproblematic, but taken together, imply conflicting attitudes towards causality. This strongly suggests that the exact linkages and causal mechanisms (if any) between the endangerment of language, knowledge and biocultural diversity are still unclear, and need to be elucidated by further research. Indeed, real-world empirical studies indicate that these phenomena can interact in complex ways, and that it is as yet difficult to make robust cross-cultural and cross-regional generalisations about correlations among the phenomena. Following are some illustrative examples. Cristancho and Vining [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] investigated perceptions of TEK loss in younger generations in two villages in Colombia and Guatemala, and found a high level of attrition in both, partly attributed to language shift (but they note that there were similar levels of environmental richness at both sites, and differing levels of language shift). McCarter and Gavin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] also reported a perceived loss of TEK in three villages in Vanuatu, but neither language shift nor ecological change were blamed by the respondents. In contrast, environmental degradation brought about by deforestation and mining, and exacerbated by an influx of weeds and feral animals, was held partly responsible for TEK and cultural erosion in several language communities of Cape York in northern Australia [
