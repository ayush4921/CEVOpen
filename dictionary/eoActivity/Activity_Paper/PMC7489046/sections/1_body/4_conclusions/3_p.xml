<p id="Par39">A further outcome of this study is the identification of those ethnotaxa that are more vulnerable to the effects of TEK and language loss. The responses shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> illustrate the unequal nature of TEK awareness for different ethnospecies. In particular, over half of the plants and birds in the stimulus sets were known to 5 or fewer respondents (out of a total of 13). The Kune speakers who took part in this study expressed their concerns regarding TEK loss, and appeared eager to take steps to remedy the situation. One young man thanked the author for ‘showing him how much he had forgotten’, and even asked if he could keep the bird stimulus pictures for further study. On the author’s last day at Buluhkaduru, an impromptu TEK learning session took place: some children were going through the album of bird pictures, and they were soon joined by a couple of adults, including the 80-year-old, who proceeded to teach the children the names of the birds. Future efforts to safeguard and/or revitalise language and TEK among Kune speakers could focus preferentially on the vulnerable ethnotaxa identified in this study, by making them feature more prominently in educational resources or in ‘learning on country’ sessions during school hours. Indigenous elders could also be made aware of such imbalances in the transmission of TEK, to enable them to focus on teaching the names and associated TEK of those ethnotaxa that are not being acquired, or forgotten, by younger people.
