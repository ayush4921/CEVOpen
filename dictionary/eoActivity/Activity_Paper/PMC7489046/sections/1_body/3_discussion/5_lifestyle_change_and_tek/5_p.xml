<p id="Par27">There are significant exceptions to the trend of disuse of a plant leading to the loss of the relevant name from the active lexicon of individual speakers. One such example is the cycad ‘palm’ 
 <italic>Cycas angulata</italic> (and possibly also 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>armstrongii</italic>), which was accurately named by 11 of 13 respondents, even though it is rarely eaten nowadays. The toxic seeds need to be prepared appropriately over several days to render them edible, and the end product, again a kind of damper, has an unpleasant smell. However, the name remains in current use, probably because of the importance of the damper in ceremonial exchanges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], where large numbers of people need to be fed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The observation by earlier researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that the consumption of cycad seeds was never really widespread in western Arnhem Land (where Buluhkaduru is situated) makes it all the more remarkable that the name of this plant is still widely known among younger people. One well-known plant that is not even found on Kune traditional lands is the cabbage palm 
 <italic>Corypha utan</italic>, which was identified and named by 10 participants (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This tree only grows in eastern Arnhem Land [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], within the territory of the unrelated Yolngu languages, but is known to Kune speakers because of its totemic significance.
