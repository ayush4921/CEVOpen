<p id="Par26">Another example of the use of an ethnotaxon label being extended to include a distinct ethnospecies is that of 
 <italic>Pandanus spiralis</italic>, the seed kernels of which can be eaten raw or roasted. The tough outer covering of the fruit has to be removed first, and the seeds seem to be eaten only infrequently nowadays. A related species is 
 <italic>Pandanus aquaticus</italic>, the seeds of which are not consumed. Two of the oldest males who took part in the current study provided different names for 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>spiralis</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aquaticus</italic>â€”these were 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>dayarr</italic>/
 <italic>kun</italic>-
 <italic>dayarr</italic> and 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>djimdjim</italic> respectively. All other respondents, however, named both species with the name label 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>dayarr</italic>/
 <italic>kun</italic>-
 <italic>dayarr</italic>, although they knew that only the seeds of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>spiralis</italic> were edible. Here too, it seems that a traditional distinction between two ethnotaxa is slowly being lost due to lack of use.
