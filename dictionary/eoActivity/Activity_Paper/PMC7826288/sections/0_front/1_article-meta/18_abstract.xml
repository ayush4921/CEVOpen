 <p>Chromosome stability is primarily determined by telomere length. TRF1 is the core subunit of shelterin that plays a critical role in telomere organization and replication. However, the dynamics of TRF1 in scenarios of telomere-processing activities remain elusive. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers, we here investigated the dynamics of TRF1 upon organizing a human telomere and the protein-DNA interactions at a moving telomeric fork. We first developed a method to obtain telomeres from human cells for directly measuring the telomere length by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Next, we examined the compaction and decompaction of a telomere by TRF1 dimers. TRF1 dissociates from a compacted telomere with heterogenous loops in ∼20 s. We also found a negative correlation between the number of telomeric loops and loop sizes. We further characterized the dynamics of TRF1 at a telomeric DNA fork. With binding energies of 11

Our results shed light on the mechanisms of how TRF1 organizes human telomeres and facilitates the efficient replication of telomeric DNA.
