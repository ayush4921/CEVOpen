  <p>Analysis of dwell time, sub-step size and site-specific binding probability using a step-fitting algorithm. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A single trace of strand-separation assays modeled by a step-fitting algorithm. The red line is the result of the step-fitting algorithm (bottom left). The dotted frame is zoomed in to show the sub-step sizes (s1 ∼ s6) and dwell time (dt1–dt6) (Bottom right). The cartoon illustrates the sub-steps in a strand-separation assay (top). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Dwell time distribution of sub-steps at [TRF1] = 25 nM (top) and 40 nM (bottom). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Distribution of step sizes. The three-Gaussian curve (black) show a periodicity of ∼10 bp revealed by centers at 10 ± 3 bp (red), 19 ± 2 bp (blue) and 31 ± 6 bp (cyan) (estimate ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 784 from 10 molecules). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Distribution of site-specific binding probability. The distribution shows three major domains as divided by two dashed lines (
   <italic>N</italic> = 784 from 10 molecules). The dashed lines match to the positions of non-telomeric sequences in the hairpin stem (cartoon).
