  <p>TRF1 modulation of a telomeric DNA fork. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Dwell time measurements on a hopping trace. A two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Black) reveals the dwell time of t
   <sub>forward</sub> and t
   <sub>backward</sub>. Buffer and temperature conditions are the same as those in Figure

   <bold>B</bold>) HMM analysis of hopping traces at various

   <sub>test</sub>. The concentration of TRF1 is 0 nM for the left panels and 10 nM for the right panels, respectively. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The open probability of a telomeric fork as a function of forces. Curves represent fittings to a Boltzmann relation model. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The dwell time on forward and backward states as a function of forces. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Scheme illustrating the TRF1 effect on the dynamics of a telomeric DNA fork.
