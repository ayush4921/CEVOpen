<p>Using single-molecule mechanical techniques of magnetic tweezers, we here investigated the dynamics of TRF1 organizing a single human telomere and the TRF1–DNA interactions at a telomeric fork upon strand separation. After preparing single human telomeres from K562 cells for single-molecule mechanical assays, we established a precise method for directly measuring the length of a single human telomere. By sampling from a total population of human telomeres, the single-molecule method can reveal the length distribution of telomeres, especially the short ones at defined length ranges. Examining the compaction and decompaction of a single human telomere by TRF1, we found that a TRF1 dimer can compact a single human telomere by interacting with two targeting sites separated far apart. TRF1 dissociates from a compacted telomere with heterogenous loops in ∼20 s. We also found a negative correlation between the number of telomeric loops and loop sizes. We further characterized the dynamics of TRF1 at a telomeric DNA fork using single-molecule strand-separation assays. With binding energies of 11

Our bottom-up methods of single telomere compaction assay and the telomeric fork assay allow us to investigate how shelterin proteins protect chromosomes from a perspective of mechanics and kinetics. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of how TRF1 itself facilitates the efficient replication of a telomere. Our methods and findings will help future research on telomere biology, epidemiology, cancer therapy, as well as shelterin-targeted drug discovery.
