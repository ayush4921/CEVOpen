<p>Other than chromosome protection, TRF1 also plays a critical role in sister telomere cohesion (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), DNA damage responses (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), telomere transcription, and replication (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25â€“29</xref>). Replication machinery encounters significant challenges at telomeres due to the TTAGGG repeats, which resemble fragile sites (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). TRF1 is essential for efficient replication by recruiting helicase and shelterin repressor to solve TTAGGG repeat-associated replication issues (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, TRF1 dynamics in telomere compaction and telomeric fork movement remains elusive.
