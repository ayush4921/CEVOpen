<p>Using single-molecule techniques, we have investigated the dynamics of TRF1 in organizing a single human telomere. We first established a method for mechanically manipulating a single human telomere. From K562 cells, we prepared single human telomeres that carried digoxigenin and biotin modifications at both ends for single-molecule force–extension assays. Our single-molecule method provides the direct measurements of telomere length (TL), which can be analytically evaluated by a WLC model (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57–59</xref>). The TL measurements by our single-molecule method are highly precise at the bp resolution. Our TL method based on single-molecule force spectroscopy measures one telomere at a time without signal amplification and gives a continuous distribution, which is in contrast to the rough estimation by TRF, PCR or fluorescence (
