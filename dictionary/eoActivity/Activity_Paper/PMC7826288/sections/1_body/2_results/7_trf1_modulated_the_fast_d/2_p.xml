<p>We ran hidden Markov modeling (HMM) to characterize the fork dynamics at constant forces (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). At a constant force of 14.8 pN, which can locally move the DNA fork by partially separate two strands, we observed that the telomeric DNA hops between forward and backward states at the absence of TRF1 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Fitted to an HMM model of two states, we revealed the forward and backward states in the telomeric DNA fork dynamics. We further fine-tuned the force from 14.4Â to 15 pN by a step size of 0.1 pN in strand-separation assays. Fork dynamics of the telomeric DNA can reach equilibrium at each force (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, left). However, time distributions at the forward and backward states evolve in opposite directions when forces increase. We next performed the strand-separation assays at [TRF1] = 10 nM under the same experimental conditions as above. After HMM analysis, we collected the durations for each interconversion between the forward and backward states (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, right).
