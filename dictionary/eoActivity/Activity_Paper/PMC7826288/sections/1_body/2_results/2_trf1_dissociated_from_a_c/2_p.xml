<p>Force–extension measurements of single human telomeres at the presence of TRF1 proteins reveal DNA compaction events. With TRF1 of 10 nM in a buffer containing 20 mM of HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM of EDTA, 100 mM of NaCl and 0.0063% Tween-20, we set out to run force–ramp assays at a force span of 0–17 pN using single-molecule magnetic tweezers (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, inset). Extension of a single telomere shows multiple leaps upon stretching (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Comparing to the smooth response of telomere extension to forces at the absence of TRF1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), multiple leaps of DNA extension in force–ramp assays provide direct evidence of telomere compaction by TRF1. The rupture of a compacted telomere by 10 nM of TRF1 usually completes at a stretching force &lt;8 pN.
