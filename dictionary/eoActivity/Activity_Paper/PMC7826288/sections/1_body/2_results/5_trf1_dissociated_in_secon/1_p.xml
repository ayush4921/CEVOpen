<p>We analyzed the dynamics of DNA–protein interactions to reveal that one sub-step indicates one dissociation event of a TRF1 dimer from the telomeric DNA in a strand-separation assay. We fitted every single trace of strand separation at 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> and [TRF1] = 25 nM using a step-fitting algorithm (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). We then collected the fitting results of the site, size, and duration for each sub-step (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, bottom right). A single-exponential decay function is enough to describe the distribution of dwell time (0.946 for the 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared value) and reveals that τ = 0.36 ± 0.02 s at [TRF1] = 25 nM (estimate ± SE, and 
 <italic>N</italic> = 1290) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, top). We also did strand-separation assays at a high concentration of [TRF1] = 40 nM and found a single-exponential coefficient of τ = 1.71 ± 0.09 s (estimate ± SE, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 588, and 0.903 for the 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared value) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, bottom). The longer time coefficient at [TRF1] = 40 nM than that at 25 nM can be explained by the overall higher binding energies from more binding TRF1 proteins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Since the hairpin stem used here is close to the persistence length of dsDNA and shorter than the TRF1-compacted loops of ∼250 bp as discovered above, the telomeric dsDNA most likely remains a linear conformation without compaction.
