<p>Analysis of the step size distribution reveals a periodicity of TRF1 binding telomeric dsDNA. We found that a three-Gaussian function describes the distribution the best with the peaks at 10 ± 3, 19 ± 2 and 31 ± 6 bp (estimate ± SD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 784), resulting in a periodic unit of ∼10 bp (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Because a TRF1 dimer binds two neighboring motifs of TTAGGGTTAGGG, 12 bp (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), the agreement within one standard deviation between our measurements and the structure-based prediction suggests that TRF1 binds as a dimer configuration on a telomere. Strand separation thus drives TRF1 away one dimer at a time and releases a unit length of ∼10 bp.
