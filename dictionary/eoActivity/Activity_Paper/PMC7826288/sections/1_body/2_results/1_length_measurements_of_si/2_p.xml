<p>We also performed a dot-blot analysis to check the background of non-telomeric DNA after enrichment using the telomere-specific probe of biotin-(5′-TAACCC-3′)
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, Materials and methods). The recovery of telomeric DNA is 96% ± 5% (mean ± SD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). In addition, the telomeric DNA is 3298 ± 2269 times more than the non-telomeric Alu-repeat DNA after enrichment (mean ± SD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). Thus, the background of non-telomeric DNA in our TL measurements is negligible.
