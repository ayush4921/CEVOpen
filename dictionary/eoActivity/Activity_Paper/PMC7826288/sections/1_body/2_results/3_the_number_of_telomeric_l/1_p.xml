<p>Because TL varies from one molecule to another in our experiments, we next checked whether Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions depend on the length of telomeres. We examined the Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions as a function of TL at [TRF1] = 20 and 40 nM (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). We grouped the telomeres into three categories of TL, i.e. TL = 1.5–2.5 kb, TL = 2.5–3.5 kb, and TL = 3.5–4.5 kb. Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions generally show two or three major peaks except that for TL = 1.5–2.5 kb at [TRF1] = 40 nM, suggesting that heterogenous loops in a telomere are a common feature as that for TL = 2.5–3.5 kb at [TRF1] = 10 nM (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> versus Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). At [TRF1] = 20 nM, Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions show that the peak centers shift to the longer range with the increment of TL (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, the Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distribution shows one more peak for TL = 3.5–4.5 kb than that for shorter TLs, indicating that TL plays a role in the heterogeneity of the TRF1-compacted telomeric loops. Such phenomena were also observed at [TRF1] = 40 nM (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). TRF1 at a high concentration of 40 nM tightly compacts a short telomere with a single peak of Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distribution for TL = 1.5–2.5 kb. When TL becomes longer, Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions show one more peak of longer extensions at [TRF1] = 40 nM. These data suggest that telomeric loop sizes depend on both TRF1 concentration and TL.
