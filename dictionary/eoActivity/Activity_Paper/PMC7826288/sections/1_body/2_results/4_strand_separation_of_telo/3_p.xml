 <sub>test</sub>, we can build a site-specific time histogram along with the ssDNA extension for each trace (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). We obtained the overall time at each base after dividing the heights of histograms by the sampling rate of 100 Hz. Peak positions and heights reveal where TRF1 binds to its targeting motifs and how long it takes TRF1 to dissociate upon strand separation, respectively. From the averaged histogram of 173 traces (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), we observed a complex landscape of TRF1 dissociation from a telomeric DNA. Along the telomeric sequence, two significant valleys are evident with bottoms at the two non-telomeric sites (TGG at the 79th bp and CGTC at the 142nd bp, respectively), showing that non-telomeric sequences can dramatically affect the interactions between TRF1 and a telomere.
