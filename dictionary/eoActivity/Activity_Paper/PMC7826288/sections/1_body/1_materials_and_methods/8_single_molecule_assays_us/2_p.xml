<p>In force–jump assays, we developed a force–manipulating protocol to examine how TRF1 compacted a single human telomere of dsDNA. We first allowed interactions between TRF1 and a single human telomere at a resting force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>rest</sub>). We next increased forces from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>rest</sub> to a testing force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>), which should be strong enough to break the interactions between proteins and DNA and generate a series of distinct steps. To assure the complete rupture of the protein–DNA complex, we then strengthened 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> to strong forces (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub> and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>). We finally reversed the mechanical manipulations by sequentially decreasing the forces from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> to 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub>, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>rest</sub>. By adjusting the durations of forces, we can investigate the kinetics of molecular interactions.
