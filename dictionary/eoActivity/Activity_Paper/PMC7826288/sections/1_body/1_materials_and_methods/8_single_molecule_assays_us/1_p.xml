<p>We used homemade single-molecule magnetic tweezers (smMT), like previously described devices (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40–42</xref>). Taking advantage of a setup of microsphere-DNA-coverslip, we ran assays on the smMT in a reaction chamber. We routinely mixed 20 μl of streptavidin-coated beads (Cat#: 65305, M270, Invitrogen, USA) with constructs of DNA hairpins or human telomeres in a volume of 40 μl containing 20 mM of HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM of EDTA, 100 mM of NaCl and 0.0063% Tween-20. The coverslip surface to support single-molecule assays has a matrix of nitrocellulose (0.1%, m/v). On the nitrocellulose matrix we next incubated anti-digoxigenin antibody (0.1 mg/ml, Cat#: 11093274910, Roche) for 0.5–2 h and passivated with BSA (5 mg/ml) overnight. The surface with antibodies can immobilize DNA, which was already bound to beads. At a sampling rate of &gt;100 Hz, we ran constant-force, force–ramp and force–jump assays in a buffer containing 20 mM of HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM of EDTA, 100 mM of NaCl and 0.0063% Tween-20.
