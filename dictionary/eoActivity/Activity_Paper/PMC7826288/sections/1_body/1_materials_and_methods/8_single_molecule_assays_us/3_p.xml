<p>We used a similar protocol of force jumps as above to manipulate constructs of hairpin DNA. DNA extensions are short at a low force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub>), which is less than the critical forces of unfolding a hairpin. In 390 ± 30 ms (mean ± SD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), we increased the force from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub> to a testing force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>) where DNA extensions become long, i.e. the hairpin is fully open. TRF1-binding events interrupt the unfolding of a hairpin, resulting in pauses at intermediate extensions. We next increased 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> to a higher force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub>) where the DNA further extends. We then decreased the force from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub> to 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>, which serves for reference purposes. We finally lowered down the force to 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub>, completing a circle of our force protocol. By optimizing the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub>, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub>, as well as their durations, we can tune a force protocol according to the tested proteins and hairpin constructs (
