<p>To prepare the long hairpin stem with 23 telomeric repeats, we first annealed ssDNA oligos (Stem oligos in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) using the temperature program the same as above. We also prepared the hairpin loop (Loop 1 oligo in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) using the same method. With cohesive end termini, we ligated the telomeric stem and the loop with a molar ratio of 1:5:10 (Stem 1/1c: stem 2/2c: loop 1) at 16°C for 12 h. Finally, the intermediate products were ligated to obtain the hairpin construct with 23 telomeric repeats at 16°C for 10 h, followed by 25°C for 2 h.
