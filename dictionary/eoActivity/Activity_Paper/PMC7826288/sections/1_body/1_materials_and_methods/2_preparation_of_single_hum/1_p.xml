<p>We cultured K562 cells (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup>CCl-243™, ATCC, USA) in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 Medium (Cat#: SH30023.01, Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cat#: 10099-141, Gibco, USA) at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air atmosphere. At 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml, we collected K562 cells and extracted genome DNA using a commercial kit (DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit, Cat#: 69506, Qiagen, Germany). Genomic DNA integrity was evaluated by running a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis at 150 V for 30 min with 400 ng of DNA samples, as suggested in the literature (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). DNA samples without a smear in the agarose gel went for restriction enzyme digestion. We first digested 20 μg of K562 DNA with 10 U of CviAII in 50 μl of 1× CutSmart
 <sup>®</sup> buffer (NEB, USA) at 25°C for 12 h. We next supplemented the reaction with three more enzymes (BfaI/MseI/NdeI, 10 U of each) and continued the digestion at 37°C for another 12 h. Enzymes were heat-inactivated at 80°C for 20 min. We then filled the 5′ overhangs (TA or AT) of K562 DNA fragments using 5 U of Klenow fragment (3′-5′ exo-) with 1:1 ratio mixture of dATP and digoxigenin-dUTP (Cat#: 11093088910, Roche, Switzerland) at 37°C for 12 h. Klenow reaction thus modified the proximal ends of K562 telomeres with digoxigenin-dUTP for later affinity interactions.
