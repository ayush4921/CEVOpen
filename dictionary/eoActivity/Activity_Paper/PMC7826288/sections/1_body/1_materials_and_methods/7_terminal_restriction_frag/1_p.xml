<p>We performed terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis using components from the kit of 
 <italic>T</italic>elo
 <italic>TAGGG</italic>™ Telomere Length Assay (Cat#: 12209136001, Roche, Switzerland). The combination of restriction enzymes used here is CviAII/NdeI/MseI/BfaI instead of HinfI/RsaI in the kit. Telomere length (TL) assay has been done at room temperature other than specifically noted. The genomic DNA of K562 cells digested by CviAII/NdeI/MseI/BfaI enzymes underwent electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel at 5 V/cm for 4 h. Next, DNA was transferred from the gel to a positive-charged nylon membrane by Southern blotting. The transferred DNA was then fixed by baking the membrane at 120°C for 25 min. We hybridized the membrane with a digoxigenin-labeled telomere probe at 42°C for 10 h. After hybridization, the membrane underwent washing twice with buffer I (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 5 min and twice with prewarmed buffer II (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50°C for 30 min. With one more washing step in 1× washing buffer for 5 min, we put the membrane in 1× blocking solution for 1 h. After an incubation step with an anti-digoxigenin antibody in 1× blocking solution for 4 h, we washed the membrane twice with 1× washing buffer for 20 min. We then incubated the membrane in a 1× detection buffer for 5 min. After discarding the detection buffer, the membrane underwent incubation with CDP-star for 10 min. We finally visualized the telomere probe using Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Tanon Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). TL quantification was done using the software of TeloTool (
