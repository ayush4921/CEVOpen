<p>We molecularly cloned human TRF1. We first obtained TRF1 coding sequences from a plasmid (Cat#: 53209, Addgene, USA) by PCR (see primers in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). With restriction enzymes of BamHI and XhoI, we prepared TRF1(3â€“439) DNA (see protein sequences in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), which were purified using 1% agarose gel and a gel extraction kit (Cat#: D2500-02, Omega Bio-tek, Inc., USA). We next cloned the TRF1 sequence into a vector of modified pET32a.
