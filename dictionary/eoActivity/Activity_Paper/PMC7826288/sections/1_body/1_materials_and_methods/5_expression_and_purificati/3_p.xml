<p>We used ion-exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography to improve the purity of proteins further. Protein solution first went through HiTrap Heparin HP (Cat#: 17–0407-01, GE, USA). Next, we performed the gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cat#: 28-9909-44, GE, USA), which was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. The purified proteins were concentrated to 2 mg/ml and stored at −80°C.</p>
