<p>We checked the biotin-(5′-TAACCC-3′)
 <sub>3</sub>-enriched telomeric DNA using dot-blot analysis. We mixed the commercially synthesized probe of biotin-(5′-TAACCC-3′)
 <sub>3</sub> with the K562 genomic DNA fragments after restriction enzyme digestion. The mixture underwent incubation at 75°C for 3 min, then gradually cooled down to 25°C, facilitating the probe to bind telomeres specifically. We next added streptavidin-coated beads (Cat#: 65305, M270, Invitrogen, USA) with DNA and left at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were then collected using a magnet and washed three times using a buffer of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 0.0063% Tween-20 to remove non-telomeric DNA. We then heated beads at 95°C for 25 min to detach the telomeric DNA from the probe. Using magnets to hold the M270 beads, we recovered the DNA in solution twice. The eluted DNA was further incubated at 95°C for 10 min, and then loaded onto Hybond membranes (Cat#: RPN303B, GE, USA) in 2× SSC buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 0.03 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0). We immersed the membranes in a denaturation buffer containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl for 10 min. The membranes were then transferred to a neutralization buffer containing 3 M NaCl and 0.5 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) for 10 min. DNA was fixed on the membranes by baking at 120°C for 25 min. After submerging the membranes in 2× SSC buffer for 10 min, hybridization was performed either with a digoxigenin-labeled telomeric probe of dig-(5′-CCCTAA-3′)
 <sub>3</sub> at 42°C for the detection of telomeric DNA or a digoxigenin-labeled Alu probe of dig-(5′-GTGATCCGCCCGCCTCGGCCTCCCAAAGTG-3′) at 55°C for the detection of non-telomeric sequences. After the washing and blocking steps, probes were detected using an anti–DIG-AP antibody (Cat#: 11093274910, Roche, Switzerland) on a chemiluminescent imaging system (Tanon-5200, Tanon Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Image analysis was done in ImageJ (NIH Image, USA).
