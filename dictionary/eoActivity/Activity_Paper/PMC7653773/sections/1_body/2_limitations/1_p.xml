<p id="Par26">This research note serves to highlight the potential existence of pCBs or pCB-like compounds within the whole flower extract of 
 <italic>L. leonurus</italic> var. 
 <italic>albiflora</italic> Benth. HPTLC screening indicated the potential existence of several pCBs, based on the reported selectivity and color index when developed with the fast blue B reagent. From these, we selected one (isolated by scraping the selected area from the HPTLC plate) for downstream LC–MS/MS analyses. The isolated compound was tentatively identified as pCB-like, with adrenoyl-EA predicted as the main candidate on several databases. A major limitation for this study is the absence of an authentic LC–MS/MS reference compound for adrenoyl-EA to (i) calibrate the instrument and accommodate for potential mass shifts/corrections and (ii) compare fragmentation and isotope patterning on our instrument. Results discussed here are tentative based on experimental mass and database searches and, further investigations will be required to unequivocally provide evidence for the exact identity of compounds. These include (i) quantification and confirmation of compound/s with LC–MS/MS using authentic standard compounds and, (ii) determining structural similarities and differences when compared to other plant-, animal- or human-derived adrenoyl-EA, with NMR. However, to support the idea of an alternative and sustainable crop to produce pCB products, it would be beneficial to isolate and identify the other compounds from the HPTLC to uncover the existence of a metabolite pathway capable of producing several different pCB or pCB-like compounds.
