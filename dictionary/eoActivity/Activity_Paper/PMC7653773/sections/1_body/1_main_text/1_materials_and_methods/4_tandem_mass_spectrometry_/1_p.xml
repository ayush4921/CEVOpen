<p id="Par18">LC–MS/MS analyses were performed, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with a Waters Synapt G2 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a Waters Acquity UPLC. Samples were separated on a Waters UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm; 1.7 μm) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 55 °C. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile. The mobile phase gradient was initiated at 100% solvent A for 1 min and linearly reduced to 28% solvent A over 22 min. Subsequently, the mobile phase was changed to 40% solvent B over 8 min followed by a 1 min wash step in 100% solvent B before the column was re-equilibrated to the initial conditions for 4 min. Electrospray ionization was applied, and samples were analysed in a negative mode run and a positive mode run. Data was acquired in MS
 <sup>E</sup> mode, which consists of a high collision energy scan range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 125–1500 and a low collision energy scan from 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 40–1500. The photo diode array detector was set to scan from 220–600 nm. The capillary voltage was set at 3.5 kV and the collision energy either 6 V (low collision energy scan from) or 30–60 V (high collision energy scan), the cone voltage was 15 V, the source temperature 120 °C and the desolvation temperature was 275 °C. The desolvation and cone gas (nitrogen) flows were 650 and 50 L/h, respectively. Sodium formate was used for calibration and leucine encephalin was infused in the background as lock mass for accurate mass determinations, where authentic reference compounds were available. Metabolites were monitored using their deprotonated quasi-molecular ions.
