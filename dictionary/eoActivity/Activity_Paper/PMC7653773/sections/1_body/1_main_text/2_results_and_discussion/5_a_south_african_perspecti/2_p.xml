<p id="Par25">As part of a pCB-driven strategy for the development of high value TMs, we suggest that the discovery of pCBs in endemic South African plants could be highly complementary to the Cannabis industry, given that these plants are adapted to the climatic and water-scarce conditions. To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence on the presence of the pCB-like compound, adrenoyl-EA, in the flowers of 
 <italic>L. leonurus</italic> var. 
 <italic>albiflora</italic> Benth. Globally, the production of pCBs from these alternative resources could benefit the future TM market, particularly in countries where agriculture is typified by water scarcity.
