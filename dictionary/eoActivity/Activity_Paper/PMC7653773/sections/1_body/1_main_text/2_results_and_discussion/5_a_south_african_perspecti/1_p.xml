<p id="Par24">It is estimated that the domestic South Africa Cannabis market will reach USD $1.8 billion by 2023 however, this projection is based on export value only, excluding Cannabis-derived pCB products. The value proposition lies within the latter, given the therapeutic potential of pCBs in chronic disease treatment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. South African agriculture is typified by both large scale mechanized, and smallholder practices and Cannabis cultivation is considered viable. Although the agricultural experience and arable land in South Africa is adequate for the growth and export of Cannabis, the irrigation infrastructure and required daylight might not be sufficient to sustain the production of high quality Cannabis-derived products. One of the major predicted hurdles in establishing a sustainable Cannabis industry is the water-intensive measures required for an efficient pCB yield from Cannabis. If one could exploit a water-efficient medicinal crop capable of producing pCB-like compounds, this would serve as an ideal industry alternative into a realm of “smart-pharming” practices.
