<p>Plant-derived monoterpenoids are widely used in daily life, and the demand is increasing. Microbial biosynthesis of monoterpenoid provides a new feasible strategy for the monoterpenoid production. 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> might be an ideal microbial cell factory for monoterpenoid biosynthesis. With the help of omics technologies, systems biology, structural biology and protein engineering, it will further lead to the identification of highly efficient monoterpenoid biosynthetic enzymes, which can help to enable high yield of monoterpenoid in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.
