<p>In order to realize the heterologous expression of target monoterpenoids in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, exogenous plant monoterpene synthetases need to be introduced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dudareva et al. (1996)</xref> identified one plant monoterpene synthetase gene responsible for the synthesis of terpene alcohol synthase. 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2010)</xref> isolated and identified two monoterpene synthetases of AaLS1p and ApLS1p, from 
 <italic>Actinidia argute</italic> and 
 <italic>Actinidia polygama</italic>, respectively, which can synthesize (
 <italic>S</italic>)-linalool. 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al. (2007)</xref> co-expressed linalool synthase from 
 <italic>Clarkia breweri</italic> and geraniol synthetase from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and these enzymes improved the biosynthetic ability of monoterpene linalool and geraniol in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Herrero et al. (2008)</xref> successfully introduced linalool biosynthetic pathway to 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and linalool was effectively produced in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. These studies showed that 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has great potential to act as a cell factory for monoterpenoids synthesis.
