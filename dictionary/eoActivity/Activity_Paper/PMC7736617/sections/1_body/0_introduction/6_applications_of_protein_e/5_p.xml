<p>(+)-Limonene is an abundant monoterpene in the essential oils of most citrus fruit, which is commonly used as an industrial and household solvent. In particular, the citrus smell enables its use in the fragrance and flavoring industries. The (+)-LS from 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> was purified, and its crystal structure was further determined. The structural comparison of (+)-LS and (−)-LS showed that the conformation of short α1 helix played critical roles in determining (+)-LS or (−)-LS enantiomer. The structural and catalytic mechanism studies of (+)-LS and (−)-LS provided theoretical basis and new options for designing and achieving (+) or (−)-limonene rationally (

 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> (−)-LS was successfully generated, which showed a new catalytic activity of producing more complex bicyclic monoterpenes (
