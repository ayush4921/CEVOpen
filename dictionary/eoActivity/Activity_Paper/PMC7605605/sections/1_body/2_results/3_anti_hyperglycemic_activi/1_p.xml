<p>The antidiabetic effect of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> on fasting blood glucose levels of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice was measured weekly. Succeeding the induction of DM by STZ, all groups of diabetic mice showed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) difference in blood glucose level as compared to normal mice across all time intervals. Though, all groups of diabetic mice didn`t exhibit a significant difference in baseline fasting blood glucose levels as compared to the negative control group. Administration of the three doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg) of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) reduction in blood glucose level as compared to the diabetic control group on the 7th day of treatment. Likewise, the three doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg) of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> showed a significant (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) reduction in blood glucose level as compared to the diabetic control group on the 14th day of treatment. Similarly, GLC 5 mg/kg treated group showed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction in blood glucose level as compared to the diabetic control group on the 7th and 14th days of treatment.
