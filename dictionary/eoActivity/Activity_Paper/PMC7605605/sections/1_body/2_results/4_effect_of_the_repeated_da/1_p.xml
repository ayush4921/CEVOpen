<p>The effect of the repeated daily doses of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> on the body weight is presented in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Earlier to the indication of DM by streptozotocin, all groups of mice didn`t show a significant difference in body weight. However, streptozotocin showed a significant reduction in the body weight of the diabetic control group on the 7th and 14th days of treatment as compared to the normal control group. Succeeding treatment of diabetic mice with the crude extract of H. 
 <italic>abyssinica</italic> for two weeks prevented weight loss in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice as compared to diabetic control. Only CE 400 mg/kg prevented weight loss significantly (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the diabetic control group after the 7th days of treatment. However, CE 100 mg/kg and CE 200 mg/kg didn`t prevent weight loss significantly following the 7th day of treatment. Similarly, the middle and the higher doses of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> (CE 200 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.01) and CE 400 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.001)) and GLC 5 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.001) improved weight loss significantly as compared to the diabetic control group following 14 days of administration. Within a group analysis revealed that the middle (200 mg/kg) and the higher (400 mg/kg) doses, the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increment on the body weight on the 14th days as compared to the baseline bodyweight. Similarly, GLC 5 mg/kg significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased the body weight on the 14th day as compared to the baseline body weight (
