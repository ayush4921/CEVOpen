<p>The flower crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Hagenia abyssinica</italic> showed significant α–amylase inhibitory activity, scavenging diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and improving serum lipid profile levels. In addition, the flower crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Hagenia abyssinica</italic> were also effective in lowering blood glucose levels in diabetic and normoglycemic mice.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Traditionally, the leaf part of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> has been used in the treatment of DM in Ethiopia. An ethnobotanical survey which was carried out in Ethiopia reported that the leaf of the plant is taken orally to treat DM.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> However, there is no previous study in the antidiabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activities of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of the repeated doses of the 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> leaf extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
