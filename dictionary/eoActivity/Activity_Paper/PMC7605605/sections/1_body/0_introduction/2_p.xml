<p>Presently, the existing pharmacotherapy for DM includes insulin and different oral antidiabetic agents for instance sulfonylureas, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, some others. These drugs have been used as monotherapy or in combination to control the elevated glycemia. However, these medications are linked to different adverse effects.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> So, the development of antidiabetic drugs from natural plant sources with minimal side effects is increased. Plants have played a major role in the introduction of new therapeutic agents. A medicinal plant, 
 <italic>Galega officinalis</italic> led to the discovery and synthesis of metformin.
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The phytoconstituents derived from medicinal plants that have anti-diabetic activity contain polysaccharides, alkaloids, peptidoglycan, guanidine, glycosides, carbohydrates, galactomannan gum, terpenoids, hypoglycans, amino acids, glycopeptides, inorganic ions, and steroids. These touch numerous metabolic cascades, which directly or indirectly affect the level of blood glucose in the human body.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Anti-hyperglycemic, anti-dyslipidemia, and anti-renal failure effects of these plants are attributed to their ability to restore the function of pancreatic tissues by causing an increase in insulin output or inhibit the intestinal absorption of glucose or to the facilitation of metabolites in insulin-dependent processes.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, herbs and phytochemicals play a major role in the discovery of new therapeutic agents and have received attention as sources of antioxidants, hypoglycemic, and antihyperlipidemic agents.
