<p>The leaf of the plant was thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove dirt and then dried under shade at room temperature (25–27°C) with optimal ventilation. The dried plant materials were ground into coarse powder by the electrical mill. Then, the coarse powdered plant materials (1.05 kg powdered leaves) were macerated separately in 80% methanol for 72 hours, and then the extracts were filtered by using Whatman filter paper No.1. The marc was re-macerated two times with fresh solvent, each for 72 hours, and the filtrates obtained from the successive maceration were concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Hamato, Japan) followed by hot air oven (Medit-Medizin Technik, Germany) set at 40°C. The semi-dried residues were frozen in the refrigerator overnight and then, dried using a lyophilizer (Labfreez, China) to completely remove the solvent residue. Then, the dried leaf extract was kept separately in a desiccator until used for the experiment.
