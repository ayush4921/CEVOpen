<p>Based on the limit test standard of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) No 425 Guideline,
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> an acute oral toxicity test was carried out for leaf crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic>. One female Swiss albino mouse fasted for 4 hours on the first day of the test then; 2 gm/kg of the extracts was given orally by oral gavage and was observed strictly for physical or behavioral changes. The animals were housed separately and observed for the manifestation of gross behavioral and physical toxicities like changes in the skin, urination, lacrimation, reduction in feeding activity, excitation, paw licking, increased respiratory rate, decreased motor activity, diarrhea, weight loss, and paralysis for one day and give special attention during the first 4 hours. Based on the results from the first mouse, the other four femalesâ€™ mice were recruited and fasted for 4 hours and then give 2 gm/kg a single dose and were observed strictly in the same manner. The observation was continued for a total of 2 weeks for any signs of toxicity.
