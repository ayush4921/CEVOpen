<p>Whether oxidative injury occurs is dependent on the outcome of the interaction between oxidants and the protective system. In the body, there is a complex defense system consisting of antioxidant enzymes that can protect against oxidative damage, such as SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase and some nonenzymatic antioxidants, including GSH, vitamins, and ubiquinone, that can also help to maintain the redox balance[
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The metabolism of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, mainly O
 <sup>2â€“</sup> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which can be scavenged by SOD and CAT, respectively[
