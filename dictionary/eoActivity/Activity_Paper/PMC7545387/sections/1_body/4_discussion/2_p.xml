<p>Many chemicals can cause liver injury, and the mechanisms of action involved in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver disease have been investigated widely[
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, biotransformed into ∙CCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and then oxygenated to ∙OOCCl
 <sub>3</sub>; both of these radicals are highly reactive and can induce the depletion of reductants, inhibit antioxidant enzymes, induce lipid peroxidation, hypomethylate proteins, and mutate nucleic acids, resulting in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis[
