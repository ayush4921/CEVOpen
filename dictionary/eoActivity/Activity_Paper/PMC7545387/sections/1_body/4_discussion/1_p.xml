<p>AST and ALT are distributed predominantly in the liver cells. When the liver is damaged, they enter the bloodstream. Clinically, elevations in serum ALT and AST can be regarded as indicators of liver diseases, although ALT is more specific than AST[

 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>. Clinically, increased ALP often indicates cholestasis caused by liver injury[

 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> flower,

 <italic>A. villosum</italic>. Serum TG is another biomarker of liver dysfunction and is found to be elevated if the liver is damaged. In this study, all herbs reduced TG significantly compared with the model group. Histopathological examinations confirmed the hepatoprotective effects of the ten tested medicinal foods and herbs by improving the degenerative morphological changes induced by CCl
