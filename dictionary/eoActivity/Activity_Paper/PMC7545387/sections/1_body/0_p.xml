 <bold>Core Tip:</bold> Many natural products confer health benefits against diverse diseases through their antioxidant activities. In this study, ten medicinal herbs were selected for an evaluation and comparison of their effects on carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>)-induced oxidative liver injury. 
 <italic>Sanguisorba officinalis</italic> (
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>) L. exhibited the strongest hepatoprotective effect, and the strongest 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activities were also found for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. Our results provided valuable information for the selection of more efficient herbs to protect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury and to support the direct application of herbs or the development of novel therapies for the management of oxidative stress-related diseases.
