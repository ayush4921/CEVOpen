<p>Through their antioxidant activities, many natural products have been shown to exert protective effects against various oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and liver diseases[

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], have been reported to protect the liver. Subsequently, scientific evidence has shown that many related products and specific bioactive components have protective effects in the liver against oxidative injuries[

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, ten medicinal foods and herbs were selected for an evaluation and comparison of their effects on CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury. In addition, the herb with the strongest hepatoprotective performance was analyzed for the detailed bioactive components by using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization source-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-ITMS/MS). The

 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury and to support the direct application of herbs or the development of novel therapies for the management of oxidative stress-related diseases.
