<p>In conclusion, the results of our study indicated that all ten medicinal foods and herbs could individually protect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> Franch., and 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> (Willd.) Ohwi root were more effective than the others. In addition, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. exhibited the strongest hepatoprotective effect, and nine components of its decoction were identified, among which gallic acid and (+)-catechin were quantified. It was also revealed that the tested materials exhibited various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities, proportionate to their phenolic content and that the highest values were found in 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. The results of this study are valuable for the selection of more effective natural products to be consumed directly or developed into nutraceuticals or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.
