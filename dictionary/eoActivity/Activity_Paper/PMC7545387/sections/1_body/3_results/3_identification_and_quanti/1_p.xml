<p>As 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> showed the strongest hepatoprotective effect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury compared with the other tested medicinal foods and herbs, its phytochemical compounds in the decoction were identified by HPLC-ESI-ITMS/MS using external standards and/or according to MS and MS/MS information found in references[
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, eight main peaks were observed on the HPLC chromatogram; these corresponded to nine main compounds in the 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> decoction (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The four major peaks (Peak 1-4) were identified as gallic acid (Peak 1), galloyl-methylglucoside, procyanidin C2 (Peak 2), (+)-catechin (Peak 3), and procyanidin B3 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate (Peak 4)[
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, the quantification of unambiguously identified compounds was performed by HPLC using corresponding standards; 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., gallic acid (Peak 1) and (+)-catechin (Peak 3) were quantified as 7.86 ± 0.45 and 8.19 ± 0.57 mg/g DW, respectively.
