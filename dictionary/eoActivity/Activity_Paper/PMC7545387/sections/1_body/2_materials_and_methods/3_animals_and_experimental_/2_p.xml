<p>SPF Kunming mice (male, weight 18–22 g) were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. With free access to water and rodent chow, the animals were kept in a controlled environment (22 °C ± 0.5 °C, 40%–60% relative humidity, and a 12 h light-dark cycle). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-Sen University (No. 2017-011). The mice were randomly assigned into 13 groups each containing eight mice: control group, model group, positive control, and ten treatment groups. Each herb extract (15 mg/mL, 10 mL/kg) was administered to the mice by gavage once per day for seven consecutive days; bifendate (150 mg/kg) was administered in the positive control group[

After 16 h, the mice were anesthetized, blood samples were taken, and the livers were harvested.
