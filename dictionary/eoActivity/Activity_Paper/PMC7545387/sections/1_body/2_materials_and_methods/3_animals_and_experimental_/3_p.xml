<p>The blood samples were centrifuged twice at 3600 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min, and the serum was separated and analyzed by using a Beckman Coulter Chemistry Analyzer (AU5821, Tokyo, Japan), and the following serum biomarkers were analyzed: alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL), and TG. Two slides of liver were sampled from the middle of the left lobe of the liver, one for histopathologic examination (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and the other for biomarker assessment. Liver homogenate was prepared from liver tissue (0.2 g) and physiological saline (ice-cold, 1.8 mL), centrifuged at 2500 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and then examined for the activities of SOD and CAT and the levels of GSH, MDA, and TG in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and as described in our previous publications[
