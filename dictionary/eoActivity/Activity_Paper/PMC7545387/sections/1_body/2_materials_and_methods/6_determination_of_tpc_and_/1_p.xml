<p>The TPC was determined in accordance with the Folin–Ciocalteu method[
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, a properly diluted sample (0.5 mL) was mixed with Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (2.5 mL, 0.2 M). After 4 min, a saturated sodium carbonate solution (2 mL, 75 g/L) was added, and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 2 h. The absorbance at 760 nm was recorded. The results were presented as mg gallic acid equivalent per gram DW (mg GAE/g DW).
