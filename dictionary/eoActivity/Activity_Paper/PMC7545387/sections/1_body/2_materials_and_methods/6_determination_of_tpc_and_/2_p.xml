<p>The TFC was determined by using a slightly modified version of a published aluminum chloride colorimetric method[
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Specifically, ethanol (1.5 mL, 95%, v/v), aluminum chloride (0.1 mL, 10%, w/v), potassium acetate (0.1 mL, 1 mol/L), and water (2.8 mL) were added to the diluted sample (0.5 mL), and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. Absorbance was recorded at 415 nm. The results were expressed in terms of mg quercetin equivalent per gram DW (mg QE/g DW).
