<p>The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay was also conducted to measure the antioxidant activities (free radical, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>-scavenging capability) of the tested herbs and was performed using a slightly modified version of a published method[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, the ABTS free radical (ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>) solution was a 1:1 (v/v) solution of ABTS stock solution (7 mmol/L) and potassium persulfate (2.45 mmol/L). The mixture was kept in the dark (room temperature, more than 16 h) for no more than 2 d. The ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution was diluted with ethanol until the solution had an absorbance of 0.710 ± 0.050 at 734 nm. Each water extract (100 μL) was mixed with diluted ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution (3.8 mL) and allowed to react for 6 min; subsequently, the absorbance was recorded, and the results were presented as μmol Trolox equivalent per gram DW (μmol TE/g DW).
