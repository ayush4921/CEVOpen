<p>The antioxidant activity of ten medicinal herbs was determined by both ferric-reducing antioxidant power and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assays. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by Folinâ€“Ciocalteu method and aluminum chloride colorimetry, respectively. Their effects on CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury were evaluated and compared in a mouse model by administrating each water extract [(0.15 g/mL, 10 mL/kg) once per day] for seven consecutive days and a dose of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> solution in olive oil (8%, v/v, 10 mL/kg). The herb with the strongest hepatoprotective performance was analyzed for the detailed bioactive components by using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization source-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry.
