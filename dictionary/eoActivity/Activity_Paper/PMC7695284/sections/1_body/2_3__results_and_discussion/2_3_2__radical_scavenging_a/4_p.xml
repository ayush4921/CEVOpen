<p>The radical-scavenging and reducing power activities of the identified constituents of DIBEt were also tested. The identified compounds showed a strong radical-scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) in the order of naringenin &gt; kaempferol &gt; 3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid &gt; ethyl maltol &gt; dialanine &gt; GABA ≅ linamarin. Naringenin also showed the highest reducing power activity, with an ascorbic acid-equivalent of 33.32 ± 0.31 and 54.34 ± 0.29 µM for CUPRAC and FRAP assays, respectively, followed by kaempferol &gt; 3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid &gt; ethyl maltol &gt; dialanine &gt; GABA ≅ linamarin (
