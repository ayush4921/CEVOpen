<p>The identification and characterization of the related compounds from DIBEt were performed in two steps. In the first step, PSI-MS was used to identify the major 
 <italic>m/z</italic> peaks with a full-scan MS, and then characterized using PSI-MS/MS to obtain the MS/MS fragment of the obtained 
 <italic>m/z</italic> from the first step. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f001">Figure 1</xref> corresponds to the total ion chromatogram of DIBEt in PSI-MS in positive-ion mode, revealing 27 secondary metabolites presented with their molecular formula, monoisotopic mass of experimental ions, and calculated ions in positive modes (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01099-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All compounds identified in DIBEt were classified into nitrogen compounds, phenolic acids, flavonoids, amino acids, triterpenoids, and others.
