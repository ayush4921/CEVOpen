<p>To determine the reducing power potential, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assays were performed according to the method described by Alam et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The reducing power potential was expressed as the ascorbic acid-equivalent antioxidant value (µM) calculated from the standard curve of ascorbic acid. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was performed using Trolox, a water-soluble analog of vitamin E, as a positive control. The antioxidant potentiality was calculated as the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant value (µM).
