<p>Cells were lysed and harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were extracted by applying the nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was used to confirm the protein content. An adequate amount of protein (30 Î¼g) was subjected to Western blot analysis, as described in a previous report using various antibodies (
