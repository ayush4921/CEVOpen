<p>To perform the MS/MS experiments, three different stepped normalized collision energies (10, 30, and 50) were used with the same instrument. The instrument was operated in the positive-ion mode. The other operative parameters for the MS/MS experiments were as follows: sheath and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 and 0 (arbitrary units), respectively; spray voltage 3.60 kV; capillary temperature 300; and S-lens RF level 50.</p>
