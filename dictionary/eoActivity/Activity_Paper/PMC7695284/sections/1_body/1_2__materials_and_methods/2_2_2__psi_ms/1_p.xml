<p>A 2 μL stock solution (10 mg/mL) was loaded using a disposable glass Pasteur pipette (Volac; Poulten &amp; Graf Ltd., Barking, UK) onto the center of a chromatographic paper tip (Whatman 1 Chr., Kent, UK). The positive-ion mode of the Q-Exactive orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) was used to collect the data over the range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 50–600. To make a sharp tip, the chromatographic paper was cut into dimensions of 6 mm base and 14 mm height. A syringe pump (Fusion 100T; Chemyx, Stafford, TX, USA) was used to load the ethanol solvent onto the sample-loaded paper at a flow rate of 15 μL/min. A spray voltage of 4.5 kV was directly applied to the paper tip for the ionization of the sample. The other parameters for the PSI experiment were as follows: capillary temperature 300, S-lens RF level 50, mass resolution 140,000 (full-width at half-maximum), and maximum injection time 150 ms. The automatic gain control was set to 1 × 10
