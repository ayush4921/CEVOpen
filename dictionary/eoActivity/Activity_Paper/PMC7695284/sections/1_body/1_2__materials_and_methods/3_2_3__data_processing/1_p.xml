<p>Mass spectral data obtained from the orbitrap MS were processed using Xcalibur 3.1 with Foundation 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compounds were tentatively identified by matching their exact (calculated) masses of protonated (M + H) adducts with measured

 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the literature. The compound structures were drawn using ChemDraw Professional 15.0 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
