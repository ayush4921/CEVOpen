<p>Oxidative stress is a major causative condition for the development and progression of numerous acute and chronic clinical disorders. Thus, antioxidants may cause health benefits as prophylactic agents. In this study, DIBEt contained various polyphenolic compounds as confirmed by PSI-MS/MS and showed superior antioxidant activity in cell-free and cellular levels. DIBEt treatment successfully lessened oxidative stress and cell death, most likely by (i) reducing ROS generation and (ii) boosting the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and/or Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression. DIBEt pretreatment may cause the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathways involved in the cytoprotective effects of DIBEt. The findings provide new insights into the cytoprotective effects and mechanisms of DIB against oxidative stress, which may be used as treatment for oxidative stress-induced disorders.</p>
