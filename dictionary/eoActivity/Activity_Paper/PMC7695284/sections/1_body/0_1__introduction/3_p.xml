<p>Instrumental analytical techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), have been applied to qualitatively and quantitatively explore the secondary metabolites of medicinal plants or foods. Although these techniques are very accurate and precise, they are very time-consuming and require laborious sample preparation and high costs. In contrast, paper spray ionization-MS (PSI-MS) requires minimal sample preparation time, boosts the ionization of compounds under mild experimental conditions, and furnishes ultrafast examinations of complex matrices at low cost [
