<p>Among the various signaling molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Redox imbalance precisely participates in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of numerous chronic diseases [

Phytochemicals with inherent antioxidant potential orchestrate innumerable cellular defensive signaling cascades directly or indirectly and might have remedial applications for oxidative stress-induced disorders [
