  <p>Protective effects of DIBEt against t-BHP-induced cell toxicity and intracellular ROS generation through the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation. Cells were treated with DIBEt and gallic acid (GA) at the indicated concentrations for 12 h and then exposed to 100 μM t-BHP for 6 h. Cell viability percentage (
   <bold>A</bold>) and intracellular ROS (
   <bold>B</bold>) were determined by MTT assay and the DCFH-DA method, respectively. Mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). # 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, compared to no treatment; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, compared to t-BHP treatment. SOD1, catalase, GPx, and phase II antioxidant enzyme (such as HO-1) mRNA (
   <bold>C</bold>) and protein expression (
   <bold>D</bold>) were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Nrf2 protein expression (
   <bold>E</bold>) was measured by Western blot. Cells were treated with an Nrf2 inhibitor (brusatol) with and without DIBEt and naringenin (NAR). Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels were analyzed by Western blot (
   <bold>F</bold>). Mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). # 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, compared to no treatment; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, compared to sample treatment. (+): presence; (-): absence.
