<p id="p0030">We should provide a productive computational environment for the usage of AILDE. We need a high performance computer with a Unix-based operating system to perform this protocol. A graphics processing unit (GPU) equipment is advised to be used to accelerate the process of molecular dynamics simulation. The prerequisite software (in the 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">materials and equipment</xref> section) is freely available on the corresponding websites. The detail introduction about the installation is provided in their user manuals. These software are utilized in different procedures. We download the source code of AILDE at
