<p id="p0405">AILDE is based on an assumption that there are no substantial changes in the binding modes between protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes. AILDE could not achieve a good performance in a complicated situation of activity cliffs. This is caused by the compounds with similar structures, but have large differences in binding affinity (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Stumpfe and Bajorath, 2012</xref>). In this protocol, a small fragment library is applied to generate the potential lead compounds. It is suggested to utilize larger chemical space to search and predict more possible lead compounds. The molecular weight of a fragment molecule is recommend to be less than 90 g/mol for a good performance.
