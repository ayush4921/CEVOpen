    <italic>antechamber</italic> module in Amber. The complex system was then solvated in the cube box of the TIP3P water model with a distance of 10 Å between the solute and box. The counter-ions (Cl

The particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm is used to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions and the short-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions is handled with a cutoff distance of 10 Å. The integration of the equations of motion is conducted at a time step of 2 fs. Finally, 1 ns production simulation is performed and the structure snapshots are collected every 1 ps (

   <p id="p0320">The fluctuations of the protein and hit compound are measured by root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) against their initial structures. The stability of the MD simulation is reflected by their RMSD values, which reveal the conformational changes during the time period of MD simulation. A plateau RMSD value means that the protein-hit complex is in the equilibration state, and that the simulation moves toward the stability status.</p>
