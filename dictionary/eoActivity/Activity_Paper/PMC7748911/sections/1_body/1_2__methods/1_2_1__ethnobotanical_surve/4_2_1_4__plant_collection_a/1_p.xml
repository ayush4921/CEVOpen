<p>A good rapport was established between the researcher and the respondents and with their assistance; plant species were collected during several visits over the course of the study. The selected respondents were those often-assisting traditional healers in plant collection from their natural habitat. A broad approach was used to correctly identify collected plant materials. This involved (i) comparison against samples in the Unisa Herbarium, (ii) against data from the literature, and (iii) consultation with botanists from within the Unisa College of Agriculture and Environmental Science (CAES) laboratories, the Unisa Department of Life and Consumer Sciences, and the Unisa Horticulture Centre. Consulted data bases included the PlantZAfrica database (
