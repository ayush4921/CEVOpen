<p>ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases were used to compare the literature reporting on medicinal plants showing antihypertensive activity against the data obtained in the survey. This was carried out using keywords (antihypertensive plants, ethnobotanical survey, medicinal plants, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, herbal medicine, and treatment of hypertension). To obtain information on plants used in South Africa, the word “South Africa” was inserted and combined with the different keywords as indicated earlier.</p>
