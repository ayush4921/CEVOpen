<p>In the literature, most of the plants used for the management of hypertension carry out their antihypertensive activity through the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reduction of oxidative stress, vasorelaxation via the nitric oxide-guanylyl cyclase pathway, and a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism as well as anti-inflammatory activities. Other reported mechanisms include the activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, lowering of systolic blood pressure, EDRF-dependent or -independent pathways, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, a

Supplementary Table
