<p>A quick summary obtained from the literatures clearly identified different classes of compounds. Some of these compounds have been evaluated for their antihypertensive activities using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays belonging to different classes such as phenolics, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, triterpenes, and peptides (Suppl. Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">1</xref>). Phenolics (
 <italic>n</italic> = 44) are the most commonly reported group of compounds identified with antihypertensive activities, followed by flavonoids (
 <italic>n</italic> = 31) and alkaloids (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27).
