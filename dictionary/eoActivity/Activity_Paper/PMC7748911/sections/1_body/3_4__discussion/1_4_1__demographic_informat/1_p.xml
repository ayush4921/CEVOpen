<p>As there were more females than males interviewed in the current survey, the predominance of women in relation to men can probably be ascribed to the involvement of men in other fields of work or the interview period such as when men were not at home. This is in agreement with the findings of a comparable study conducted in the Western Cape, South Africa [

It will be fair to say that not all the respondents are traditional healers, so women being traditionally caretakers of the family's health may have impacted their knowledge on medicinal plants that exceed those of men. However, the predominance of women to men as the custodian of traditional knowledge varies according to the population under investigation in terms of their sociocultural characteristics. The higher percentage of ages between 55 and 66 years corroborates with previous reports suggesting that mainly adults and older people practice traditional medicine [

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. This study clearly shows the persistent gap in knowledge of herbal practice between the younger and older generations, suggesting the urgent need for documentation of this invaluable knowledge. Interestingly, the high education level of the informants and traditional healers in this study is enough to encourage the documentation of this knowledge or practice. This contrasts with reports that most traditional practitioners in Nigeria involved in maternal healthcare have no formal education [
