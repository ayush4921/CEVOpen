<p>A review of the literature for plants used to treat hypertension in South Africa identified a large number of medicinal species (
 <italic>n</italic> = 139), and some of these plants have also been reported elsewhere for the treatment of hypertension. In South Africa, the most frequently cited plants are 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>, 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic>, 
 <italic>Citrullus lanatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic>, 
 <italic>Hypoxis hemerocallidea</italic>, 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic>, 
 <italic>Clausena anisata</italic>, 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichilia emetica</italic>, 
 <italic>Leonotis leonurus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ballota africana</italic>, 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. For instance, 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> with the highest citation is also commonly used in other parts of the world such as India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Spain for the management of hypertension [

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Comparison of the survey results with the literature data shows that the majority of the medicinal plants reported from the survey have not been previously reported for the treatment of hypertension. Although they appear in the inventory of plants used by the people of Vhenda, these plants have not been identified as antihypertensives [

This study indicates the multipurpose usage of medicinal plants and the dominance of the Fabaceae family of plants as an essential component of traditional medicine. With more than 490 species, the Fabaceae family is the second largest family of medicinal plants currently being used in traditional medicine. The family has been reported to show different medicinal potentials including antioxidant, antidiabetic, antibacterial, cytotoxic, and antihypertensive properties [

 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. In parallel to the data reported in the current study, the possible mechanisms for the antihypertensive properties of the Fabaceae family may involve the PI3-kinase/PKB/Akt pathway, inhibition of ACE and/or antioxidant properties [
