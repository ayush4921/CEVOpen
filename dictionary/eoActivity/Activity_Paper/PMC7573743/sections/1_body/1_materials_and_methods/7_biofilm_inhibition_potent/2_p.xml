<p>The biofilm inhibition potential of Date palm ethanolic extracts was also observed through Phase contrast microscopy. For this, few drops of the overnight culture of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> was added on separate glass slides and incubated at 37Â°C for 14 h. Using phosphate buffer saline, the slides were washed and supplemented with Date palm extracts. Then the slides were rinsed, stained and the biofilms were dissolved using 30% glacial acetic acid. Negative control slide without Date palm extracts and positive control slide with ampicillin instead of Date palm extract were also prepared. All the prepared smears on glass slides were examined microscopically.
