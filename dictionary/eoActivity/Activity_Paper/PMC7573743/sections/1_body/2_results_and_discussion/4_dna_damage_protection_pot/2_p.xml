<p>Pure calf thymus DNA formed a complete and clear band in second lane that was taken as standard of negative control and lane 1 is the positive control in which calf thymus DNA is treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>. In the presence of calf thymus DNA and Fenton reagent in lane 3 to 8 showed no smear formation. This protection of calf thymus DNA in the presence of Fenton reagent has proven the oxidative damage protection potential of extracts.
