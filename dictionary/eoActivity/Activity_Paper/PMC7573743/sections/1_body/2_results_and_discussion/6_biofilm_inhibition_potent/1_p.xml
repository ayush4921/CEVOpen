 </sup> Potential of the 2 tested varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> L. including Ajwa and Khalas to inhibit the growth of bacterial biofilm was evaluated against 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> Both extracts at varying concentrations inhibited the bacterial biofilm formation. By increasing the concentration of extract sample, the potential of biofilm inhibition was increasing. At 100mg/ml concentration of Ajwa and Khalas extracts exhibited higher percentage of biofilm inhibition against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 10mg/ml concentration of Khalas and Ajwa showed lower percentage of biofilm inhibition against 
 <italic>P. multocida.</italic> The results of biofilm inhibition assay of Ajwa and Khalas at varying concentrations are given in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1559325820962609">Figure 3</xref> below. Phase Contrast Microscopy showed the compact bacterial growth on slide of negative control in the absence of any antibacterial agent. Condensed growth of bacteria was observed because of crystal violet. Positive control that contains antibiotic, Khalas and Ajwa extracts inhibited the growth of bacterial colonies which were grown in nutrient broth.
