<p>Antibacterial activity of different extracts has been due to their destructive effect on cell wall and cell membrane, inhibiting the enzymes, or metabolic inactivation of microorganism and the destruction of DNA or RNA molecule in bacteria. Results of the antibacterial activities of studied varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> namely Ajwa and Khalas by using 100mg/mL concentration against selected bacterial strains i-e 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>B. Subtilis</italic> are given in 
 <xref rid="table3-1559325820962609" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> as inhibition zone (IZ; mm) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; Âµg/mL). The inhibition zones (mm) as a measure of antibacterial activity of tested varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> are shown in
