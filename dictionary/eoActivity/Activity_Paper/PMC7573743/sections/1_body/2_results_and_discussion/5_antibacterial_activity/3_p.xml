<p>Antibacterial activity showed reduction in bacterial growth in terms of increased zone of inhibition and decreased MIC indicating that extracts exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity. The strong antibacterial activity of Ajwa and Khalas ethanolic extract may be attributed to large amounts of phenolics and flavonoids. The potent antibacterial action of ethanolic extract can be correlated with its high phenolic content because of phenolic toxicity to microorganisms.

 </sup> Abdullah et al. studied the antibacterial activity of hot aqueous and methanol extracts of Ajwa date fruit against Gram negative bacteria including 
 <italic>S. typhi, E. coli, V. Cholera</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> through well diffusion method. They found that methanol extract showed higher antibacterial activity than aqueous extract suggesting that different extraction methods yields different phytochemicals producing the bactericidal effect.
