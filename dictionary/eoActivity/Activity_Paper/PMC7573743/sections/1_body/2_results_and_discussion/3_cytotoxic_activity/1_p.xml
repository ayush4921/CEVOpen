<p>Cytotoxic activity of tested varieties of Date palm was carried out through hemolytic assay using human red blood cells (RBCs). The percentage hemolysis of different extract and concentrations of Ajwa and Khalas is given in 
 <xref rid="table2-1559325820962609" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The highest percentage of red cell lysis was observed in ethanolic extract of Ajwa (3.45%) at 100 mg/mL concentration while lower percentage of red cells lysis was observed in ethanolic extract of Khalas at 10 mg/mL concentration. The Triton X-100 used as positive control showed 90.05% lysis of red cells. The mechanical stability of the erythrocytic membrane is a better sign of the effect of various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by chemical constituents for the screening of cytotoxicity. So in this study, the cytotoxic effect of fruits extract and concentrations against human red cells was evaluated. The percentage lysis of human erythrocytes was below 5.0%, so it was concluded that the extract and concentrations have less cytotoxic effects.
