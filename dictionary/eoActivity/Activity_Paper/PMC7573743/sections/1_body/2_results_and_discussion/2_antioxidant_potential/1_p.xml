 </sup> Dates are rich source of phenolics and flavonoids due to which they have potential role in protection against cellular damage caused by oxidative stress generated by free radicals produced in the body.

 </sup> Some varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> are rich source of dietary fibers so they can be included in formulation of fiber and group of antioxidant food.

 </sup> Results of different antioxidant assays including DPPH inhibition assay, reducing power assay, total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) are given in 
 <xref rid="table2-1559325820962609" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Results showed that TPC in Khalas and Ajwa ranged from 47.8 ± 0.04 to 121 ± 0.16 and 89.6 ± 0.05 to 140.4 ± 0.18 mg/100 g, respectively. It proved that sample containing higher phenolic content has higher antioxidant activity.

 </sup> Total flavonoids content (TFC) in Khalas and Ajwa varied from 20.65 ± 0.03 to 121 ± 0.16 and 23.81 ± 0.04 to 83.28 ± 0.68 mg/100 g, respectively. 
 <xref rid="table2-1559325820962609" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed that TFC varies by changing the concentration and also by using different Date palm varieties. The ferric reducing power potential was confirmed by the change of yellow color of the test solution to various shades of green and blue depending on the concentration of the plant extract, the highest reducing power was obtained by using 100mg/mL concentration of Ajwa (19.3 ± 0.09) and lowest was (4.95 ± 0.06) by using 10mg/mL concentration of Khalas.
