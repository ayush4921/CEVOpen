<p>Currently, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been recognised; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease [

Using an artificial intelligence (AI) programme, a group of researchers found potential therapeutic candidates that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thus inhibit viral infection. Such drugs could be used as potential therapeutics against COVID-19 [

However, in the cases of such commercial medications, there is always an increased risk of the potential development of drug resistance, especially in the case of specific viral enzyme inhibitors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel antivirals that are cost-effective and exhibit enhanced efficacy for the management and control of viral infections when vaccines and standard therapies are unsuccessful [

Natural substances such as mushrooms and herbs have previously shown both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity and thus serve as excellent sources of novel antiviral treatments, hence the possibilities of natural substances as effective novel treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising [
