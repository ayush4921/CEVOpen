<p>Another species of mushroom that has shown promising antiviral effects is 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa,</italic> (hen-of-the-woods, ram’s head and sheep’s head) a species of 
 <italic>Basidiomycotina.</italic> This is an example of an edible mushroom that has been used in herbal medicine. In comparison to the shiitake mushroom, 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> has a higher nutritional value. The major biologically active component of the mushroom is the β-glucan in the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharide (GFP). Moreover, GFP has shown great anticancer potential with it being approved as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of cancer in China [

 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> using ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE ion exchange chromatography. GFAHP has a reported molecular weight of 29.5 kDa, and the N-terminal sequence of GFAHP consists of 11 amino acid peptides. This peptide sequence did not match any known amino acid sequences, thus indicating that GFAHP is likely to be a novel antivirus protein. This protein extract displayed great ability to inhibit in vitro replication of HSV type 1 (HSV-1). In murine models, higher concentrations of GFAHP, in particular at the doses of 125 and 500 μg/mL, strongly reduced the severity of blepharitis, neovascularisation and stromal keratitis induced by HSV-1(Gu et al., 2007). Gu et al. (2007) found that topical administration of the GFAHP protein extract to the cornea of mice caused a significant decrease in virus production. This study demonstrated that GFAHP was able to both directly inactivate HSV-1 and inhibit HSV-1 infiltration into Vero cells [

 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> (GF-D) and was used in combination with human IFN α-2b (IFN) in order to investigate the inhibitory effect of hepatitis b virus (HBV). Following analysis of HBV DNA and viral antigens, the results obtained showed that GF-D or IFN alone were able to inhibit HBV DNA in cells with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.59 mg/mL for GF-D and 1399 IU/mL for IFN. Upon further analysis, researchers found that combined use of GFD and IFN synergistically inhibited HBV replication. When combined with 0.45 mg/mL GF-D, the IC50 for IFN was reported to be 154 IU/mL, thus suggesting that in combination, there was a 9-fold increase in antiviral activity. The results indicate the possibility of using GF-D and IFN combination therapy as a potentially effective therapy against hepatitis b virus infections [

Following administration with GF-D, CD4+ cell counts, viral load measure, symptoms of HIV, status of secondary disease and sense of wellbeing were monitors in order to test HIV status of each individual. From 35 patients, 57% presented with an increase in CD4+ cell count, whereas 22% reported a decrease in cell count. In regard to viral load, different results were observed: 9 patients displayed an increase in viral load, whereas a decrease was observed in the viral load of 10 patients. Despite this, 85% of patients reported an increase in sense of wellbeing with regard to symptoms and also secondary diseases that are linked to HIV, further suggesting the positive impact this extract can have against viral diseases [
