<p>A study conducted in 2018, determined the structural characterisation of lentinan from 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic> mycelia (shiitake) as well as looking at the antiviral activity against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic> mycelia extract is a powder that is extracted from shiitake mushrooms known as 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes.</italic> The novel lentinan (LNT-1) was extracted and purified via anion exchange and the structural characterisation was carried out by a range of experiments including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1D-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results obtained displayed that LNT-1 had an overall molecular weight of 3.79 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> Da. Structural characterisation of LNT-1 showed that it was a β—(1 → 3)—glucan backbone with—(1 → 6)—glucosyl side-branching units terminated by mannosyl and galactosyl residues. Additionally, the study found prominent antiviral activity against INHV, and the main antiviral mechanisms of LNT-1 were direct inactivation as well as inhibition of viral replication. As well as this, administration of LNT-1 also caused significant downregulation in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-11, whilst also upregulating the expressions of IFN-1 and IFN-γ, cytokines that are known to induce antiviral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory effects [

As previously said, the innate immune response is a critical factor for COVID-19 disease severity and disease outcome. COVID-19 patients exhibit high titres of inflammatory cytokines and so the effects of LNT-1 should be considered on SARS-COV-2 [
