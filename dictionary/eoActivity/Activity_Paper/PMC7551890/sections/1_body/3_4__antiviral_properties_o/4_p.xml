<p>Abu-Serie et al. evaluated the antioxidant and the anti-inflammatory effects of Malaysian 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> aqueous extract (GLE) and Egyptian 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> ethanolic extract (CVE). The main finding of this study shows that GLE-CVE exhibited higher antioxidant and anti-radical effects in comparison to individual extracts. GLE-CVE also attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in white blood cells, which occurred through the process of downregulating inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, cyclooxygenase-2, nuclear factor kappa-beta (κβ) as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition, the combined extracts also exhibited great ability in enhancing the cellular antioxidant indices. These changes caused by GLE-CVE also led to suppression of cellular increase in nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation. This study also concluded that the combined extract had an antioxidant effect that was significantly greater than that of a commercial anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone. As oxidative stress and inflammation are two factors that are consistently linked to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, there may be a great possibility of this combined extract as an alternative treatment [
