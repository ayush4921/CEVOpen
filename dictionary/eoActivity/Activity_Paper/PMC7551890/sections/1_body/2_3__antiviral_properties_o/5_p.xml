<p>In addition to garlic, ginger, also known as 
 <italic>Zingiber officinalis</italic>, has shown great promise as a medicinal agent [

It has been reported that the health benefits of ginger are mainly due to the phenolic compounds such as gingerols and shogao it possesses [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Many investigations have demonstrated that ginger possesses a range of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, neuroprotective, cardiovascular protective and antiviral properties [

The results from this study showed that in addition to garlic, ginger extracts significantly inhibited the calicivirus which was in a dose-dependent manner, thus confirming the specific viral potency ginger possesses [

In addition, in a separate study, it was found that fresh ginger had the potential to inhibit the attachment and internalisation of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to both human lung cells and liver cells, in a dose-dependent manner. It was also found that the treatment with ginger stimulated the mucosal cells to increase sections on Interferon-beta (INF-β) secretions, which has antiviral effects and thus possibly contributed to the inhibition of the viral infection [

This study concluded that extracts of ginger stimulated the production of TNF-α, which has previously been shown to act as the first line of defence against virus infections [
