<p>Garlic (
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>) is an aromatic herbaceous plant that has been extensively used worldwide, especially in the Far East, for centuries, in many food dishes due to its appetising property, bitter taste and the flavour it gives to dishes. Despite the use of garlic being such a common practice, this particular plant is of great medical importance, as garlic has exhibited antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and even antitumor effects [

Despite researchers arguing in order for garlic to be effective, it should be consumed fresh; some research has proven that the effects of garlic are consistent when it is cooked, with oils even providing better protection against oxidative stress and infections [

 <italic>A. sativum</italic> is rich in alliin, allicin, ajoenes, vinyldithiins and flavonoids such as quercetin, all of which are sulphur-containing phytoconstituents [

 <italic>A. sativum</italic> but the experiments that have been conducted have shown that 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> is effective against influenza B, herpes simplex viruses, cytomegalovirus, rhinovirus, HIV, HSV type 1 and 2 and viral pneumonia [

It has been speculated that in the case of HIV, the ajoene acts by inhibiting the integrin-dependent processes, thus inhibiting the fusion of cells with HIV-infected cells, and ajoene was also able to inhibit HIV replication, further showing its antiviral activity [

Additionally, a single clinical trial reported that garlic may prevent the occurrence of the common cold, however, the data provided are insufficient. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that garlic is effectively used in cardiovascular diseases by regulating blood pressure, with reducing effects on glycaemia and high blood cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Taken together, the data show the beneficial effects extracts of garlic have and thus make it useful in medicine. However, further research is still required to determine the exact mechanisms and its potential as an antiviral agent.
