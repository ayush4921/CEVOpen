<p>Due to the increasing number of human casualties, research has focused on understanding the nature of the disease in order to develop effective treatments. Currently, no specific treatment has been identified for COVID-19. The race to develop a preventive vaccine is still ongoing, with many still in the early stages of clinical trials. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop an effective antiviral with enhanced efficacy for the prophylaxis and treatment of coronavirus infection. Various medications have now been identified and developed as a means for controlling and suppressing inflammatory crises such as steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressants [

However, developing such medications often means that they are associated with adverse side effects such as ulceration, gastric irritation, angioedema, hepatic failure, headache, haemolytic anaemia, hyperglycaemia and immunodeficiency-related problems, as well as others [

There have been many reports regarding the use of natural substances isolated from medicinal plants as effective treatments against viral infections. Lin et al. (2014) summarised the antiviral capabilities of herbal medicines against several viral pathogens such as coronavirus, coxsackie virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In regard to coronaviruses, this review highlighted that naturally occurring triterpene glycosides, known as saikosaponins, isolated from medicinal plants such as Bupleurum spp., Heteromorpha spp. and Scrophularia exhibited great antiviral activity against human coronaviruses (

These naturally occurring compounds were able to effectively prevent early stages of coronavirus infection by affecting viral attachment and cell penetration. Moreover, many natural compounds such as myricetin, scutellarein and phenolic compounds from Isatis indigotica and Torreya nucifera have been identified as natural inhibitors against the number of coronavirus enzymes, including nsP13 helicase and 3CL protease [

The water extract from Houttuynia cordata has also been identified as another anti-coronavirus natural medicine, as it has been observed to both inhibit the viral 3CL protease and block the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, thus displaying various antiviral mechanisms against SARS-CoV1 [
