<p>Coronaviruses have been described as zoonotic infections, with alpha and beta coronaviruses found primarily in mammals such as bats whereas gamma and delta are more common in pigs and birds. Additionally, investigations into the previous coronavirus outbreaks found that SARS-CoV1 was transmitted from bats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans [

Many efforts have been made in order to identify the reservoir host or the intermediate host for the novel coronavirus. Despite the fact the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be identified, genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 88% similarity between two severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS)-like coronaviruses derived from bats, thus demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved from a coronavirus of bat origin [
