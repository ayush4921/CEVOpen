<p>The primary mode of human to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified to be through respiratory droplets [

Once the virus has gained entry into a human host, reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells using receptor-mediated endocytosis via the membrane-bound aminopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor (ACE2). Studies have shown that the primary target for this novel virus seems to be the lung alveolar epithelial cells, which ultimately results in the manifestation of respiratory symptoms [
