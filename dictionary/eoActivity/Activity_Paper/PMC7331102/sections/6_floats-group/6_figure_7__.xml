  <title>HPLC-DAD chromatogram of the phenolic compounds presents in the EH 70% ethanolic extract (representative figure).</title>
  <p>Polyphenolic compounds were separated by Phenomenex-C18 (2)-column, the Diode Array Detector was set at 280 nm; the mobile phase consisted of 3% acetic acid water and acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.9 ml/min in gradient conditions. In the figure X-axis denotes the units of time (minutes) i.e. retention time (tR) and Y axis denotes the intensity of absorbance (milli-Absorbance units) or concentration. Ten compounds were detected in chromatogram.</p>
