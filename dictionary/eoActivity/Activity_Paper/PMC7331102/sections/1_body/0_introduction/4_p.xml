<p>Leaf, stem, root or sometime the complete plant possess the property to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS), the main causative agents of oxidative stress and cellular damage which results in numerous diseases and disorders

 </sup>. ROS or RNS includes a variety of free radicals such as superoxide anion (O 
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>-</sup>), hydroxyl radical ( 
 <sup>.</sup>OH), nitric oxide radical (NO 
 <sup>.</sup>), and peroxyl radicals (ROO 
 <sup>.</sup>), and non-free radical species like hydrogen peroxide (H 
 <sub>2</sub>O 
 <sub>2</sub>), ozone (O 
 <sub>3</sub>), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), nitrous acid (HNO 
 <sub>2</sub>)

 </sup>. The primary site of ROS production in the cell is the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Natural antioxidants protect us from oxidative stress by reducing the free radicals to nontoxic products. However, healthy cells have their own natural ROS or RNS defense mechanisms which actively eliminate free radicals through enzyme-mediated systems like superoxide dismutases, peroxidases, catalases, and glutathione peroxidases
