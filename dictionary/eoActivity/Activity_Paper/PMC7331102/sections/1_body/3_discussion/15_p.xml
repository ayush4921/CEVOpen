<p>The complete results obtained from the antimicrobial activity study indicated that aqueous extracts had high antimicrobial property than the 70% ethanolic extracts, which supports the previous study of Abubakar, 2009

 </sup>. The presence of bioactive metabolites in the extracts such as flavonoids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, alkaloids, phenolics, steroids and anthraquinone as reported earlier is likely to be responsible for the good antimicrobial property. Polyphenols and other bioactive molecules regulate the synthesis of nucleic acids of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria; that is why the proper zone of inhibition has been observed in the assay

 </sup>. Perumal showed that plants with high caffeic acid levels had shown significant antimicrobial activity. In the study, 70% ethanolic extracts of CR and TP contains the highest amount of caffeic acid, and these two leaves extracts showed better antimicrobial activities which support the previous study as well

 </sup>. The antimicrobial activity also depends on the ROS formation. Balanced state of the body interrupted by pathological situations due to overproduction of ROS and comparatively low amount of endogenous antioxidants in the body. It results in the reaction between ROS and intra and extracellular species leading to the emergence of oxidative stress-related disorders and pathogenesis. To control oxidative stresses, it is necessary to maintain the balance between ROS and antioxidants by administering exogenous natural antioxidants such as hydroxycinnamic acids
