 </sup>. DPPH is a highly used free radical to determine the free radical scavenging activity of natural antioxidants. This free radical scavenging assay is based on the reduction of DPPH radicals in methanol in the presence of hydrogen-donating antioxidant due to the formation of the non-radical shape of DPPH-H. DPPH is unaffected by side reactions, like metal ion chelating and enzyme inhibitions and it is counted as one of the benefits of it. In this method, a change in colour from purple to yellow happens, and this is proportional to the concentration and radical scavenging capacity of the extracts in the form of hydrogen donating capability
