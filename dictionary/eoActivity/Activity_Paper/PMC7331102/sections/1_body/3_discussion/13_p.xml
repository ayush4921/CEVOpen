<p>From previous studies and reports, it was observed that there is a positive correlation exists between antioxidant property and the bioactive compounds. It can be concluded that the bioactive compounds appear to be responsible for the significant (p-value &lt;0.01) antioxidant property of both the solvents extracts

 </sup>. The observation of the investigations agrees with the point that the ethnomedicinal plants are the principal source of therapeutically and nutritionally used natural antioxidants

 </sup>. The study findings conclude that the aqueous extracts have maximum antioxidant activity in comparison with the 70% ethanolic extracts. EH has huge and intense potentiality towards pharmaceutical and nutraceutical importance due to the presence of high polyphenolic compounds which is comparable with the green and black teas

 </sup>. Using the above 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> test, the results suggested that EH exhibited potent antioxidant activity, and it can serve as a new source of the natural antioxidant agent
