<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-diabetic property evaluation of the plants leaves extracts was assessed by inhibition of polysaccharides degrading enzyme α-amylase inhibitory method. A large variety of α-amylase inhibitors have been reported from various plants, which protect against oxidative damage resulted in hyperglycemia. Inhibition of enzyme activity may be due to the presence of potentially bioactive compounds like polyphenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides. The DNS reagent assay is a widely used procedure to quantify the amount of reducing sugars produced after-treatment of the solution by α-amylase with different types of samples

The anti-diabetic and antioxidant properties of the EH leaves might be due to the synergistic effect of biologically active phytochemicals present in the extracts
