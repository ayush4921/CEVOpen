<p>Flavonoids are the category of plant secondary metabolites with high antioxidant, antimicrobial and chelating activities. Antioxidant activities of flavonoids depend on the structure and substitution pathways of hydroxyl groups. The antioxidative properties of flavonoids classes are due to various reaction mechanisms, such as scavenging of free radicals, chelation of metal ions (e.g. iron and copper), and inhibition of enzymes which are responsible for free radical production. Depending on their specific structure, it can inhibit or regulate all the possible ROS, which can cause cellular damages. Previous studies have concluded the protective ability of flavonoids against various diseases
