 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-arthritic activity exhibited by the extracts is caused may be due to the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols and tannins. Denaturation of the protein involves the breakdown of chemical structures of the molecules and finally leads to cell death; it happens due to various stresses like a high level of salt, temperature and acidity. The processes of protein denaturation may be related with the alteration in electrostatic, hydrogen, hydrophobic and disulphide bonding. Denaturation of proteins is leading to oxidative stress-related diseases such as inflammatory situations, rheumatoid arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. The results concluded that leaves extracts of CR have the highest ability to control the oxidative stress-related generation of auto-antigen, which relates to the inhibition of the denaturation of proteins
