<p>The anti-arthritic activity of aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts was determined by the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models, i.e. inhibition of protein denaturation. The various concentrations of extracts were selected for the assay between 1 mg/ml and 0.00196 mg/ml. The study observed that the maximum inhibition percentage was 70.36±0.69% and 74.54±0.75% for CR aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts, respectively. The minimum inhibition activity is 52.28±0.91% and 53.48±0.89% for TP aqueous and 70% ethanol extract ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f14">Figure 14</xref>), respectively, as compared to inhibition percentage for standard diclofenac sodium was 97.25% at 1 mg/ml of concentration.
