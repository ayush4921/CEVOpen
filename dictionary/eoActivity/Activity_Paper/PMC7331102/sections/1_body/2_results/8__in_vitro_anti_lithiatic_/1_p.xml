<p>In the research investigation, titration was used to assess the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-lithiatic property of aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts using a calcium oxalate dissolution assay. Based on the results obtained in the study, the highest dissolution percentage of calcium oxalate was 79.98±0.95% and 74.41±4.43% for EH aqueous and CB 70% ethanolic extract, respectively. The lowest is 46.37±3.22% and 10.45±1.78% for TP aqueous and 70% ethanolic extract (
