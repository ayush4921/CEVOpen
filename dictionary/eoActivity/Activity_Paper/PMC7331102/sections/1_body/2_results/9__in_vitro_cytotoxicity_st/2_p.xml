<p>The dose-dependent (10 Âµl of crude plant extract) cell viability assay elicited a 10-12% mortality rate of PBMC in 48 hrs of culture in the control; only the aqueous extracts of CR showed higher mortality than control, with other aqueous extracts eliciting lower mortality rates, showing some nontoxic or cytoprotective properties for PBMC or immune cells ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f17">Figure 17</xref>). However, the EH aqueous extract showed maximum cytoprotectivity showing a mortality of ~2.5%. EH 70% ethanolic extracts showed cytoprotectivity (~4%) nearly comparable to its aqueous soluble counterpart. The 70% ethanolic extracts showed higher mortality in PBMC. Particularly, CR and TP 70% ethanolic extracts are much cytotoxic, where TP found over two-fold cytotoxicity than control. Both extracts of CB showed cytoprotectivity compared to the control.
