  <italic>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiling of the 70% ethanolic extracts.</italic>
 </bold> The HPLC profiling of ten important bioactive phenolic acids, gallic acid (GA), catechin hydrate (CH), chlorogenic acid (CHA), caffeic acid (CA), syringic acid (SYA), p coumaric acid (pCA), sinapic acid (SIA), coumarin (CM), quercetin (QE) and kaempferol (KMP), was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography. Standard reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The peak area was calculated by Open Lab CDS version 2.0 software. In the experiments the polyphenolic compounds were separated under the following conditions: Phenomenex-C18 (2)-column (250 mm×4.6 mm i.d.; Luna 5-μm particle diameter 100 Å), the diode array detector (DAD) was set at 280 nm; the mobile phase consisted of 3% acetic acid water and acetonitrile (Himedia, India). Prior to use, the solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic bath and filtered through 0.22-μm membranes. The flow rate was 0.9 ml/min in gradient conditions. The injection volume was 20 μl. All the separations are carried out at ambient temperature. The gradient elution of solvent A (water-acetic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile) had a significant effect on the resolution of compounds according to the procedure: 0 min, 100% (A); 5 min, 95% (A); 17 min, 85% (A); 40 min, 60% (A); 60 min, 50% (A); 65 min, 50% (A); 70 min, 100% (A)
