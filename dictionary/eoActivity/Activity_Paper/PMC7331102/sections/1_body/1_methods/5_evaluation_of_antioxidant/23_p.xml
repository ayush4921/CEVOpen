 </sup> in triplicate with slight modifications. The complete procedure is comprises three different steps, namely (i) Experimental kidney stone (calcium oxalate stones) preparation, (ii) Preparation of semi-permeable membrane from chicken eggs, and (iii) Estimation of calcium oxalate by titration method. All the experimental protocols are given below.
