  <italic>DPPH free radical scavenging capacity assay.</italic>
 </bold> The DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, SRL, India) stable free radical scavenging property of the extracts was carried out by the help of using the standard method of Shen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) with slight modifications. In brief, 0.1 mM DPPH solution was made in methanol and 50 ÂµL of leaf extract was mixed with DPPH solution thoroughly, vortexed and the total reaction mixture (3mL) was incubated at dark for 30 min. Next, absorbance was read at 517 nm. Ascorbic acid (Merck, India) was used as a standard. This experiment was performed in triplicate.
