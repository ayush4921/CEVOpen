<p>A cell viability assay has been done with Trypan Blue. Cells were then laid in 12 well plates at a concentration of 3.6x10 
 <sup>7</sup> cells/ml with a volume of 1 ml at each well except media (DMEM) control containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution 100X, Himedia, India) along with 10% FBS and incubated in the CO 
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h in 5% CO 
 <sub>2</sub> humified environment at 37ºC (CO 
 <sub>2</sub> Incubator Galaxy 48S, New Brunswick, Germany). Next, 10, 5 and 2.5 µl of each of the extracts (different dose of aqueous and ethanolic extracts) were added to the wells except controls and continued in culture for another 48 hrs. Culture plates were then taken out and treated with 10 μl of 0.4% freshly prepared trypan blue solution for 5 mins and readily observed under Nikon Eclipse TS 100 Inverted Phase-contrast Microscope and documented by CCD Camera (DS-Fi2-U3) and NIS-BR Software (Nikon Corporation, Japan).
