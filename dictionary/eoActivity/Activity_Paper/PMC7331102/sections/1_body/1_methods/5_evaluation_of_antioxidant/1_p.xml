 </bold> ABTS (2, 2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan) radical cation decolourization assays were carried out in triplicate to determine the stable free radical scavenging property of extracts by the help of the standard method of Re

 </sup> with slight modifications. In brief, 5 µL of leaf extract was mixed with 2.995 µl of ABTS reagent thoroughly, vortexed and the total reaction mixture (3 mL) was incubated at dark for 30 min. Next, absorbance was read at 734 nm. Ascorbic acid (Merck, India) was used as a standard. ABTS stable free radical scavenging property was expressed in ascorbic acid equivalent as well as the inhibition percentages were determined using the following equation:
