 </sup>. In brief, β-carotene (2 mg) (HiMedia, India) was dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform (Merck, India) and then 1 ml of the chloroform solution was added to 20 μl of linoleic acid (HiMedia-GRM10250, India) and 200 mg of Tween-80 (HiMedia-PCT1513, India). The mixture was evaporated at 50°C, and then 50 ml oxygenated water was added and shaken to form an emulsion. A total of 0.012 ml of leaf extracts were mixed with 0.1 ml of the emulsion. The reactions were left at 50°C, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm. All reactions were read at zero time and every 15 min up to 180 min. This experiment was performed in triplicate. Lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI) values were expressed using the following formula:
