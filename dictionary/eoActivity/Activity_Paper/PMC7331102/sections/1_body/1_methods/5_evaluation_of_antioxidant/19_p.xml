 <italic>In vitro</italic> anti-arthritic activity of extracts was done using a standard protocol, assessing the percentage inhibition of protein denaturation. The experiment was carried out by taking sodium diclofenac (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan) as the standard. Absorbance was measured at 416 nm. The experimental measurement was performed in triplicate.
