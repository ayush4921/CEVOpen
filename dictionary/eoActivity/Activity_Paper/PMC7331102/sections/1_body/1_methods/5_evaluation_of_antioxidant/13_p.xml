 </sup> A total of 500 mg of fresh leaves was crushed in 2 ml extraction medium containing HCl (Merck, India), sorbitol (Himedia-MB066, India) and NaCl. In the test cuvette, 2.5 ml phosphate buffer was mixed with 0.3 ml of catechol (Loba Chemie, UN281, India) solution. The spectrophotometer was set at 495 nm. Next, 0.2 ml of extract was added, and the change in absorbance was recorded every 30 seconds up to 5 min. PPO activity was expressed as a change in absorbance at 495 nm per minute/g fresh weight
