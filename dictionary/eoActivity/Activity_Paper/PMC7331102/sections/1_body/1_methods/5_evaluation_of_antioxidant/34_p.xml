<p>A healthy male Wister rat (160 g) was deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) followed by thoracotomy. Terminal cardiac puncture was made in ventricle using an appropriate sterile needle and blood drawn slowly and collected in PBS-EDTA solution, diluted by 1X PBS in 1:1 ratio and laid on Histopaque-1077 (HiMedia, India), a density gradient cell separation medium of ficoll and sodium diatrizoate was fixed and adjusted with a density of 1.077 g/ml, an equal volume of media and diluted blood. This Histopaque overlaid with diluted blood was centrifuged at 300g at 25Â°C for 30 mins. The RBCs were a thick red precipitate at the bottom of centrifuge tube, whereas the blood PBMC were found at the interface of Histopaque and the top layer of serum. PBMCs from the interphase were collected, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM media and this placed in Neubauer Improved Chamber (Marienfeld, Germany) and observed under Microscope Nikon Eclipse TS 100 (Nikon Corporation, Japan) to measure cell concentration.</p>
