<p>The present study demonstrated the inhibitory effects of RAP on the animal model of inflammation. Here, we showed that RAP significantly restores the biochemical enzymes, antioxidant defense, reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF) levels, and restores liver and brain injuries triggered by LPS. Moreover, the histopathological interpretations showed that LPS induced hepatic and brain injuries were greatly improved by RAP pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner. The present results suggest that RAP provides protection against inflammation-induced tissue and organ injury via regulating oxidative and inflammatory responses. RAP could be used to inhibit or diminish LPS induced inflammatory injury.</p>
