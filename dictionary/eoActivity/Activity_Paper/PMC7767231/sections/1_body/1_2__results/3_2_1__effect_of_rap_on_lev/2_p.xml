<p>Conversely, pretreatment of RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly (

These results suggest that RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) ameliorates the upregulation of cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, and RAP exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the plasma VEGF decreases with all doses by RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg), respectively (
