<p>There were no architectural alterations in liver histology in sections of the liver from normal rats. LPS treated rats, however, showed cell infiltration, necrosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and severe congestion of the central vein, while 100 and 200 mg of RAP/kg suppresses these LPS induced histopathological changes (

Pyknotic nuclei (darkly stained punctate nuclei) and altered vacuolated morphology were observed in the LPS group. RAP treatments (100 and 200 mg/kg) have successfully reduced the injury and restored the normal brain architecture (
