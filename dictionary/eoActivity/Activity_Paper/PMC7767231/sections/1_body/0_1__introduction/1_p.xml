<p>Inflammation is a natural defense response against infection, toxin exposure or tissue injury [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sepsis has a high mortality rate and is characterized by systemic inflammatory characteristics and organ dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The occurrence of tissue injuries and organ dysfunction is critical in inflammation, hypotension, and hypoxia. A large number of agents such as eicosanoids, vasoactive oxide, and endothelins are released in sepsis, which causes vascular tone and permeability disruption [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Plasma leakage into the interstitial components causes edema and hypotension, negatively affecting the respiratory system and oxygenation of tissues [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Inflammation has become a predictable risk factor for epithelial-derived malignancies [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Inflammation can be triggered by autoimmune diseases, infections, tumors or any other pathological conditions that cause the body’s inflammatory cell infiltrations in the body [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Infiltrating cells include neutrophils, T cells, B cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and natural killing cells that excrete large quantities of inflammatory cytokines into the body. These include TNF, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The cytokine balance controls the production of numerous biologically active intermediaries, which may further modify the amount of distant organ dysfunction in septic shock [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. VEGF has been highly potent and promotes the dose-dependent dilation of vessels than histamine which induces vascular permeability [
