 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> polysaccharides (RAP) are mainly derived from burans or gurans with potent antioxidant activities [

 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> (family Ericaceae) is an evergreen shrub with a showy display of bright red flowers. It is found at altitudes as low as 1200 m and as high as 3600 m, and leaves are glossy green [

 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> is known for its wide range and effectiveness in the treatment of eczema, diarrhea, menstrual disorders, choleretic, diuretic, antispasmodic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory [

 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> have a hepatoprotective function [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The existence of alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins has been demonstrated by phytochemical testing of 
 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this research, it will be investigated by means of an animal model of the therapeutic effect of RAP both in systemic inflammation and on early biomarkers. In particular, we hypothesized the capacity for systemic inflammation reduction and enhances animal survival. In the present study, we also investigated the production level biochemical, oxidative, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are described to be crucial and responsible for the inflammatory response causing systemic inflammation.
