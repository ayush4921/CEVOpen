<p>Colorimetric methods were applied for the evaluation of biochemical parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin (BIL), creatine kinase (CK), creatine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and albumin (Human Diagnostic Worldwide; Wiesbaden, Germany). Antioxidant enzyme indices were measured in plasma, brain, and liver. The liver and brain tissues were collected and homogenized based on the requirements for superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and catalase (CAT) kits and were determined according to the manufacturer guidelines.</p>
