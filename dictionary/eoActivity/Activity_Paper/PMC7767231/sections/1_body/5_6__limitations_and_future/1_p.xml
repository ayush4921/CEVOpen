 <italic>Rhododendron arboreum</italic> possess good quantities of flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds and polysaccharides. The present study determined the total phenolics (TPC) as well as total flavonoid contents (TFC) but these values were found to be very insignificant (TPC &lt; 10 mg GAE/g of extract and TFC &lt; 20 mg RE/g of extract) and hence were not reported. This decline in TFC and TPC content may be due to the climatic change or habitat of the plant. Very low proportions of TFC and TPC support the results indicating polysaccharides as most abundant phytoconstituents present in the extract. Moreover, the polysaccharides from 
 <italic>R. arboreum</italic> have already been proved for their anti-inflammatory potential. Polysaccharide research poses a range of obstacles which must be addressed. Current research on polysaccharides will solve the ambiguities related to their therapeutic effectiveness and clinical trials. To fill this knowledge gap, the medicinal value of polysaccharides for inflammatory diseases have been presented to determine the popularity and usage. As per our knowledge this is the first report on role of RAP in ameliorate pathogen induced inflammatory disorder. Moreover, reliable and cost-effective methods for modifying, processing and full identification of the ingredients of the extracts will further provide the actual insights about the compounds responsible for biological activity, and a substantial area of research has therefore yet to be explored.
