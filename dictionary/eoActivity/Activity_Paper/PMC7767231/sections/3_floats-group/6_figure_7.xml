  <p>Effect of RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) on histological alterations in the brain of LPS-induced systemic inflammation. There is a severe loss of intact cells in the cortical region of the brain. LPS group shows more vacuolated and edematous tissue in comparison to the normal control group. RAP administration has shown a decrease in neuronal loss. The normal control group has shown the normal morphology of the cortical region.</p>
