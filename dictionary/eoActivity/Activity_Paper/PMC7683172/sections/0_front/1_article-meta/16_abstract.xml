  <title>Background</title>
  <p> One of the most dangerous Plasmodium species is 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Hence, it causes a higher rate of mortality. The resistance of 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> to the ACT (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies) has led to the search for new antimalarial drugs. The purpose of this research was to assess the 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> antiplasmodial activity of 
   <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic> ethyl acetate extract to provide a scientific basis for the use of this medicinal plant to treat malaria.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic> stem bark powder was macerated in ethyl acetate to obtain the extract. The extract liquid filtrate was concentrated, evaporated and dry using a Rotavapor. The Peter and Rane test were used for the suppressive and curative antiplasmodial activities at different doses (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg). A positive and negative control groups were administered chloroquine (5 mg/kg) and 10% hypromelose, respectively. To assess the parasitemia of the mice a thin blood smear was made.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> The ethyl acetate extract completely (100%) inhibited the development of 
   <italic>P. berghei</italic> in the suppressive test at the dose of 500 mg/kg while that of the curative test was inhibited at 95%. The extract-treated group (500 mg/kg) and (Chloroquine (5 mg/kg) group all survived. The negative control group recorded a 100% mortality rate.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> The present study provides scientific confirmation on the use of 
   <italic>E. cylindricum</italic> stem bark as an antiplasmodial remedy. However, the identification of the mode of action and the purification of the active compounds are necessary for further studies.
