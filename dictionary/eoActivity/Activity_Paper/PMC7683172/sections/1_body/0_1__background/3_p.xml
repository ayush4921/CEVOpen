 <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic> belonging to the family Meliaceae is a medicinal plant traditionally used in the Centre Region of Cameroon to treat malaria, yellow fever, bacterial infections like typhoid fever, diarrhea and symptoms like stomach-ache. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the stem bark of 
 <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic> Sprague carried out by Kouam et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reveals the presence of four acyclic triterpene derivatives named sapelenins G–J (1–4), along with eight known compounds, sapelenins A–D, ekeberin D2 (5), (+)-catechin and epicatechin, and anderolide G. One of the most promising sources of compounds with antiplasmodial properties has been studied in the plant family Meliaceae. Some species belonging to this family (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica, Entandrophragma angolense, Entandrophragma candollei, Entandrophragma utile, Khaya grandifoliola</italic>) are commonly used as antimalarial agents [
