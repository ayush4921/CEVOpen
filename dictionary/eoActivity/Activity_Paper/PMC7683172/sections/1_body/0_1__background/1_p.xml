<p>Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa called Plasmodium which is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female anopheles mosquito. One of the main public health problems in developing countries is malaria. According to the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], in 2017, they were an estimate of 251 million cases of malaria as compared to 231 million cases in 2010. Cameroon with 71% of the total population living in high transmission areas and 4500 deaths recorded annually is one of the most affected countries in Africa [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the major drugs for malaria treatment [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Plasmodium exacerbates the situation further; posing a major obstacle to successful chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy of the disease [
