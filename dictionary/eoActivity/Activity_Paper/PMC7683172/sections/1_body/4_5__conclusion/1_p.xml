<p>The resistance of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to chloroquine is now a major health problem in some African countries. The results provide scientific data that, the extract of 
 <italic>E. cylindricum</italic> may contain antimalarial active compounds hence justifies their use as antimalarial agents in Cameroon. The development of phytopharmaceutical products could be of relevance for the protection of risk groups, in areas with such high levels of resistance. Therefore, it would be interesting if the active principle is isolated, identified, and characterized.
