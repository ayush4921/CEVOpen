<p>As a preliminary phase to look for compounds that potentially have antiplasmodial activity, phytochemical screening was performed. The phytochemical screening reveals the presence of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, flavonoids, Saponines, Terpenoids and Tannins,) except steroids. The antiplasmodial activity of this plant may be due to these secondary metabolites in the plant extract. It has been found that certain alkaloids possess antimalarial properties. A key example is the isolation of quinine from the Cinchona species. Their antiplasmodial activity may be through the inhibition and detoxification of heame in red blood cells [
