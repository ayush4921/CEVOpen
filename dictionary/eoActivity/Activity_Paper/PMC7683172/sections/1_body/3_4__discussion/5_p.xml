 <sup>th</sup> of the curative test, the crude extract did not completely inhibit the parasite even though we had a suppressive effect. Akuodor

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] obtained similar results. These authors showed that parasites are less vulnerable to the suppressive test than to the curative test when they assess 
 <italic>Bombax buonopozense</italic> root bark aqueous extract in mice infected by 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. This difference in inhibition may be because the treatment was administered 1 h (suppressive test) and 72 h (curative test) after infection. It is evident that
