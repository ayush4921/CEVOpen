<p>During the first 10 years of operation of the EU‐IMP, a total of 78 incidents were reviewed by the IRN. A teleconference was organized by the EMA to discuss each new incident and, if applicable, follow‐up information on a known issue. While for the majority of incidents a single IRN teleconference was sufficient, 13 of them (8 safety and 5 quality), due to their complexity, as well as the need to gather further evidence, needed more than one iteration. This led to a total of 106 teleconferences organized for the 78 incidents.</p>
