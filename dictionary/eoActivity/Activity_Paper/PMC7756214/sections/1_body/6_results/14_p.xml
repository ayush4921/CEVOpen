<p>A communication strategy was recommended for the vast majority of incidents, at the time of the initial and/or follow‐up teleconference, as applicable. When the total number of IRN teleconferences is taken into consideration, that is, 106 teleconferences for 78 incidents, one or multiple communication approaches were considered necessary in 80 cases (75%), while only in 36 instances (25%), no immediate communication was warranted. Depending on public health needs, one or more options were implemented, with the most frequent being LTTs and press releases (see Figure 
 <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). LTTs and public communication materials were shared within the network prior to publication through the so‐called “Early Notification System,” a system set up to coordinate communication actions on critical issues across the EU and to support consistency of the message to the public.
