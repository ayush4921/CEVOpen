<p>Through the cooperation of NCAs, the EC and the EMA, the EU‐IMP supports the Network in fulfilling its mission to protect public health by ensuring that medicines on the EU market are safe, effective, of high quality and by advising on the necessary actions, when issues arise that might have a serious impact on public health. While recognizing the prerogative of MSs to take the actions they deem appropriate in their territory, the EU‐IMP offers a platform to coordinate actions and communication at EU‐level, to rapidly pool expertise, as well as to minimize duplications.</p>
