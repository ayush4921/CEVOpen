<p>Among the many significant safety examples, one was the notification from the Paul‐Ehrlich‐Institut of cases of possible immune‐related encephalitis in association with daclizumab, a medicine used to treat adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. An IRN meeting was promptly convened and after consideration of the evidence available at that point in time, it was concluded that the issue could be handled through an Article 20 referral procedure triggered by the EC and that product withdrawal should be urgently considered within that procedure (routine measure). As a provisional measure, the marketing authorization of daclizumab was suspended within 2 weeks of the initial notification, in line with the legal mandate of the PRAC, while a formal review via a referral procedure was ongoing and a press release was issued to inform the public.

 </xref> This temporary measure was taken after weighing the evidence available at that point in time against the seriousness of the potential issue. It was also agreed to prepare LTTs, to ask the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) whether other relevant cases were observed in clinical trials, and to inform international partners. As a result of the high level of cooperation and information sharing among all the concerned stakeholders, and after carefully assessing all the available evidence, the PRAC was in a position to finally conclude within three‐months that the risk with the product outweighed the benefit.
