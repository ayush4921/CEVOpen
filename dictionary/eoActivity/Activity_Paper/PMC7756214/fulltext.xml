By supporting the development of new medicines and granting marketing authorizations, Regulatory Authorities (RAs) enable the availability of new therapeutic options to respond to unmet medical needs.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> RAs are responsible for protecting public health by monitoring that the above requirements are met throughout the entire lifecycle of a medicinal product and by taking the necessary actions, when this is no longer the case.</p><p>Medicines are authorized mainly based on the supportive data coming from clinical trials that are typically of limited duration and sample size, exclude the most severely ill patients, and limit the number of comedications.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> Those controlled conditions significantly differ from the ones encountered in real life and may consequently hamper the possibility of identifying in the pre&#x02010;authorization period important serious adverse drug reactions. For instance, rare, delayed reactions or those that occur due to an interaction with other medicinal products or comorbidities might only emerge after a medicine is released on the market, when the exposure is significantly larger, for a longer duration and in less ideal settings.</p><p>Even in cases where a medicinal product has been authorized for many years, some new information might emerge at some point that may warrant to recall that medicine because it ceases to satisfy the quality requirements, as a result of, for example, unexpected identification of impurities, with possible consequent shortage of supply.</p><p>In the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Union (EU) Regulatory Network (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;the Network&#x0201d;) is composed of the RAs in the Member States (MSs) (hereafter referred to as National Competent Authorities [NCAs]), the European Commission (EC), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The continuous collaboration among those partners ensures that individual efforts are coordinated and concerted toward the common goal of protecting public health, through an approach underpinned by the existence of clear roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The EC is the competent authority for centrally authorized products (CAPs), while NCAs are the competent authorities for nationally authorized products (NAPs). The EU regulatory model foresees that while NCAs retain responsibility for medicinal products authorized on their territory, the EMA provides coordination to support the scientific evaluation, supervision, and safety monitoring of all medicines on the EU market.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>In order to enable the network to rapidly and effectively manage incidents along the lifecycle of CAPs, the EMA established a crisis management plan in 1997.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Taking into account the experience gained with CAPs, as well as the need to have a more encompassing and coordinated approach in the EU, the initial plan was revised and widened in scope to include medicines authorized in the EU through any procedure. Additionally, the membership was revised to include a wider expertise and, in order to formalize the process, a module was created in the European Pharmacovigilance Issues Tracking Tool (EPITT)<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> to track the EU&#x02010;IMP steps and support rapid communication on incidents between MSs and the EMA. Arising from these, the EU Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan (EU&#x02010;IMP) was set up in 2009.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> The EU&#x02010;IMP is coordinated by the EMA and can be triggered by any member of the Network.</p><p>An incident is defined as an event or new information regarding one or more medicine(s) authorized in the EU, which could have a serious impact on public health.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> This may include events that affect the known safety, quality, efficacy, or availability of the medicinal product, due to for example, manufacturing compliance or other supply chain issues. While some events initially might not seem to have major consequences on public health, they may trigger media attention and patients' concerns, and subsequently negatively impact on the use of a medicine.</p><p>Incidents are managed through &#x0201c;routine&#x0201d; measures, that is, those that are already established and immediately applicable, such as (1) pharmacovigilance and quality/manufacturing monitoring tools, for example, carrying out of inspections (2) regulatory tools enabling action, for example, variation, suspension, or revocation of the marketing authorization, and (3) communications aimed at patients and healthcare professionals, for example, press release, questions and answers (Q&#x00026;A) documents, Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC), and so on.</p><p>The EU&#x02010;IMP is therefore fully in line with the WHO manual for the assessment of pharmacovigilance systems,<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> that identifies crisis management and communication as two of the minimum requirements of functional pharmacovigilance systems. Through communication, the work of RAs in assessing and supervising medicinal products throughout their life cycle becomes visible to the public.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>The decision on the appropriate measure is informed by consideration of the impact, the level of urgency of the incident, as well as evidence coming from various sources. For instance, the results of a study conducted within the SCOPE initiative have shown that EU Health Care Professionals have high awareness of DHPCs.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>If routine measures are not considered sufficient to address the public health concern, due to its potential impact and/or urgency, an incident can be upgraded to a crisis. This has not been necessary for the 78 incidents that have been dealt with by the EU&#x02010;IMP during the period of observation of this study.</p><p>Acknowledging that no previous publication is available in the scientific literature, the main objective of this descriptive analysis is to provide a comprehensive overview of the experience during the first 10&#x02009;years of operation of the EU&#x02010;IMP, including concrete examples, as well as to support future research aimed at analyzing the system and its performance.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0008"><label>2</label><title>PRINCIPLES OF THE <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">EU&#x02010;IMP</styled-content>
</title><p>In line with the provisions of EU legislation, the modus operandi of the EU&#x02010;IMP is based on achieving an appropriate balance between the prerogative of NCAs to take the pre&#x02010;emptive actions they deem appropriate for their territory (eg, suspend a product, trigger the EU referral mechanisms,<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> and so on), and the need for coordination at EU level.</p><p>Clear roles, responsibilities, and established mechanisms to bring together expertise from the entire Network and share information are crucial to minimize the potential for duplication and perhaps divergent actions, shorten the time needed for decision making, and deliver a consistent message for the EU public, while effectively responding to the public health concern.</p><p>Flexibility is a key factor in managing very different issues that may range from safety to quality, efficacy, or a combination thereof, and may concern one or more medicinal products (eg, product class issues, products manufactured at the same facility) authorized through different procedures.</p><p>The approach followed by the EU&#x02010;IMP builds on the realization that public health issues benefit from a common methodology with the objective to ensure that outcomes are proportional to the public health concern, based on robust evidence and supported by an agreed approach for informing stakeholders. Many factors contribute to the achievement of this and the associated decision making, including the estimation of the public health impact of the issue, the identification of knowledge gaps and the appropriate regulatory framework to address these and the definition of the communication strategy.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0009"><label>3</label><title>EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS</title><p>The EU&#x02010;IMP may be triggered after new information on a public health concern is received from any source, but more frequently EU NCAs, non&#x02010;EU RAs, Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs), the Press, and so on. This may include new data shared with regulators, publications in scientific journals, actions taken by a non&#x02010;EU RA, and so on.</p><p>Two instruments have been devised in the EU to facilitate exchange of information relating to serious safety and quality issues. These are EPITT and the rapid alert notification procedure aimed at members of the Rapid Alert Network.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Through EPITT, MSs and the EMA exchange safety information on (1) concerns with potential major impact on the known risk&#x02010;benefit balance of a medicine, possibly warranting prompt regulatory action and communication (in the form of Rapid Alerts) or (2) other less urgent concerns (in the form of Non&#x02010;Urgent Information).</p><p>Through the Rapid Alert Network procedure, MSs, EMA, the EC, and other relevant partners (eg, international organizations and non&#x02010;EU RAs) exchange quality information mainly on recalls of medicinal products, due to quality defects or falsification that may result in illness, suboptimal or inappropriate treatment, or threat to life.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0010"><label>4</label><title>HOW THE <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">EU&#x02010;IMP</styled-content> WORKS</title><p>The EU&#x02010;IMP facilitates the interaction between the incident management structures set up at EU&#x02010;level and those established at national level.</p><p>The EU&#x02010;IMP has a proactive and a reactive component. The proactive component has the objectives of: (1) continuously scanning the horizon and monitoring various sources of information (eg, newly published data, communications from other RAs, signals from safety databases, and so on) on incidents impacting medicinal products, (2) reviewing their public health impact, and (3) recommending the necessary routine measures to remedy the situation.</p><p>When a serious concern for a medicinal product with the potential of leading to major risks for public health is identified, the Incident Review Network (IRN) is involved within the shortest possible time. After reviewing the information available on a particular incident, the IRN Chair (or back&#x02010;up) takes the decision on whether an IRN is needed. This is normally the case when discussion within the Network is needed as to the most appropriate assessment pathway for the issue and there is need for coordination at EU level in terms of actions and communication. The IRN then convenes by teleconference and is chaired by the EMA. It has a core of about 20 members (from the EMA, its scientific committees, EC and NCAs) with multidisciplinary expertise covering risk management, risk communication, regulatory affairs and pharmacovigilance (Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Additional members may be invited ad&#x02010;hoc to participate, based on the specific expertise required. For example in case of quality and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) issues, participation from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM),<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> the network of official medicines control laboratories (OMCL),<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> and so on may be required. The Chairs of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) and the co&#x02010;ordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures&#x02014;human (CMDh) are also invited, as applicable, to link the IRN and the scientific committees, which may subsequently be called on to conduct a detailed scientific assessment. This ensures that the right expertise and leadership are available to rapidly provide perspective and direction on how to best address an incident.</p><fig fig-type="FIGURE" xml:lang="en" id="pds5133-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Composition of the IRN.

<sup>11</sup>
</xref> is a review procedure used to resolve issues such as concerns over the safety, or risk benefit balance of a medicine (or class of medicines). During a referral, the EMA, through its scientific committees and/or the CMDh, conducts a thorough scientific assessment on the issue and makes a recommendation on behalf of the EU. For most of referrals, the EC issues a decision to all MSs to reflect the measures to take to implement the recommendation.</p><p>A signal procedure is the framework through which the PRAC assesses information and makes a recommendation on a new or known adverse event that may be caused by a medicine authorized in the EU and requires further investigation.</p><p>Some communication measures, for example, Lines&#x02010;to&#x02010;Take (LTTs) are not public but are documents that are prepared by the agency and disseminated to the network to assist its staff in responding with a consistent message to possible media and public queries on issues of high public health interest.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>

In this scenario, the IRN Chair may ask a lead party (Rapporteur for CAPs or appointed EU MS for NAPs) to prepare within a defined timeframe a Preliminary Risk Analysis, with the objective to elaborate on the risk and on the options available to handle (from an operational point of view) the incident.

</xref> The exercise confirmed the capability of the EU&#x02010;IMP to handle crisis situations. Additionally, the experience gained over these years has provided opportunities for improvement in several areas including process streamlining, communication, interactions, composition, success factors, and technical considerations. These have been translated into subsequent system enhancements with for example the inclusion in the IRN of a larger expertise (risk management, communication, quality), the increased duration of the IRN mandate, technical upgrades to allow recording of the IRN meetings and storing of audio material, and clarification of practicalities concerning the preliminary risk analysis (who drafts it, expected timelines, etc.), in case an incident risks escalating into a crisis.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0011"><label>5</label><title>METHODS FOR A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF 10&#x02010;YEARS' EXPERIENCE</title><p>All EU&#x02010;IMPs are tracked in EPITT and receive an identifier when the first IRN teleconference is held for the issue.

A teleconference was organized by the EMA to discuss each new incident and, if applicable, follow&#x02010;up information on a known issue. While for the majority of incidents a single IRN teleconference was sufficient, 13 of them (8 safety and 5 quality), due to their complexity, as well as the need to gather further evidence, needed more than one iteration. This led to a total of 106 teleconferences organized for the 78 incidents.</p><p>Examples of complex issues include the identification of shortcomings in the quality management system (in relation to the aseptic filling process) of Ben Venue Laboratories (manufacturer of a large number of CAPs and NAPs<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">

For instance, whenever an issue discussed at IRN is deemed to be of relevance internationally, the outcomes of the discussion, together with relevant documents are promptly shared with international regulators with whom confidentiality agreements are in place. For issues of major public health impact new ad&#x02010;hoc confidentiality agreements and collaborations may be set&#x02010;up, as has happened for example, in response to the nitrosamine contamination. Additionally, strategic partnerships across the regions, usually referred to as &#x0201c;clusters,&#x0201d; have been established, with experts from the EMA and other RAs who meet periodically via teleconference.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>An IRN teleconference was organized on the same or the day after the initial notification in 42% of the cases. For the remaining 58% of the cases, more information was needed prior to organizing an IRN teleconference. IRN recommendations have always been implemented within the shortest possible delay. For instance, when the IRN recommended that the issue should be addressed via a signal procedure, this was commenced at the following planned PRAC meeting, which happened within 1 month from the concerned IRN. When the IRN recommended to issue a stand&#x02010;alone press release, this was published within 1 week of the date of the IRN, but most commonly within 2&#x02009;days.</p><p>During the observation period (see Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), most of the issues dealt with related to safety (44, 56%), quality (27, 35%), or a combination thereof (4, 5%).</p><fig fig-type="FIGURE" xml:lang="en" id="pds5133-fig-0006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Categorization of issues.

</p><p>Due to the intrinsic nature and unpredictability of incidents, the number of initial notifications varied significantly across the different years of observation, with a peak of 15 in 2011 and a low of 1 in 2019 (for which only 8 months fall in the reporting period). Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> displays the number of initial notifications that were received per year.</p><fig fig-type="FIGURE" xml:lang="en" id="pds5133-fig-0007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Number of initial notifications per year [Colour figure can be viewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com">wileyonlinelibrary.com</ext-link>]</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-13" xlink:href="PDS-29-1343-g007"/></fig><fig fig-type="FIGURE" xml:lang="en" id="pds5133-fig-0008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Main types of communication approaches recommended at the IRN teleconference.

Considering that the decrease in notifications concerning safety issues was the major contributor to the drop in the overall number of initial notifications after 2012, it may be argued that the implementation of the revised pharmacovigilance legislation in 2012 introduced clear roles and responsibilities and offered robust regulatory tools to manage most of the incidents without recourse to the IRN mechanism.</p><p>Incidents occurred with NAPs and CAPs at comparable frequencies: 30 (38%) with NAPs; 26 (34%) with CAPs; and 22 (28%) with a combination of both.</p><p>The IRN recommended to trigger a referral in almost half of the total number of incidents, that is, in 37 (47%) cases, while other assessment pathways (see Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were advised in 41 (53%) cases. The legal bases underpinning the triggering of the referral procedures were different articles of the EU legislation, depending on the type of underlying issue, mainly Articles 31 (10, 13%) and 107/107i (10, 13%) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Articles 20 (7, 9%) and 5(3) (4, 5%) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, or various combinations thereof. Article 31 or 20 is invoked in case of safety, quality, or efficacy issues, when the concerned products include at least a NAP or exclusively CAPs, respectively. An article 107/107i procedure is triggered in case an urgent regulatory action is necessary due to a safety concern with an authorized medicinal product, while article 5(3) is invoked when an opinion on a scientific matter related to the evaluation of medicines for human use is sought from the CHMP.</p><p>A communication strategy was recommended for the vast majority of incidents, at the time of the initial and/or follow&#x02010;up teleconference, as applicable. When the total number of IRN teleconferences is taken into consideration, that is, 106 teleconferences for 78 incidents, one or multiple communication approaches were considered necessary in 80 cases (75%), while only in 36 instances (25%), no immediate communication was warranted. Depending on public health needs, one or more options were implemented, with the most frequent being LTTs and press releases (see Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). LTTs and public communication materials were shared within the network prior to publication through the so&#x02010;called &#x0201c;Early Notification System,&#x0201d; a system set up to coordinate communication actions on critical issues across the EU and to support consistency of the message to the public.</p><p>The final outcomes of the incidents managed through the EU&#x02010;IMP differed significantly, depending on the nature of the issue and the robustness of the evidence. They ranged from maintenance of the unaltered marketing authorization (22% of cases) to its variation (46% of cases), through to its suspension (10% of cases) or revocation (9% of cases) (see Figure <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).

</title><p>The IRN has supported the network while dealing with several important incidents. A number of examples in some more detail are provided to illustrate the proactive work of the EU&#x02010;IMP and its interface with the existent regulatory framework.</p><p>Among the many significant safety examples, one was the notification from the Paul&#x02010;Ehrlich&#x02010;Institut of cases of possible immune&#x02010;related encephalitis in association with daclizumab, a medicine used to treat adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. An IRN meeting was promptly convened and after consideration of the evidence available at that point in time, it was concluded that the issue could be handled through an Article 20 referral procedure triggered by the EC and that product withdrawal should be urgently considered within that procedure (routine measure). As a provisional measure, the marketing authorization of daclizumab was suspended within 2&#x02009;weeks of the initial notification, in line with the legal mandate of the PRAC, while a formal review via a referral procedure was ongoing and a press release was issued to inform the public.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> This temporary measure was taken after weighing the evidence available at that point in time against the seriousness of the potential issue. It was also agreed to prepare LTTs, to ask the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) whether other relevant cases were observed in clinical trials, and to inform international partners. As a result of the high level of cooperation and information sharing among all the concerned stakeholders, and after carefully assessing all the available evidence, the PRAC was in a position to finally conclude within three&#x02010;months that the risk with the product outweighed the benefit.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> Meanwhile, the MAH had taken the decision to voluntarily withdraw the marketing authorization for this product.</p><p>A second safety example concerns the notification of the MAH's intention to terminate several ongoing clinical trials with idelalisib, a cancer medicine used to treat adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or follicular lymphoma, due to increased risk of serious respiratory infections and associated deaths observed in three studies. Two IRN teleconferences were held in the days following the initial notification to agree that the issue could be handled via routine measures, specifically the prompt initiation (by the EC) of an Article 20 referral procedure. Through the IRN, the information gaps were identified, the available evidence was shared with international RAs, the relevance of the issue (observed in off&#x02010;label use) to the on&#x02010;label use was discussed, and engagement with the MAH on interim measures and proposed actions was initiated. The IRN agreed that the CTFG was to be consulted on the draft DHPC, LTTs had to be drafted and a press release<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> issued. After giving due to consideration to the seriousness of the potential issue, as well as the incomplete evidence available, the PRAC resolved to adopt (within 1 week of the initial notification) a temporary measure (restriction of the indication in previously untreated patients with CLL and a certain genotype) and a DHPC.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> Four months later, after reviewing the complete dataset, consulting the relevant expertise within the referral procedure, and taking into consideration the absence of alternative suitable treatments, the PRAC recommended that the temporary restriction should be lifted. However, in order to better protect patients, risk minimization measures were strengthened. Warnings were added to the product information to request that treatment is not started in cases where there are ongoing systemic infections, and that effective monitoring of these and adequate prophylaxis specifically for <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (during treatment and up to 6 months after interruption) is in place.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">
<sup>26</sup>

</p><p>The IRN has also dealt with numerous important quality issues. Shortly after the initial notification of potential genotoxic impurities (N&#x02010;nitrosamines) in valsartan containing products (used to treat hypertension), an IRN teleconference was convened. Considering that the impurity was due to the route of synthesis and cross&#x02010;contamination, the IRN discussed that the issue could also be relevant for products containing other sartans (provided they had a tetrazole ring). Therefore, the issue was judged to significantly impact public health (there were about 13&#x02009;000 sartan containing medicines on the EEA market) and likely to attract media interest. Due to its complexity, as well as the limited information initially available, several IRN teleconferences were needed to discuss the most appropriate routine measures to handle the issue. These included recommendations for harmonized market actions (batch quarantines and recalls), initiation of an Article 31 referral procedure,<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> development of harmonized LTTs and issuing of press releases.<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref> Other actions included sampling and testing proposals for the EDQM and the OMCL network, and working with international partners toward an harmonized approach to the assessment, inspections, and communication. The evaluation resulted in a recommendation for MAHs to review their manufacturing processes, introduce rigorous testing regimens, and ensure that sartan medicines currently on the EU market would only contain levels of those impurities below agreed safe thresholds, and that by 2021 no quantifiable levels of those impurities should be present in sartan products.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0014"><label>8</label><title>MAIN LIMITATIONS AND PERSPECTIVE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</title><p>As this analysis is descriptive in nature, with the main objective to summarize the experience in the first 10&#x02009;years of operation of the EU&#x02010;IMP, there was no comparator arm, nor any attempt to measure the effectiveness of the individual regulatory interventions<xref rid="pds5133-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">

In so doing, it has reduced the number of ad&#x02010;hoc IRN meetings needed, thus making use of the already existing regulatory options and increasing the overall efficiency of the Network.</p><p>Through the cooperation of NCAs, the EC and the EMA, the EU&#x02010;IMP supports the Network in fulfilling its mission to protect public health by ensuring that medicines on the EU market are safe, effective, of high quality and by advising on the necessary actions, when issues arise that might have a serious impact on public health. While recognizing the prerogative of MSs to take the actions they deem appropriate in their territory, the EU&#x02010;IMP offers a platform to coordinate actions and communication at EU&#x02010;level, to rapidly pool expertise, as well as to minimize duplications.</p><p>During the first 10&#x02009;years of operation, the EU&#x02010;IMP has been progressively strengthened with the introduction of enhancements needed to ensure that it can continue fulfilling its mission, while coping with ever complex and new health challenges.</p><p>This descriptive analysis aims to document the foundations of the EU&#x02010;IMP. In so doing, it should support further research aimed at specifically appraising the performance of the system and benchmarking it against the approach followed in different jurisdictions to drive future enhancements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="pds5133-sec-0018"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="pds5133-sec-0006"><title>DISCLAIMER</title><p>The views expressed in this article are the personal views of the authors and may not be understood or quoted as being made on the behalf of or reflecting the position of the European Medicines Agency, one of its committees or working parties, or any regulatory agency or organization with which the authors are affiliated.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="pds5133-sec-0016"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Georgy Genov and Morgane De Verdiere for their critical review and Radoslav Zhelev and Loris Piccolo for their contribution to the graphics.</p></ack><ref-list id="pds5133-bibl-0001" content-type="cited-references"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="pds5133-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="pds5133-cit-0001">
