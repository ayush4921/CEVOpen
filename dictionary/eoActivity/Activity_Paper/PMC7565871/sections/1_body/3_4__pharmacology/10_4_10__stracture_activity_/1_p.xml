<p>Currently, isolated natural products capture a lot of attention for ‘lead compound’ selection in the primary stage of drug discovery, where the SAR analysis plays a vital role in describing the structural configuration connected with biological activity and potential mechanisms of action [

 <italic>H. pubescens</italic>, the most common steroidal-alkaloid class of phytoconstituents; conarrhimine, conessimine, conessine, conimine and isoconnessine was reported to have multiple and dose-dependent biological activities. Structurally, the above-mentioned five compounds are derived from the “conanine” moiety: a chemical structure containing an extra pyrrolidine or tetrahydropyrrole group to the steroid moiety. For example, all five analogues showed acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/neuroprotective activity within an IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 4 ± 0.1 to &gt; 300 (μM) in vitro [
 <xref rid="B129-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The SAR revealed that the attachment of a methyl group (-CH
 <sub>3</sub>) to the pyrrolidine (N-atom at the position C-19 of the alkaloid moiety), as well as adding a tetradecahydro-cyclopenta-phenanthrene ring (N-atom at position C-10 of the steroid moiety), influenced AChE inhibition (

 <xref rid="B129-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Conessimine was the most potent AChE inhibitor, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4 μM, where a double -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group is present on the steroid N-atom (at position C-10), but no -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group on the pyrrolidine N-atom (at position C-19). Similarly, the absence of -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group at the C-19 position in both conimine and conarrhimine and the presence of a single -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group/lack of -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group at C-10 vary the IC
 <sub>50</sub> between 23 to 28 μM. On the other hand, the presence of a -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group at C-19 in conessine and double -CH3 groups at C-10 yielded an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 21 μM, but the presence of a single -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group (elimination of one -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group) at position C-10 in isoconessimine, drastically lowered the AChE inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 300 μM).
