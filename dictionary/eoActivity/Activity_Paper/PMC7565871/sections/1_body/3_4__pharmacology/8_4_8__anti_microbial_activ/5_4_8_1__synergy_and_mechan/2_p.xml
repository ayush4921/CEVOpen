<p>Siriyong et al. [
 <xref rid="B137-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] investigated the efficacy of an 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> extract and conessine as resistance-modifying agents (RMAs) on the susceptibility of 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> to novobiocin and rifampicin. The authors observed significant synergistic activity: the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was â‰¤ 0.5. To investigate the mechanism of synergism, the authors used fluorescent dyes and different efflux pump inhibitors and concluded that neither the extract nor conessine act as permeabilizers [

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while there was no accumulation of ethidium bromide, suggesting the synergism was due to interference with the AdeIJK pump, but no involvement of the AdeABC pump [
