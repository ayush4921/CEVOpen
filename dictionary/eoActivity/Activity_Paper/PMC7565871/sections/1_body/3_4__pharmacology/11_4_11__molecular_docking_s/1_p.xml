<p>Molecular docking is another artificial intelligence-based computational method for finding potential biological activities of a natural product through binding energy/docking score calculations (kcal/mol) based on “target-ligand” docking complexes [
 <xref rid="B147-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Typically, the target is a macromolecule associated with the disease of interest, and the ligand is a therapeutic agent used to inhibit or activate the macromolecule and its pathways/function. A similar docking approach was also used by Cheenpracha et al., taking mokluangin A-C and antidysentericine as ligand, and the crystallographic structure of AChE reported from

Similarly, using information from previous studies, six different biological activities of conessine such as antibacterial, anti-CNS, antidiabetic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antimalarial were analyzed through a blind docking approach [

Based on the individual docking score (kcal/mol), conessine would be expected to exhibited more anti-CNS activity with docking score −11.18 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 1C2B), than anti-inflammatory activity with docking score −10.18 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 1F19), antibacterial activity with docking score −9.40 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 1HNJ), antifungal activity with docking score −9.38 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 6TZ6), antidiabetic activity with docking score −8.84 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 5NN4) and antimalaria activity with docking score −8.71 kcal/mol (PDB ID: 1LDG) (

Thus, a docking study may a cost-effective computational analysis to help understand different biological activities in the form of binding energy and possible molecular interaction-cum-mode of inhibition. Nowadays, molecular docking is also a useful tool in drug development to identify potential hit and better lead compounds, as well as insights into their mode of action [
