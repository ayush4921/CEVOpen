<p>In a study on alkaloids isolated from 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic>, five alkaloids were tested for CNS-stimulant activity i.e., conimine, isoconessimine, conessine, conarrhimine and conessimine. Conessimine showed the highest activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4 Î¼M. This study suggests that these alkaloids can be used for the treatment of neurological disorders [
