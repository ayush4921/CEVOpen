<p>Zahin et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] investigated the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> by the ferric thiocyanate (FTC) method, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method and DPPH radical scavenging method. Their results revealed a fair antioxidant effect using the FTC and TBA method, but a very low DPPH radical scavenging activity (20%). In another study conducted by Bhusal, [
 <xref rid="B113-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> bark was evaluated for antioxidant effects, whereby both methanol and ethanol extracts had strong DPPH inhibition activity (methanol extract 96% at 0.1 mg/mL), whereas the hexane extract appeared to have the weakest activity.
