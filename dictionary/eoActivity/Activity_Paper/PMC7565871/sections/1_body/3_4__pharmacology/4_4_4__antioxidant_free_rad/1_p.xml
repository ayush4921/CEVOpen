<p>The aqueous and methanol extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> show a very strong radical scavenging activity with 90% DPPH free radical inhibition. The methanol extract also significantly reduces hydroxyl - and superoxide ions. In addition, it also causes a reduction of Fe

 <sup>2+</sup> conversion. Another study reported that its application decreases the damage to deoxyribose by OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions. Similarly, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> degradation, nitrite inhibition and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by the ethyl acetate fraction [
