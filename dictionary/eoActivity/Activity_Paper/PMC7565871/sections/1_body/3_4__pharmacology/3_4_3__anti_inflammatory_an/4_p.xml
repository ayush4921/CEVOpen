<p>The methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> (100 and 200 mg/kg) suppressed the acetic acid-induced writhing response significantly in a dose-dependent manner. In the same study, the analgesic effect was also tested in the tail flick model. Fifteen min. after drug administration, there is a significant increase in reaction time compared to the pre-drug reaction time. The extract enhances the stress tolerance capacity in animal models. The analgesic effect is proposed to be mediated by the prostaglandin pathways [
