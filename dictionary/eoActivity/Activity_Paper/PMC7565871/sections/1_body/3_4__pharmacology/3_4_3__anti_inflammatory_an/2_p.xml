<p>Studies also suggest the anti-inflammatory efficacy of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> in a dose-dependent manner; a 400 mg/kg dose showed 74% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) inhibition when tested on carrageenan-induced rat paw edema [

 <xref rid="B121-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] the methanol, petroleum ether, chloroform, dichloromethane and aqueous extract of its stem was evaluated. The chloroform extract produced maximum analgesic effect with 71% abdominal writhing inhibition, 88.5% inhibition in the open field test and CNS-depressant activity with 83% inhibition in locomotion at a 200 mg/kg dose.
