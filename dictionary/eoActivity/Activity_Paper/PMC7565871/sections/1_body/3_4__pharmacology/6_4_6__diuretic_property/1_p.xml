<p>At a dose of 30â€“100 mg/kg in Wistar rats, the aqueous seed extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> was reported to increase urine output notably. A significant increase of excretion of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> ions was also observed. The chloroform extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens was</italic> also reported to cause a dose-dependent increase in urine output. In addition to this, an elevated level of urinary Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> was also observed, thus showing that increased electrolyte excretion is probably responsible for its diuretic effect [
