 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> has been demonstrated by different in vitro studies to have a wide range of medicinal properties, particularly anti-malarial, anti-mutagenic, anti-hypertensive, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, CNS-stimulant, diuretic, anti-amoebiasis, anti-urolithic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, gut-relaxant and anti-diabetic properties. Several bioactive chemical compounds have been isolated from this plant i.e., conimine, isoconessimine, conessine, conarrhimine and conessimine. In in vitro studies conessimine appeared to have considerable CNS-stimulant activity, as well as antibacterial effects. However, clinical trials on the therapeutic potential of this plant are limited and largely preliminary.
