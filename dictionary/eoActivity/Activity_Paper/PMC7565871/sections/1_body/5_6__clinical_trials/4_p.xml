<p>The same authors carried out another randomized clinical study in 43 patients with ulcerative colitis; “
 <italic>Kutaja Ghana vati</italic>” (
 <italic>H. pubescens,</italic> 1 g three times a day) helps in reducing the bowel movement frequency [
 <xref rid="B159-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Johari and Gandhi [
 <xref rid="B160-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] carried out a randomized single-blind parallel group study comparing a monoherbal formulation containing 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> extract with mesalamine in chronic ulcerative colitis patients, with special emphasis on side effects and relapse. The study supports the efficacy of the monoherbal formulation in resolving chronic ulcerative colitis, with fewer chances of relapse and side effects. However, the authors recommend that the study be used to conduct Phase II and III clinical trials with larger sample sizes. Recently, Kumari et al. [
 <xref rid="B161-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] studied the efficacy of 
 <italic>Kutaja</italic> syrup (
 <italic>H. pubescens)</italic> on 30 infants suffering from acute diarrhea. The trial drug was given to infants at a dose of 15 mg/kg, every 8 h for two days; the drug had a significant role in reducing signs and symptoms of diarrhea. However, the authors advised a randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size.
