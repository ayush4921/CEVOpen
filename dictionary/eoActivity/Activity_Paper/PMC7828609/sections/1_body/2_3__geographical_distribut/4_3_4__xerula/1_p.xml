<p>The type species of the genus, 
 <italic>Xerula pudens</italic> (often treated in the literature under its synonyms, 
 <italic>Xerula</italic> or 
 <italic>Oudemansiella longipes</italic>) has been reported first in Europe (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This species is connected to 
 <italic>Quercus</italic>, thus its distribution could theoretically cover the whole continent [
 <xref rid="B50-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It has also been reported in Thailand [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], but without details on the morphology, hence this record is highly dubious because 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> does not actually occur in that country. The first recorded Asian species are 
 <italic>Xerula sinopudens</italic> in Japan and 
 <italic>Xerula strigosa</italic> in China [
 <xref rid="B26-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Other species were documented in different countries, such as 
 <italic>X. australis</italic> (Australia), 
 <italic>X. fraudulenta</italic> (France), 
 <italic>X. oronga</italic> (D.R. Congo), 
 <italic>X. renati</italic> (Switzerland, as 
 <italic>Oudemansiella renati</italic>) and 
 <italic>X. setulosa</italic> (Jamaica, as 
 <italic>Gymnopus setulosus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B28-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The latter species was also documented in Brazil and Belize [
 <xref rid="B27-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Generally, the species are similar to 
 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic> in being saprobic, and their basidiomata are attached to rotten wood, which is often buried deep beneath leaf litter or soil [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
