<p>Among the many compounds isolated from the OX genera, only strobilurins have made it to the commercial market, but the natural products were too unstable in the field experiments and it was considered a great challenge to achieve the biotechnological production of the natural compounds in ton scale as generally required for agrochemical fungicides. The discovery of the strobilurins, however, allowed the opportunity to develop synthetic fungicides by mimetic synthesis because the natural core structure was relatively simple [
 <xref rid="B5-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first synthetic fungicide arising from mimetic synthesis using strobilurins as a template was published in 1996 [
 <xref rid="B134-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Natural strobilurins were named consecutively according to the order of discovery such as strobilurin A, B, and C. Applying Quantitative Structural Activity Relationship on the structures of the natural strobilurins, numerous companies were able to produce synthetic analogues, which are more effective in combating target organisms [

 <xref rid="B84-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] stated that there are eight synthetic strobilurins on the market worldwide, some of which are already registered for agro-chemical use. The key compounds are azoxystrobin (30), di-moxystrobin (31), fluoxastrobin (32), kresoxim-methyl (33), pyraclostrobin (34), picoxystrobin (35) and tri-floxystrobin (36) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The estimated worth of these synthetic compounds is $3.4 billion in 2015, making up to 25% of the fungicide market and 6.7% of the total crop protection market [
 <xref rid="B84-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Currently, China is able to produce 4 strobilurin fungicides namely azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, tri-floxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl (

 <xref rid="B136-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Many of these synthetic fungicides have been developed from azoxystrobin. Azoxystrobin is a broad-spectrum fungicide with activity against several diseases on many edible crops and ornamental plants such as rice blast, rusts, downy mildew, powdery mildew, late blight, apple scab, and

 <xref rid="B138-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] also showed that applying pyraclostrobin can enhance productivity and increase the antioxidative system, thereby reducing stress in Japanese cucumber (
