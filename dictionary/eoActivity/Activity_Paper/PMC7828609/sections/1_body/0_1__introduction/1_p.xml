<p>Basidiomycota, especially mushrooms, have been explored for thousands of years not only for their nutritional value but also as therapeutic agents [
 <xref rid="B1-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mushrooms are well-studied for their bioactivities such as anticancer, anti-diabetics, anti-hypertensive, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory and cholesterol-lowering properties [

 <xref rid="B4-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The discovery of mushroom metabolites pleuromutlin, illudin and strobilurins lead to the exploration of Basidiomycota as natural product-based candidates for drugs and agrochemicals [

 <xref rid="B5-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Producer organisms for commercial products and development candidates for such applications are mostly derived from genera such as 
 <italic>Agaricus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic>, but include 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> [

 <xref rid="B9-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recently, such studies have been increasingly relying on bioinformatics, genomics and transcriptomics [
