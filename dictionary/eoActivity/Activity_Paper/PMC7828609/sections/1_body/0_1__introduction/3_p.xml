<p>Many studies have documented the bioactive compounds produced by these genera, which are dominated by strobilurins. These compounds, for which some other trivial names (oudemansins and mucidin) have been used in earlier publications, are all Î²-methoxy-acrylates with a similar carbon skeleton [

 <italic>Oudemansiella canarii</italic> also produces oudemansin A with antimicrobial properties [

Due to the increased awareness in the pharmaceutical and nutritional values of mushrooms, there is an amplified demand from consumers for other varieties of mushrooms, thus leading to the exploration of wild mushrooms for utilization [
