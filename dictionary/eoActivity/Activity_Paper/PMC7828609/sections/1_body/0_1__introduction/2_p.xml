<p>The taxonomy of the oudemansielloid/xeruloid (OX) group, which comprises saprotrophic mushrooms that are widespread in all forested areas of the world, is quite complex and their generic classification has been re-arranged several times over the past decades. As the work of applied researchers such as chemists did not always keep pace with the taxonomy, there are a lot of synonyms in the literature that refer to certain species under different generic names. We here follow the concept derived from the major taxonomic study by Petersen and Hughes [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This work was based on comprehensive morphological studies including the reexamination of many types of materials and a concurrent molecular phylogeny based on rDNA data. The authors erected four new genera (
 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic>, 
 <italic>Paraxerula</italic>, 
 <italic>Ponticulomyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Protoxerula</italic>) and reconfiguration of other genera such as 
 <italic>Dactylosporina</italic>, 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic>, 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> and 
 <italic>Xerula.</italic> This concept has also been accepted in recent general overviews on the taxonomy of the Fungi and the Basidiomycota in particular [
