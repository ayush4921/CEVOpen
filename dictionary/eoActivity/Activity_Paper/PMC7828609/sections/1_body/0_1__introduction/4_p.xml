<p>This paper aims to explore the OX group of mushrooms as sources of bioactive compounds. We highlight the importance of this group by gathering information on the bioactivities and compounds produced from the earliest records up to the present. Furthermore, we discuss their diversity, distribution, taxonomy and different methods for their cultivation. </p>
