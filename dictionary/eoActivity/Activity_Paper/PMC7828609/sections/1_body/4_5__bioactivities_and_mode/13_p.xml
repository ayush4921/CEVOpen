<p>Xerulins (27) with their derivatives, di-hydro-xerulin (28) and xerulinic acid (29) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f008">Figure 8</xref>) were isolated from 
 <italic>Oudemansiella melanotricha</italic>. These compounds act as inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. They strongly inhibit the incorporation of 
 <sup>14</sup>C acetate into cholesterol in HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B112-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Xerulin and di-hydro-xerulin inhibited the biosynthesis of cholesterol in HeLa S3 cells (ID
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 Âµg/mL) without being cytotoxic [
