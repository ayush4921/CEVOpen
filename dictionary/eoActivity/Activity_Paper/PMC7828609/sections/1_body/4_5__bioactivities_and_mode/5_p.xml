<p>Oudemansins and strobilurins have been reported from a variety of Basidiomycota, which are widely distributed all over the world in tropical and temperate climates, but the most frequently reported producers are the genera of the Physalacriaceae treated here and the related genera 
 <italic>Strobilurus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> [
 <xref rid="B114-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Mycelial cultures of 
 <italic>M. mucida</italic> produce oudemansin A, which is closely related to strobilurin A [
 <xref rid="B104-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and these compounds show high antifungal activity at very low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B77-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B115-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Oudemansin also inhibited the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in rats, but at rather weak concentrations [
 <xref rid="B105-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Rosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] later found the compound in 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic>. An extract of cultures of the latter species showed antifungal effects but inhibited the growth of UACC-62 cells by 47% and the enzyme trypanothione reductase (TryR), thus indicating anti-tumor activity. 
 <italic>Hymenopellis radicata</italic> is also known to produce oudemansins [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Mucidin and strobilurin A were found to be identical [
 <xref rid="B84-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Mucidin was discovered in the 1960s from the submerged culture of 
 <italic>M. mucida</italic> as an antifungal agent and its structure was described and established in 1979 [
 <xref rid="B98-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Šubík et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] noted that mucidin could inhibit the growth and germination of the conidia of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. It also completely prevented the growth of yeasts in glycerol and ethanol and inhibited the growth of wild-type yeasts including anaerobes. Mucidin repressed the oxidation of glucose and ethanol under aerobic condition; however, in an anaerobic environment, the metabolism of glucose was not affected. In the presence of glucose, mucidin was able to reduce cytochrome b and completely oxidized cytochrome a and c by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport, thus contributing to its antifungal activity. Specifically, it inhibits electron-transfer reactions in the cytochrome bc1 complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [
