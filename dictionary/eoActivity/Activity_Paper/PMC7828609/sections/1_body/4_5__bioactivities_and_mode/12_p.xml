<p>Sadorn et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] identified 12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f007">Figure 7</xref>) different compounds from a 
 <italic>Xerula</italic> sp. (strain BCC56836) in Thailand. These were mostly known compounds, such as oudemansins, derivative of strobilurin, scalusamides A–C, phenol A acid and di-hydro-citrinone. The strain also produced compounds such 2-(5-heptenyl)-6,7,8,8a-tetrahydro-3-methyl-4H-pyrrolo [2,1-b][1,3]oxazin-4-one with insecticidal activity. Some oudemansins known for their antifungal activity also exhibit antimalarial activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.19–13.7 µM) and antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> and 
 <italic>Colletotrichum capsici</italic> with MIC values ranging from 12.5−50 µg/mL. Aside from antifungal and antibacterial activities of 2-(E-hept-5-en-1-yl)-3-methyl-6,7,8,8a-tetrahydro-4H-pyrrolo[2,1-b][1,3]oxazin-4-one, the compound also has insecticidal activity against the four-instar 
 <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (milkweed bug) and anti-phyto-pathogenicity against 
 <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic>, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum coccodes</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternaria tenuis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Penicillium italicum</italic>. The compounds phenol A acid and di-hydro-citrinone have enzyme-inhibitory activity against cathepsin B with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.4 ± 1.9 and 28.5 ± 1.7 µM, respectively. Most of the compounds isolated have low cytotoxicity in both the both cancerous and non-cancerous cells.
