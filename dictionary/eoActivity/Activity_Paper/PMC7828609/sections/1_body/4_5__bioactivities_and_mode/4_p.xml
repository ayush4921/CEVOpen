<p>Some compounds from OX taxa are already well studied. The strobilurins, first reported by Anke et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] from fermentations of 
 <italic>Strobilurus tenacellus</italic>, were later also isolated from numerous other Basidiomycota. The species 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> (as 
 <italic>O. radicata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mucida</italic> (as 
 <italic>O. mucida</italic>) were also able to produce this compound and its derivatives (strobilurins A (4), B (5) and X (6) [
