<p>Polysaccharides isolated from the oudemansielloid genera showed anti-oxidative properties [

 <italic>Hymenopellis radicata</italic> were tested for in vitro antioxidant and in vivo hepatoprotective activities [

 <xref rid="B116-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The polysaccharides displayed anti-oxidative activity against CCl4-induced liver injury of mice, thus demonstrating the hepato-protective effect of these compounds [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f006">Figure 6</xref>) isolated from 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> also have antioxidative and lung-protective effects [

 <xref rid="B118-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The MSPS derived from the fungus was able to relieve lung injury and prevent oxidative stress from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injured mice, thus they can possibly be developed into functional foods and natural drugs in preventing lung injury [
 <xref rid="B91-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These polysaccharides showed potential for relieving liver injury by monitoring the serum levels of hypersensitive C-reactive proteins, complement 3, and serum enzyme activities (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase). They also enhanced antioxidant enzyme abilities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and total antioxidant capacity). Lipid peroxidation (lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde) also decreased. The polysaccharides were mainly composed of mannose, glucose and galactose as monosaccharide components [
