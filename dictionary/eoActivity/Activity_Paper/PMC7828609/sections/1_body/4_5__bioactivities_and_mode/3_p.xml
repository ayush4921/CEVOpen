<p>The challenge of finding antimicrobial agents has become evident due to the increasing resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to present-day drugs [
 <xref rid="B2-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The exploration of bioactive compounds especially from natural sources such as plants, bacteria and fungi is needed to develop less toxic and more potent antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B93-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Recently, mushrooms have been subjected to screening for bioactive compounds and many studies have revealed their antimicrobial activities [

 <xref rid="B94-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The Agaricales were explored for their antimicrobial capacity. The antimicrobial properties of mushrooms have potential in the defense against several diseases [

 <italic>Oudemansiella canarii</italic> has been well studied for its significant antimicrobial activities against 
 <italic>Candida albicans, C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sphaerospermum</italic> [

 <xref rid="B96-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The extract of 
 <italic>Mucidula mucida</italic> (as 
 <italic>O. mucida</italic>) was shown to have antibacterial activity against the Gram positive bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus [
 <xref rid="B95-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], but this cannot be explained by the presence of strobilurins, which are selective antifungal agents. Therefore, oudemansielloid species could turn out to be a source of novel potent compounds with antimicrobial properties, once they have been studied more thoroughly.
