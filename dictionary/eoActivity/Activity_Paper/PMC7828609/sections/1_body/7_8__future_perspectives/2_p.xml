 <italic>Oudemansiella, Xerula, Mucidula</italic> and 
 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic>, among other genera of mushrooms produce important bioactive compounds, confirming their efficacy as antimicrobial, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. The compounds isolated were mostly dominated by strobilurins; however, studies also identified xerulins, scalusamides, phenol A acid, di-hydro-citrinone and polysaccharides with bioactivities and have not been fully exploited. These promising compounds may have a bright future in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and medicinal application. These future applications, however, face challenges. Studies on the cultivation of the OX genera are few as cultivation is generally developed only edible species. The OX complex are only cultivated in Asian countries. Therefore, thorough studies on the optimum cultivation methods of important species with bioactivities are necessary for stable bioactive sources to supply future demands. Mushrooms grown in greenhouses do not comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements. Mushrooms should be grown in submerged cultures in a sterile environment to produce high quality bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical and medical applications. Another challenge is that the content of bioactive ingredients varies widely depending on the procedure, harvest, extraction time, and other environmental factors. Therefore, establishing a stable protocol considering important physical parameters is necessary. Furthermore, bioactivities of mushrooms are usually demonstrated using crude extracts, with a mixture of solvents and other metabolites.
