<p>Some compounds, especially strobilurins, have already been identified with structure elucidation but many are strongly cytotoxic. However, it is possible that other interesting compounds may be isolated from OX taxa in the future. Polysaccharides, for instance, are non-toxic and should be further explored for their bioactivities. The possible side effects of these compounds are an important concern and must be studied in order to upgrade for pharmaceutical applications. It is also essential to establish and validate standard testing protocols to guarantee the quality of the bioactive compounds isolated for pharmaceutical applications, thus further studies are necessary.</p>
