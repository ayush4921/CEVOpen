<p id="p0020">Currently, there is no known effective treatment or vaccine that can mitigate/inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Available clinical interventions for COVID-19 are only palliative and limited to support. This article critically assesses the possible mechanism of actions of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on published clinical reports. We also present medicinal plants with pharmacological and biological activities that can mitigate the hallmarks of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.</p>
