 <xref rid="bib181" ref-type="bibr">Ramos-Casals et al., 2014</xref>). sHLH also is known as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening medical condition which comprises a heterogeneous group of hyper-inflammatory syndrome occurred when there is an infraction in the interplay of genetic predisposition and activators such as infections. It is characterized by a sudden and severe hyper-cytokinaemia due to inappropriate survival of histiocytes and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and ultimately leads to haemophagocytosis, multi-organ failure, and high mortality (
