<p id="p0050">Although, the immunosuppression pathway depicting how SARS-CoV-2 affects the immune system has not been fully elucidated. However, MERS and SARS have been reported to evade immune detection and weaken immune responses. During viral infection, host factors produce an immune response against viruses. CD4+ and CD8+ are important T cells which perform a pivotal role in mitigating against the virus and decrease the chance of acquiring autoimmunity/inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Cecere et al., 2012</xref>). The CD4 + T cells enhance the synthesize of viral-specific antibodies by activating T cell-dependent B cells. While CD8+T cells are cytotoxic and wipe out virus-infected cells. Approximately 80% of total inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitial in SARS-CoV infected patients are CD8+T cells. They perform important functions in scavenging and coronaviruses in infected cells (
