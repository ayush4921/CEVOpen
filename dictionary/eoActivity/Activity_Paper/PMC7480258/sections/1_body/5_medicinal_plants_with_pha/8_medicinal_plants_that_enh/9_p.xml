<p id="p0265">Many of these vegetal products promote bronchodilation, thus relieving fluid in the lungs, preventing lung fibrosis or plague formation, naso-/trachea-pharyngeal clogging, alleviating (dry) cough, chest pain, and difficulty in breathing. Overall, these novel chemical entities can be explored as formulations or cocktail containing promising druggable agents against the novel SARS-CoV-2 for blocking receptor binding and/or viral phagocytotic internalization of the SARS-CoV-2 following the binding of the S- (spike) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, and its associated proteases such as the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), Cathepsin L (CTSL) and Cathepsin B (CTSB), which are ubiquitously present in almost all of the human cells; the existence of which does not indicate that the virus can always infect the cells that express them.</p>
