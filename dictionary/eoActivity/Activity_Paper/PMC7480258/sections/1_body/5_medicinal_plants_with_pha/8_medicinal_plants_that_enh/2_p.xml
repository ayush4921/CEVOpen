<p id="p0230">The antiviral mechanisms of different extracts preparations of many vegetal products have been by the disturbance of cell membrane integrity thereby increasing the membrane permeability, and invariably causing the leakage of the RNA or DNA of the virus (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Bouyahya etÂ al., 2019</xref>), whereas fortifying or strengthening the cell membrane with nutraceuticals that offer protection to the integrity promises to be a functional approach to preventing invasion by known viruses and by extension the novel SARS-COV-2. Among the protective vegetal natural products reported to preserve or enhance cell membrane integrity are the following, some of which also have antiviral activities against respiratory viruses causing flu (gripe), while a few others have been studied against the earlier members of the coronavirus family such as the MERS and SARS. Many bioactive compounds from the vegetal sources have been shown to interact with the surface of cell membranes to prevent viral entry, specifically binding to membrane carrier proteins, regulating ion channels, modulating enzymes, influencing the order of the membrane lipid bilateral to elicit their medicinal activities. While there exists a plethora of membrane-modulating bioactive vegetal components, nutraceuticals, and phytochemicals, a variety of peptides are also secreted by plants with lipophilic properties that enhance their ability to pass across cell membranes (

Many of these structural compounds have been studied to decipher their mechanistic transportation across cellular, intracellular, and artificial membranes, as well as their effects on gene expression within the nucleus following possible participation in signalling pathways. The structure-activity relationships often some of them have been described by several authors vis-a-vis how they affect the fluidity, micro-viscosity, order, elasticity, and permeability of both biological and artificial membranes.
