 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> injection showed obvious anti-influenza virus activity. It improved the survival rate of Raw264.7 cells which were infected with influenza virus, enhanced the blocking effect of influenza virus on cell cycle after infection, reduced the MDA content and increased the SOD activity. At the same time, the innate immunity was affected by regulating the expression of TLR3, TAK1, TBK1, IRF3, and IFN-β in the TLR3-mediated signalling pathway, thus exerting its antiviral effect in vitro (
