<p id="p0095">scientific literatures on 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic> species have shown its health benefits with special focus often on immunological effects based on in vitro and in vivo studies. 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic> and its preparations exert immune stimulant activity through three mechanisms: activation of phagocytosis, stimulation of fibroblasts, and the enhancement of respiratory activity that results in augmentation of leukocyte mobility. The production of cytokines (interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-10) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is stimulated by 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Burger et al., 1997</xref>). Some in vitro studies have proved the antiviral activity of various different preparations of Echinacea. Direct antiviral activity of 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> radix was analysed by means of a plaque-reduction- assay. The assay showed that the extract caused a 100% plaque-reduction down to concentrations of 200 ug/ml. The glycoprotein-containing fractions exhibited antiviral activity and decreased plaques numbers by up to 80%. It was concluded that the glycoprotein-containing fractions of 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> root extracts are able to induce the secretion of Il-1, TNF a, and IFN a, j3. Futhermore, they are at least partially responsible for the antiviral activity of Fchinacea purpurea radix (
