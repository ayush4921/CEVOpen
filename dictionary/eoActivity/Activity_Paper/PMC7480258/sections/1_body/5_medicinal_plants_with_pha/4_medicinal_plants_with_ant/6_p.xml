<p id="p0105">The antiviral activity of 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> (Burm. f.) extract was determined using Real Time – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to examine its ability to inhibit virus load in A549 cells transfected with Simian Retro Virus (SRV). The immune-stimulant activity of extract was determined by its ability to enhance lymphocytes cell proliferation using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The result of this study revealed that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> inhibited the SRV virus titer and it was not toxic to the cell line. Also, 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract at low concentration enhanced lymphocyte cell proliferation (

 <xref rid="bib235" ref-type="bibr">Wiart et al. (2005)</xref> which demonstrated andrographolide viricidal activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) without significant cytotoxicity. 
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. (2008)</xref> also established that ethanol extract 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and andrographolide inhibited Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic proteins during the viral lytic cycle in P3HR1 cells.
