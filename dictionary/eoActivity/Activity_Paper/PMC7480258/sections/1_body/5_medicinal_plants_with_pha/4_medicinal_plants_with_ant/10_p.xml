<p id="p0125">Glycyrrhizin affects cellular signaling pathways such as protein kinase C; casein kinase II; and transcription factors such as activator protein 1 and nuclear factor κB. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin and its aglycone metabolite 18β glycyrrhetinic acid upregulate expression of inducible nitrous oxide synthase and production of nitrous oxide in macrophages (
