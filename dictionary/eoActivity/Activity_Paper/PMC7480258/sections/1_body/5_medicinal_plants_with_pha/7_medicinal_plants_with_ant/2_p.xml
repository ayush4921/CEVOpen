Hence, interest has been increased for finding antioxidants of plant source, which are safe and suitable for use in food and/or medicine. In that regard, due to the increasing numbers of diseases ravaging the continent of Africa and of course the World at large there are has been an increase interest in for finding antioxidants from plant source, which are safe and suitable for use in food and/or medicine. For that reason, many indigenous plants were selected for their significant antioxidant activities.
