 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Crane, 1990</xref>). Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called honeycombs (

Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides: fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar) (
