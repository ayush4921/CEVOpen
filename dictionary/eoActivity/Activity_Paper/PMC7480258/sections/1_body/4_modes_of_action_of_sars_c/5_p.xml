<p id="p0070">Furthermore, when compared with other kinds of respiratory syndrome coronaviruses: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 showed higher infectivity and transmissibility but a low mortality rate. The observed increase in virulence of SARS-CoV-2 may be due to much higher strength at which SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and mutation noted in its genome sequence. The detected changes on the SARS-CoV-2 gene include differences in orf8 and orf10 proteins, alteration on Nsp 2 and 3 proteins, shorter 3b segments, absent 8a, and longer 8b (
