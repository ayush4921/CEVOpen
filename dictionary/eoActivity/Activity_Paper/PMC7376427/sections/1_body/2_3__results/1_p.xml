<p>Disc diffusion assay was performed to detect the presence of inhibitory zones of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> against MRSA. Inhibitory zones were observed from crude extracts (hexane, ethanol, and water) of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> against MRSA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Except for water extract, both hexane and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> showed inhibitory zones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Relatively larger inhibitory zones ranging from 13.1 to 18.7 mm were observed from the undiluted crude ethanol extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>, while diameters of inhibitory zones of water and hexane extracts were lower ranging from 6.6 mm to 15.6 mm and 6.7 mm to 13.1 mm, respectively. Similarly, in 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, larger inhibitory zones were observed from undiluted ethanol extract ranging from 6.4 mm to 13.3 mm followed by hexane extract which showed a diameter range of 6.5–11.4 mm. Highest AI and RPI values were observed from crude ethanol extracts of both plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Among diluted extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>, inhibitory zones were observed from 10-fold to 100-fold diluted ethanol extracts. In 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, only the 10-fold diluted ethanol extract showed inhibitory zones. Mean inhibitory zone of vancomycin (30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/disc) for MRSA and MSSA was 20.6 mm and 20.8 mm, respectively. Compared to the MRSA strains, MSSA (ATCC 25923) also showed similar susceptibility pattern for the corresponding plant extracts (
