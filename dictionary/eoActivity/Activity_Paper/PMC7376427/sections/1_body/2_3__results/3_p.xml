<p>MRSA which were not effectively inhibited by extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> was effectively inhibited by extracts of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, and vice versa. MRSA nos. 2 and 3 were inhibited at MIC of 2.4 mg/mL of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>, but they were inhibited at 0.012 mg/mL by the hexane extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>. MRSA nos. 9 and 10 that were inhibited at MIC of 0.32 mg/mL of hexane extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> were inhibited at 0.012 mg/mL by the hexane extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>. Furthermore, MIC values obtained for the different extracts of the same plant for individual MRSA also varied. MRSA no. 6 which was inhibited at MIC of 0.48 mg/mL of ethanol extract was also inhibited at MIC of 0.012 mg/mL of hexane extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>. MRSA no. 9 was inhibited at MIC of 2.4 mg/mL of ethanol extract, but it was also inhibited at MIC of 0.012 mg/mL of hexane extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>. The reference strain of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923) was more sensitive for the hexane extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> which required MIC of 0.003 mg/mL. Relatively high MIC values ranging from 0.48 to 2.4 mg/mL of ethanol and hexane extracts were needed to inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences in MIC between hexane, ethanol, and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
