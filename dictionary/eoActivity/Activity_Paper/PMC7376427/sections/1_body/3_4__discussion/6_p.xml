<p>Many other studies published recently also reported the presence of compounds of natural origin that could alleviate the symptoms associated with skin infections. A study conducted on water extract of 
 <italic>Borojoa patinoi</italic> which was used in Colombian traditional medicine did not inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> M121 which is resistant to both methicillin and vancomycin [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the extract inhibited multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and the UHPLC (ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography) analysis of the plant extract showed the presence of 26 phenolic compounds including hydroxycinnamic acids, phenolic acids, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, flavonones, flanones, tyrosol ester, and dihydrochalcones. Mazzarello et al. reported that a skin cream containing propolis 20%, tea tree oil 3%, and 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> 10% was effective in reducing acne [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Pathogenesis of acne is associated with 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> Propolis consists of flavonoids, caffeic acid, benzoic acid, and cinnamic acid. Tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol, which shows an important role in the antimicrobial activity. Besides, another study on acne reported antiacne efficacy of two essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Presence of monoterpene, diterpene, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, azulene, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones in essential oils may have attributed to the antibacterial effects against MDR bacteria [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
