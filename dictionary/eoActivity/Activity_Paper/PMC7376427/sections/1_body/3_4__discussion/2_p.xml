<p>The MIC values obtained for the extracts against the MRSA varied from one plant extract to another. One reason would be the extraction of different constituents in particular solvents depending on their chemical and physical properties especially the polarity. Furthermore, due to genetic variability, different MRSA could have acted differently with chemicals in each extract. Organisms which were not effectively inhibited by 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> were effectively inhibited by extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, and vice versa, suggesting the effectiveness of both plants towards different strains of MRSA. However, 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> is more effective since hexane extracts inhibited majority of MRSA strains at relatively lower MIC such as 0.003â€‰mg/mL. Low polar active compounds present in the hexane extract may be responsible for this antimicrobial activity. As observed in our previous studies, compared to the MRSA strains, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC standard (ATCC 25923) also showed similar susceptibility pattern for both plants [
