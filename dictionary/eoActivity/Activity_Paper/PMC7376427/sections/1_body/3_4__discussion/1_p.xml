<p>The results revealed that the crude extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> were effective against the MRSA strains as observed by the zones of inhibition. Disc diffusion assay was performed as a preliminary screening to confirm the inhibitory effects of the plant extracts against MRSA. Highest AI and RPI values were obtained from crude ethanol extracts of the plants. Since undiluted crude extracts were more effective against MRSA, it is assumed that the antibacterial effect may be due to the presence of possible active ingredients in high concentrations. However, the strength of an inhibitory effect cannot be compared by the results of disc diffusion assay due to the varying concentrations of the crude extracts. Therefore, MIC was determined as the standard method to compare the antibacterial activity of the plant extracts.
