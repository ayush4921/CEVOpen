<p>Studies conducted in Sri Lanka revealed that certain medicinal plants which are being used in traditional medicine possess anti-MRSA properties [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, local studies on 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, related to MRSA, were deficient. On the contrary, very few studies were available from other countries on these plants which reported anti-MRSA activity. Glorybai et al. reported the presence of antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> in 2015, but they have used a single strain of MRSA, and MIC was not reported [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, their study revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, 2-butenamide, 
 <italic>N</italic>-(4-fluorophenyl)–methyl 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamyl tiglate silane, trichlorocyclohexyl silane, and its derivatives in 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>, which could be responsible for the antibacterial activity. Sivagurunathan and Krishnamoorthy reported the antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> for a single strain of MRSA in 2017, but MIC was not reported. High concentrations of phenolic compounds were identified in the ethanol extract, and HPLC results showed the presence of different types of unidentified phytoconstituents [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Zuo et al. reported anti-MRSA activity of 19 medicinal plants against 9 MRSA strains (except 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>) with MIC range of 1.25–3.07 mg/ml [
