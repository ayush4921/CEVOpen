<p>Broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC. Serial 5-fold dilutions of the plant extracts were prepared in the 10% DMSO, yielding serial dilutions of the crude extract. Bacterial inoculum was prepared in Mueller–Hinton broth, and the turbidity was adjusted to approximately 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. 96-well microtitre plates were used for the MIC assay, and 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of plant extract was added to each well of the microplate. 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of bacterial suspension was added to each well except the negative controls. Vancomycin (MIC ≤ 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was used as positive control. 10% DMSO and plant extracts without bacterial suspension were used as the negative controls. Microtiter plates were incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 24 hr. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by the measurement of absorbance at 630 nm using a microplate reader. The lowest concentration (highest dilution) of the extract that does not produce bacterial growth depending on the absorbance was regarded as MIC. The assay was done in triplicate for each extract separately, and average absorbance values were used to determine the MIC.
