<p>20 g of coarse powder of each plant material was mixed with 200 ml of the solvent. The contents were placed in a mechanical shaker for 72 hr at 25°C. Then, the extracts were filtered, and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The resulting crude extracts were dissolved in a minimum amount of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) separately, and the final concentration of each extract was adjusted to 300 mg/ml. Each extract was stored at 4°C in sterile airtight containers for further studies.</p>
