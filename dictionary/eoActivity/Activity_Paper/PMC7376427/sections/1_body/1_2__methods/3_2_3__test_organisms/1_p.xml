<p>MRSA strains (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20) were used for the study along with CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) standard strain of methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA-ATCC 25923) as the reference organism. The MRSA strains used in this study were isolated from pus samples obtained for culture and sensitivity testing from patients having skin and soft tissue infections among patients admitted to Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya, Sri Lanka. Organisms were subcultured for 24 hours on blood agar and MacConkey agar plates and confirmed by gram stain, catalase test, slide and tube coagulase tests, and the zone diameter of cefoxitin (30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) on Mueller–Hinton agar at the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka.
