<p>One of our previous studies reported the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> against standard organisms such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853), and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 700603) [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on these plants for multidrug-resistant organisms are not available. Therefore, this study explores the antibacterial activity against MRSA strains which were isolated from pus samples obtained for culture and sensitivity testing from patients having skin and soft tissue infections.
