<p>Antimicrobial resistance has become a major public health issue in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century which has threatened the prevention and the treatment of a wide variety of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The rate of emergence of antibiotic-resistant human pathogens is greater compared to the discovery of new antibiotic drugs [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among the antibiotic-resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) causes a plethora of diseases involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, and joints [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is one of the major causes of the hospital- and community-acquired infections [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The resistance for 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-lactam antibiotics in MRSA is acquired by the expression of 
 <italic>mecA</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Majority of clinical isolates of MRSA are also resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin [
