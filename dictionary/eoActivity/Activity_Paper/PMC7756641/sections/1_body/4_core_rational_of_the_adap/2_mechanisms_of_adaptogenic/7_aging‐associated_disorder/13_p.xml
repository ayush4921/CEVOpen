<p>Overproduction of ROS and their inadequate elimination by the innate antioxidant system in aging relate directly to transcription factors that control the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation, inflammation, and ROS production. As an example, age‐related changes in the expression of AP‐1, NF‐kB, FoxO, and Nrf2 transcription factor‐mediated signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells lead to the progression of inflammaging (i.e., aging‐related low‐grade chronic inflammation) and atherosclerosis.
