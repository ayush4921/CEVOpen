<p>All adaptogens tested (
 <italic>R. rosea L., E. senticosus, W. somnifera, R. carthamoides, and B. alba</italic>) activate the melatonin signaling pathway by acting through two GPCRs MT1 and MT2, and upregulating the ligand‚Äêspecific nuclear receptor RORA, which plays a role in different common aging diseases such as neurological disorders, hypertension, dyslipidemia, intellectual disability, retinopathy, and cancer. Furthermore, melatonin activates adaptive signaling pathways and upregulates the expression of 
 <italic>UCN, GNRH1, TLR9, GP1BA, PLXNA4, CHRM4, GPR19, VIPR2, RORA, STAT5A, ZFPM2, ZNF396, FLT1, MAPK10, MERTK, PRKCH</italic>, and TTN, which are commonly regulated by all adaptogens tested.
