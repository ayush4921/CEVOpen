 </xref> Since Rhodiola upregulates PLCB1, PI3KC2G, and c‐AMP related genes, and modulates NO and JNK it was suggested that Rhodiola and estrogens interfere with each other in some way.

 </xref> While both are neuroprotective, it is remaining unclear whether they are mimetic and in competition or are naturally antagonistic.
