<p>All adaptogens upregulate mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinases MAPK10 and MAPK13 which correspondingly involved in the regulation of 77 and 58 signaling pathways, including adaptive stress response signaling survival and longevity. These findings support the use of adaptogenic plants in TMS as a panacea for the treatment of numerous diseases.</p>
