<p>In young age, the balance between pro‐ and antiaging JNK‐mediated programs is shifted in favor of Hsp70 (Figure 
 <xref rid="med21743-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Apparently, oxidative stress does not affect survival and reproduction of young cells because stress‐activated Hsp70 blocks JNK‐stimulated apoptosis. Enhanced levels of Hsp70 correlate with increased life span. In contrast, with age, when induction of Hsp70 is reduced, the balance shifts in favor of the aging and apoptosis programs. Consequently, even weak oxidative stress can induce the degeneration of neuronal cells and the progression of aging‐related diseases. The ability to respond effectively to stress by generating increased Hsp70 correlates with high adaptability and increased life span.
