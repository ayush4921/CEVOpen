 </xref> G‐protein activated, phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol‐1,4,5‐triphosphate (IP
 <sub>3</sub>) that is involved in numerous intracellular signaling pathways associated with various diseases including depression and cancer. DAG triggers protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates numerous proteins and plays an important role in tumor progression. PI3K is a key upstream mediator of intracellular signaling related to regulation of NF‐kB‐mediated defence responses and apoptosis as well as to long‐term potentiation of neurotransmission, which improves memory and learning.
