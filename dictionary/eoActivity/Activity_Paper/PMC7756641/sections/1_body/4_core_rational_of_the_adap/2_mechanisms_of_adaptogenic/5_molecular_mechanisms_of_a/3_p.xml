<p>Some of these proteins play key roles in regulating numerous processes. As an example, all adaptogens upregulate TLR9, a member of the PI3K (complex) gene‐encoding transmembrane receptor that plays key roles in regulating 152 signaling pathways including glucocorticoid receptor signaling, interleukins IL‐2, IL‐3, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐7, IL‐8, IL‐9, ILK, IL‐12, IL‐15, IL‐17A, IL‐17 signaling, B‐ and T‐cell receptor signaling, leukocyte extravasation, extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinase (ERK)/MAPK, PI3K/AKT signaling in the pathogenesis of influenza, lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated MAPK signaling, p53 and JNK signaling, production of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages signaling, eNOS signaling NO signaling in the cardiovascular system, leptin signaling in obesity, type II diabetes mellitus signaling, IGF‐1 and insulin receptor signaling, prolactin signaling, AMPK signaling, and so forth.
