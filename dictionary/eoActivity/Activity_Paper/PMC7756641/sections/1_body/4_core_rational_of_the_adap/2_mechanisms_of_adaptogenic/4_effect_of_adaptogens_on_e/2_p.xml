<p>The hypothetical mechanism of adaptogens’ action on HPA‐axis hormones in stress is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="med21743-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The HPA axis plays a pivotal role in regulating the majority of endocrine hormones associated with the CNS. Stress hormones regulate growth, appetite, blood pressure, emotion, sexual function, body temperature, sleep, biorhythms, and hydration. They are produced by the endocrine system, are secreted into the bloodstream, and target other tissues to regulate physiological functions. The main function of stress hormones is to maintain homeostasis to counteract stress
