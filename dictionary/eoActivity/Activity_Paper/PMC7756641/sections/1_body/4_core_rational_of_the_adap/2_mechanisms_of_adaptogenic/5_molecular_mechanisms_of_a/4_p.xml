<p>All adaptogens upregulate protein kinase C (PKC) eta, an enzyme encoded by the PRKCH gene that plays key roles in the regulation of 72 signaling pathways including CRH signaling, androgen signaling, prolactin signaling, growth hormone signaling, melatonin signaling, Gαq signaling, feedback in cAMP signaling, Nrf2‐mediated oxidative stress response, production of NO and ROS in macrophages, mTOR signaling, NF‐κB activation by viruses, calcium‐induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, protein kinase A signaling, phospholipase C signaling, eNOS signaling, opioid signaling pathway, neuropathic pain signaling in dorsal horn neurons, axonal guidance signaling, CREB signaling in neurons, dopamine‐DARPP32 endothelin‐1 signaling, α‐adrenergic signaling, nNOS signaling in neurons, synaptic long‐term potentiation and synaptic long‐term depression signaling pathways.
