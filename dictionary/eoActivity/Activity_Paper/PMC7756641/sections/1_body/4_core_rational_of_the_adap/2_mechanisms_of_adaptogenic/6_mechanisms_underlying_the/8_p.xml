<p>An imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen radicals and their degradation results in oxidative stress. Reactive intermediates interact with polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, and RNA and DNA fragments, initiating numerous redox reactions that damage many cellular components such as the membrane, mitochondria, and nucleus, which leads to dysfunction of cellular processes and homeostasis, and triggers apoptosis and necrosis. Oxidative stress is increased in chronic inflammation and aging‐related disorders including atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration.

 </xref> The feedback cellular response is associated with activation of defence mechanisms including induction of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes and molecular chaperones. Several adaptive signaling pathways such as p38, PKC, ERK, JNK, and PI3K signaling may activate Nrf2. Two other adaptive signaling pathways involving NF‐κB and FOXO transcription factors are important in neuronal stress adaptation.
