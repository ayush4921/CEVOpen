<p>These models take into account interactions within the biological network, which are important if medications act at various targets in the network or if homeostatic feedback mechanisms are effective. System pharmacology models are useful to describe synergistic mechanisms of action of complex combinations of medicinal plants. The term synergy is appropriate for interactions of two or more ingredients leading to qualitatively new pharmacological effects, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., to the expression of genes that cannot be obtained by any single ingredient independently. On the contrary, antagonism occurs as a result of the interaction of several ingredients in a combination, which leads to the absence, reduction or prevention of the effects of any individual ingredient in this combination.
