<p>Kampo tradition uses fixed combinations of medicinal plants in standardized proportions. The idea to combine two or more plants or substances, which will be stronger than any ingredient alone, is very attractive for several reasons: the ingredients may have different targets and mechanisms of action in human organisms, and therefore better effect as a combination; and the combination can be used at lower doses and may be less toxic if any ingredient contains a toxic impurity. The ingredients can also act synergistically, thereby providing new unique effects that are not possible to obtain by any ingredient independently. Synergistically means that the combination is active, while the ingredients separately are inactive.
