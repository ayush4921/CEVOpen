<p>Similar to antioxidants and vitamins, adaptogens constitute a category of nutritional and herbal medicinal products essential for good health, adaptability, resilience, survival, and healthy aging. Regardless of the nature of the stimulus (stressor), an adaptogen increases adaptability, resilience, and survival by activating adaptive signaling pathways of cellular and organismal defence systems (stress system e.g., neuroendocrine‐immune complex). Furthermore, adaptogens trigger the generation of hormones (cortisol, corticotropin‐releasing hormone [CRH] and gonadotropin‐releasing hormones, urocortin, neuropeptide Y), playing key roles in metabolic regulation and homeostasis. Meanwhile, multitarget mechanisms of action and a wide range of pharmacological effects indicate their nonspecific pharmacological activity.</p>
