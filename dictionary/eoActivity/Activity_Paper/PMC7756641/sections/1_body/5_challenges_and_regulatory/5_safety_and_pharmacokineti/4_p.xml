<p>The highest concentration of the label in the blood was observed 15 min after administration of the 3H‐labeled eleutheroside B, and this concentration dropped sharply within 4 h and was eliminated mainly through the renal system with urine. Approximately 35% of the labeled drug was eliminated via the urine 2 h after administration, 55% after 4 h, and 90% after 48 h. A small amount of radioactivity (2.5%–3%) was eliminated with the feces. Most of the labeled drug accumulated rapidly in the organs and tissues. In fact, after only 15 min, 88% was absorbed and retained at a high level for a rather long duration. After 8 h, up to 30% of the administered drug was still retained in the organs and tissues. This represents an exceptionally high level of incorporation of labeled eleutheroside B into the liver and kidneys with subsequent rapid removal from these organs. The high levels of labeled eleutheroside B in the pancreas can probably be attributed to its active participation in the digestion process and to its synthesis of two important hormones: insulin and glucagon. The accumulation of eleutheroside B in the adrenals for up to 4 h suggests its influence on the hypophysis–adrenal cortical system. In the brain, a minimal level of incorporation of the radioactive label with an insignificant reduction over time was observed. Eleutheroside B does not pass the blood–brain barrier.
