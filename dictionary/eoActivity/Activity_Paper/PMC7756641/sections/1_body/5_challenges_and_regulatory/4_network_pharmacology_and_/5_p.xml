<p>At low and normal doses, adaptogens act as mild stress mimetics, increasing the homeostatic range (Figure 
 <xref rid="med21743-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and resulting in increased resistance to stress. At higher doses, they may suppress inflammation and therefore prevent premature aging and maintain health and vitality. This is the “specific” difference of adaptogens, which activate adaptive signaling pathways and increase survival and resiliency from stress, from some other natural compounds, the so‐called PAINS (PAn‐assay Interference compouNdS), such as toxoflavin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, and resveratrol. Quercetin, β‐sitosterol, rutin, and curcumin do not comply with these criteria, despite nonspecific pleiotropic effects in numerous in vitro experiments.
