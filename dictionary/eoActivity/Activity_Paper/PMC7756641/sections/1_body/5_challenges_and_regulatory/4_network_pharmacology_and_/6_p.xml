<p>Adaptogens stimulate neurogenesis and exhibit neuroprotective activity, suggesting their potential benefits in neurodegenerative disorders. Surprisingly, they trigger apoptotic signaling pathways associated with antitumor activity. Regulation of both stress‐resistance and proapoptotic genes is not necessarily a paradox. Adaptogens stimulate mediators of the stress response and transcription factors,

 </xref> which may orchestrate different patterns of gene expression based on the dose of adaptogens, perhaps activating stress‐resistance genes normal or small doses, but proapoptotic genes at high doses beyond a certain threshold. Possibly, adaptogens regulate different genes in different cell types, causing apoptosis in some cells (
