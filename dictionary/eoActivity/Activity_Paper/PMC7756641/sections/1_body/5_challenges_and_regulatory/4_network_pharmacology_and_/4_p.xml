<p>The specificity of the pharmacological action of various adaptogenic plants depends on both the chemical compositions of the extracts and the dose. Product‐specific (or compound‐specific) activity is theoretically possible to achieve in the smallest dose/concentration, when a compound selectively interacts with only one receptor type, which can trigger minimal signaling pathways in a molecular network. Although the effector (ligand) molecule at higher doses can nonspecifically interact with numerous molecules of several networks, this may cause both feedback downregulations and antagonistic interactions of various molecular networks, resulting in quite different pharmacological responses and toxic effects.</p>
