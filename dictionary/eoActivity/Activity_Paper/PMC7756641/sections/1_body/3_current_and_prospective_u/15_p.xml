<p>One more possible benefit of adaptogens in respiratory tract infectious diseases might be their beneficial effect during patient convalescence. Adjuvant therapy with Chisan/ADAPT‐232, a fixed combination of

 <italic>R. rosea</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic>, in pneumonia has a positive effect on patient recovery by decreasing the duration of the acute phase of the illness, increasing patient mental performance during the rehabilitation period, and improving patient quality of life (QOL).

 </xref> Both the clinical and laboratory results of the present study suggest that Chisan (ADAPT‐232) can be recommended in the standard treatment of patients with acute nonspecific pneumonia as an adjuvant to increase patient QOL and to expedite their recovery.
