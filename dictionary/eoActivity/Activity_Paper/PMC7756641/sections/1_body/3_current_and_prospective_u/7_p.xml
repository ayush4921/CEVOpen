 </xref> However, most of these trials lacked good methodology (e.g., lack of randomization, proper control, blinding, statistical tools, description of inclusion and exclusion criteria, description of the medication, diagnosis, study design, and small sample size). In 2009, Li et al. assessed the efficacy and safety of 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus</italic> in patients with acute ischemic stroke in a Cochrane systematic review. The authors included 13 RCTs (962 participants). The primary outcome measure in all included trials was the improvement of the neurological deficit after treatment. 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus</italic> was found to significantly increase the number of participants with improvement in neurological impairment. However, because the risk of bias in all of the included trials was high, the authors concluded that much larger trials of greater methodological quality are required.

 </xref> In the EMEA assessment report dated March 25, 2014, the authors concluded that despite the large number of studies on the topic, 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus</italic> root preparations do not reach the level of “well‐established use” scientific evidence sufficient to grant a marketing authorization, although in total, the data available are sufficient to justify further research on the concept of adaptogens.
