<p>In recent years our understanding of mechanisms underlying the health benefits of natural dietary compounds has improved considerably. Based on modern concepts, plants synthesize in their most susceptible parts (flowers, roots, and leaves) special secondary metabolites for self‚Äêprotection against microorganisms, insects, and other pests, as well as to mitigate harmful environmental conditions.

 </xref> In animals that use plants as their primary nutrition multiple mechanisms to counteract the potentially poisonous effects of phytotoxins have evolved. These natural compounds are not noxious in humans at lower doses but are able to induce mild cellular stress responses.

 </xref> The ability of plant secondary metabolites to activate the adaptive cellular stress response pathway in human body is one of their essential mechanisms of action.
