<p>The interest in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> (known as 
 <italic>limonnik = лимонник</italic> in Russian) arose from ethnopharmacological investigations by. Komarov (1895) and Arsenyev (1903–1907) in far eastern Siberia and northern Manchuria. The berries and seeds were determined to have been used by Nanai hunters (natives of far eastern Siberia and Chinese Manchuria, also known as Goldis or Samagir) as a tonic to reduce thirst, hunger, and exhaustion and to improve night‐time vision.
