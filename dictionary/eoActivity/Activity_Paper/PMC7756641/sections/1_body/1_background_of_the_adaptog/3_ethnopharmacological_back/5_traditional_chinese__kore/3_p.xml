<p>The core of the TCM concept is the yin‚Äêyang theory consisting of two natural, complementary, and contradictory forces of opposite polarity that interact to form a dynamic system in which the entire is dual and better/superior than the collected parts. According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang features (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light), which are in dynamic equilibrium (balance); yin is negative/passive/dark/female/water, while yang is positive/active/bright/male/fire. Although yin is stronger, they are always in balance.</p>
