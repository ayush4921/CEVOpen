The “bell shape” dose‐effect relationship is common for adaptogens, which have high therapeutic indices (effective dose: toxic dose ratio). In addition, toxic medicinal plants in small doses activate the body's defence systems, particularly the immune system, to cope with cancer and other diseases associated with suppressed immunity. Adaptogens similarly activate the body's defence systems, but at doses not toxic for humans.
