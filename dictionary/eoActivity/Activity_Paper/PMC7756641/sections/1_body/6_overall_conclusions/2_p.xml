<p>The adaptogenic concept does not have a long history as analogues of TMS, even though adaptogenic plants have been used in TMS as rejuvenating herbs, qi tonics, rasayanas, and restoratives for centuries and are formally considered to be “traditional” by drug regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States. It is supported by an evidence‐based approach and statistical assessments of pharmacological and clinical studies of efficacy and safety of standardized herbal medicinal products as well as their mechanisms of action. The efficacy of plants used in TMS has been investigated using modern theories and methods of system biology and network pharmacology. In this review, we summarized our knowledge about common adaptogenic plants used as officinal medical preparations in USSR/Russia and in traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda medicine, and other TMS and alternative medical systems, and to provide a modern rationale for their use in the treatment of stress‐induced and aging‐related disorders. Overall, the basic principles of TMS are in line with those of the adaptogenic concept, which uses systems biology and network pharmacology models to understand the fundamentals of TMS such as “life vital energy”/qi (Chinese)/prana (Indian)/pneuma (Greece)/zorutyun (Armenian)/od (German)/ruah (Hebrew), and mana (Polynesian), which are related to adaptability. Yin‐yang balance can be interpreted as “homeostasis”, whereas “shanghuo”—as a state of threatened homeostasis and decreased resistance to stress, which is increased by adaptogens.</p>
