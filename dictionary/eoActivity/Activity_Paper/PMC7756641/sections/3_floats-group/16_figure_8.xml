  <p>Adaptogens exhibit antioxidant and detoxifying effects presumably by activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Nrf2 is a principal regulator of redox homeostasis normally retained in the cytoplasm by association Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein‐1 (Keap1). Upon exposure of cells to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is phosphorylated in response to PKC, phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K), and MAPK pathways. After phosphorylation, this complex dissociates and Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the ARE and triggers expression of antioxidant and detoxifying genes including superoxide dismutase, glutathione S‐transferase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, and heme oxygenase 1. Thus, activation of Nrf2 translocation or upregulation of gene expression resulting in activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway is the key mechanism of the cellular defense response
