<p>In this work the phytochemical content and bioactivity of traditionally consumed wild plants namely 
 <italic>H. laevigata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. radiata,</italic> and 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic> were investigated. The edible portions (leaves) were studied, both fresh and after blanching, to assess the impact of processing on these food matrices. Among bioactive phytochemicals, TPC, TFC, lycopene, Î²-carotene, and chlorophylls were quantified. Samples were studied for their antioxidant potential using different approaches and as inhibitors of enzymes linked to obesity and hyperglycaemia.
