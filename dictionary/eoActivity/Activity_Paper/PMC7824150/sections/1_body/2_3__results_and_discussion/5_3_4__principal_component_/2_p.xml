<p>PCA was applied to differentiate the four different taxa of 
 <italic>Hypochaeris</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyoseris.</italic> By choosing eigenvalues greater than one (&gt;1), the dimensionality was reduced from 16 variables to two principal components (PC). PCA results revealed that the first two principal components explained total variance completely 78.4%. The loadings of first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 45.25 and 33.15% of the variance, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00032-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The first component (PC1) is highly positively correlated with Chlorophylls, and FRAP. The second component (PC2) is positively correlated with TSS, β-carotene bleaching test t = 30 min, β-carotene bleaching test t = 60 min, while citric acid, β-Carotene, TPC, and TFC) are positively correlated with component 1 and component 2. pH, DPPH, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase show a negative correlation for PC1 and PC2.
