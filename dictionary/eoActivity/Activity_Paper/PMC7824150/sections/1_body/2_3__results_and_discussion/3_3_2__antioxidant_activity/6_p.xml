<p>Previously, Senguttuvan et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] studied the radical scavenging potential of an infusion from the dried leaves of 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> and found IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 595.23 μg/mL and 2143.1 μmol of Trolox equivalent (TE)/dried weight (DW). Dried leaves are also able to exert their antioxidant activities through other mechanisms, including the protection of lipid peroxidation and ferric reducing power.
