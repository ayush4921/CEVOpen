 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported a significant decrease in total polyphenol and antioxidant components in boiled broccoli. Abu-Ghannam and Jaiswal [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] described a reduction in the total phenolic content of up to 45% at lower blanching temperatures (80–90 °C) within 2 min of blanching and reduction of the total polyphenol content continued within 6 min at high blanching temperatures
