<p>Carotenoid content in raw and cooked leaf samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00032-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The reported values show a greater concentration of total carotenoids (expressed in β-Carotene equiv.) in the fresh leaves than in the blanched ones. The blanching water had a significantly higher (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05) carotenoid content than the blanched leaves, but lower than the fresh leaves. A similar trend was found in leaves of both 
 <italic>Hypochaeris</italic> (
 <italic>leavigata</italic> and 
 <italic>radicata</italic>) and 
 <italic>Hyoseris</italic> (
 <italic>radiata</italic> and 
 <italic>lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic>). Compared to the initial concentration in the fresh leaves (HL1, HR1, HRA1 and HT1), the lowest carotenoid concentration in blanching water was found in sample HT3, with a value of 205.2 g/100 g, whereas the highest value was found in sample HRA3 (298.1 g/100 g). The presence of carotenoids in blanching water was reported by Parmar et Rupasinghe [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], who observed that an infusion of wild berry stems in hot water had a carotenoid content in the range of 275–417 mg/L. They further showed a high carotenoid content in commercial green tea with average values of 410 and 1332 mg/L for extraction in methanol and hot water respectively. In a study carried out by Loranty et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] on 25 infused fruit and herbal teas, only lutein was present in the infusions, other carotenoids not being found. The highest level of lutein (24.3 mg/200 mL) was found in a Tilias infusion (Edward Tea). Suzuki et Shioii [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found chlorophyll and carotenoids in seven teas infused from 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> leaves.
