<p>The present study assessed for the first time the impact of the blanching process on the phytochemical content and bioactivity of the spontaneous plants namely 
 <italic>Hypochaeris laevigata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic>, 
 <italic>Hyoseris radiata,</italic> and 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina.</italic> Traditionally, these species are widely consumed in Central and South Italy, both fresh and after blanching. For this purpose, fresh and blanched samples as well as residual blanching water were studied. The blanching process determined a reduction in the content of all investigated phytochemical classes. At the same time, the analysis of the data showed that the blanching water retains most of the bioactive compounds and for this reason it is characterized by a good antioxidant and inhibitory activity against enzymes linked to obesity and related diseases such as diabetes type 2. For this reason, the consumption of the fresh spontaneous plant and the reutilization of residual blanching water should be promoted in order to ensure the right amounts of healthy micronutrients able to counteract oxidative stress and related diseases.
