<p>TPC was determined as described by Sicari et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An aliquot of 350 Î¼L of aqueous extract was mixed with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (1 mL) and 20% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (10 mL). The absorbance was measured at 760 nm in a spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-Agilent 8453) and the results were expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g fresh weight (FW).
