<p>A spectrophotometric method was used to measure the total flavonoid content. TFC was determined using a method based on the formation of a flavonoid-aluminium complex [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The extract was mixed with 2% aluminium chloride solution. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then measured against a blank at 510 nm. TFC was calculated based on a standard curve and expressed as mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/100 g FW.
