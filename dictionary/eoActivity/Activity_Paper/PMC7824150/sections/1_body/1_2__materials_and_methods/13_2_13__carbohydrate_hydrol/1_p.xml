<p>The hypoglycaemic activity of samples was evaluated through inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For α-amylase assay, aqueous extracts (from 25 to 1000 μg/mL) and starch solution were added to the enzyme at room temperature for 5 min, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured. For α-glucosidase inhibitory activity test, samples extracts (from 25 to 1000 μg/mL) were mixed with enzyme solution, a maltose solution, peroxidase/glucose oxidase (PGO) system-colour reagent solution and 
 <italic>o</italic>-dianisidine (DIAN) solution. This mixture was incubated for 30 min and the absorbance was measured.
