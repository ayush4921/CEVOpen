<p>The pH was determined by direct measurement in a digital potentiometer (Crison Instruments S.A., Milan, Italy). The Total soluble solids (TSS) were measured at 20 °C using a digital Atago Model PR-101 α refractometer (Atago Co. Ltd., Milan, Italy), results were reported as Brix degrees (°Brix). The titratable acidity (TA) was determined using 0.1 N NaOH to pH 8.1. Results were expressed as percentage of monohydrate citric acid.</p>
