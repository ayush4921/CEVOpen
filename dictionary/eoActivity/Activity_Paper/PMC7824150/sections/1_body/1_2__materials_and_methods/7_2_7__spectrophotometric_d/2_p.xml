<p>The extraction was repeated until the sample became colorless. The combined extract was transferred to a separating funnel and 5 mL of distilled water was added to separate polar and nonpolar phases. The nonpolar hexane layer containing carotenoids was collected and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) until dry. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL of hexane. The total carotenoid content was determined by a spectrophotometric method using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453 Technologies, Agilent, Milan, Italy). The absorbance was read at 450 nm. All analyses were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation (SD).</p>
