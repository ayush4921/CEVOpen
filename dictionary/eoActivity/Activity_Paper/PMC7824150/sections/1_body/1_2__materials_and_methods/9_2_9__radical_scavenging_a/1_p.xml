<p>In ABTS radical scavenging ability test, potassium persulphate solution and ABTS solution were mixed to obtain ABTS radical cation solution [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. After 12 h, this solution was stabilized (absorbance of 0.70) at 734 nm employing a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Jenway 6003, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution was mixed with different concentrations of aqueous extracts (from 1 to 400 Î¼g/mL) and the absorbance was read at 734 nm after 6 min.
