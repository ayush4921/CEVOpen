<p>In this context, the evaluation of the impact of blanching on Calabrian traditional vegetables, namely 
 <italic>H. laevigata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. radiata,</italic> and 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina,</italic> was investigated. For this purpose, basal leaves were screened for their Total Phenols Content (TPC), Total Flavonoids Content (TFC), chlorophylls and Total Carotenoids Content (TCC) before and after blanching process. β-Carotene bleaching, FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH tests were applied to test the antioxidant activity. The inhibitory effects of enzymes linked to obesity and DMT2 such as lipase, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase were assessed. In order to evaluate the possible loss of bioactive compounds after blanching, the residual blanching water was also investigated.
