<p>It is seemingly odd that CAs, among the most efficient enzymes in Nature, may be activated for biomedical purposes

Thus, CAs represent a crucial family of new targets for improving cognition, but also in therapeutic areas, such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders, for which few effective therapies are available. In fact, in a recent paper, one of our groups showed that the CAA D-phenylalanine and the CAI acetazolamide are respectively able to reinforce and impair extinction memory, that is, a new memory trace that inhibits the expression of the memory of a traumatic event
