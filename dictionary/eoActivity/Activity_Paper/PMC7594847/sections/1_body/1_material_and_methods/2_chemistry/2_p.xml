 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million and coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) are reported in hertz (Hz). 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra were fully decoupled. The following abbreviations were used to explain multiplicities: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), double doublet (dd), broad (br), and multiplet (m). Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel columns by flash column chromatography (Kieselgel 40, 0.040−0.063 mm, Merck). Reactions were followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck aluminium silica gel (60 F254) sheets that were visualised under a UV lamp. Evaporation was performed 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> (rotating evaporator). Sodium sulphate was always used as the drying agent. Commercially available chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
