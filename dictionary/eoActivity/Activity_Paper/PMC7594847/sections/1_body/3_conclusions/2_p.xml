<p>In the present study, we described the synthesis and CA activating effects of a series of oxime ether-based amino alcohols towards four hCA isoforms expressed in human brain, that are CA I, II, IV and VII. Except for the phenolic compounds 
 <bold>14–16</bold>, all amino alcohol derivatives from this study induce a consistent activation of the tested CAs, with K
 <sub>A</sub>s spanning from a low micromolar to a medium nanomolar range. Specifically, hCA II and VII, probable main CA targets when CNS diseases are concerned,

 </xref> are most potently activated by these oxime ether derivatives. With K
 <sub>A</sub>s of 79 and 420 nM towards hCA II and VII, respectively and K
 <sub>A</sub>s for CA I and IV settling in a range 10- to 100-fold higher, derivative 
 <bold>5</bold> from the 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylamines series turned out as the most potent and selective hCA II activator of the study. On the other hand, a multitude of selective hCA VII activators were identified. Specifically, a mention should be done for derivatives 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>, from the isopropylamines series, showing a 10- to 100-fold selective hCA VII activation profiles with respect to all other assayed CAs. In this second youth period for CAAs, innovative pharmacological studies made these lately neglected agents to draw attention in the memory therapy and cognitive neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in therapeutic areas, such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders

 </xref>. As hCA VII is a key isoform involved in brain metabolism, the here identified potent and selective hCA VII activators may be considered of interest for investigations of possible therapeutic applications or as lead compounds in search of more potent and selective CAAs. This work might bring new lights on the intricate relationship between CA activation and brain physiology.
