<p>The 
 <italic>E</italic> configuration of amino alcohols 
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>16</bold> was conferred by comparison between the 
 <sup>1</sup>H signals of the iminic protons of compounds 
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>16</bold> with the same signals of final compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold>. The chemical shift of iminic proton signal resulted around δ 8.05–8.50 ppm for all derivatives as usually reported for oximes with 
 <italic>E</italic> configuration.
