The enzyme kinetic method showed that timolol noncompetitively activates hCA I and II by forming of a ternary complex consisting of the enzyme, the substrate, and timolol. Docking studies were used to point out that timolol also binds at the entrance of the active site cavity nearby the proton shuttle residue His64
