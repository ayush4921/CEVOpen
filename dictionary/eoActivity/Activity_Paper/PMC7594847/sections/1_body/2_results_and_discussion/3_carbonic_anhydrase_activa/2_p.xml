<p>Amino alcohols 
 <bold>1–16</bold> were here assayed for their activating properties of 4 catalytically active and physiologically relevant hCA isoforms expressed in human brain, that are: the cytosolic hCA I, II, and VII, and the membrane associated hCA IV
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>58</sup>
 </xref>. In the CNS context, hCA I is expressed in the motor neurons in human spinal cord
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>59</sup>
 </xref>. The physiologically dominant isoform hCA II is located both in the choroid plexus, and in oligodendrocytes, myelinated tracts, astrocytes and myelin sheaths in the vertebrates brain
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>60</sup>
 </xref>. hCA IV is located on the luminal surface of cerebral capillaries, associated with the blood–brain barrier, and expressed in layers III and VI in the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus

 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>. CA VII might be considered a brain-associated CA as it is predominantly expressed in the brain, and absent in most other tissues. CA VII is also considered a key molecule in age-dependent neuronal pH regulation.
