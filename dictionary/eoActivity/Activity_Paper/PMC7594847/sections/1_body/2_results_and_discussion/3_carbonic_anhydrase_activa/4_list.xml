  <p>A special mention should be done for phenol derivatives 
   <bold>14–16</bold> which, uniquely among amino alcohols 
   <bold>1–16</bold>, did not produce any activation of the tested hCAs. In fact, it is worth stressing that CAI properties, rather than as CAAs, are commonly ascribed to the phenolic chemotype. Phenols have been thoroughly reported to anchor to the zinc-bound nucleophile (water molecule or hydroxide ion), that is, by one of the four CA inhibition mechanisms known to date. Surprisingly, neither a significant inhibition was detected by treating CA I, II, IV and VII with phenols 
   <bold>14</bold>–
   <bold>16</bold>. One could speculate that the CAI efficacy of 
   <bold>14–16</bold> is counterpoised by their CAA action, hindering its detection by the Stopped Flow assay.

  <p>The cytosolic isoform hCA I was moderately activated by all remaining amino alcohols, that are 
   <bold>1–13</bold>, with K
   <sub>A</sub> values in the range of 0.92–12.1 µM. The 
   <italic>tert</italic>-butylamino derivatives 
   <bold>1–8</bold> induce a slightly greater activation of CA I than isopropylamines 
   <bold>9–13</bold>. In the 
   <bold>1–8</bold> subset, it can be noted that the 
   <italic>o-</italic> or 
   <italic>p-</italic>substitution of the aromatic ring bearing the oxime ether group lower the K
   <sub>A</sub> values 
   <bold>4</bold>, 
   <bold>6</bold>, 
   <bold>8</bold> up to fivefold with respect to 
   <bold>2</bold> (K
   <sub>A</sub>s of 1.37, 1.26 and 0.92 vs 4.25 µM). In contrast, 
   <italic>m</italic>-substitutions are deleterious for the binding to the target as in 
   <bold>5</bold> and 
   <bold>7</bold> (K
   <sub>A</sub>s of 7.10 and 6.02 µM). The cyclisation of the oxime ether group to the aromatic ring as in 
   <bold>1</bold> led to the second-best CA I activation after 
   <bold>8</bold> (K
   <sub>A</sub>s of 0.94 vs 0.92 µM).

  <p>The physiologically most relevant isoform hCA II was activated by most tested amino alcohols more than hCA I (K
   <sub>A</sub>s in the range 0.079–7.19 µM), except for compounds 
   <bold>4</bold> and 
   <bold>13</bold> (K
   <sub>A</sub>s of 6.35 vs 5.90 µM). Surprisingly, the 
   <italic>m-</italic>anisole derivative 
   <bold>5</bold> reported a 100-fold enhancement of activation efficacy of hCA II when compared to hCA I (K
   <sub>A</sub>s of 0.079 vs 7.10 µM). Most remaining 
   <italic>tert</italic>-butylamino derivatives showed submicromolar K
   <sub>A</sub> values, whereas all compounds of the subset 
   <bold>9–13</bold> activate hCA II in a low micromolar range (K
   <sub>A</sub>s in the range 1.94–5.90 µM). All CAAs reported here were more active towards hCA II than histamine, which is a quite weak activator of this isoform with a K
   <sub>A</sub> of 125 µM.

  <p>No submicromolar K
   <sub>A</sub> values were measured for amino alcohols 
   <bold>1–13</bold> as hCA IV activators. Indeed, all K
   <sub>A</sub>s are in a rather flat low micromolar range (K
   <sub>A</sub>s in the range 1.01–12.9 µM), making such a membrane associated isozyme the less activated by the assayed derivatives. Notably, the reference CAA histamine even less activates hCA IV with a K
   <sub>A</sub> of 25.3 µM. No significant differences exist between 
   <italic>tert</italic>-butyl and isopropyl derivatives as for the activation of hCA IV.

  <p>The other cytosolic isoform investigated here, hCA VII, was rather potently activated, that is chiefly in a submicromolar range, by most of the compounds reported in this work (K
   <sub>A</sub>s in the range 0.082–8.86 µM). All derivatives showed much better activation profile than the reference histamine (K
   <sub>A</sub> of 37.6 µM) towards hCA VII. Contrariwise to the other hCAs tested, the most efficient CAAs are the isopropylamino derivatives 
   <bold>9</bold> and 
   <bold>10</bold>, ethers of secondary oxime with an aliphatic pendant showing medium nanomolar K
   <sub>A</sub>s values of 82 and 91 nM, respectively. Only the oxime ethers of 
   <italic>p-</italic>anisaldehyde and acetone in the isopropylamino and 
   <italic>tert</italic>-butylamino series, respectively, that are compounds 
   <bold>4</bold> and 
   <bold>11</bold>, show K
   <sub>A</sub>s steadily in a low micromolar range. As this isoform is one of the most widely spread in the brain, and probably involved in crucial metabolic/pH regulation processes, these results are of interest in the search of more effective CA VII activators than the currently available such derivatives.
