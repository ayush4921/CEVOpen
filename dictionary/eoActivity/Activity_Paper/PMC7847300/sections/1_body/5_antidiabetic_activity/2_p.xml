<p id="Par62">For this purpose, Ikegai et al. synthesized a series of C-glucosides with azulene in the aglycon moiety, starting from a previously examined compound 
 <bold>52</bold> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Expected inhibitory activity toward human sodium-glucose transport protein 1 (hSGLT1) and human sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (hSGLT2) was evaluated in vitro using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) expressing hSGLT1 or hSGLT2. The researchers measured IC
 <sub>50</sub> values regarding to hSGLT2 and selectivity versus hSGLT1 of the essential compounds: 
 <bold>52</bold> (99 nM, 140 fold), 
 <bold>53</bold> (22 nM, 590 fold), 
 <bold>54</bold> (8.9 nm, 280 fold) in at least two independent experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). Moreover, preclinical tests on KK/A
 <sup>y</sup> type 2 diabetic mice were conducted to confirm the antihyperglycemic effect of 
 <bold>53</bold> in vivo. This test showed that a single oral administration of 
 <bold>53</bold> with a dose 3 mg/kg reduced blood glucose levels significantly by 46% compared to the vehicle. Afterward, the optimization of molecule 
 <bold>53</bold> was performed, leading to the synthesis of 
 <bold>54</bold>, which was finally chosen as the most promising compound from the whole series and proposed to reach clinical trial in the form of mono choline salt 
 <bold>55</bold>, named YM543. Pharmacokinetics studies on normal rats were carried out to assess this compound in the living organism. Results obtained after administering a single 1.0 mg/kg dose intravenously or a single 3 mg/kg dose orally revealed fast oral absorption with 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> 0.5 h, bioavailability 29%, clearance 2483 L/h/kg, the volume of distribution 3360 L/kg. Renal drug concentration was 23 times higher than that in plasma. Oral administration of 0.3–3.0 mg/kg dose of 
 <bold>54</bold> resulted in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion that lasted over 12 h for the dose of 0.3 mg/kg or higher. Moreover, the compound exhibited potent and long-lasting antihyperglycemic activity in both streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ rats, type 1 diabetes model) and KK/A
 <sup>y</sup> mice without decreases into the hypoglycaemic range.
