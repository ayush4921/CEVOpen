<p id="Par40">One of the greatest achievements of mankind in the field of medicine was the invention of antibiotics about 100 years ago. Recent years have not revealed many new discoveries in the field of new antibacterial drugs, and more bacterial strains resistant to available antibiotics have appeared. Therefore, there is an increasing risk that the advent of the post-antibiotic era will see decreasing access to new drugs and therapies against pathogenic microorganisms [

Another significant problem the world has to tackle is how to deal with outbreaks of dangerous viruses in our environment, which affect human life such as AIDS or epidemics like Spanish flu in 1918, SARS in 2002–2004, MERS in 2012, and COVID19 in 2019–2021 [

It seems that the azulene derivatives presented below could provide new insights and solutions to these issues. Various modifications of the azulene system of potential antiviral and antimicrobial activity are discussed below (Fig.
