<p id="Par48">Related potential applications of azulene derivatives were presented by Yokota et al., who focused on finding thromboxane A

These tests enabled SAR analysis and selection of 6-mono- and 6-dihydroxylated-isopropylazulene derivatives of 4-chlorobenzenesulfonamide 3-substituted azulene derivatives for the in vivo experiments in mice. The results of the in vivo experiment showed that pre-treatment with
