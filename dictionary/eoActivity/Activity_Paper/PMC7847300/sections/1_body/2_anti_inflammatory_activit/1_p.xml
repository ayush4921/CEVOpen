<p id="Par45">Inflammation is a physiological reaction of an organism exposed to stress factors such as tissue damage, injuries, cancers, and arthritis. In case of minor contusions and sports injuries, especially in young people, inflammation is even welcome because it helps tissues heal [

The two most important groups of anti-inflammatory drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), working through cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibiting mechanism, and glucocorticoids, which suppress the immune response and inhibit the synthesis of two main products of inflammation: prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Unfortunately, both groups cause many side effects, and because of that, new approaches in the therapy of chronic inflammation are considered necessary. Various modifications of azulene derivatives of potential anti-inflammatory activity have already been obtained and are discussed below (Fig.
