<p id="Par47">Azulene scaffold can be encountered among compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza var. alba</italic> roots, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Ma et al. evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of tanshinones isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> var. 
 <italic>alba</italic> roots in THP-1 macrophages [
