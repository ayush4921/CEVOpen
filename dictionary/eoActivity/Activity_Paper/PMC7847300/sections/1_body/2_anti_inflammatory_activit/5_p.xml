<p id="Par49">Ozimec Landek et al. synthesized two series of azulene compounds fused with two benzene rings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and analyzed the influence of new compounds on tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production. TNF-α can be considered an important inflammatory factor. In these series of derivatives, two carbon atoms of azulene scaffold were replaced with heteroatoms, mainly sulfur. Both series of 1-thia- and 2-thiaazulene derivatives showed in vitro potency to inhibit TNF-α production in lipopolysaccharide activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells assay. Compounds 
 <bold>16–21</bold> belonging to series with aminoalkoxy chain at C-2 position showed potency to inhibit TNF-α production in vitro in low micromolar range with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the most potent compounds in the range of 1–3 µM. However, none of these compounds exhibited the ability to inhibit other important inflammation factors like p38 kinase or COX-2 enzyme.
