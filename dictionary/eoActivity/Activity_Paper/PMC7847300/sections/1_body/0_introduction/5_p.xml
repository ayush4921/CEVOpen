 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, since azulene compounds originate from medicinal plants, they draw the attention of researchers seeking new active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Herbs containing terpenes have been applied in medicine since ancient times. Azulene derivatives occur naturally in mushrooms e.g., 
 <italic>Lactarius indigo</italic>. Chamazulene can be found in camomile, wormwood, or achillea oil and is known for antiallergic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory applications. These compounds have also revealed themselves to have some cosmetic uses, especially in soothing creams and ointments [

Photophobia and phonophobia occurring during migraine without aura were also effectively treated. Both of the aforementioned effects were confirmed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [
