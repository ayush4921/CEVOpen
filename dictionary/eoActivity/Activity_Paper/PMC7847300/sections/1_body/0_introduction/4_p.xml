<p id="Par37">Azulene 
 <bold>2</bold> and its derivatives guaiazulene 
 <bold>3</bold> and chamazulene 
 <bold>4</bold> are aromatic hydrocarbons with unique chemical structure, physicochemical and biological properties. The azulene molecule consists of two condensed rings, cyclopentadiene and cycloheptatriene, and possesses 10π electrons, so it obeys Hückel’s rule. Moreover, azulene with its deep blue color is isomeric with colorless naphthalene and intensively absorbs light in the range of 500–700 nm [
