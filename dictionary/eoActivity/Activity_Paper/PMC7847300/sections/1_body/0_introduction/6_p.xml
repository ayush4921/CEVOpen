<p id="Par39">Azulene is a very interesting scaffold for medicinal chemistry applications as it resembles bicyclic aromatics existing in many drugs. Moreover, it can be considered a structural isomer of naphthalene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Modifications of azulene and its derivatives rely on substituents’ addition or their conjugation with other biologically active molecules. Introducing substituents to the core of terpene can increase its solubility, modify absorption, and metabolism. However, the idea of its combining with other active compounds, pharmacophores, or moieties can lead to more profound results. The concept of creating molecular conjugates, hybrids, dimers, and other consortia brought drug discovery science to an entirely new unexplored dimension, which has been lately reviewed by Pawełczyk et al. [

Therefore, we present different azulene derivatives and conjugates, including selected molecular consortia, which exhibite attractive potential for medicine and pharmacy. Potential applications of these compounds’ concern various areas of medicine, including anti-inflammatory with peptic ulcers, antineoplastic with leukemia, antidiabetes, antiretroviral with HIV-1, antimicrobial with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, and antifungal (Fig.
