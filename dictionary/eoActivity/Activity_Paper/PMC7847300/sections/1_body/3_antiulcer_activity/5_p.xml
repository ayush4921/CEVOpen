<p id="Par54">Cao et al. studied antigastric ulcer activity in vivo of guaiazulene derivatives on 221 mice divided into 28 groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. They obtained guaiazulene sulfonate derivatives with a double sulphonylamino motif due to piperazine presence and studied their antigastric ulcer activity through an ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model method. All studied guaiazulene derivatives presented antigastric ulcer activity. It is worth noting that compounds 
 <bold>39â€“46</bold>, showed a significant reduction of gastric ulcers, whereas the most promising compounds 
 <bold>39</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, 
 <bold>43</bold> exhibited even better antiulcer activity than the first-line drug omeprazole (Fig.
