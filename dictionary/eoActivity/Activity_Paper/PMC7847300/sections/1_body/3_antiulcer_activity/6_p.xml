<p id="Par55">The researchers also provided SAR analysis. Many parameters such as topological polar surface area (TPSA), octanolâ€“water partitioning coefficient (log 
 <italic>P</italic>), molecular molar refractivity (MR), calculated partition coefficient (Clog P), molecular weight (MW) were taken into account and compared. Unfortunately, there were not enough data to prove the correlation between the mentioned parameters and biological activity. Nonetheless, the authors noted some dependencies. For example, compounds possessing two sulphonylamino moieties revealed better activity than other compounds. In general, derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents exhibited better activity than molecules with electron-donating groups, whereas the bromine element played an important role in enhancing activity. The mechanism of action of guaiazulene derivatives is not known at the moment. Scientists proposed two probable explanations: surface coverage and multifunctional group synergistic mechanisms.
