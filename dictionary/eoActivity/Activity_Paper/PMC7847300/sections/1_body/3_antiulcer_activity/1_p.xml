One of the most important groups of drugs used in the treatment of peptic ulcers is called proton-pump-inhibitors (PPIs) and comprises molecules like omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole. PPI is the most effective group of drugs used to diminish hydrochloric acid release in the stomach. Even PPIs, which are considered safe, cause side effects. Therefore, new classes of antiulcer drugs are desirable. The success of Egualen, which is a sodium salt of 3-ethyl-7-propan-2-yl-azulene-1-sulfonic acid applied in the treatment of gastric ulcers in Japan under the tradename Azuloxa [
