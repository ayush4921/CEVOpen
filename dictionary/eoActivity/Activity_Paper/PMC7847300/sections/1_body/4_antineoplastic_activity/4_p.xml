<p id="Par59">Hong et al. synthesized a group of 14 azulene-indoles using a microwave-assisted method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. After that, an evaluation of their in vitro activity against 60 human cancer cell lines, including melanoma, leukemia, lung, colon, renal, ovarian, central nervous system, breast, and prostate lines, was performed according to standard National Cancer Institute protocols. Results indicated that compound 
 <bold>49</bold> could be considered a potent inhibitor of EKVX non-small cell lung cancer cell line growth with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.00 µM and HS578T breast cancer cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.93 µM. Also, other compounds 
 <bold>48</bold> and 
 <bold>50</bold> showed interesting antineoplastic activity. Molecule 
 <bold>48</bold> was found a selective and potent growth inhibitor of K-562 leukemia cancer cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.51 µM, and revealed good inhibition properties in HOP-92 non-small cell lung cancer cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.38 µM. Azulene derivative 
 <bold>50</bold> presented good potential against HOP 92 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.56 µM and PC-3 prostate cancer cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.41 µM. The mechanism of action of the compounds mentioned above was not indicated.
