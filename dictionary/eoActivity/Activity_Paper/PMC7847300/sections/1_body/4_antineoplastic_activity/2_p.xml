<p id="Par57">Azulene moiety, as an element of molecular consortia, raises great hope for effective anticancer drugs. Photodynamic activation with red laser light and guaiazulene revealed the generation of singlet oxygen and suppression of inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [

 <italic>Artemisia arborescens</italic> plants collected in Sicily showed promising activity on studied melanoma cancer cells with potential to trigger apoptotic death [
