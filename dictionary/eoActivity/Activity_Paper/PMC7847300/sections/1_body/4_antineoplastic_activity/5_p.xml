<p id="Par60">A very interesting study on a series of azulene derivatives as potent multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or gastrointestinal stomach tumors (GIST) was performed by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. After synthesis and screening tests, compound 
 <bold>51</bold> presented high cytotoxicity against human peripheral blood cell line MV4-11 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the submicromolar range. Simultaneously, it also inhibited KDR, cKIT, PDGFRβ, and FLT-3 receptors. Afterward, scientists analyzed the pharmacokinetics of 
 <bold>51</bold> in rats and measured the essential parameters after administering its single intravenous or oral dose. The next experiment was conducted on human leukemia MV4-11 xenografts in BALB/c nude mice and revealed that on the 30th day after the beginning of treatment, using 50 mg/kg dose twice a day, tumor growth inhibition by 
 <bold>51</bold> was 99 ± 0.82%. The results indicate that compound 
 <bold>51</bold> has a great potential to become a perspective antileukemia agent, and it can undoubtedly move to the next phase of research—clinical trial. Therefore it can be considered as a potent FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitor and antileukemia agent.
