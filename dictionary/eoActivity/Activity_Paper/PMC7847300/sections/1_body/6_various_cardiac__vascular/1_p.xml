<p id="Par63">An interesting study was provided by Löber et al., who developed the synthesis path of azulene derivatives and assessed their affinities for the monoaminergic G protein-coupled receptors, including dopamine, serotonin, histamine, α-adrenergic receptor subtypes, and performed SAR analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The authors synthesized a series of azulenylmethylpiperazines inspired by previously examined compound FAUC 3019, a partial agonist of dopamine D
 <sub>4</sub> receptor with a potential application in therapy of erectile dysfunction. Receptor binding properties were tested in vitro on Chinese hamster ovary cells. In vivo test of the most promising molecule 
 <bold>56</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>) was conducted on 32 male rats. Compound 
 <bold>56</bold> proved to induce penile erection in male rats after systemic (subcutaneous, sc) administration and injection into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In low concentrations, the effectiveness of 
 <bold>56</bold> was better than that of the reference—apomorphine. Azulene derivative 
 <bold>56</bold> revealed excellent D
 <sub>4</sub> receptor affinity, good selectivity, and was considered as D
 <sub>4</sub> partial agonist with EC
 <sub>50</sub> at 0.41 nM. The rationale for incorporation of azulene moiety into novel compounds can be explained by the specific charge distribution within this molecule with a significant negative molecular electrostatic field (MEP) below and above the five-membered ring, and a positive MEP at the seven-membered ring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, the large dipole moment of azulenes made molecule 
 <bold>56</bold> easily recognizable for the dopaminergic D
 <sub>4</sub> receptor. The results proved that the new compound 
 <bold>56</bold> could be considered for further study towards erectile dysfunction. Nevertheless, more study in this field is needed, including comparative research on the effectiveness and safety profile of newly synthesized compound 
 <bold>56</bold> and already approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with first-line drugs like sildenafil and tadalafil.
