<p id="Par66">Although new azulene derivatives come from synthetic reactions in the laboratory, the plethora of their derivatives are still present in various plants. An excellent illustration of this is ergosterol ganotheaecolin A (
 <bold>68</bold>), found in mushroom 
 <italic>Ganoderma theaecolum</italic> by Luo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The fungus is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of neurological disorders. After isolation and confirmation of structure, scientists conducted for this molecule in vitro evaluation of neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in PC12 cells, using NGF as control. The results indicated that 
 <bold>68</bold> could stimulate cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and reached the maximum effect at 10 µM. Much research still needs to be performed in this area, but 
 <bold>68</bold> revealed the potential to become a cure for neurological diseases in the future.
