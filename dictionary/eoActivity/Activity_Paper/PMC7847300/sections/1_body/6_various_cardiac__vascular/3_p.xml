<p id="Par65">The orexin system is critical in terms of sleep–wake regulation, stress response, and insomnia. Therefore there is interest in small molecular potentiators that enhance the effects of endogenous neuropeptides, especially orexin-A and orexin-B. In another study, Leino et al. screened a library of 70,000 synthetically accessible azulene-based compounds targeting orexin-based receptors [
