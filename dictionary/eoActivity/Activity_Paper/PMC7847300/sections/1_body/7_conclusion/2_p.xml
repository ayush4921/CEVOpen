<p id="Par68">Azulene, chamazulene, and guaiazulene have been known for ages and widely applied in medicine. In this review, we presented new potential applications of their derivatives in medicine and pharmacy. Azulene scaffold exhibits an interesting perspective for medicinal chemistry as it can be considered a structural isomer of naphthalene. Therefore, introducing the bicyclic azulene hydrocarbon into various molecular consortia leads to compounds with a vast spectrum of biological activities. The azulene derivatives may be potentially applied in the therapy of peptic ulcers, leukemia, lung cancer, diabetes, and various viral, fungal, and microbial infections. In this review, we presented many biological studies, which were performed in vitro on various cell lines, e.g., PBMCs, U2OS, TZM-bl, EKVX, HS578T, K-562, HOP-92, PC-3, MV4-11, CHO, (CHO)-K1, PC12, and in vivo on rats and mice. The most promising applications of azulene derivatives were proposed for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. It is worth noting that in the biological study, some of the azulene derivatives revealed even better antiulcer activity than a reference drug omeprazole. Another promising biological activity of azulene derivatives was their influence on the growth of selected cancer cell lines e.g., K-562 leukemia cancer cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value on the micromolar level. Azulene scaffold also creates perspective applications for diabetes treatment. To sum up, many structures that contain azulene moiety can be considered as candidates for drugs. Nevertheless, more research in the area of toxicity needs to be carried out before moving to clinical trials and the market.
