<p id="Par67">Terpenes constitute a large family of organic compounds produced mainly in biochemical processes, starting from isoprene moiety. The most important example of this group is vitamin A which is involved in many biochemical processes such as vision, gene transcription, immune function, hematopoiesis, embryonic development, and reproduction. Another important terpenic compound is squalene, a precursor of cholesterol, bile acid, vitamin D, and steroid hormones. In nature, terpenes often serve as plant protection from microorganisms, parasites, or herbivores, and because of that, many biologically-active terpenes are obtained from plants. To the terpene family created by nature belong, among others: lycopene, botulin, menthol, thymol, camphor, paclitaxel, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, chamazulene, and guaiazulene. Most terpenes reveal a long list of traditional uses in herbal extracts due to their anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, or antibacterial activity.</p>
