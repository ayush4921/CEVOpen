Azulene derivatives, including guaiazulene or chamazulene, occur in nature as components of many plants and mushrooms, such as <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>, <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic>, <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, and <italic>Lactarius indigo</italic>. Due to physicochemical properties, azulene and its derivatives have found many potential applications in technology, especially in optoelectronic devices. In medicine, the ingredients of these plants have been widely used for hundreds of years in antiallergic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory therapies. Herein, the applications of azulene, its derivatives and their conjugates with biologically active compounds are presented. The potential use of these compounds concerns various areas of medicine, including anti-inflammatory with peptic ulcers, antineoplastic with leukemia, antidiabetes, antiretroviral with HIV-1, antimicrobial, including antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, and antifungal.</p><p id="Par2"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="44_2021_2701_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/></p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Azulene</kwd><kwd>Chamazulene</kwd><kwd>Conjugates</kwd><kwd>Medicinal chemistry</kwd><kwd>Molecular consortia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015/19/N/NZ7/01342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lijewski</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par34">Terpenes constitute a large family of organic compounds produced mainly in biochemical processes, starting from isoprene moiety <bold>1</bold> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Examples of great importance in the animal world are carotenoids and vitamin A, which play a crucial role in numerous highly advanced biochemical processes in the human body. Vitamin A is known for improving many functions, including vision, gene transcription, immunity, hematopoiesis, embryonic development, and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Another terpenic compound is squalene, a precursor of steroids, such as cholesterol, bile acid, vitamin D, and steroid hormones. A critical biochemical pathway that allows organisms to produce cholesterol-engaging squalene is the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Isoprene moiety <bold>1</bold>, azulene <bold>2</bold>, and its derivatives - guaiazulene <bold>3</bold>, chamazulene <bold>4</bold>.

Lycopene is a red carotenoid obtained from tomatoes and has proven to decrease risk factors, like LDL-cholesterol and IL-6, in cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another example is botulin, which is a triterpene revealing anticancer properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and also demonstrating an ability to inhibit sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). In this second way, it influences the reduction of biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In nature, terpenes also serve as a form of protection for plants from microorganisms, parasites, and herbivores.</p><p id="Par36">Many terpenes exhibit biological activity and are used in the pharmaceutical industry. Essential oils obtained from plants e.g., menthol, thymol, and camphor, are active ingredients in nasal decongestants, chest creams, and cough medicines. They also act as antipruritics and anty-itching agents, due to their analgesic properties. Essential oils can also play a role as penetration enhancers in transdermal drug delivery systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Triterpenoid compounds like oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and their derivatives show anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Noteworthy is paclitaxel, which is an anticancer drug isolated from <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic>, and is also a diterpenoid belonging to the group of terpenes. What is more, it is approved for breast cancer treatment, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Azulene <bold>2</bold> and its derivatives guaiazulene <bold>3</bold> and chamazulene <bold>4</bold> are aromatic hydrocarbons with unique chemical structure, physicochemical and biological properties. The azulene molecule consists of two condensed rings, cyclopentadiene and cycloheptatriene, and possesses 10&#x003c0; electrons, so it obeys H&#x000fc;ckel&#x02019;s rule. Moreover, azulene with its deep blue color is isomeric with colorless naphthalene and intensively absorbs light in the range of 500&#x02013;700&#x02009;nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Azulene derivatives, due to their extraordinary physicochemical properties, have been proposed for many potential technical applications, such as molecular switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], components of various optoelectronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, since azulene compounds originate from medicinal plants, they draw the attention of researchers seeking new active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Herbs containing terpenes have been applied in medicine since ancient times. Azulene derivatives occur naturally in mushrooms e.g., <italic>Lactarius indigo</italic>. Chamazulene can be found in camomile, wormwood, or achillea oil and is known for antiallergic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory applications. These compounds have also revealed themselves to have some cosmetic uses, especially in soothing creams and ointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Chamomile oil oleogel formulation has been proven to be efficient against many different ailments, including pain, nausea, and vomiting. Photophobia and phonophobia occurring during migraine without aura were also effectively treated. Both of the aforementioned effects were confirmed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Guaiazulene, as an ingredient of local pomade, has provided rapid recovery in risky neonates with recalcitrant diaper dermatitis without any side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Azulene is a very interesting scaffold for medicinal chemistry applications as it resembles bicyclic aromatics existing in many drugs. Moreover, it can be considered a structural isomer of naphthalene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Modifications of azulene and its derivatives rely on substituents&#x02019; addition or their conjugation with other biologically active molecules. Introducing substituents to the core of terpene can increase its solubility, modify absorption, and metabolism. However, the idea of its combining with other active compounds, pharmacophores, or moieties can lead to more profound results. The concept of creating molecular conjugates, hybrids, dimers, and other consortia brought drug discovery science to an entirely new unexplored dimension, which has been lately reviewed by Pawe&#x00142;czyk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, we present different azulene derivatives and conjugates, including selected molecular consortia, which exhibite attractive potential for medicine and pharmacy. Potential applications of these compounds&#x02019; concern various areas of medicine, including anti-inflammatory with peptic ulcers, antineoplastic with leukemia, antidiabetes, antiretroviral with HIV-1, antimicrobial with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, and antifungal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Azulene, its derivatives, and potential applications in medicine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="44_2021_2701_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e577"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Antiviral and antimicrobial activity</title><p id="Par40">One of the greatest achievements of mankind in the field of medicine was the invention of antibiotics about 100 years ago. Recent years have not revealed many new discoveries in the field of new antibacterial drugs, and more bacterial strains resistant to available antibiotics have appeared. Therefore, there is an increasing risk that the advent of the post-antibiotic era will see decreasing access to new drugs and therapies against pathogenic microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Another significant problem the world has to tackle is how to deal with outbreaks of dangerous viruses in our environment, which affect human life such as AIDS or epidemics like Spanish flu in 1918, SARS in 2002&#x02013;2004, MERS in 2012, and COVID19 in 2019&#x02013;2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Because of the above-mentioned problems, the development of new antibacterial and antiviral compounds is crucial. It seems that the azulene derivatives presented below could provide new insights and solutions to these issues. Various modifications of the azulene system of potential antiviral and antimicrobial activity are discussed below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Possible modifications of azulene derivatives of antiviral and antimicrobial potential</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="44_2021_2701_Fig3_HTML" id="d32e600"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">As an introduction to the application of azulene and its derivatives in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PACT), some observations on the toxicity of these molecules, mainly related to the revealed phototoxic properties, should be considered. Such a study was performed by Chiang et al., who examined these natural products in terms of generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) after excitation with UVA light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Damrongrungruang et al. investigated azulene&#x02019;s effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) viability and singlet oxygen formation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. They found out that azulene at concentrations 5&#x02013;500&#x02009;&#x000b5;M when activated with light-emitting diode at 625&#x02009;nm and light dose 4.2&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup> induced singlet oxygen generation. Another conclusion was that PBMCs viability was significantly reduced by azulene at a concentration of 15&#x02009;&#x000b5;M and red light densities of 4.2, 100, or 200&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The suggested mechanism of photodynamic reaction with azulene as photosensitizer was proceeding via the generation of ROS, which further caused damage to intercellular structures, including DNA. The authors noted that a few improvements are necessary for further development of PDT in medicine, especially the length of irradiation time. The effects of azulene-light-oxygen action were analyzed in PACT study by Hayek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. They performed microbial reduction in ligature-induced periimplantitis in dogs using azulene as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy approach and found it equally efficient as conventional infection treatment. Also, PACT was found to be less invasive in comparison to other approaches. This study showed that <italic>Prevotella sp</italic>., <italic>Fusobacterium sp</italic>., and <italic>Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus</italic> were significantly reduced in both groups. During the treatment, 400&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of azulene 25% solution w/v was applied in the form of a paste based on 10% urea peroxide, 15% tween 80 in 75% carbowax as a vehicle. The 0.01% (w/w) concentration of azulene in the paste was situated on scanned surfaces and exposed to diode GaAlAs laser operating at the wavelength of 660&#x02009;nm and light dose 40&#x02009;mW for 180&#x02009;s. The authors did not note any therapeutic effect without light activation, which indicates that azulene antimicrobial properties rely on photodynamic mechanisms. After treatment, no significant differences were observed between the groups, which suggests that photodynamic therapy is a noninvasive method that could be used to reduce microorganisms in peri-implantitis. Recently, Nagai et al. demonstrated that azulenocyanine revealed the photodynamic antimicrobial effect on human infected dentine plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the study, dentin plates extracted from human molars were infected through immersion in a solution of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. In the treatment procedure with 0.01% azulenocyanine (0.1&#x02009;ml) after 5&#x02009;min period in darkness, the 1.5&#x02009;W laser irradiation at 940&#x02009;nm revealed the best results in terms of bactericidal effects by reduction of the colony count assay (CFU/ml) and by the ATP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Despite photodynamic studies presented above, azulene and its derivatives demonstrated their own potential against viruses and microbes. In the study performed by Peet et al., 18 azulene derivatives were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-1 assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The authors researched the cytotoxicity of the compounds on the U2OS cell line. The least toxic compounds were examined in the first screening phase of the antiviral activity test using HIV-1-based virus-like particles for safe, sensitive, and fast evaluation of the antiretroviral activity. The highest potential was found for 2-hydroxyazulenes <bold>5&#x02013;7</bold> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which were selected for the second phase of antiviral test to develop the inhibition of infectious HIV-1 virus replication TZM-bl cells. Finally, compound <bold>5</bold> was not active against the HIV-1 virus, but azulene derivatives <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold> were recognized as active with the best score for <bold>7</bold> with IC<sub>50</sub> at 8.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M and selectivity index 7. The antiretroviral activities of azulene derivatives <bold>5&#x02013;7</bold> were explained by the inhibition of reverse transcriptase. However, the authors did not exclude other antiviral mechanisms. Following the obtained results, the azulene derivatives can be considered as potential candidates for the development of antiretroviral agents.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of 2-hydroxyazulene derivatives <bold>5&#x02013;7</bold> and heterocyclic organobismuth(III) carboxylates with azulene moieties <bold>8&#x02013;12</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="44_2021_2701_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e682"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">The antimicrobial study was based on selected fungi and bacteria.

In case of minor contusions and sports injuries, especially in young people, inflammation is even welcome because it helps tissues heal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, when inflammation becomes chronic, some therapeutic actions are needed. The two most important groups of anti-inflammatory drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), working through cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibiting mechanism, and glucocorticoids, which suppress the immune response and inhibit the synthesis of two main products of inflammation: prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Unfortunately, both groups cause many side effects, and because of that, new approaches in the therapy of chronic inflammation are considered necessary. Various modifications of azulene derivatives of potential anti-inflammatory activity have already been obtained and are discussed below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Possible modifications of azulene derivatives of anti-inflammatory potential; TNF-&#x003b1; - tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, IL-1b/IL-8&#x02014;interleukins 1b and 8, TXA<sub>2</sub>/PGH<sub>2</sub>&#x02014;thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>/prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="44_2021_2701_Fig5_HTML" id="d32e727"/></fig></p><p id="Par46">Plants traditionally used in medicine, e.g., camomile (<italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>) and yarrow (<italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>), exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect due to the presence of azulene derivatives.

Moreover, a study performed by Ma and coworkers showed that chamazulene significantly protects against complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant-induced osteoarthritic inflammation in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, chamazulene can be recommended as a therapeutic agent for clinical trials against osteoarthritic inflammation. Also, the combinations of azulene derivatives with various molecules reveal attractive anti-inflammatory potential. For example, Nihei et al. studied the efficacy of a combination of sodium azulene sulfonate and L-glutamine to treat oral mucositis caused by anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Patients using sodium azulene sulfonate L-glutamine suspension as a mouthwash three times a day, reported fewer or less severe cases of mucositis in comparison to a control group. Considering its high level of safety and lack of alternatives available to fight oral mucositis induced by anticancer treatment, this procedure seems to offer the chance for the patients to have a better quality of life while fighting cancer.</p><p id="Par47">Azulene scaffold can be encountered among compounds isolated from <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza var. alba</italic> roots, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

One of the most important groups of drugs used in the treatment of peptic ulcers is called proton-pump-inhibitors (PPIs) and comprises molecules like omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole. PPI is the most effective group of drugs used to diminish hydrochloric acid release in the stomach. Even PPIs, which are considered safe, cause side effects. Therefore, new classes of antiulcer drugs are desirable.

The most important example of this group is vitamin A which is involved in many biochemical processes such as vision, gene transcription, immune function, hematopoiesis, embryonic development, and reproduction. Another important terpenic compound is squalene, a precursor of cholesterol, bile acid, vitamin D, and steroid hormones. In nature, terpenes often serve as plant protection from microorganisms, parasites, or herbivores, and because of that, many biologically-active terpenes are obtained from plants. To the terpene family created by nature belong, among others: lycopene, botulin, menthol, thymol, camphor, paclitaxel, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, chamazulene, and guaiazulene. Most terpenes reveal a long list of traditional uses in herbal extracts due to their anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, or antibacterial activity.</p><p id="Par68">Azulene, chamazulene, and guaiazulene have been known for ages and widely applied in medicine. In this review, we presented new potential applications of their derivatives in medicine and pharmacy. Azulene scaffold exhibits an interesting perspective for medicinal chemistry as it can be considered a structural isomer of naphthalene. Therefore, introducing the bicyclic azulene hydrocarbon into various molecular consortia leads to compounds with a vast spectrum of biological activities. The azulene derivatives may be potentially applied in the therapy of peptic ulcers, leukemia, lung cancer, diabetes, and various viral, fungal, and microbial infections. In this review, we presented many biological studies, which were performed in vitro on various cell lines, e.g., PBMCs, U2OS, TZM-bl, EKVX, HS578T, K-562, HOP-92, PC-3, MV4-11, CHO, (CHO)-K1, PC12, and in vivo on rats and mice. The most promising applications of azulene derivatives were proposed for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. It is worth noting that in the biological study, some of the azulene derivatives revealed even better antiulcer activity than a reference drug omeprazole. Another promising biological activity of azulene derivatives was their influence on the growth of selected cancer cell lines e.g., K-562 leukemia cancer cell line with IC<sub>50</sub> value on the micromolar level. Azulene scaffold also creates perspective applications for diabetes treatment. To sum up, many structures that contain azulene moiety can be considered as candidates for drugs. Nevertheless, more research in the area of toxicity needs to be carried out before moving to clinical trials and the market.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>These authors contributed equally:
