<p id="Par59">The average of the three replicate samples was used to generate the histograms of relative abundance (phylum and genus). R software (Version 2.15.3) was used for alpha diversity index and beta diversity analyses, rarefaction curve generation, Spearman correlation analysis of heat maps, Mantel tests and distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA). LEfSe software was used for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and effect size (LEfSe) analysis with the default filtering value of LDA score set at 4. Statistical analysis (including one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman correlation analysis) were performed with SPSS 19.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, USA), two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of different year and licorice species on the contents of bioactive compounds. Spearman correlations (r) were run among the bioactive compounds, the soil physicochemical properties and nutritional components of leaves.</p>
