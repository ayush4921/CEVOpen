<p id="Par42">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, there was a significant relationship between the dominant bacteria genus and the bioactive compounds of roots, soil physicochemical factors and leaf nutrition. Specifically, unidentified-
 <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic> had a significant positive correlation with SAN, GIA, GTF and LI, but a very significant negative correlation with CF; 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> had a significant positive correlation with PTK; 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> had a significant positive correlation with PTP; 
 <italic>Halomonas</italic> had a significant positive correlation with SNN, TS, PWC, PTK and CF, but a very significant negative correlation with SAN, GIA, GTF and LI; 
 <italic>Nocardiopsis</italic> had a significant positive correlation with TS, PWC, PTP, PTK and CF, but a very significant negative correlation with SAN, GIA, GTF and LI; 
 <italic>Novosphingobium</italic> had a significant negative correlation with PWC, but a very significant positive correlation with GTF; and 
 <italic>Sinomicrobium</italic> had significant positive correlation with SNN, PWC, PTK and CF, but a significant negative correlation with GIA, GTF and LI. It is worth noting that we found that the biomarkers with significant differences at the genus taxonomic level of the dominant bacterial community (including 
 <italic>Nocardiopsis</italic>, 
 <italic>Halomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Sinomicrobium</italic>) had a significant negative correlation with GIA, GTF, and LI (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. These results showed that the biomarkers with significant differences (except 
 <italic>Methylophaga</italic>) at each classification level were significantly negatively correlated with GIA, GTF, and LI, while all showed a significant positive correlation with PTK.
