 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Wilcox rank sum test based on the UniFrac distances showed significant differences in beta diversity between E.W and S.W (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), E.W and E.G (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), R.W and R.D (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and E.D and E.G (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), which indicated the existence of significant differences in endophytic bacterial community of roots of medicinal licorices between different species and different growing years.
