<p id="Par35">In addition, 
 <italic>t</italic>-test analysis of the two groups showed significant differences in the relative abundance of Tenericutes in samples E, G and W (

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, the relative abundance of Tenericutes in E.G was significantly higher than that in E.D, E.W and S.G (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The relative abundance of Tenericutes in E.D was significantly higher than that in E.W (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the relative abundance of Tenericutes in S.W was significantly higher than that in E.W (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These findings indicated significant differences in the relative abundance of Tenericutes among plant species and growing year (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
