<p id="Par28">Endophytic bacteria have been isolated from both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], ranging from woody plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], such as walnut and poplar, to herbaceous crop plants, such as rice and wheat. Modern molecular technology, especially high-throughput sequencing technology, has facilitated characterization of the composition and structure of microbial communities in different plants and has substantially increased our understanding of the composition and diversity of endophytic bacterial communities in the plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These techniques provide information more rapidly and accurately than conventional culturing methods, which are time-consuming and may not be applicable for microorganisms that cannot be cultured [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although high-throughput sequencing technology is still subject to several challenges in terms of analysis and visualization of genomic data that relies heavily on the performance of automated pipelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], these techniques can be applied to comprehensive analyses of plant tissues RNA and DNA sequencing and are within the reach of most laboratories. High-throughput sequencing based on the targeted phylogenetic marker 16S rRNA can be used to effectively characterize the diversity of microbial communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which makes it a practical approach to the isolation and identification of the community composition and diversity of endogenous bacteria in medicinal licorices.
