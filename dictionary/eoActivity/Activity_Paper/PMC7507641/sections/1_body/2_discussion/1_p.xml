<p id="Par44">In this study, we explored the effects of planting year (years 1, 2, and 3) and species of medicinal licorices (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>) on the accumulation of bioactive compounds. We found that the bioactive compounds were more affected by main effect planting year than main effect species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which is consistent with the results of Fan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. On the one hand, the bioactive compounds of medicinal plants are the products of physiological activities that occur in the process of cell specialization and maturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and their contents increase with the growth and development of plants. On the other hand, most of the active ingredients in medicinal plants are secondary metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (including phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and glycyrrhizin), which accumulate during plant growth and development to provide protection against pathogens and neighboring plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, plant growth and development are influenced by climatic conditions (rainfall regimen and temperature). Zoe Bont et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] demonstrated that plants can adapt to changing environments by adjusting the production and maintenance of compounds in their roots. Plants grown for 3 years in this study were subjected to two more years of climate variability than other sample plants, which can stimulate the accumulation of compounds in the roots and accelerate their resistance to environmental pressures. This is also one of reasons why growth year is a factor that influences the accumulation of bioactive compounds in the roots of medicinal plants.
