<p id="Par45">Similarly, the accumulation of bioactive compounds in medicinal licorice roots is easily affected by many factors. In this study, our results showed the components in leaves (PWC, POC, PTN, PTP, PTK and CF) were negatively correlated with the contents of glycyrrhizic acid (GIA), liquiritin (LI) and total flavonoids (GTF) in roots (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, these findings indicated that resource allocation and nutrient competition occur among roots and leaves of medicinal licorices. At the same time, we showed that the content of glycyrrhizic acid (GIA), liquiritin (LI) and total flavonoids (GTF) are negatively correlated with TS in soil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We speculate that this effect is mainly because the high concentration of salts (mostly ions like Na
 <sup>+</sup>) in the soil can decrease the uptake of water and nutrients by plants, as well as the rate of photosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], resulting in ion and osmotic stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], thus inhibited the accumulation of bioactive compounds. However, appropriate salt stress can increase the accumulation of bioactive compounds in licorice by upregulating proteins involved in the related biosynthesis pathways to stimulate the production of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin and total flavonoids and other bioactive compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Wan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Yang [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] et al. demonstrated that appropriate salt stress stimulated the glycometabolism of
