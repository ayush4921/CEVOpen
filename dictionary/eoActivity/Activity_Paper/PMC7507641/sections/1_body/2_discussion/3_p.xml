<p id="Par46">In addition, our results also showed that GIA, LI and GTF had a significant positive correlation with SAN, but have no significant correlation with SNN (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We speculate that this is related to the concentration of ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in soil and the efficiency of root absorption [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reported the highest content of total flavonoids (GTF) in the root of licorices when SNN: SAN was 0/100, which was significantly higher than that the contents when SNN: SAN was 100/0 and 50/50. These findings showed that different forms and ratios of nitrogen can affect the quality of

On the other hand, nitrogen fixation is a result of the symbiotic relationship between rhizobia and host plants, which can facilitate the absorption of nitrogen from the air and soil by host plants. Some studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] showed that rhizobia form nodules in the root of 
 <italic>glycyrrhiza</italic> by symbiosis and facilitate nitrogen fixation by the hosts in exchange for nutrients. The amount of nitrogen fixation by rhizobia is affected by the host’s demand and yield potential for nitrogen, the compatibility of both symbiotic partners and the availability of nitrogen in the soil. Therefore, clarifying the role of soil factors in the growth of medicinal licorices will provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and rational utilization of medicinal plants in production practice.
