  <p>Cladograms (
   <bold>a</bold>) and LDA value distribution histogram (
   <bold>b</bold>) in 27 samples. Description: In cladograms (
   <bold>a</bold>), the circle radiating from inside to outside represents the taxonomic level from the Phylum to the species. Each small circle at a different taxonomic level represents a taxonomic at that level, and the diameter of the small circle is proportionate to the relative abundance of species. The figure shows the species with LDA Score greater than the set value (default setting is 4) (
   <bold>b</bold>), that is, species with significant differences in different groups. The length of the histogram represents the size of the influence of species with significant differences. The English letters in the figure is the group name (E, R and S: years 1, 2, and 3, respectively; W, G and D: 
   <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
   <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, and 
   <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, respectively).
