<p id="p0040">This research was conducted in two stages. While, in the first stage, a list of herbs that are used for the treatment of flu in Turkish folk medicine is presented, in the second stage, it was investigated whether there are experimental studies of “anti-influenza” effects of the plants from this list in the world literature. Among these studies those with active compound determination were especially preferred. Various electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar, have been scanned for both studies. In the interest of the plant inventory survey, the national studies conducted in all regions (
