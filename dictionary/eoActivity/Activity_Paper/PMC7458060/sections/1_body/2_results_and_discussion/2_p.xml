Throughout our existence, human beings have always been in search of healing from plants in the fight against winter diseases, but clinical studies have to this point been limited. Although the following work is relatively new in Turkey, they are promising for future study:

Today, much more research is needed, as outbreaks such as SARS, avian influenza, swine influenza and COVID-19 threaten the existence of human beings every year.
