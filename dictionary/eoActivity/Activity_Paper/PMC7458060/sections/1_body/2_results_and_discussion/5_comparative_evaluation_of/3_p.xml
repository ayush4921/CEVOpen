<p id="p0140">As a matter of fact, similar results were obtained from studies conducted in 17 neighboring countries, comparing with the taxon list presented in the study, including especially 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> (11 countries with 64.7%), 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> (8 countrIes with 47.1%) and 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> (6 countries with 35.3%). While the similarity was seen mostly in Iraq (75.0%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (73.3%), and Cyprus (73.1%), the least similarity was seen in Montenegro (31.8%) and Israel (38.1%). This may due to the fact that, besides the resemblance of landforms, climate and vegetation, we lived together with the cultures of those countries during the Ottoman period for about 500 years. The reason for the low similarity in Israel and Montenegro may be due to the geographical distance as well as the difference of social-cultural habits, religious rituals, topography and flora (

 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> emerged as the plant used most in influenza treatment in 12 countries (70.6%) since the spreading area of this plant is very wide and it is very easy for the public to access and use (
