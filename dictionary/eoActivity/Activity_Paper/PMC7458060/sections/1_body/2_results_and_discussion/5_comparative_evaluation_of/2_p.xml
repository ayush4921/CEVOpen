<p id="p0135">16 taxa, such as 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> (with 46 references and 56.8%) and 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> (with 17 references and 21.0%) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , red color), have been identified as the most frequently cited plants. The reason why these herbs are highly cited may be a reflection of their stronger protective and therapeutic effects against flu; this may be the result of the experience gained in Turkish folk medicine for centuries. We would obviously see this when comparing similar studies between 17 geographically close countries (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, blue color). The emergence of the data presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> in a similar manner as in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> confirms the superior efficacy of these plants, with 76.7% similarity.
