<p id="p0200">Turkey has remarkable potential for serious research on this topic due to having vast ethnomedicinal experience and the richest flora of Europe and the Middle East. This study, conducted in this regard, is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening study conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. In particular, we would like to emphasize that the most common detected genus members, such as 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> (16 taxa; 7.1%), 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> (12; 5.4%), 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> (12; 5.4%), and 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> (10; 4.5%) may be more efficient in terms of the anti-influenza targeting than other genera for the interest of the sectors that are researching new natural drug sources.
