<p id="p0205">Through this study, we strongly recommend these 35 (15.6%) plants, which have proved their high anti-influenza activities and inhibition potentials in the experimental studies, to be subject to clinical research and for widespread use in the near future. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa detections that have not been investigated yet, it is an important resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers. Clinical research and evaluation studies required for standard compliance for human use, starting especially with the fifteen plant taxa whose use records against both malaria and influenza were presented in this study, can be begun. With a possible mass production of one or more malaria-like drugs, a significant contribution can be provided to the indigenous people living in that region and to the national economy. Therefore, more experimental studies are urgently needed to understand the true value of these plants. Based on the data to be obtained, we believe that the future extension of anti-influenza studies, including plant taxa that are frequently used in Turkish folk medicine, would be a more effective option.</p>
