<p id="Par49">Intradermal injection of histamine induced the formation of a wheal on the skin of all rats (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). An hour after histamine injection, only rats pre-treated with hydrocortisone presented a significantly reduced wheal diameter, when compared to the negative control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, 2 h after histamine injection, rats pre-treated with NLE or the standard drug (hydrocortisone) exhibited a significantly reduced wheal diameter, as compared to the negative control. These effects of NLE and the standard drug on the wheal diameter were time- and dose-dependent and were statistically significant at NLE 250 and 500 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.0001).
