<p id="Par48">Sub-plantar injection of carrageenan in the paw induced oedema (in all rats) which size increased with time till 4 h and then spontaneously decreased till 24 h after injection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, rats pre-treated with NLE or standard drugs (diclofenac and hydrocortisone) exhibited significantly reduced paw oedema sizes at all points measured in time when compared to the negative controls. These effects of NLE and standard drugs on the oedema size were time- and dose-dependent and were statistically significant among groups (
