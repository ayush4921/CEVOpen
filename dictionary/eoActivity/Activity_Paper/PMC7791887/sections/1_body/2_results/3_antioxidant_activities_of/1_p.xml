<p id="Par47">The extract and BHT exhibited a concentration-dependent scavenging activity of DPPH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The concentration of NLE required to inhibit 50% of free radicals (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 0.0976 ± 0.25 mg/ml compared to 0.2188 ± 0.02 mg/ml obtained for BHT (positive control). The difference in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between the NLE and BHT was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and NLE was found to be about two-fold more potent than BHT, in scavenging DPPH radicals. Also, both NLE and gallic acid caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values determined for NLE and gallic acid were 0.2367 ± 0.006 and 1.418 ± 0.01 mg/ml, respectively. The difference in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between the NLE and gallic acid was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and NLE was about six-fold more potent in inhibiting lipid peroxidation than gallic acid. The extract, ascorbic acid and BHT showed a concentration-dependent reducing power (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). IC
 <sub>50</sub> determined were 0.447 ± 0.02; 0.151 ± 0.03 and 0.07 ± 0.04 mg/ml, for NLE, ascorbic acid and BHT, respectively. There were significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) between the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of NLE, ascorbic acid and BHT. However, NLE was about 3 and 6-fold less potent than ascorbic acid and BHT, respectively, in reducing Fe
