<p id="Par53">The phytochemical screening of the hydro-ethanol extract of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves (NLE) revealed the presence of triterpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins and phenolic compounds and the absence of alkaloids. Also, the determination of the total phenol and total flavonoids contents of NLE extract revealed appreciable amounts of these two secondary metabolites. The presence of saponin, triterpenoids and considerable amounts of flavonoids and phenolic compounds in our extract could explain the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of NLE, as similarly reported by previous studies on aqueous and acetone extracts of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Likewise, these findings are consistent with a study showing the presence of vitamins A, C and E in 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Previous reports showed the presence of alkaloids in the chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, acetone and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves, in addition to the presence of phenolic compounds (flavonoids, coumarins and tannins), and sterols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The absence of alkaloids in our extract (NLE) could be due to solvent system used for the extraction or the geographical location of plants collected. Our choice for the hydro-ethanolic system was because we wanted to mimic, as much as possible, the traditional preparation of 
 <italic>N. lotus.</italic>
