<p id="Par55">The antioxidant activity of NLE extract was determined using DPPH radical scavenging assay, lipid peroxidation inhibition assay and reducing power assay. The DPPH radical scavenging assay revealed that NLE was about two times more potent than BHT in scavenging DPPH. This result shows that NLE has a strong antioxidant potential, and that could be attributed to its phenolic, flavonoid and elemental contents. A correlation between phenolic compounds, micro-element content and antioxidant activity has been reported in the literature [

The extract’s ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation could be attributed to the presence of lipid-soluble antioxidant compounds, hence, could donate protons to stabilize lipid radicals or exquisitely scavenges lipid peroxyl radicals, thereby, terminating subsequent chain propagation reactions [

 <sup>3+</sup>) in ferric chloride is converted to ferrous (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) by antioxidant compounds. The extract was not as potent as ascorbic acid or BHT in reducing Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>. In a similar study, the hydro-alcohol and chloroform extracts of
