<p id="Par31">The total phenol content of NLE extract was determined as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Briefly, aliquots (10 μl) of NLE extract and gallic acid of different concentrations were placed in Eppendorf tubes. Distilled water (0.79 ml) and Folin-cicocalteau reagent (~ 50 μl) were subsequently added and mixed totally. The mixture was afterwards incubated at room temperature for 8 min. After incubation, Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (150 μl) was added, mixed and again incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Aliquots were put in well-plates, and absorbance read at 750 nm. Triplicates concentrations of NLE and gallic acid prepared were used.
