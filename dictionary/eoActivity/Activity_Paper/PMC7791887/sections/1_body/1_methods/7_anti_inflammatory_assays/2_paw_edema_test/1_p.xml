<p id="Par38">The paw edema test was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Briefly, rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 each. Oedema was induced by sub-plantar injection of 100 μL of 1% freshly prepared solution of carrageenan into the right-hind paw of each rat of all groups. Group 1 served as negative control and was administered distilled water; groups 2, 3 and 4 were treated with NLE at 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg of body weight (bw) respectively, 3 days prior to the induction of inflammation. Groups 5 and 6 were given diclofenac (2 mg/kg bw) orally and hydrocortisone succinate (4 mg/kg bw) intraperitoneally 30 min before carrageenan injection. Paw thickness was measured just before the carrageenan injection (initial) and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h after carrageenan injection. Increase in paw thickness was measured as the difference in paw thickness at the initial time and paw thickness at respective hours using a plethysmometer.
