<p id="Par37">Sixty pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (Hsd: SD strain), aged 2 to 3 months and weighing 150–200 g, were purchased from the Center for Plant Medicine Research (CPMR), Mampong, Eastern Region, Ghana. Animals were housed in stainless steel cages of 2 cubic feet (61 cm × 31 cm × 31 cm) with softwood shavings as bedding. They were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (temperature ~ 25 °C, relative humidity 60–70%, and 12 h light-dark cycle), fed with standard pellet diet (AGRIMAT, Kumasi, Ghana) and allowed access to water ad libitum. Animals were acclimatised under these conditions for 7 days before the experiment. To prevent contamination, animals’ feeding, and water troughs were washed frequently.</p>
