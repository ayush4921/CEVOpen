<p id="Par44">Percentage inhibition against the log of concentration was plotted for each sample tested, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) interpolated from the curves. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined using Graph Pad Prism software version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> mean value (Â± SEM). Graphs were plotted using Sigma Plot for Windows Version 11.0 (Systat Software Inc., Germany). A duplication method was used before the actual analysis of the micro and macro-elements. The method employs three-axial geometry, thereby reducing background noise by radiation polarisation.
