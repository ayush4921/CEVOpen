Currently, a surrogate classification of five subtypes of breast cancer (based on histological and molecular characteristics) is being used in clinical practice. Tumours expressing progesterone receptor (PR) and/or estrogen receptor (ER) are considered hormone receptor-positive breast cancers, while in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), tumours do not express any of these receptors. Just as in the rest of the world, invasive ductal carcinoma is the commonest histological type of breast cancer in Africa [
