<p>Medicinal herbal plants and natural phytochemicals represent a powerful and valuable resource of active compounds that exhibit antiviral activities. Some of these sources require further chemical modification to enhance their potency and selectivity. Finding effective treatments for human and animal coronaviruses can benefit from testing several compounds and polyphenolics such as caffeic acid, isobavachalcone, myricetin, psoralidin, and quercetin, griffithsin, lycorine, silvestrol, and tryptanthrin. These compounds must be examined in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments to ensure their therapeutic and safe levels before conducting human clinical trials because of their toxicity at specific doses. The prime candidates for initial studies are these compounds that have been recognized by the FDA or other national or international organizations as generally safe or that have previously been allowed for medicinal uses. This review provides essential information on the potential role of phytochemicals in inhibiting coronavirus strains. This may provide adequate evidence to researchers seeking active therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, naturally derived compounds alone or in integration with western medications may be further tested.
