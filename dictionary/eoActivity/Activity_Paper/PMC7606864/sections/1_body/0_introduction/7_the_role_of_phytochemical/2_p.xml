<p>Dozens of proteins are coded by coronaviruses, some of which are involved in viral replication and entry into cells, including 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (3-chymotrypsin-like protease; 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>), one of the main proteases of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); M
 <sup>pro</sup>, a key enzyme for replication of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>); and S protein, an essential binding protein for the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 through the cellular membrane via hACE2 (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The function of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and M
 <sup>pro</sup> together is to form a viral replication complex. Therefore, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, and S protein are ideal targets for researchers and drug developers to design and develop an effective cure for COVID-19 (
