<p>It has also been cited that herbacetin might act as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV/3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The docking scores of this compound against S protein, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and SARS-3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> were −8.3, −7.2, and −9.263, respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The same authors recorded the docking score (a mathematical equation employed to approximately establish the binding affinity between two molecules after they have been docked) of rhoifolin, a flavon found in fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Rhus succedanea</italic> and Citrus grandis, against S protein, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, and it was −9.5, −8.2, and −9.565, respectively. The induced-fit docking results of pectolinarin and morin against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> were −8.054 and −8,930 (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), respectively; however, the best pose between these compounds and S protein was −9.8 and −8.8, and −7.8 and −8.2 with M
 <sup>pro</sup>, respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Pectolinarin can be found in plume thistles (
 <italic>Cirsium</italic> spp.), while almond, guava, and old fustic contain a high quantity of morin. The best position of kaempferol, a phytochemical found in spinach and kale, against S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> was −8.5 and −7.8 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)), while −8.526 was the best binding position of this compound against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>).
