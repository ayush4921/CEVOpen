<p>Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a contagious avian coronavirus that influences the respiratory tract, reproductive systems, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney of chickens, causing avian infectious bronchitis disease. Several studies have tested the antiviral potential of plant-derived extracts against IBV (

 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). The main mechanisms of action of viral inhibition that have been recognized in all studies on IBV appear to be through interference with the spike protein or viral envelope disruption. However, terpenoid compounds (-)-β-pinene, (-)-α-pinene, and 1,8-cineole have an exceptional mechanism to inhibit IBV and breaking its replication cycle via binding to N protein of the virus, thereby preventing its interference with the viral genomic RNA (

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). The structural models of the terpenoids supported the previous observations as it showed that these substances can actively connect to five amino acid residues at the active site at the N terminus of the N protein (TyrA140, TyrA92, As A138, PheA137, and ProA134) (

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>) reported that these amino acid residues are considerably preserved among avian coronavirus strains. Therefore, terpenoids/isoprenoids, organic chemicals derived from terpenes, can be considered as potentially strong antiviral agents against almost all IBV strains and as a reasonable target for further investigations.
