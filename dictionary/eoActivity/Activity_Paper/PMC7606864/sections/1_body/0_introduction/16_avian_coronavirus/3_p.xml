<p>Phytochemicals and medicinal herbal extracts may be useful in this role. Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) noticed that treatment with 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract inactivated two eminent enveloped viruses (influenza and avian IBV). The authors suggested that the extract of 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> may have the possibility to exhibit antiviral impacts against a broad spectrum of other enveloped viruses, which can be attributed to the potential synergistic effect among the extract's inhibitory compounds, particularly flavonoids and lectins. Enhancing innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is essential in the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccine treatments. In this regard, animal experiments may be a useful model to test the effectiveness of medicinal, herbs, and spice products as antiviral agents.
