<p>Several medicinal herbal extracts were examined 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against coronaviruses in mice (strain MHV-A59) but without determining the particular substances responsible for virus inhibition (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). However, based on the abundance in the tested extracts, the authors proposed potential compounds or classes of compounds that may be responsible for this impact. The significant inhibitory potential was observed to the extracts acquired from 
 <italic>Torilis</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Acanthopanacis</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Sophorae</italic> sp. when tested at low concentrations (&lt;1 Î¼g/mL). Specifically, the extract of the 
 <italic>Sophorae</italic> sp. root exhibited high viral specificity (
 <italic>SI</italic> = 696), suggesting that it could be powerfully selected for future investigations aiming to screen and identify compounds that have antiviral potential. The authors suggested that the inhibition of the activity of proteases, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, might be the potential mechanism of these three species to exert their antiviral activities (
