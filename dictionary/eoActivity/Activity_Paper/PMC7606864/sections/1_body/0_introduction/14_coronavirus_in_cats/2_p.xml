<p>Another screening study against 19 substances was conducted by McDonagh et al. (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>), and the authors focused on naturally occurring compounds that have been observed to have antiviral impacts against coronavirus strains or other RNA virus strains. They used many phytochemicals, including hesperitin, artemisinin, baicalin, glycyrrhizic acid quercetin, hesperidin, curcumin, and rutin at single doses ranging from 10 to 50 μM. Although none of these agents reached EC
 <sub>50</sub>, glycyrrhizic acid at a level of 25 μM was the most promising, causing a decrease in cytopathic influence assay by 26.7%. Despite these findings, further researchers are required to examine more concentrations of these compounds against FCoV.
