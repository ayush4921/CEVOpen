<p>Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is another coronavirus that belongs to the α-CoV group that causes a severe cat disease and without actual antiviral medication available yet. A computer screening study was conducted by Theerawatanasirikul et al. (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>) for a library of naturally occurring compounds against a mutated form of FCoV called feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The authors, firstly, virtually 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screened the potential binding of tested phytochemicals to FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Then, they used a protease inhibitor assay against the same enzyme to evaluate the 15 most promising compounds in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> trials. Among the tested compounds, no inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 μM) was observed by steviol and 7-benzyl luteolin; however, moderate inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 77.2 ± 13.8 μM) was demonstrated by quercetin 7-rhamnoside whereas 7-methyl luteolin and stictic acid showed the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (28.5 ± 4.2 and 29.4 ± 4.6 μM, respectively). While, when the authors used the cytopathic effect assay to test these active compounds, only stictic acid showed a protective impact on viral-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Hsieh et al. (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>) considered 
 <italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin as a potent inhibitor of FCoV, with high selectivity index (&gt;218) and EC
 <sub>50</sub> of just 0.0088 nM, through binding to its membrane and spike proteins, and prevented its attachment to the host cells. The authors reported that this mannose-binding lectin outperformed all comparable synthetic antiviral agents.
