<p>Since the emergence of the recent surpassing COVID-19 disease and the proclamation of the World Health Organization of it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the global scientific concern has been prompted. Worldwide, the pandemic has recorded, as of September 4, 2020, 26,504,030 cases, with 873,821 deaths, and the numbers continue to increase drastically

 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily. They can infect both humans and animals (

 <italic>alphacoronavirus</italic> (α-CoVs), 
 <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> (β-CoVs), 
 <italic>gammacoronavirus</italic> (γ-CoVs), and 
 <italic>delta coronavirus</italic> (Δ-CoVs) (
