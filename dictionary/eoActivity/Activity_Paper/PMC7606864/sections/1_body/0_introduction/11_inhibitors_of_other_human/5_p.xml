<p>Finally, besides the antiviral potential of griffithsin and silvestrol against MERS-CoV, as mentioned earlier, they also appear to have inhibition impacts against other human coronaviruses. Griffithsin has demonstrated high antiviral impacts (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0032–0.33 μM) against several HCoV strains (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>), and silvestrol inhibited (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3 nM) HCoV-229E protein translation (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). A follow-up study attributed the inhibition potential of silvestrol to HCoV-229E in an 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> bronchial epithelial cell system to the inhibition of RNA helicase eIF4A (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>).
