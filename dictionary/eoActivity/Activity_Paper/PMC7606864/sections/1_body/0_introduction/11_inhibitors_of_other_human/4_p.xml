<p>The antiviral potential of 
 <italic>Strobilanthes cusia</italic> leaf's methanolic extract against HCoV-NL63 has been recently stressed by Tsai et al. (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>), and the authors have noticed an efficient reduction in virus yield in infected cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.64 μg/mL) in a dose-based manner. The six substantial phytochemicals of the extract have been isolated, purified, and identified, and among them, indigodole B, an indole alkaloid derivative, and tryptanthrin, a natural alkaloid having the basic indoloquinazoline moiety, exhibited the highest antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.60 and 1.52 μM, respectively) against HCoV. The rise in the antiviral potential of tryptanthrin compared to indigodole B may be due to the occurrence of the double bond at C5a in tryptanthrin, as compared to the supplemental ethyl moiety in indigodole B. Thus, the supplementation of a double bond in the quinazoline ring for substances based on structural conformity for tryptanthrin could substantially elevate their antiviral activity. Furthermore, tryptanthrin has also shown a wide range of biological activities, including anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-protozoal, antimicrobial, and anticancer action (
