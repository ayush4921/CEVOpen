<p>Quercetin is a flavonoid that originated in many fruits, grains, and vegetables, but high levels of the active substance were found, particularly in certain herbs and berries (

For example, quercetin has shown restoring influence by decreasing the concentrations of several antioxidants in the lungs, including catalase, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase, in mice treated with influenza, suggesting that quercetin taken along with viral infection may safeguard lung tissues and preserve antioxidant capacity (

Although providing quercetin orally simultaneously with viral installation did not restore the decrease in the level of vitamin E connected with a viral infection, it augmented the pulmonary levels of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and catalase (
