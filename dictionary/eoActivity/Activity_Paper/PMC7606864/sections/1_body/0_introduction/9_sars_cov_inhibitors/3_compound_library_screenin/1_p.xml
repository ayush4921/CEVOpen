<p>It is noteworthy that searching for natural phytochemicals that have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV using extensive 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screening studies is similar to the search for a “needle in a haystack” (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), despite the existence of many such studies. For instance, in the study of Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), the authors found that there are only four of Chinese medicinal herbs (
 <italic>Artemisia annua, Pyrrosia lingua, Lycoris radiata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lindera aggregata</italic>) with moderate to high antiviral efficiency, when they examined more than 200 chloroform or ethanol extracts of these plants. Despite this low number, only one compound (lycorine) with high antiviral efficacy (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.7 ± 1.2 nM) derived from 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> was allotted as a SARS-CoV prospective medication candidate (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). It is disappointing that lycorine can exert toxicity impacts at relatively low dosage levels (~1,000 μg/kg in dogs), and this is what the authors did not mention (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>).
