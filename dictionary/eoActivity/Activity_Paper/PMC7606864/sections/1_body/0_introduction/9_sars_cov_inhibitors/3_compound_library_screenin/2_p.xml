<p>SARS-CoV helicase (nsP13) is an enzyme that exerts a vital role in the replication, transcription, and translation of the viral genome. Minimal investigations have studied the efficacy of naturally occurring compounds to inhibit this enzyme. Yu et al. (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) screened the activity of 64 natural substances against nsP13. They indicated that the most promising candidates were the polyphenolic substances scutellarein (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.86 ± 0.48 μM) and myricetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.71 ± 0.19 μM), without any considerable noticeable toxic impact on the normal (non-tumorigenic) epithelial cells of the breast. Both compounds were noticed to inhibit nsP13 by inhibiting the activity of ATPase indirectly. Scutellarein has been conventionally considered as an anti-inflammatory agent and used in respiratory infection medication and can be isolated from Chinese Skullcap (
