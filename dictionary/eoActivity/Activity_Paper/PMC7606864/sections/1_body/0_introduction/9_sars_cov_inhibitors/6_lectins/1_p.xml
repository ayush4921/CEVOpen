<p>Plant lectins are naturally occurring proteins that are able to combine reversibly and correctly to carbohydrate groups and show antiviral activity against several viral infections, including herpes simplex virus, Ebola, influenza, and SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Curiously, Michelow et al. (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) reported that increasing recombinant human mannose-binding lectin levels in the plasma of mice permitted them to overcome different viral infections except the fatal Ebola. Petersen et al. (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>) demonstrated that lectins had shown reasonable tolerability in clinical experiments. Moreover, a total of 33 plant lectins have been tested using a cytopathic effect assay for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (

 <sub>50</sub> values for 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> agglutinin were low (0.45 ± 0.08 μg/mL) and did not influence the virus replication. The exact mechanisms of action for the potential antiviral activity of plant lectins were not established. Therefore, further investigations are required to prospect for a treatment of coronavirus infection among the promising classes of naturally derived substances.
