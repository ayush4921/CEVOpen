<p>As described earlier, several natural derivatives demonstrate considerable promising results as SARS-CoV inhibitors; however, only few fulfill the requirements of the commercial drug in terms of selectivity and efficacy. Hence, increasing the effectiveness and antiviral activity of these compounds to the appropriate levels for therapeutic applications may require adjusting their chemical structure. Moreover, drug developers can reduce timelines and increase their chances to find effective viral inhibitors starting from understanding the structural conformity of the naturally derived compounds. Working on this principle, modification of the main active constituent of liquorice, namely, glycyrrhizin, which has been used in patients treating SARS-CoV (
