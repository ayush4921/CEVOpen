<p>Polyphenols are a class of mainly natural compounds that have shown antiviral properties across several investigations. For instance, the effectiveness of 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> seeds against SARS-CoVPL
 <sup>pro</sup> has been ascribed to the bioactive agents of ethanolic extract of this plant (polyphenolic compounds), in a bioassay-guided fractionation way (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). From the ethanolic extract, six polyphenols that vary widely in their antiviral activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 4,200 and 38,400 nM) were isolated and identified as neobavaisoflavone, corylifol A, bavachinin, 4â€²-O-methylbavachalcone, isobavachalcone, and psoralidin. Isobavachalcone and psoralidin demonstrated the highest antiviral activity. When mixed, both compounds showed reversible inhibition of PL
 <sup>pro</sup> through their ability to attach to the free form of the enzyme preferentially, rather than the complex substrate of the enzyme (type I mechanism) (
