<p>Few investigations have been carried out to determine the therapeutic potential of plant-derived compounds against MERS-CoV. MÃ¼ller et al. (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> noticed that the replication of MERS-CoV was significantly inhibited by a phytochemical derived from 
 <italic>Aglaia</italic> sp. called silvestrol. The inhibition of viral replication caused by silvestrol can be recognized to its inhibitory activity of RNA helicase eIF4A, which prevents protein expression of coronavirus and preclude the establishment of replication and transcription complexes (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Also, the protein obtained from the red algae 
 <italic>Griffithsia</italic>, which is called griffithsin, can be considered an appropriate inhibitor of MERS-CoV. Griffithsin can inhibit the attachment of MERS-CoV and several human coronaviruses to host cells by specifically binding to glycans of protein spikes of the viruses via its three carbohydrate-binding domains (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). It is worth noting that griffithsin has a specificity index against human coronavirus cells (compared to human fibroblast or colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines) established between 30 and 3,100 (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Therefore, griffithsin can be considered an appropriate candidate for clinical studies as well as animal model experiments against SARS-CoV-2.
