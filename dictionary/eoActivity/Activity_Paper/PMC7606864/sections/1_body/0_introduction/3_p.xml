As a result of the frantic worldwide race to find an effective vaccine or cure, several synthetic and natural compounds, as well as antiviral medications, have been proposed to overcome the morbidity and mortality caused by this pandemic. Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine were primarily suggested to treat severe cases based on several of their mechanisms of action. These included alkalization of cellular phagolysosomes (
