 <italic>Pf</italic>W2, known to be resistant to chloroquine and other antimalarials [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], were cultured into sealed flasks at 37°C, in a 3% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 91% N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere in RPMI 1640, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% human serum and human erythrocytes to achieve 2% hematocrit. Parasites were synchronized in the ring stage by serial treatment with 5% sorbitol (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and tested at 1% parasitemia. Stock solutions of plant extracts were prepared at 1 mg/mL in DMSO, diluted from 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as needed for individual experiments, and tested in triplicate as described previously by Yamthe et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most potent antiplasmodial extract, the aqueous extract from 
 <italic>T. mantaly</italic> stem bark (
 <italic>Tm</italic>sb
 <sup>w</sup>), was then submitted to acute toxicity study and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity.
