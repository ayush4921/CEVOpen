<p>For the study, a dose of extract at 2000 mg/kg of body weight was administrated to the three animals of the test group. The three other animals of the control group received distilled water at dose 10 mL/kg. After administration, animals were observed for general behavior changes and mortality continuously for 30 min and thereafter intermittently for 4 h and 24 h later. During observation times, behavioral parameters such as piloerection, appearance of faces, sensitivity to sound and touch, mobility, aggression, and mortality were recorded. Mice were further observed for up to 14 days postadministration during which mortality, body weights, and gross behavioral changes were recorded daily. At day 15 posttreatment, animals were sacrificed and the macroscopic appearance of organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart, and lungs and their relative weight were recorded.</p>
