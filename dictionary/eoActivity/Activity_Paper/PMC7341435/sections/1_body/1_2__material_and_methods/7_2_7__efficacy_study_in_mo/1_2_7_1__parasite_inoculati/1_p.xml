A cryopreserved parasite was thawed and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into naïve recipient mice. Three days after infection, the parasitemia was monitored daily in tail vein blood through Giemsa-stained thin smear observation under oil immersion at 100x magnification. Passage of infection in new mice consisted of an i.p. injection of 200
