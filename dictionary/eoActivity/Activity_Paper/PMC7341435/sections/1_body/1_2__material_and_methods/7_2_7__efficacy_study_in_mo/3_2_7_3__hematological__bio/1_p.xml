<p>At the end of the assays, animals were anesthetized using urethane and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture in heparin and dried tubes for hematological and biochemical analysis, respectively. Serum was obtained by blood centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min and stored at -20°C for the biochemical parameters' analysis, with focus on transaminase enzymes ALT and AST using Kits Hospitex. Blood in heparinized tubes was used for hematological parameter analysis using autoanalyzer Cell-Dyn Model 331 430. Histopathological analysis of the liver was performed according to the protocol described by Pieme et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In brief, mouse liver pieces (3–5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thick) were fixed in 10% Formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) for 24 h and washed in running water for 24 h. Samples were dehydrated in a cup containing increasing concentration of ethanol at different times and then cleared in two cups containing xylene during 1 h and 1.5 h, respectively, to remove absolute alcohol. Embedding was done by passing the cleared samples through three cups containing molten paraffin at 50°C and in a cubical block of paraffin. It was followed by microtome cutting. The slides were stained using hematoxylin-eosin for microscopic examination.
