<p>Plant products continue to make an immense contribution to malaria chemotherapy, either directly as antimalarial phytomedicine or as an important source of lead compounds for the discovery of new and potent antimalarial drugs [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Cameroon, plant extracts are still widely used to combat malaria and several other diseases in daily practices, especially in areas where access to standard treatments is limited [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The rich and diverse Cameroonian flora is a potential reservoir of potent antiplasmodial natural compounds, and its exploration based on ethnopharmacological approach is still promising in the fight against malaria. Indeed, 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> (
 <italic>Combretaceae</italic>) is a plant of the Cameroonian pharmacopeia used for malaria and/or related symptoms [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of such plant extracts for inhibitory activity against malaria parasites is the first step in the search for new natural plant-derived antimalarial leads. We previously reported the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity of crude extracts from the leaves and stem bark of 
 <italic>T. mantaly</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] against chloroquine-sensitive (
 <italic>Pf3D7</italic>) and chloroquine-resistant (
 <italic>PfINDO</italic>). However, no efficacy study in an animal model of malaria has been carried out so far. Therefore, the present study is aimed at confirming the safety and efficacy of its use.
