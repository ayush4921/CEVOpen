<p>Malaria infection induced significant decrease of total RBC counts, hemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT) rates by 41.69%, 58.93%, and 60.23%, respectively, in untreated infected mice compared to normal (uninfected mice) group. Daily administration of

The total white blood cell (WBC) count significantly increased in the negative control compared to uninfected mice.
