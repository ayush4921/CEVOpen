<p>Globally, 7 out of the 12 extracts prepared showed activity against 
 <italic>Pf</italic>W2 with their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.809 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 5.886 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Five extracts showed very good antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and two exerted moderate antiplasmodial activity (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL ≤ IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Four extracts out of the eight more potent (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) antiplasmodial extracts were prepared with distilled water and methanol (three extracts each), suggesting that their antiplasmodial constituent of 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> are polar. Indeed, the aqueous extracts were more active than hydroethanolic and ethanolic extracts; this might justify the traditional choice of water to prepare phytodrugs from 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> against malaria [
