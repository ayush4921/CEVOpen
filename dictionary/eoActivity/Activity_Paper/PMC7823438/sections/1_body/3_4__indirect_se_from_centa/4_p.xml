<p>Plant regeneration via SE in leaf culture was also obtained in other gentian species. ISE in 
 <italic>G. pneumonanthe</italic> was achieved on Â½MS supplemented with 2,4-D and BA [

 <italic>G. kurroo</italic>, 
 <italic>G. cruciata</italic>, 
 <italic>G. tibetica</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lutea</italic>, 
 <italic>G. pannonica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The leaf explants of these species were grown on a medium supplemented with three auxins and five different CKs, and optimum regeneration was achieved in the presence of NAA in combination with BA or TDZ (thidiazuron). Furthermore, cytomorphological analyses have shown that somatic embryos originated from palisade mesophyll cells. SE was also induced on leaf explants of 
 <italic>G. straminea</italic> and 
 <italic>G. utriculosa</italic> cultured on an MS medium supplemented only with 2,4-D [

 <italic>G. straminea</italic>, 
 <italic>G. macrophylla,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. chirata,</italic> successful induction of embryogenic callus was achieved on medium with a combination of 2,4-D and CKs [
