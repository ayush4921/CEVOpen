<p>The successful induction of SE, as well as shoot and root regeneration in vitro, depends on a variety of factors, including the explant selection, light conditions, and exogenously added PGRs [

The leaf culture, implying in vitro cultivation of isolated leaves, is generally not used because the whole leaves cannot be maintained in tissue culture. However, if the leaf sections are used as initial explants, then calli, buds, or somatic embryos can be induced since some mesophyll cells have the potential to re-enter the cell cycle and become committed to different morphogenetic pathways when appropriately induced. Leaves from in vitro cultivated plants are an easily accessible source of explants, while the leaf culture enables the regeneration of genetically stable plants [
