<p>Plants have unique developmental plasticity, which allows their adaptation to constant environmental changes. Plant in vitro culture techniques relies on this plasticity to mold the morphogenetic paths in the desired direction. Morphogenetic processes enabling the regeneration of the whole plant in in vitro tissue culture conditions are somatic embryogenesis (SE), organogenesis, micropropagation, androgenesis, and gynogenesis. Differentiated somatic cells grown in vitro begin to divide and can regenerate the whole plant through SE or organogenesis [

SEis a powerful biotechnological method for the propagation and genetic improvement of many plant species, as it enables the obtaining of a large number of somatic embryos, which can be further used in the production of artificial seeds with diverse applications in biotechnology [
