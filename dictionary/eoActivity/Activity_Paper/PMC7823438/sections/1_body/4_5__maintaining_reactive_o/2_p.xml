<p>The level of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is controlled by the activities of several key enzymes, including superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalases (CATs), and class III peroxidases (POXs) [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The SODs provide the front-line defense against ROS since they scavenge superoxide radicals to produce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. CATs remove the excess of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, while extracellular POXs play a role in the precise regulation of ROS levels in the cell and apoplast because, in addition to their role in removing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, they can also catalyze the formation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and hydroxyl radicals [

 <xref rid="B84-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. By regulating ROS levels in the apoplast, POXs participate in cross-linking, cell wall reconstruction, and elongation [
