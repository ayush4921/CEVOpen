<p>As discussed above, a homology-based search revealed only four AGP sequences in the first version of the 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> transcriptome, all of which were AGPs with conserved domains [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. This was expected since HRGPs, including AGPs, are intrinsically disordered proteins lacking hydrophobic core, so the sequence constraints imposed on these proteins are relatively low. Therefore, AGPs can rapidly mutate and evolve, which hinders their homology-based mining [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. We have recently developed a highly sophisticated bioinformatics pipeline developed in R, ragp, for mining and analysis of HRGPs with an emphasis on AGPs [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The key novelty incorporated in ragp is the machine learning-based prediction of proline hydroxylation sites, which represent the glycosylation sites. The analysis of 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> transcriptome [
 <xref rid="B118-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] as well as 62 plant proteomes using ragp [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] revealed, quite unexpectedly, that the most frequently identified domains found in AGPs were the Protein kinase and Protein tyrosine kinase domains. The Protein (tyrosine) kinase domains have thus far eluded experimental evidence for linkage with AGPs in any plant species. Possible implications of this finding include a novel way of attachment of AGPs to the plasm membrane through their transmembrane domains and a novel way for the involvement of AGPs in signaling. So far, structural features of AGPs and circumstantial evidence suggested that AGPs may be involved in signaling as co-receptors [
 <xref rid="B97-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], or through interaction with membrane receptors (including protein kinases) on the same or neighboring cell [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], interaction with other AGPs, pectins, and other cell wall or cytoskeletal elements [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The presence of protein kinase domains on ragp-predicted AGPs suggests that AGPs may actually be the membrane receptors themselves or that certain Protein kinases have previously undetected AG-glycomodules and can be glycosylated. While the experimental evidence for the Hyp-glycosylation of these protein kinases is lacking, and the functions of the proposed “AGP-Protein kinase” molecules are unknown, it should be noted that, for example, 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> SERK5 (AT2G13800.1) has predicted hydroxyprolines organized in characteristic AG-glycomodules [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B118-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00070-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The analysis of expression and function of “AGP-Protein kinases” and their possible involvement in SE in 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> is planned.
