<p>AGPs are heavily glycosylated, intrinsically disordered glycoproteins ubiquitous in plants, which belong to a superfamily of cell surface hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) [

 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The extraordinary structural diversity of AGPs relies not only on their protein backbones encoded by large gene families [

 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] but also on the possibility of differential glycosylation of the same isoform into hetero generous glycoforms [
 <xref rid="B92-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Structural features that are common to AGPs include the presence of branched type II arabino-3,6-galactans (AGs) and short oligoarabinosides(both 
 <italic>O</italic>-linked to the hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues), a high percentage of amino acids that constitute the AG-II glycomodules (Pro/Hyp, Ala, Ser, Thr, and Gly), N-terminal signal peptide directing their synthesis via secretory pathway, and often a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor signal peptide [

 <xref rid="B95-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Dragićević et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] recently demonstrated that many AGP sequences may have transmembrane domains. Beside these basic structural features’ characteristic for classical AGPs and their short counterparts, AG peptides, many AGPs contain additional conserved domains or functional motifs and are termed chimeric AGPs [
