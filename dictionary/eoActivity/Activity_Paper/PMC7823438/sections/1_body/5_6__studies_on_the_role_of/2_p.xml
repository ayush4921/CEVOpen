<p>AGPs are involved in cell proliferation [

 <xref rid="B104-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] has been investigated using a variety of approaches. One of the main tools for studying the AGPs’ functions, used for decades, is a synthetic red dye, β-D-glucosyl Yariv reagent or βGlcY [
 <xref rid="B105-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Most AGPs specifically bind βGlcY [1,3,5-tris (4-β-D-glycopyranosyloxyphenylazo)-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene]; for β-galactosyl Yariv reagent, similar to βGlcY, a noncovalent interaction with β-1,3-galactan moieties of AGPs has been demonstrated [
