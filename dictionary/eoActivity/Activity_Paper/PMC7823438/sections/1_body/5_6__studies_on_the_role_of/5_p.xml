<p>However, quite unexpected results were obtained when βGlcY was used to investigate the role of AGPs during morphogenesis (simultaneous development of somatic embryos and adventitious buds) from centaury root explants [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Namely, it turned out that βGlcY may actually stimulate the morphogenesis from the root explants, albeit not in a linear dose-response manner. βGlcY increased the shoot regeneration frequency of roots cultured on the hormone-free medium from 71.67% for untreated culture to 93.89% and 92.22% for cultures grown on 15 µM or 25 µM βGlcY, respectively. The same concentrations also increased the average number of regenerated shoots per root explant, while lower (5 µM) or higher (50–75 µM) βGlcY concentrations had little effect on the regeneration potential of the 8-week-old root culture in comparison to untreated control [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Comparable results were obtained when the regeneration was scored after four weeks in culture [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] or when 1 µM IBA was added to the medium [
 <xref rid="B100-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In any case, the obtained regenerants displayed normal morphology. Interestingly, the shoots regenerated on media containing 25–75 µM βGlcY had elevated content of AGPs in comparison to control shoots [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], as determined by the single radial gel diffusion method, which also utilizes βGlcY [
 <xref rid="B110-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The roots developed on regenerated shoots also had increased AGP levels when developed on βGlcY-containing media [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This finding suggests that blocking of AGPs may increase their synthesis by some type of feedback regulation. The authors suggested that βGlcY in tissue culture may act as a stressor that may stimulate regeneration [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] since βGlcY triggers wound-like responses in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell culture, as shown by whole-genome array [
 <xref rid="B111-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. On the other hand, the presence of 75 µM βGlcY in the centaury 4-weeks old leaf culture did not alter the AGP content, regardless of other conditions (basal or inductive medium and light vs. darkness) [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], so the effect of βGlcY on AGPs accumulation might be tissue-specific. Finally, the profile of AGPs present in the regenerating leaf explants, as determined by crossed electrophoresis [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], depends on the medium composition, light conditions, and culture age [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].
