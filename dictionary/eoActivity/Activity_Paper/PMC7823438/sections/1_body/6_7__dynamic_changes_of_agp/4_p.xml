<p>The obtained immunohistochemical results only corroborated well-established observations that spatiotemporal occurrence of AGPs during SE is developmentally regulated and that AGPs may serve as positional markers, markers of cell identity, or markers for embryogenic competence [

 <xref rid="B100-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Our results indicate that the profile of AGP epitopes expressed during SE is not only species-specific but also strongly depends on the explant type and the culture conditions: While some epitopes, such as MAC207, have similar expression patterns in both regeneration systems, others, such asJIM13, are strongly expressed in somatic embryos developed from leaves, but are absent in embryos regenerated on
