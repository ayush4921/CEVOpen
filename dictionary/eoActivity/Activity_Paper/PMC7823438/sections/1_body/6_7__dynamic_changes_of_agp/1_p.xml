<p>Overall, the evidence collected using βGlcY reagent in different assays suggests that AGPs are important for the induction of SE in centaury. However, tracking the dynamicsof AGPs’ distribution during regeneration requires more sophisticated methods, such asa widely use dimmunohistochemical approach with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against AGPs’ carbohydrate epitopes.A large set of the anti-AGP mAbs of the JIM, LM, and MAC series are commercially available and are listed, along with the epitopes they recognize, in several reviews [

 <xref rid="B96-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The exact structure of the recognized epitopes is not always clearly determined, but it is known that MAC207, JIM4, and JIM13 bind to the β-

 <sc>l</sc>-Rha motif, whereasLM2 recognizes β-linked glucuronic acid (β-D-GlcA). A systematic review of the available literature describing the expression of different mAb-recognizable AGP epitopes during SE in different species [

 <xref rid="B109-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], to mention a few, would surely transcend the scope of the current review and would only confirm that none of the tested epitopes stands out as a universal SE marker in all or most of the studied plant species. Thus, the existence of two systems for SE induction in the same species—DSE on the hormone-free medium from root explants [

 <xref rid="B104-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]—provides an opportunity for the comparison of the obtained immunohistochemical results and search for common epitope markers or patterns.
