<p>Even though anti-AGP mAbs have been widely used for studying AGPs’ distribution during SE and other developmental processes, their usefulness is intrinsically limited for several reasons: (1) mAbs are not specific for a single AGP; (2) they cannot distinguish all glycoforms of an AGP backbone, and (3) the epitope has to be unmasked for immunodetection [

 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Of course, that the analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression can indicate the involvement of a particular AGP in some process [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], but in non-model species, such as 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic>, the necessary sequence resources are commonly unavailable. Thus, we initially used in-house assembled centaury leaf and root transcriptomes [
 <xref rid="B113-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] and mined centaury AGP sequences using a homology-based search. Using this approach, we have identified four centaury AGP transcripts, named 
 <italic>CeAGP1</italic> through 
 <italic>CeAGP4</italic> [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Of these, 
 <italic>CeAGP1</italic>, 
 <italic>CeAGP2,</italic> and 
 <italic>CeAGP4</italic> (GenBank: KC733882, KC733883, and KC733885, respectively) were characterized with conserved fasciclin domains and represented members of a subclass of chimeric AGPs known as fasciclin-like AGPs or FLAs [
 <xref rid="B114-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. 
 <italic>CeAGP1</italic> was highly induced (26.7-fold) during morphogenesis from centaury leaf explants in the light, where ISE was accompanied with indirect shoot development, but more importantly, it was over 20 fold induced during ISE in darkness, in comparison to the control explants, indicating its importance during ISE [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. 
 <italic>CeAGP2</italic> was slightly induced during both direct (on hormone-free medium) and indirect morphogenetic paths (ISE and indirect shoot development on inductive media), while the induction of 
 <italic>CeAGP4</italic> during ISE and organogenesis on inductive media was very low [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The role of 
 <italic>CeAGP1</italic> in ISE can be viewed in light of the general role of FLAs as molecules involved in cell adhesion and protein–protein interactions [
 <xref rid="B114-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. 
 <italic>CeAGP3</italic> is an AG peptide with a conserved DUF1070 domain (GenBank: KC733884, protein:AGN92423). The expression pattern of 
 <italic>CeAGP3</italic> indicated its general involvement indifferent morphogenetic paths in centaury, since this transcript was induced 36.6-fold relative to control during ISE in darkness, but was also highly induced during indirect morphogenesis in the light (ISE and organogenesis), as well as in direct organogenesis on a hormone-free medium [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. We have analyzed all 271 sequences containing the DUF1070 domain (DUF stands for Domain of Unknown Function) from 25 diverse families of vascular plants, aiming to elucidate the function of this motif. As it turned out, most of the DUF1070 domain represented typical glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor signal peptide (GPIsp) found in short AGPs (AG peptides), so the DUF1070 was renamed to arabinogalactan peptide (PF06376) [
 <xref rid="B115-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. To our best knowledge, DUF1070/PF06376 is the only conserved domain exclusively found in AGPs and HRGPs, in general. GPI anchors in proteins, such as 
 <italic>CeAGP3,</italic> are proposed to increase lateral mobility of the anchored proteins in the plasma membrane, allow polarized targeting to the cell surface, inclusion in lipid rafts, as well as further processing by GPI-specific phospholipases and glycosidases, thereby releasing diffusible AGPs and/or carbohydrates as extracellular signals, as well as biologically active lipids as intracellular signals [

 <xref rid="B115-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]; any of the proposed features for GPI-anchored AGPs may be important for morphogenesis and SE.
