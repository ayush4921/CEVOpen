<p>As recently reviewed by Tomiczak et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], SE has also been successfully obtained from the root cultures of several other species from the Gentianacea family, even though in these cases, the SE was not spontaneous as in centaury but required the addition of PGRs. Mikuła and Rybczyńsky [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] tried to induce SE in 
 <italic>G. cruciate</italic> root explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D and kinetin. The root explants formed callus tissue at the cut surface precisely on the wounding site of roots. Further ultrastructural analysis has shown that the structures originating from single cortical cells resembled proembryos in root explants of 
 <italic>G. cruciate</italic>, but the process of SE was not further continued [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. On the other hand, in 
 <italic>G. kurroo</italic>, 
 <italic>G. pannonica</italic>, and 
 <italic>G. cruciate,</italic> somatic embryos were regenerated by rhizodermal cells of adventitious roots [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This process was stimulated by various combinations of auxins and CKs, and somatic embryos were further converted into plantlets on a ½MS medium. Successful induction of SE was also achieved on root explants of 
 <italic>G. lutea</italic> grown on a medium supplemented with auxins alone or in combination with cytokinin, although the conversion of somatic embryos into plantlets required the addition of mannitol or sorbitol to the basal culture medium [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The initiation of somatic embryos was also obtained in root explants of 
 <italic>Eustoma grandiflorum</italic> cultured on a medium with 2,4-D [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The somatic embryos originated from pericycle and vascular parenchyma cells of seedling roots. Further conversion of the somatic embryos into plantlets was enabled with the addition of BA or GA
