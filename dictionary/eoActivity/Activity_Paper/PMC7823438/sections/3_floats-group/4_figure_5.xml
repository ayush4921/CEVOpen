  <p>Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) with Tyr kinase domains. The first sequence is Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor-like Kinase 5 (SERK5) from 
   <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (AT2G13800.1 or Q8LPS5 protein precursor). Four sequences below are found in the 
   <italic>C. erythraea</italic> transcriptome, based on homology with SERK5. In addition to AG glycomodules with predicted hydroxyprolines and Tyr kinase domains, all sequences have N-terminal signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, while most have Leucine-rich repeats typical for SERK receptors. The image is generated using ragp.
