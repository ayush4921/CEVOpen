  <p>Distribution of AGPs during SE in centaury. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Cross-section of a root explant with somatic embryos at its surface, stained with βGlcY reagent. Scale bar indicates 80 μm (
   <bold>b</bold>) Indirect SE on centaury leaf explants grown on 100 μM βGlcY reagent in darkness. Somatic embryos form only on the parts of the explants that are not in direct contact with the medium. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Embryogenic globule developed on leaf explant and labeled with JIM15 antibody. Scale bar indicates 10 μm.
