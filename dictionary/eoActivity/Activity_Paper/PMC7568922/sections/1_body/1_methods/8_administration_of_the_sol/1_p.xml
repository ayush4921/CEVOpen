<p>Mice were divided into eight groups (six test groups and two control groups), each group comprising a minimum of six mice (n=6). The mice were starved overnight before performing the experiment. The negative control group (Group 1) received distilled water, while the positive control group (Group 2) received glibenclamide, and the test groups, (Group 3–5) received an aqueous solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> at doses of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight, and (Group 6–8) received ethyl acetate solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> at doses of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight. The extract was administered orally by using oral gavage. The effects of the solvent fractions were compared with the control groups. Blood sample from the control and test animals was collected after 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours following the solvent fractions, standard drug, and water administration. Blood glucose level was measured using glucometer on blood drawn from the tail of the mice.
