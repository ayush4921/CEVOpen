 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> contain secondary metabolites such as steroid, vitamin, terpenes, carotenoid, flavonoids, and fatty acids. These bioactive compounds possess antiseptic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, preservative, and antitumor activities.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> An additional study revealed the existence of other phytoconstituents (phenols, tannins, alkaloids, triterpene, flavonoids, anthraquinones, steroids, polysterols, coumarins, glycosides, and absence of saponins).
