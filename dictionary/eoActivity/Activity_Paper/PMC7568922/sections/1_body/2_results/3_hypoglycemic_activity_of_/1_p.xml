<p>The blood glucose level was measured every 30 minutes for the first 1 h and then at 2nd, 4th, and 6th hours following administration of the three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the solvent fractions, glibenclamide 5mg/kg, and distilled water to each group of mice. In this study, a statistically significant difference in BGL was not noticed in the first 1 h after administration of the solvent fractions. A statistically significant BGL reduction was noticed at two hours following administration of EAF400 mg/kg (p&lt;0.05), AQF400 mg/kg (p&lt;0.01), and GLC5mg/kg (p&lt;0.001), compared with baseline blood glucose level. However, the lower doses (100 mg/kg) and the middle doses (200 mg/kg) of the solvent fractions did not display a statistically significant variance in BGL at 2 h as compared to baseline blood glucose level. At 4th h, EAF 200 mg/kg and 400mg/kg (p&lt;0.05, for both), AQF 200 and 400mg/kg (p&lt;0.01, for both), and GLC (p&lt;0.001) revealed a significant BGL drop as compared with the negative control. Furthermore, at 6th hour after administration of the solvent fractions, EAF 200 and 400mg/kg (p&lt;0.01, for both), AQF 200 mg/kg (p&lt;0.01), 400 mg/kg (p&lt;0.001), and GLC (p&lt;0.001) revealed a statically significant BGL drop as compared to the negative control. Similarly, AQF and EAF at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited a significant (p&lt;0.001) blood glucose decrement as compared to the baseline BGL at 6th h of administration of the solvent fractions. However, the lower dose (100mg/kg) of the solvent fractions didn`t display a significantly (p&gt;0.05) BGL reduction as compared to the negative control group and baseline BGL at all points of time. The percentage reduction of baseline blood glucose levels was 25.90%, 26.36%, 38.43%, 30.96% and 49.42% for EAF200mg/kg, AQF200mg/kg, EAF400mg/kg, AQF400mg/kg, and GLC 5mg/kg, respectively (
