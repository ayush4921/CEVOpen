<p>Within a group analysis showed that the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> treated groups produced a significant (P &lt; 0.001) drop in the blood glucose level on the seventh and fourteenth days as compared to the baseline BGL. Similarly, GLC 5mg/kg significantly (P &lt; 0.001) dropped the blood glucose level on the seventh and fourteenth days as compared to the baseline BGL. As revealed in

 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> at doses of 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg produced a higher reduction in fasting BGL at the 14th days, 33.29%, 38.59%, 52.71%, and 59.66%, respectively for AQF100, AQF200, AQF400, and GLC 5mg/kg (
