<p>The antihyperglycemic activity of aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> on fasting BGL of STZ-induced diabetic mice was determined weekly in all groups of mice. Following the induction of diabetes by streptozotocin, all groups of diabetic mice exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.001) variances in BGL as compared to normal mice across all time intervals. However, all diabetic mice didn`t show significant variance in baseline fasting blood glucose levels. Treatment with all doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg) of AQF displayed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction in BGL as compared to diabetic and normal control groups on the seventh and fourteenth days of treatment. Likewise, the glibenclamide treated group showed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) drop in blood glucose level as compared to diabetic and normal control groups on the seventh and fourteenth days of treatment.
