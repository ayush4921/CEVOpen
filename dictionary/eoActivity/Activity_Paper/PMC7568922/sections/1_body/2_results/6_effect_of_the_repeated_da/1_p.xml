<p>The effect of the repeated daily doses of the solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> on the bodyweight of both in the diabetic and normal mice are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Before the indication of diabetes with streptozotocin, all groups of mice didn`t show a significant difference in body weight. However, Streptozotocin showed a significant (P &lt; 0.001) decrement in the bodyweight of the diabetic control group on the seventh and fourteenth days of treatment as compared to the normal control group. Following treatment of diabetic mice with an aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> for 2 weeks improved weight loss in STZ-induced diabetic mice as compared to the diabetic control group. Only AQF400 mg/kg and GLC 5mg/kg improved weight loss significantly (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the diabetic control group after 7th days of treatment. In contrast, AQF100 mg/kg and AQF200 mg/kg failed to improve weight loss significantly after the 7th day of treatment. However, the three aqueous fraction doses AQF100 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05), AQF 200mg/kg (P &lt; 0.001), and AQF400 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.001) and GLC5 mg (P &lt; 0.001) improved weight loss significantly as compared with diabetic control group following fourteen days of administration of the solvent fractions and the standard drug.
