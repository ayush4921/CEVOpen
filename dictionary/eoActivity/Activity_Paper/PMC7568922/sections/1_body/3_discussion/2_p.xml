<p>The streptozotocin-induced animal model can be explained as a valuable animal model to investigate the activity of anti-diabetic agents such as glibenclamide against DM. STZ is well-known to induce diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia by damaging the pancreatic β cells.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Streptozotocin gets into β-cell using GLUT2 transporter and resulting in the alkylation of DNA, thereby brings the activation of poly ADP ribosylation. Poly ADP-ribosylation leads to depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP.
