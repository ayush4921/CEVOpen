<p>HDL and plasma lectin cholesterol acyltransferase are believed to be involved in the transport of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver for its excretion.
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The higher levels of cholesterol associated with HDL and the increase in the activity of plasma lectin cholesterol acyltransferase on the administration of aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> may result in a higher amount of cholesterol being removed from extrahepatic tissues which may contribute to the anti-hypercholesterolemia. Thus, the lowering in cholesterol levels of serum and tissues by the administration of aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> would seem to be mediated through its increased rate of degradation to bile acids and neutral sterols.
