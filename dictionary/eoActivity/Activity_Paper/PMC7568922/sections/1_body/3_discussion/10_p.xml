<p>In this study, a significant (P&lt;0.001) increment in the TC, TG, and LDL levels on diabetic mice when compared with normal control groups. This elevated TG level in diabetic mice could be because of the higher production of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in the liver and diminished catabolism. Since insulin has a dominant inhibitory effect on lipolysis in adipocytes, insulin deficiency is linked with excess lipolysis and increased influx of free fatty acids to the liver.
