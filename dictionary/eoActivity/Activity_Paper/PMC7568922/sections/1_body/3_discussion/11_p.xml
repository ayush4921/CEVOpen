<p>The highest reduction in TC, TG, VLDL, and LDL was attended at the higher dose (400mg/kg) of an aqueous fraction. This dose-dependent activity of the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> might be attributed to the higher dose (400 mg/kg) contains a higher amount of secondary metabolites responsible for a significant reduction in serum STG, STC, LDL-C, and VLDL-C; and increment in HDL-C than the lower (100mg/kg) and the middle doses (200mg/kg). The reductions of TG, TC, and LDL level by an aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> might be due to the involvement of polyphenolic part of the extract in preventing the formation of AGEs in diabetic mice.
