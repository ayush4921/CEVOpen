<p>In the present study, we successfully synthesized AgNPs using aqueous 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. plant extract. Several characterization studies, such as FTIR, TEM, XRD, EDX, zeta potential, and DLS, were performed to evaluate the synthesized AgNPs. AgNPs showed good stability, with a particle size ranging from 20 to 500 nm. The synthesized AgNPs from 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. extract showed a significant antibacterial activity against various species. The capping of plant constituents, such as secondary metabolites, on the surface of AgNPs might have enhanced this activity. Apart from exerting antibacterial property, the synthesized AgNPs from the plant extract also exhibited potent larvicidal activity against the fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The molecular docking studies performed with the salivary protein and odorant-binding protein of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> respectively showed that the naphthoquinone compound plumbagin exhibited reliable binding affinity towards the two enzymes. Collectively, these results suggest that the synthesis of metal nanoparticles by plant extracts can be optimized further in such a way that nanoparticles of desired quality and activity can be produced. Such eco-friendly nanoparticles can be efficiently used in bactericidal, wound healing, and targeted drug delivery systems, making this method potentially useful in large-scale production of similar metallic nanomaterials.
