 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2018, globally, about 2.5 million cases of malaria were reported, wherein India alone accounted for 76% of the cases [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several millions of humans die from mosquito-borne diseases every year, resulting in a drastic impact on socio-economic development [

In recent years, the use of nanoparticle and nanoemulsion systems from plant extracts has gained prominent importance due to their significant application in producing compounds exhibiting antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant properties [

Furthermore, low concentration of silver nanoparticles is found to be non-toxic to eukaryotic cells, including humans, but are known to exert high toxicity against prokaryotic cells of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi [
