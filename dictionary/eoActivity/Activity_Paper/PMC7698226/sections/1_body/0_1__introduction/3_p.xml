 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. (Plumbaginaceae) is one such plant that has been reported to possess various secondary metabolites in their leaves [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge and literature survey, 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. has not been used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Therefore, in this study, an attempt was made to perform green synthesis of AgNPs using 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. Synthesized AgNPs were characterized to assess their antibacterial activity against four microbial strains. Following this, their larvicidal activity towards the fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) were also investigated. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed with a naphthoquinone-derived compound ‘plumbagin’, which is known to be predominantly present across the Plumbaginaceae family of plant species [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Using Auto Dock 4.2, attempts were made to dock plumbagin with the crystal structures of D7 salivary protein and odorant-binding protein (OBP) from 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, respectively. The docking results showed that plumbagin possessed reliable hydrogen bond interactions with high dock scores compared with the respective co-crystal ligands of the target enzymes.
