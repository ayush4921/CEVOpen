<p>Fully grown leaves of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. were collected from the University of Madras, Guindy Campus, and initially cleaned using running tap water followed by double-distilled water to remove the dust particles. Around 10 g of washed leaves were boiled in 100 mL of distilled water for 30 min at 60 Â°C. Using Whatman filter paper, the aqueous crude extract was retained and used for further experiments.
