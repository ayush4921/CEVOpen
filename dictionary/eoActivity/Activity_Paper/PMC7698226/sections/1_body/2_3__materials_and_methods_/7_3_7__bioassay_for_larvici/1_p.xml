<p>The synthesized AgNPs were used at various concentrations (20–100 µg/mL). Each test included a set of control groups (distilled water) with five replicates for each concentration. The dose–response data were subjected to probit analysis to determine the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 24-h exposure under constant climatic conditions. Larvae were added to 249 mL of water and 1.0 mL of prepared plant extract by maintaining five replicates. The control WAS maintained without extract and the replicates were left for exposure for 24 h. Then, the number of viable larvae was reported for assessment of the mortality rate from the mean of triplicates using Equation (1). The extracts showing higher activity were considered for further studies:
