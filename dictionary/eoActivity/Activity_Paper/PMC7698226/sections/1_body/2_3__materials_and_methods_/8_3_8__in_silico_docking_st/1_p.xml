<p>A molecular docking study was performed to determine the binding efficacy of plumbagin in the active site of the chosen drug targets. A Lamarckian genetic algorithm method, implemented in the Auto Dock 4.2 program, was employed [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The ligand compound plumbagin was retrieved from the PubChem database. The ligand free form of D7 Salivary Protein of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (PDB:3DXL) and OBP of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (PDB: 3OGN) was fetched from the Protein Data Bank. Before molecular docking, using the PRODRG server, energy-minimized 3-D atomic coordinates of plumbagin was generated [

All torsions were allowed to rotate during docking. A grid box of size 50 Å × 50 Å × 50 Å with a spacing of 0.375 Å was prepared at the active site of both the enzymes (based on the hydrogen bonding interactions exhibited by their respective co-crystal ligands). The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) was used for molecular docking, where a maximum of 15 conformers was considered for each compound. Using Auto Dock 4.2, molecular docking was compiled and run under Microsoft Windows XP operating system.
