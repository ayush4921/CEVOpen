 <xref rid="plants-09-01577-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The lowest concentration (20 µg/mL) of AgNPs synthesized from plant extracts showed no mortality after 24 h. The mortality rate was significantly increased with an increasing dose-dependent manner where the highest mortality rate was observed with increasing concentrations of synthesized AgNPs. This difference in lethal concentrations might be due to differences in secondary metabolites present in the plant. This was in concordance with the previous reports exploring the insecticidal activity of the phytochemicals through the dose-dependent response [
