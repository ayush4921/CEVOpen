<p>In the present study, the larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. was explored by the use of AgNPs. As seen from previous reports [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the naphthoquinone compound plumbagin is found to be predominantly present in the Plumbaginaceae plant family. In particular, Maniafu et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported the presence of two compounds, viz. 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (plumbagin)’ and β-sitosterol, in the crude extracts from three 
 <italic>Plumbago</italic> spp. 
 <italic>Plumbago zeylanica</italic> (
 <italic>P. zeylanica</italic>) Linn, 
 <italic>Plumbago dawei</italic> (
 <italic>P. dawei</italic>) Rolfe, and 
 <italic>Plumbago stenophylla</italic> Bull. They attributed plumbagin to be primarily responsible for the larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. In a similar work, the root compound of plumbagin from 
 <italic>Plumbago zeylanica</italic> was evaluated for antimalarial activity against the fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 2014, Deshpande et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported the presence of plumbagin in the leaves of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. Hence, based on these observations, the present study focused on performing molecular docking of plumbagin with the mosquito salivary proteins.
