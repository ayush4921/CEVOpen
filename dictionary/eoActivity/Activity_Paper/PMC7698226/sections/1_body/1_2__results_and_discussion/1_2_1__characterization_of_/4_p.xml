<p>The synthesized PA-AgNPs were observed under TEM and are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01577-f004">Figure 4</xref>a. The shape of the particles was shown to be primarily spherical and hexagonal with a particle size of &lt;50 nm. Further, the TEM image of PA-AgNPs indicated smaller particles without agglomeration due to the phyto-molecules capping on the surface of the nanoparticle. The above findings followed earlier reports where plant extract was employed in synthesis of AgNPs [

Thus, the synthesized AgNPs were found to depend upon the presence of secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, steroids, tannins, and others, indicating that they might have played a vital role in the synthesis of AgNPs.
