<p>The synthesized AgNPs from 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern analysis. Results showed strong diffraction peaks in the spectrum of 2θ values ranging from 10° to 70° (

The peaks correlated with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure indexed by Bragg’s reflections corresponding to the (111, 200, 220, 311) plane. Some noise peaks were also observed, which could be due to the presence of organic material capped on the silver. Strong signals found in the EDX analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01577-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles. Similarly, the occurrence of weak signals from the same analysis confirmed the presence of some organic molecules, which is similar to earlier reports [
