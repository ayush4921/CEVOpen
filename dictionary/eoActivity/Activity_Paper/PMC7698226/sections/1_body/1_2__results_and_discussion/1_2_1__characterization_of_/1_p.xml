<p>The secondary metabolites present in the 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. plant extract act as reducing and capping agents and thus significantly facilitate the formation of silver ions from silver nitrate for the synthesis of AgNPs. Similar studies showed the presence of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, phenols, tannins, and other bioactive metabolites, that are mainly responsible for the synthesis of AgNPs [
