<p>Inflammation is a complex biological response of the vascular tissues to a range of stimuli, including irritants, injured cells and pathogens. Injuredinjured or damaged cellscell linked with inflammation have been shown to release arachidonic acid from the cell membrane [

 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The products of these two pathways are involved in the incidence of many inflammatory diseases including arthritis [
