 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> system (Fenton reaction; [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). The reaction mixture contained 500 μL of 2-deoxyribose (2.8 mM) in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), 200 μL of premixed ferric chloride (100 mM) and EDTA (100 mM) solution (1:1; v/v), 100 μL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (200 mM) with or without the extract solution (100 μL). The reaction was triggered by adding 100 μL of 300 mM ascorbate and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. An aliquot (0.5 mL) of the reaction mixture was added to 1 mL of TCA (2.8%; w/v; aqueous solution), then 1 mL of 1% aqueous TBA were added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was heated for 15 min on a boiling water bath, cooled and the absorbance of methanol extracts and their various fractions at 50–250 µg/mL for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was measured at 532 nm against a blank (the same solution but without leaf extract extract).
