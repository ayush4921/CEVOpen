<p>The crude samples were diluted with appropriate solvent (1/100, v/v) and filtered. The particle-free diluted crude extracts (1 μL) were injected using a syringe into the injector with a split ratio 30:1. All data were obtained by collecting the full-scan mass spectra within the scan range 40–550 amu. The percentage composition of the crude extract constituents was expressed as a percentage by peak area. The identification and characterization of chemical compounds in various crude extracts was based on GC retention time. The mass spectra were computer matched with those of standards available in mass spectrum libraries.</p>
