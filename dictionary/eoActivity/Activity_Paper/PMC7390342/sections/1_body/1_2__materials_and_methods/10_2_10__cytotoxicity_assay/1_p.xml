<p>The standard protocol for the assessment of cellular toxicity measures the ability of cultured cells to proliferate in the presence of a test sample, and subsequently quantitates total protein content with sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye as a measure of the percentage of surviving cells. The cytotoxic potential of methanol extracts and their different fractions was determined in the human lung carcinoma (LU-1) and human prostrate carcinoma (LnCaP) cell lines at 1.562–50 µg/mL in DMSO. Cultures (3 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates, and six two-fold serial dilutions of test samples in 10% DMSO (10 μL) were added to each well. The plates were incubated in air humidified and containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, at 37°C in incubator (Biotech) for 72 h, after which cell viability was determined with SRB staining following the standard protocol [

 <sub>50</sub> values were determined as the concentration of sample required to inhibit cell growth by 50% relative to a control treated with 0.5% DMSO. Colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich; purity &gt; 96 by HPLC) was used as the positive control compound.
