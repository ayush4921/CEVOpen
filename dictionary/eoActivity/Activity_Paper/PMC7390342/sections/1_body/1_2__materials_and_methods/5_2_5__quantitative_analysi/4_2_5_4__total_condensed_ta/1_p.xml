 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To 50 Î¼L of diluted sample, 3 mL of 4% vanillin solution in methanol and 1.5 mL of concentrated HCl were added. The mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min, and absorbance was measured at 500 nm against methanol as a blank. Total condensed tannins was expressed as mg catechin/g DW. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
