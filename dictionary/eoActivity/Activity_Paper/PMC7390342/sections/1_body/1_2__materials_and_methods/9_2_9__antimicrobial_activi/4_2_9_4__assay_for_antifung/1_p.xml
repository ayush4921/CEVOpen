<p>The agar tube dilution method was used to determine the antifungal activity of the leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Samples were prepared by dissolving plant extracts in DMSO. Culture media was prepared by dissolving 6.5 g of potato dextrose agar per 100 mL distilled water (pH 5.6). SDA (10 mL) was dispensed in screw-capped tubes and autoclaved (121°C for 21 min). Tubes were allowed to cool at 50°C and the SDA was loaded with 67 μL of extract pipetted from the stock solutions. The tubes containing the media were then allowed to solidify in slanting position at room temperature. The tubes containing solidified media and plant extract were inoculated with a 4-mm-diameter piece of inoculum taken from a 7 d-old culture of fungus. Controls were run in parallel whereby the respective solvent was used instead of plant extract. The test tubes were incubated at 28°C for 7 d. Cultures were examined twice weekly during the incubation. Readings were taken by measuring the linear length (mm) of fungus in the slant, and growth inhibition was calculated with reference to negative control.
