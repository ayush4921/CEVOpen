<p>The use of medicinal plants in the treatment of various human ailments depends on their phytochemical constituents. Our investigation of the presence of various active constituents in crude methanol extract and various fractions [chloroform, ethyl acetate and residual aqueous extract] indicated that methanol extracted the greatest range of phytochemicals from the plant. Hence, we used only the methanol extract for the GC–MS study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the methanol leaf extract of

The following bioactive compounds were found in the methanolic extracts: 2-nonadecanone 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine; ethyl iso-allocholate; 4-(3-hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol; hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid); 1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-3-[5-tetraazolyl]-1,2,4-triazole; 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol; Z,Z-4,16-octadecadien-1-ol acetate; 3-pyridinol, hexadeca-9-en-1-ol (phenolic and alcoholic compounds); 1-methyl-2-(3-methylpentyl)-cyclopropane; hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid(Z,Z) (fatty acid); Beta-elemen, phytol and N-[4-bromo-n-butyl]-piperidinone.
