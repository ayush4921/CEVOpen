<p>The inhibitory effect of cell growth was observed to be concentration dependent (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236319.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236319.g006">6</xref>). ME, once again, showed the strongest cytotoxic effect against human prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL, respectively) followed by CF (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.5 and 20 μg/mL, respectively) and EAF (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23 and 20 μg/mL, respectively), whereas the lowest effect was found for AE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 and 35 μg/mL, respectively). The fact that the ME exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity suggests that antioxidants play a major role in the cytotoxicity. These results are in accordance with Sekerler et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] who reported that 
 <italic>Centaurea salicifolia</italic> M.Bieb. ex Willd. chloroform extracts showed strong antioxidant ability, maximum phenolic content, remarkable anticancer, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore it can be supposed that other than antioxidants, high phenolic and flavonoid contents of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> ME are involved in the cytoxic activity. A study reported a good correlation between the flavonoid contents, antioxidant activities and cytotoxic activity (hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2) of
