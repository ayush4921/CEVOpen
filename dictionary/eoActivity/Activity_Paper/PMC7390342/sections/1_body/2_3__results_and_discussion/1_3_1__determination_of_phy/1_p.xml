<p>Plant extracts are complex mixtures of chemical compounds known to play important role in several biological activities. In this study the qualitativeq analysis of phytochemicals of 
 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> revealed the presence of alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids tannin and saponin in all the leaf extract fractions. Terpenoids were detected in all the fractions except EAF. Phlobatannins (tannins that with hot dilute acids yield a phlobaphene) were observed only in ME and EAF, whereas coumarin was found only in ME and CF (
