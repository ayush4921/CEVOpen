<p>The reducing power of all leaf extract fractions (50–200 μg/mL) from 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> was found to increase with concentration of the sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236319.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The ranking order for reducing power was ME &gt; CF &gt; EAF &gt; AE. Significantly higher reducing power (0.929±0.09 at 200 μg/mL) was found in the ME fraction. All extracts and fractions exhibited reducing power (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236319.g002">Fig 2</xref>), which is in accordance with several results in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Methanol extract showed the maximum reducing power, which is in agreement with Naz and Bano [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] who reported the highest reducing power ability of methanol extracts of
