<p>Eugenol extracts exhibited significant antioxidant potential as measured using DPPH radical scavenging (81%) and reducing power (1.12) at 1.0 μM/ml and 0.1 μM/ml, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] reported higher flavonoids content and antioxidant activity as well as positive correlation between them, in chloroform extract of 
 <italic>Merremia borneensis</italic>. Superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activities were reported higher in 
 <italic>Torilis leptophylla</italic> chloroform extract compared to its ethyl acetate extract [
