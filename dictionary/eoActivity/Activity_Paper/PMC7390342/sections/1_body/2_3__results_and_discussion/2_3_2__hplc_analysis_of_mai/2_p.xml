<p>The methanol leaf extract fraction of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> was found to contain some important flavonoids; i.e., apigenin, caffeic acid, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, isoquercetin, rutin and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid. The maximum total polyphenolic and flavonoid content, as well as antioxidant activity, has been reported in leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Amaranth hypochondriacus</italic>. They also mentioned the highest polyphenolic, flavonoid content and antioxidant potential in leaf extracts compared to different other parts of plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Flavonoids among all the phenolic compounds are known as the most important due to their strong antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Flavonoids have potent antimicrobial and antioxidant potential and are thought to have positive effects on human health [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It was reported that the flavonoid, rutin, also present in 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> extract, promoted the lipid peroxidation inhibition in heart tissues of rats exposed to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Henneberg et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] also reported the efficacy of rutin to detoxify oxidative species in human erythrocytes under oxidative stress.
