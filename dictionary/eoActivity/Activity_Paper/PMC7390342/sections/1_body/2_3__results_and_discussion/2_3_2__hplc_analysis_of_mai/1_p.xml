<p>HPLC analysis revealed the presence of various polyphenolic compounds in 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> leaf extract fractions identified against eight standards; i.e., apigenin, caffeic acid, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, isoquercetin, rutin and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid (
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All of the eight compounds were detected in ME, with isoquercetin, rutin, catechin and caffeic acid in the highest concentration (14.91, 11.55, 9.68 and 7.34 mg/g extract, respectively) compared to other fractions. In AE, only caffeic acid, gallic acid and catechin were detected. With the exception of apigenin, all of the previously mentioned polyphenolic compounds were detected in the CF, with isoquercetin, catechin, rutin and caffeic acid as the major components. Finally, the EAF was found to contain low concentrations of caffeic acid, catechin, gallic acid, rutin and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid compared to ME and CF.
