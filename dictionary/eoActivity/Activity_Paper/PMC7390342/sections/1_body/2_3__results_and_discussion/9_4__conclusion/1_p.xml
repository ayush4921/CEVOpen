<p>In this study, we showed that 
 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> extracts and their fractions demonstrated promising antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties, particularly for ME and CF. These biological activities were tentatively ascribed in part to the polyphenolics as well as other constituents of these fractions. Overall, the results obtained provide a biochemical rationale for further chemical analysis as well as animal and clinical studies with an antioxidant and chemotherapeutic focus.
