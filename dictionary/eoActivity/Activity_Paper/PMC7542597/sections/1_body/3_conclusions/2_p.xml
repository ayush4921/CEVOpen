<p>Our work suggests that 
 <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to merit their potential clinical use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild cases of COVID-19.
