 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> preparations have been experimentally studied for cough. The anti-tussive activity of its mucilage and isolated rhamnogalacturonan was evaluated in cats. Both substances suppressed the cough reflex and decreased the frequency of cough, especially in the laryngopharynx area, although the polysaccharide was more active than mucilage (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> models (

 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> ethanolic extract presented anti-inflammatory activity in mice through the ear edema model. The extract reduced the levels of IL-1β in tissue challenged by TPA. Also, the extract and isolated compounds inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. Malvidin-3-glucoside presented inhibitory activity similar to dexamethasone (
