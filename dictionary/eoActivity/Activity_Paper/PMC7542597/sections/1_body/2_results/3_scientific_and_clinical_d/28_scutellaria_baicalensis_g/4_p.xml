 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> has been not experimentally proven for symptoms of respiratory disease. Other related experimental effects include anti-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Extracts inhibited the production of NO, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-17, interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells (

 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> suppressed LP-induced COX-2 protein expression 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as presented analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities
