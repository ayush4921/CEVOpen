<p>Preclinical evidence. This species has not been experimentally proven for respiratory disease. The closest experiment is an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study examining SARS-CoV and the effect of several essential oils. The authors reported that a distilled oil extracted from 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> berries was an effective virucidal against SARS-CoV. This essential oil also contained eremanthin and dehydrocostus lactone as minor constituents at 3.65% and 7.57%, respectively. These compounds are somewhat unusual in essential oils, but at least one 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study found that dehydrocostus lactone had activity against the hepatitis B virus, an enveloped DNA virus (

 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> has also been evaluated for its antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities in mice and rats. The essential oil exhibited a signiﬁcant analgesic effect in tail-ﬂick and formalin tests, a dose-dependent anti-inﬂammatory effect in formalin-induced edema, and a moderate sedative effect at the anti-inﬂammatory doses (
