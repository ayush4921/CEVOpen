<p>Anti-inflammation activity was investigated via the amount of nitric oxide (NO) production in the murine macrophage cell RAW 264.7 (ATCC® TIB­71™) induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the method of Heo et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with modification. Cells were seeded with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS in 96-well plates at a density of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with LPS 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL with or without CCLE (CCLE was prepared in DMSO 10% and supplemented to medium at a final concentration of 125, 62.5, and 31.25

 <italic>μ</italic>L of cell culture supernatant was mixed with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the Griess reagent and incubated at room temperature in darkness for 10 minutes. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured using an ELISA reader.
