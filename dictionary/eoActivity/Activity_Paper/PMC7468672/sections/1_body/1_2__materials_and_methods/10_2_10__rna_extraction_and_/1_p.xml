<p>After 7-day treatment, granulation tissues (30 mg) from wounds were collected for RNA extraction, using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was used for evaluating mRNA expression of some genes involved in the wound healing process, including tumor necrosis factor 
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 1 (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1), transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was the housekeeping genes. The primers used for the genes are listed in
