<p>The total flavonoid content (TFC) CCLE was evaluated according to the method described by Msaada et al. with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The CCLE sample was diluted with ethanol 70% solution; 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sample was added to a glass tube containing 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> 5%; the mixture was vortexed for 10 seconds and left standing for 5 minutes. Then, 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (10%) and 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of NaOH 1 M were added to the tube. The mixture was then adjusted to 2 mL with distilled water and vortexed for 10 seconds, and absorbance was measured at 415 nm. TFC was expressed as milligram quercetin equivalent per gram of CCLE (mg QE/gE).
