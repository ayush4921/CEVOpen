<p>Fibroblast proliferation is essential to the wound healing process. The HE staining images of 7-day-old wound granulation revealed a significant increase of the fibroblast cell density by 1.9 times in the 50 mg/kg/d CCLE-treated group, compared to that of the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Besides, the two CCLE treatment groups also increased TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 gene expression by 2.2 and 3.3 times, respectively, to 10 mg/kg/d and 50 mg/kg/d doses of CCLE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 has been reported to be involved in induction on fibroblast proliferation [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, the increase of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 gene expression is strongly correlated with the increase of the fibroblast number in the HE staining images.
