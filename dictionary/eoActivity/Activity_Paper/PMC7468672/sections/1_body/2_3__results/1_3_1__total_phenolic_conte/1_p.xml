<p>The hydroethanolic extract from 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves was obtained with a yield about 16.75% of dried weight. Total phenolic content (TPC) was estimated using a Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay. The TPC of CCLE was 114.3 ± 1.7 mg GAE/g CCLE. The total flavonoid content (TFC) of CCLE was 145.46 ± 3.1 mg QE/g CCLE, using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method (
