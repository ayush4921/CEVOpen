<p>The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> indicated that CCLE has angiogenesis stimulation activity. Wounds from CCLE treatment mice have better neovascularization (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref>), compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). In addition, in the CCLE-treated group at the dose of 50â€‰mg/kg/d, VEGF mRNA expression also significantly increased by 2.4 times, compared to the control (
