<p>Significant differences in the wound closure rate and reepithelialization between CCLE treatment groups and the control group indicated that CCLE have wound healing activity in the mouse model. The results in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> showed that CCLE topical treatment dose-dependently increased the wound closure rate. The wound closure percentage in the CCLE 50â€‰mg/kg/d-treated group was significantly higher than that in the control group at an early stage, which was 28.0%, while the percentage in the control group was 15.4% after 4 days. Consequently, CCLE reduced the complete reepithelialization time significantly, which was approximately 3.5 days faster.
