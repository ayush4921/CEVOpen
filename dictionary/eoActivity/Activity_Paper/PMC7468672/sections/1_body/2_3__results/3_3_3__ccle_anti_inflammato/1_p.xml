<p>After the toxicity of CCLE on RAW 264.7 cells was tested, the CCLE concentrations which showed no toxicity to the cells (125, 62.5, and 31.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were used for anti-inflammatory analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CCLE showed anti-inflammatory capacity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> via the decrease of NO production in the mouse macrophage cell RAW 264.7 induced with LPS 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). Anti-inflammation effect of CCLE was dose-dependent, with the highest inhibition of NO production at 91.4% when cells were treated with CCLE at a concentration of 125
