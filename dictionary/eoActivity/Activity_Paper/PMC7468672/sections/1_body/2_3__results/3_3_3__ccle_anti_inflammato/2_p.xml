<p>Analysis from the histopathology result of 7-day-old wounds indicated that CCLE treatment at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d reduced the inflammatory cell density by 2.8 times (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). In addition, CCLE treatment decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1 dose-dependently. Wounds treated with CCLE 10 mg/kg/d and 50 mg/kg/d had levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> mRNA lower than the control 2.1 and 3.3 times, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The mRNA expression level of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1 in the 10 mg/kg/d and 50 mg/kg/d CCLE-treated groups was also downregulated by 3.3 and 4.6 times, respectively, compared to that of the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). Combined with the NO production inhibition in RAW 264.7 cells, the decrease of inflammatory cell density in granulation tissue and the mRNA downregulation of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1 genes suggested that CCLE has anti-inflammatory activity.
