 <italic>Crassocephalum crepidioides</italic> (Benth.) S. Moore. (
 <italic>Compositae</italic> family) is a TMP found in various parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The leaves of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> are traditionally used to treat indigestion, stomachache [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and wound [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> has been reported to have antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], hypoglycemic, antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] activities. Several bioactive compounds have been found in 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves, including some phenolic and flavonoid compounds [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves contains 
 <italic>β</italic>-cubebene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-farnesene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-caryophyllene. 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves has been also used for treating wounds in Vietnam, China, India, and some African countries [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there have been no published materials proving 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> wound healing activity. This study is aimed at investigating the wound healing activity of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> hydroethanolic leaf extract (CCLE) on a mouse excision wound model, focusing on the wound closure rate, histopathology characteristics, and the mRNA expression level of several genes involved in the wound healing process.
