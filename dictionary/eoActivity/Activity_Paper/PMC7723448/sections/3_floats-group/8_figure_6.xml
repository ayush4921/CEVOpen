  <p>DPK treatment protects nerve tissues from histopathology of neuropathic pain. Effect of DPK treatments on CIPN histopathology was evaluated through H&amp;E staining for axonal degeneration (AD), swelling (AS), and lymphocytic infiltration (L). Representative micrographs of H&amp;E stained sciatic nerve sections from NC 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, DC 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, GABA 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, DPK 69 
   <bold>(D)</bold>, DPK 205 
   <bold>(E)</bold>, and DPK 615 
   <bold>(F)</bold> groups at low (×10; scale bar: 100 µm) and high (×40; scale bar: 20 µm) magnifications are provided. Intact axons are indicated as “A,” Schwann cells as “SC,” myelin sheath as “MS,” axonal degeneration as “AD,” axonal swelling as “AS,” and lymphocytic infiltration as “L” in these micrographs.
