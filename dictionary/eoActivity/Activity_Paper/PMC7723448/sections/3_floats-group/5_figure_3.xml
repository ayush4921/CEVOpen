   <italic>In vivo</italic> experimental design and mouse CIPN model establishment. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation summarizing details of animal procurement, quarantining, CIPN model establishment through i.p. injections of PTX (2 mg/kg body weight/day for 6 days), drug administration, assessment parameters, and 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments. The groups included in this study are normal control (NC), disease control (DC) (PTX-treated animals receiving no treatment), gabapentin (GABA) (PTX-treated animals receiving reference drug gabapentin intraperitoneally at 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 2 weeks), DPK 69 (PTX-treated animals receiving 69 mg/kg body weight of DPK orally per day for 2 weeks), DPK 205 (PTX-treated animals receiving 205 mg/kg body weight of DPK orally per day for 2 weeks), and DPK 615 (PTX-treated animals receiving 615 mg/kg body weight of DPK orally per day for 2 weeks). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Body weights of the animals in different groups receiving different treatments were monitored for 15 days and graphically represented. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 in all groups, except GABA, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 5. Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test and observation represented as 
   <sup>#</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, when significantly different in comparison to NC; *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0, when significantly different in comparison to DC.
