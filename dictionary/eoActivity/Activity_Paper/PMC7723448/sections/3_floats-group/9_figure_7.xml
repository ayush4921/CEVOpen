  <p>DPK treatment ameliorates CIPN etiology. Effectivity of DPK treatment on reducing CIPN etiology is quantitatively represented as lesion scorings for axonal degeneration 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, axonal swelling 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and lymphocytic infiltration 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. Lesion scores are represented through individual graphs for respective parameters and total score 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Data represented as mean ± SEM, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 in all groups, except GABA, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 5. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test and observation represented as 
   <sup>###</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, when significantly different in comparison to NC; *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, when significantly different in comparison to DC.
