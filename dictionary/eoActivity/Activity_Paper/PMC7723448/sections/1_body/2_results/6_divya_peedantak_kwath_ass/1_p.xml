<p>PTX causes axonal degeneration, swelling, and lymphocytic infiltration (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Tasnim et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, efficacy of DPK in treating these conditions was evaluated through histological staining of sciatic nerve tissue and subsequent microscopic analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These pathological features have been scored and quantitatively represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A–D</xref>. Representative micrograph from the NC group shows intact axons (A), Schwann cells (SC), and myelin sheath (MS) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consequently, no lesion score showed up for this group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A–D</xref>). PTX treatment shows degenerated and swollen axons, indicated as AD and AS, respectively, in the micrograph. The image also shows infiltrated lymphocytes (L) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Treatments with gabapentin and DPK (at 205 and 619 mg/kg body weight doses) showed visible reduction in these pathological features in the respective images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C,E,F</xref>). However, the group receiving DPK at 69 mg/kg body weight did not show much improvement with respect to these features (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Individual lesion scores for axonal degeneration, swelling, and lymphocytic infiltration as well as the total one for the DC group were obviously the maximum. The lesion score for axonal degeneration although reduced visibly in GABA group, the change was not statistically significant. Similarly, reductions in the lesion score of axonal degeneration observed in DPK-treated groups were also not statistically significant. The changes in DPK-205 and DPK-619 groups were comparable to those in the GABA group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Lesion scores for axonal swelling in both GABA and DPK-619 groups were significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when compared to the DC group. Although, the lesion score for axonal swelling in the DPK-205 group was comparable to GABA and DPK-619 groups, it did not show statistical significance when compared to the DC group. Lesion score for axonal swelling in the DPK-69 group did not show much reduction and was comparable to the DC group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Lesion scores for infiltrating lymphocytes for each group exhibited a pattern similar to that shown by the lesion score for axonal swelling, except that the reduction in infiltrating lymphocytes in case of GABA and DPK-619 groups were more pronounced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) when compared to the DC group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). In the total lesion scoring, in addition to the GABA and DPK-619 groups, the DPK-205 group also showed statistically significant reduction relative to the DC group. However, the reduction in the latter was less pronounced than the former ones (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in case of DPK-205 vs. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 in cases of GABA and DPK-619). Total lesion score for DPK-69 did not show statistically significant reduction when compared to the DC group, rather total lesion scores for both appeared comparable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Altogether these observations showed that DPK treatment, albeit at higher doses, can assuage the etiology of PTX-induced neuropathy. Considering that DPK is an herbal decoction, higher dose may not be an issue with respect to toxicity. In fact, the recommended doses of gabapentin have reported side effects which may be not the case for DPK.
