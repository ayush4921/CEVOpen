<p>Given the fact that DPK is practically a storehouse of anti-inflammatory agents, we evaluated its efficiency in attenuating inflammation on differentiated THP-1 cells 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> PMA-differentiated, LPS-inflamed human THP-1 cells were treated with different concentrations (1, 10, 100, 300, and 1,000 μg/mg) of DPK. LPS-treated and -untreated differentiated THP-1 cells, respectively, serving as disease (0) and normal (NC) controls did not receive any DPK treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) have been implicated in neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we monitored the effect of DPK treatment on these cytokines released in LPS-induced THP-1 cells. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were, respectively, 3, 2.8, and 5.6 times higher in disease control (0) cells with inflammation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A–C</xref>). Noticeable reductions in IL-6 levels from 353.9 (±4.7) pg/ml in (0) group to 242.2 (±8.8) pg/ml and 74.1 (±13.1) pg/ml were observed when the cells were treated with DPK at 300 and 1,000 μg/mg concentrations, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Effects on IL-1β levels were visible with DPK treatments at 100 μg/mg or more. It reduced from 540.83 (±22.8) pg/ml in (0) group to 344 (±28.4), 320 (±2.3), and 293 (±27.6) pg/ml, when treated with 100, 300, and 1,000 μg/ml of DPK, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Significant reduction in the level of TNF-α relative to the disease control (0) cells (3,685.0 ± 33.3 pg/ml) was observed with 10 μg/mg DPK treatment (3,070.1 ± 36.9 pg/ml) onward. However, we did not observe dose dependency in the reduction in TNF-α (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these observations showed that DPK possess strong anti-inflammatory effects. In order to ensure that PMA, LPS, DPK, or their cotreatments did not have any untoward effects on the cells and that the model was suitable for evaluation of inflammation, cell viability of THP-1 cells was checked through alamarBlue assay, conforming to the described experimental regimen. Cells were equally viable in the control and experimental groups, confirming the cytosafety of DPK in the treatment regimen and also lending the credibility to the experimental setup (
