<p>The mouse model of CIPN was generated through intraperitoneal injection of PTX at a human-relevant clinical dose. The experimental design and regimen have been explained in detail in the

 <italic>Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Animal Models and Treatment Groups</italic>), 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and schematically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. The effect of DPK on general health and metabolism was monitored through change in the body weights of the animals and alteration in their food and water intake habits. The PTX-induced disease control (DC) group showed approximately 9% increase in body weight by day 14, whereas that of normal control (NC) group was 3% by the same day. The DC group showed a statistically significant more increase in body weight than the normal control (NC) animals. Interestingly, an increase in body weights was under control by day 13 and day 14 in the DPK-615 group, receiving a daily oral dose of 615 mg/kg DPK. The average body weights in this group were significantly lower when than those of the DC and NC groups. However, similar effects were not observed in DPK-69 and DPK-205 groups, which received daily oral doses of 69 and 205 mg/kg of DPK, respectively. This effect was also not observed in the group receiving gabapentin, the FDA-approved drug for treating CIPN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Food and water intake were similar among the animals across different groups (data not shown). This suggested that observed increase in the body weight of the DC group is not due to any change in the eating and drinking habits of the animals, rather most likely due to some underlying metabolic alterations experienced while establishing the CIPN mouse model.
