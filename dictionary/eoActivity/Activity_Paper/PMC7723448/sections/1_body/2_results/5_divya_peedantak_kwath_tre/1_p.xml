<p>The effect of DPK treatment on PTX-induced oxidative stress in peripheral nerve tissue was evaluated 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> by monitoring tissue levels of MDA, GSSG, and GSH:GSSG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A–C</xref>). The DC group is expected to experience enhanced lipid peroxidation due to PTX treatment which was reflected as a significantly increased MDA level (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) when compared to the NC group. Gabapentin and DPK treatments significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) reduced the MDA levels in the respective treatment groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, the GSSG level in the DC group was more than double of that observed in the NC group (117.34 ± 10.61 vs. 51.45 ± 7.71 μM/mg of tissue, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Treatment with gabapentin although showed visible reduction in the GSSG level, the change was not statistically significant when compared to that of the DC group. However, GSSG levels in all the DPK-treated groups were significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) relative to DC groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Likewise, the GSH:GSSG in all the treatment groups were noticeably high when compared to the DC group. The differences were statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for GABA and DPK-205 groups and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for the DPK-615 group). GSH:GSSG for the DPK-69 group was visibly more than that of the DC group, but the difference was not statistically significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also checked the effect of DPK treatment on the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α in study animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The mean serum TNF-α was significantly raised in the DC group when compared to the NC group (20.25 ± 1.36 pg/ml vs. 13.50 ± 0.83 pg/ml, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Treatment with gabapentin reduced the serum TNF-α level to 5.72 ± 0.84 pg/ml (DC vs. GABA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Treatments with DPK showed a dose-dependent reduction of serum TNF-α, and the changes were all statistically significant when compared to the DC group [20.25 ± 1.36 pg/ml in DC vs. 15.94 ± 1.36 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 12.50 ± 0.34 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 10.23 ± 1.93 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) pg/ml in DPK-69, DPK-205, and DPK-615 groups, respectively]. Taken together, these observations indicate that DPK treatment alleviates the oxidative stress and concomitant inflammation imposed by PTX treatment.
