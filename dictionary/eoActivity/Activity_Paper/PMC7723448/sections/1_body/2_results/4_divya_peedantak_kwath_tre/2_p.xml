<p>The tail flick latency test was conducted to evaluate the modulation of nociception and relieving of mechano-hyperalgesia by DPK treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). A threshold around 8 (±0.18) s of latency was established which was maintained in the NC group. Induction of CIPN with PTX reduced this threshold significantly, to an average 3.65 (±0.12) s in the treatment groups by day 7. In the DC group, this was even lower (1.89 ± 0.17 s). This reduction of latency threshold upon CIPN induction reflects allodynia. Treatment with gabapentin (GABA group) increased the average latency time to 5.69 ± 0.09 s by day 12 and 7.15 ± 0.09 s by day 17. Latency time in the DPK-615 group was around 3.6 ± 0.11 s by day 12 but caught up with the GABA group at 7.13 ± 0.08 s by day 17. These values were noticeably higher than those of the DC group. The increase in latency times in DPK-69 and DPK-205 trailed behind. DPK-205 witnessed an increase in latency time to 4.53 ± 0.15 s by day 12 and 6.14 ± 0.09 s by day 17. Latency times for DPK-60 after day 12 and day 17 were around 3.79 (±0.17) and 5.16 (±0.13) s, respectively. While all the treatment groups showed increases in latency times reflecting amelioration of the inflicted allodynia, latency time of the DC group remained significantly lower than that of the treatment groups. In fact, it reduced to 1.70 (±0.05) s by day 12 from 1.89 (±0.17) s on day 7 and further to 1.58 (±0.08) s by day 17, although the reduction was not visibly discernible.
