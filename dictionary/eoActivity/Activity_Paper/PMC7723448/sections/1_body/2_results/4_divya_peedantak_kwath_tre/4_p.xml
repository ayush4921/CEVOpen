<p>Allodynia or increased pain sensation in PTX-induced neuropathy can be due to neuroinflammation (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the Randall–Selitto test was used to assess the effect of DPK treatment on modulation of this pain sensitivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). While the normal PWT in all the groups was observed to be 21.2 ± 0.18 g, it reduced to around 5.5–9 g after PTX dosing by day 9. Following gabapentin treatment, PWT increased to 11.69 ± 0.51 and 17.54 ± 0.31 g by day 13 and day 19, respectively. A visible increase in PWT in case of DPK-69, DPK-205, and DPK-615 groups was observed to be 8.93 ± 0.22, 13.86 ± 1.17, and 16.31 ± 0.45 g, respectively, only by day 19. Meanwhile, PWT in the DC group continued to decrease further to 3.93 ± 0.23 and 3.63 ± 0.22 g by day 13 and day 19, respectively. All of these observations demonstrated that DPK can be a very potent modulator of PTX-induced pain sensitivity.
