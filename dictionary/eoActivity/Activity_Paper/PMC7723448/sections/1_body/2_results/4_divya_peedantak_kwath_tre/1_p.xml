<p>PTX has been shown to induce heat hyperalgesia, mechano-hyperalgesia, mechano-allodynia, and allodynia (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Scripture et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the pharmacological effects of DPK on PTX-induced neuropathic pain sensitivity was analyzed using the hot plate test, tail prick latency test, Von Frey test, and Randall–Selitto test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A–D</xref>). Efficacy of DPK in assuaging heat hyperalgesia was monitored through the hot plate test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). PTX administration reduced the latency times to almost half (from average 12.29 ± 0.24 s to around 7.78 ± 0.18 s) by day 6 in all the groups, except NC, one that did not receive the chemotherapeutic treatment. A significant increase in the latency times of the groups receiving treatments for CIPN was observed over time. Latency time of the group receiving gabapentin increased from an average 7.58 ± 0.80 to 9.03 ± 0.45 s by day 11, a significant improvement over the DC group, in which the latency time further reduced to around 5.29 (±0.20) s over this period. An increase in latency time (8.52 ± 0.88 to 9.24 ± 0.75 s) in the group receiving DPK at 206 mg/kg body weight was comparable to the GABA group at day 11. However, the group receiving DPK at 69 mg/kg body weight showed only a marginal increase (7.76 ± 0.39 to 8.22 ± 0.33 s) in latency time over this period. The most significant increase in latency time, from 7.52 (±0.88) to 10.28 (±0.91) s, was observed in the group that received DPK at 615 mg/kg body weight. This increase was even more pronounced than that observed in the GABA group. Moreover, the increase in latency times of all the treatment groups was significant when compared to the DC group. The improvement was more noticeable by day 16 which witnessed a sharp increase in latency times 11.76 (±0.49) and 10.92 (±0.36) s, respectively, for DPK-615 and DPK-205 groups. The GABA group showed a trend similar to the DPK-205 group, with its average latency time increasing to 11.08 (±0.53) s. However, DPK-69, with its average latency time increasing to only 8.43 (±0.3) s, did not show a sharp increase in latency time as other DPK groups, although it was statistically significant (
