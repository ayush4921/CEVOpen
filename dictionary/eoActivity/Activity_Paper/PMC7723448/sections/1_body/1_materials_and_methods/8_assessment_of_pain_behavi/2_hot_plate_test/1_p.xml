<p>The hot plate test was performed to measure response latencies as described previously with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arrau et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Balkrishna et al., 2019a</xref>). On the day of assessment, after 1 h of drug treatment, all the animals were placed in the Perspex cylinder of the hot plate (UgoBasile, Italy) maintained at 55.0 ± 0.5°C, and time to discomfort reaction (licking paws or jumping) was recorded as response latency. A cutoff point of 20°s was considered to avoid any possible accidental paw damage.
