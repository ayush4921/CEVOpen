<p>The CIPN animal model was generated as previously described (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Thangamani et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Kaur and Muthuraman, 2019</xref>). Eight- to 10-week old male CD-1 mice were randomized based on body weights and divided into six different groups consisting of six animals each. The details of randomization, dosage, and associated descriptions are depicted in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Due to one mortality observed in G3 (GABA), animal sample size was revised to 
 <italic>N</italic> = 5. Animals of the group G1 served as normal control. PTX was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 2 mg/kg body weight for six consecutive days to those of groups G2 to G6. PTX-treated animals were assessed for pain sensitivity. Animals that developed neuropathic pain were selected for the experiment and randomized into different treatment groups (G2–G6). Animals of group G2 served as disease control (DC) and were treated with 0.25% Na-CMC. The reference drug gabapentin (GABA) was administered intraperitoneally to the animals of group G3 (GABA) at 100 mg/kg body weight. Animals of groups G4 (DPK-69), G5 (DPK-205), and G6 (DPK-615) were treated orally with Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (DPK) at 69, 205, and 615 mg/kg body weight, respectively. All drug treatments were given for two weeks. The neurobehavioral monitoring of the animals through hot plate, tail flick latency, Von Frey, and Randall–Selitto tests was performed on different days, before and after PTX treatment. Body weights of the animals were measured every day for fifteen days (day 1–day 15) from the day when PTX administration was started. The change in body weight of each animal was calculated before and after the development of CIPN and after subsequent treatment. Animal feed and water consumption were recorded daily for the whole study duration.
