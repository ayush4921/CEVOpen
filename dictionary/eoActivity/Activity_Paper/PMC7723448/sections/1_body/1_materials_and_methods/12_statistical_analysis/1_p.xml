<p>Experiments were performed in triplicates and quantitative data represented as mean ± SEM. Two groups were compared by an unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. For comparing three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was used. For comparisons between three or more groups for different time points, two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used. Observations were considered statistically significant at 
 <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05.
