<p>The levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were measured according to 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Hissin and Hilf (1976)</xref>. The isolated sciatic nerve tissue samples were homogenized in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 25% metaphosphoric acid. The homogenates were clarified through centrifugation at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content was determined by incubating clarified homogenate with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPT) at room temperature for 15 min in dark. Fluorescence was measured at 350 (excitation) and 420 (emission) nm using the EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, United States). Levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were determined by first incubating the clarified tissue homogenates with N-ethylmaleimide (0.04 M) for 30 min in dark and, subsequently, with 0.1 N NaOH and OPT solution for another 15 min. Fluorescence was measured at 350 (excitation) and 420 (emission) nm as mentioned earlier. Lipid peroxidation was monitored through the levels of malodialdehyde (MDA) in the clarified tissue homogenates according to 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Heath and Packer (1968)</xref>. This assay is based on the reaction of MDA with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) forming an MDA–TBA adduct that absorbs at 532 nm. Clarified tissue homogenates were incubated with three volumes of 0.5% TBA (diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 8) at 95°C in a water bath for 25 min. The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples on ice. Absorbance was measured at 532 and 600 nm using the EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, United States). Absorbance values measured at 600 nm were subtracted from MDA–TBA complex values at 532 nm. MDA concentration was calculated using the Lambert–Beer equation with an excitation coefficient
