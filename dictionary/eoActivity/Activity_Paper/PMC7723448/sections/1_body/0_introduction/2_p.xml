<p>Other approved and licensed drugs for neuropathic pain also have associated side effects. Conventional analgesics like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are ineffective clinically in attenuating neuropathic pain. Besides, opioids are addictive and cause seizures and respiratory malfunctioning. Despite their reported anti-allodynic effects, use of tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants against neuropathy is limited again due to severe side effects including, blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain or loss, low blood pressure, rashes, hives, and increased heart rate. Therefore, identification of an alternative treatment for CIPN with less or no side effects is essential. Different traditional systems of medicine, with recommendations for herbal treatments, have been used throughout the world for treating neuropathic pain. This encouraged researchers to explore plants like

 <italic>Allium sepa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> as sources for medicine against CIPN (
