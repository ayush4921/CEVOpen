<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), one of the most common side effects of chemotherapeutic agents, has symptoms like pain, allodynia, loss of sensation, paresthesia, numbness, tingling, and gait disturbances (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Heuvel et al., 2017</xref>). CIPN quite often leads to reduction in the dose of the chemotherapeutic agent being administered or, in the worst case, discontinuation of the treatment altogether. This not only affects the quality of life but also puts the survival of the patient at stake (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Miltenburg and Boogerd, 2014</xref>). Particularly, with extension in cancer patient survival times due to newer therapies, CIPN is becoming more prevalent. A staggering 68% of CIPN prevalence, in the first month of chemotherapy that reduces only to 60 and 30% in the subsequent three and six months, respectively, is indeed alarming. These figures are based on a review of data from 4,179 patients across 31 studies, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The dataset analyzed in this review included reports from CIPN cases due to treatments with oxaliplatin, bortezomib, placlitaxel, taxane, cisplatin, vincristine, thalidomide, platinum, carboplatin, docetaxel, and proteasome inhibitor (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Briani et al., 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, available treatment options for CIPN are limited, often ineffective or with undesirable side effects. Moreover, underlying pathophysiology of CIPN is still somewhat less understood. Considering CIPN as neuropathic pain due to axonal degeneration, relevant pharmacologic treatments, involving tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, are administered. However, these agents showed suboptimal efficacy against CIPN and, not to mention, have unacceptable aftereffects (

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>). This implicates that the disease mechanism behind CIPN is different from the one responsible for typical neuropathic pain. Based on the modestly positive outcome of randomized control clinical trial, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has recommended the use of duloxetine against CIPN. However, duloxetine is more effective in case of central neurotoxicity, characterized by mental confusion, catatonia, and hyporeflexia that particularly occur under oxaliplatin treatment (
