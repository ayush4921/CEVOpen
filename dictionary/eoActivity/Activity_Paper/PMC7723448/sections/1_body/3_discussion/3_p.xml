<p>Indeed, there are reports on efficiencies of extracts from several herbal origins in handling CIPN which has been reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Garg and Adams (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Forouzanfar and Hosseinzadeh (2018)</xref>. These studies have mostly evaluated single plant extracts and, in few cases, have explored the possible mechanism of action. However, none of these are formulations, thereby limiting their possibility to be used as medication. These studies are very good for enriching the knowledge base on alternative medicinal systems, which, of course, can be used further to identify a successful treatment for CIPN.
