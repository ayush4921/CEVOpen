<p>About 20% of cancer pains are treatment related and are mostly neuropathic in nature (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Verstappen et al., 2003</xref>). Neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy lead to CIPN. This distributes pain in a stocking-and-glove manner (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2001</xref>). The pain is pricking or burning in nature with “electric sensation” (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">DeSantis et al., 2015</xref>). At molecular levels, dynamics of microtubule assembly is affected in PTX-induced CIPN (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2008</xref>). Taxane agents bind to polymerized tubulin within microtubules and prevent their depolymerization (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Jordan and Wilson, 2004</xref>). This leads to microtubule aggregation in axons and Schwann cells (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Kuroi and Shimozuma, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Stillman and Cata, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Izycki et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ghoreishi et al., 2018</xref>). Axonal degeneration is a common feature in CIPN pathology (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2018</xref>). The approved analgesic treatments for CIPN have their undesirable side effects. Gabapentin attenuates pain in CIPN through modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, NMDA receptors, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition of the membrane, anterograde (axoplasmic) trafficking, inhibition of neurotransmitter release, and inflammation (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Kukkar et al., 2013</xref>). Microtubule dynamics is not targeted by gabapentin. Thus, gabapentin is likely to ameliorate CIPN symptomatically by affecting nociception, neuropathy being still at large. Therefore, it is imperative to find mechanism-based strategies, without side effects, for preventing and relieving CIPN (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ghoreishi et al., 2018</xref>). Fortunately, this concept is evolving fast, albeit with not very promising outcomes yet (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Freynhagen and Bennett, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Vardeh et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>). PPAR agents like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have been explored in these regards. These agents are neuroprotective (decreased lesion volume), anti-inflammatory (decreased microglial activation and inflammatory gene expression), anti-apoptotic (decreased number of apoptotic neurons), and antioxidative (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). But, weight gain, fluid retention, congestive heart failure, and bone fractures are common adverse effects associated with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Nesto et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Betteridge, 2011</xref>). Among severe side effects and PPAR-γ agonists, rosiglitazone has been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events, while pioglitazone with significantly increased incidence of bladder cancer (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Nissen and Wolski, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Friedland et al., 2012</xref>). In 2000, due to hepatotoxicity, troglitazone, yet another PPAR-γ agent, was withdrawn from the clinical use. Dual PPAR-α/γ agonists, like tesaglitazar, muraglitazar, and ragaglitazar have been associated with compound-specific safety, like nonreversible increases in serum creatinine, increase in cardiovascular events, and bladder tumors, respectively; the last one being validated in rodents (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, alternative treatment options in traditional systems of medicines need to be explored.
