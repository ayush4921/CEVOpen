<p>Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related pathophysiological processes, one of which can be easily induced by another. Thus, both processes are simultaneously found in many pathological conditions, including CIPN (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, 2016</xref>). Oxidative stress activates a variety of transcription factors involved in inflammatory pathways which can cause many chronic diseases (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>). Chemotherapy induces immunomodulatory effects, which in turn causes cytokine-induced neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is emerging as one of the major mechanisms of CIPN pathology (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Lees et al., 2017</xref>). This implicates that herbs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties are likely to be more effective against CIPN. Oxidative stress is known to induce inflammation during CIPN pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Areti et al., 2014</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in pathophysiology of PTX-induced pain (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Duggett et al., 2017</xref>). Under oxidative stress, when intra- and extracellular levels of ROS rise in the tissues, the inherent ROS scavenging system of the body employs enzymes like glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins to generate oxidized glutathione (GSSG) from reduced glutathione (GSH). ROS like hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides get scavenged through reduction during this process (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Meister, 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Deneke and Fanburg, 1989</xref>). Thus, under oxidative stress, tissue levels of GSSG increase. GSH:GSSG serves as an important bioindicator of cellular health. Free radicals generated during oxidative stress lead to lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Barrera, 2012</xref>). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, including when it occurs in the neural tissue as well (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Naik et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Niki, 2008</xref>). We investigated the effect of DPK treatment on oxidative stress in sciatic nerves and that on cytokines levels in human THP-1 cells. DPK treatment reduced the MDA and GSSG levels while increasing GSH:GSSG. The anti-inflammatory effect of DPK was evaluated through its efficiency in reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. LPS was used to induce inflammation in these cells subsequent to their pretreatment with DPK. Besides, serum TNF-α levels were found to be reduced in a dose-dependent manner in response to DPK treatment. Our observations indicate that DPK alleviates oxidative stress and prohibits inflammatory response.
