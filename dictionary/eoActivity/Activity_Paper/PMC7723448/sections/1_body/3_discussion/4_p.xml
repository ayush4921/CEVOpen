<p>Ayurveda, the traditional ancient medicine system of India, relies on protocols and formulations used in combination to treat any ailment. Each treatment regimen is customized based on patient body type with respect to its metabolic efficiency. Ayurvedic medicines are not mere extracts or decoctions. They are well-optimized treatment formulae. Therefore, Ayurvedic treatments aim at eradicating the cause, rather than just subduing or curing the symptoms of the ailment. Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (DPK) is a decoction of 28 herbs, with meticulous optimization with respect to part/s of the plants included, form/s and quantities in which these parts were used (

While our observations from behavioral studies convincingly proved that DPK is quite effective in treating CIPN, those from biochemical studies have given insight into the mechanism behind DPK action against CIPN. Our observations indicate that DPK alleviates oxidative stress and prohibits inflammatory response. Besides, its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, DPK is able to control PTX-induced weight gain in the animals. However, DPK treatment did not show any other effects on the gross metabolism of the study animals. Weight gain has been reported clinically as a side effect of chemotherapy (
