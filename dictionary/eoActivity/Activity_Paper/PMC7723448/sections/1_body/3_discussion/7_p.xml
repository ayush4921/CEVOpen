<p>Neuropathic pain is a maladaptive response of the nervous system to damage (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Costigan et al., 2009</xref>). The peripheral component of the somatosensory nerve senses the pain stimuli and transmits to the central component for processing and response disbursement. A malfunctioning peripheral system due to tissue damage owing to chemotherapy therefore jeopardizes the first step in pain behavior, often leading to over-responsiveness. Restoration of peripheral nerve tissue from the damaging effects of oxidative stress and concomitant inflammation helps in re-establishing appropriate pain responses. Some of the herbal ingredients of DPK have established antinociceptive property, like

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2008</xref>), in addition to being analgesic, have anti-inflammatory effects. These observations implicate that DPK is likely to target the oxidative stressâ€“mediated neuroinflammation in neuropathic pain pathology. We observed that DPK treatment alleviated CIPN-associated axonal degeneration and swelling and lesion formation. Lymphocytic infiltration was also reduced. DPK quite efficiently modulated the nociceptive behaviors of the animals with CIPN, implicating a role in re-establishing the tissue structure of peripheral nerves, resulting in reversion of the pain over responses. The assuaging of axonal degeneration, swelling, and lymphocyte infiltration in PTX-induced CIPN can be attributed to the neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> and 
 <italic>P. retrofractum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Dar et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> serves as a nerve tonic in promoting overall health of the nervous system (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Akram et al., 2011</xref>). We did not find any ingredient of DPK to directly have effect on microtubule dynamics, a fast-emerging cause of CIPN pathology. However, ROS generated during oxidative stress is known to disrupt microtubule networks, leading to formation of tubulin aggregates in plants (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Livanos et al., 2014</xref>). So, it is self-evident that attenuating oxidative stress will help restoring the microtubule dynamics. 
 <italic>R. communis</italic> has also been shown to target the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) pathway in manifesting its therapeutic effects (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdul et al., 2018</xref>). Since DPK is a collection of active ingredients from several herbs, we cannot exactly attribute its effectivity against CIPN entirely to PPAR-targeting property of 
 <italic>R. communis</italic>. Nevertheless, there are high chances that this pathway is also targeted in addition to others, thereby making DPK highly potent against CIPN.
