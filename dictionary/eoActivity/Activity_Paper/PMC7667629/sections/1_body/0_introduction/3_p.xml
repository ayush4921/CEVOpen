<p>Addressing AMR relies on good antimicrobial stewardship and adherence to clinical treatment guidance. However, up-to-date product information such as a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) based on the available scientific evidence may also be crucial to sustain safe and effective use of the available antibiotics. Within a referral procedure, all available scientific evidence is reviewed. Typically, the outcome of a referral is an amended product information for healthcare professionals and patients reflecting a consensus on product characteristics (i.e. regarding therapeutic indication, dosage, contraindications, adverse events, warning and precautions) that ideally reflects the current state of knowledge and science. The underlying policy strategy is that EU-wide harmonised and adequate instructions for healthcare professionals and patients reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics, thereby contributing to a solution for the AMR emergency.</p>
