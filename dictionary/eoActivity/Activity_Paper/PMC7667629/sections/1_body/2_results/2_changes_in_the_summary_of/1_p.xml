<p>A summary of the changes in the SmPC as a result of referral procedures is presented in 
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The outcome of all 15 referrals included the restriction of antibiotic use. The amendments such as deletion and addition of an indication per medicinal product in the section 4.1 varied from two for meropenem up to 16 for fosfomycin. The outcomes of 13 referrals included deletion of therapeutic indication that involved non-prophylactic and prophylactic treatment. Only one referral included deletion of both a prophylactic and a non-prophylactic treatment for a single indication (amoxicillin used for endocarditis). Meropenem and colistin/colistimethate sodium were the only antibiotics where a referral did not result in deletion of therapeutic indication, but involved restriction of use. For meropenem there was one addition in the therapeutic indication statement regarding the paediatric population, i.e. 3 months as the lower age limit for treatment of bronchopulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis and complicated urinary tract infections. For colistin/colistimethate sodium the section was revised as follows: colistin/colistimethate sodium are now indicated in adults and children including neonates for the treatment of serious infections with selected aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in patients with limited treatment options. The majority (13/15), of referral procedures resulted in a deletion of at least two therapeutic indications in section 4.1. (

Septicaemia was the most common disease removed from the SmPC section 4.1. of the antibiotics included (ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime sodium and teicoplanin), followed by community-acquired pneumonia (ceftazidime, cefuroxime axetil and fosfomycin), gonorrhoea (cefuroxime axetil, cefuroxime sodium, amoxicillin), bone and joint infections (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin and cefuroxime sodium) and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (levofloxacin, teicoplanin, ceftriaxone). Meningitis (imipenem/cilastatin and cefuroxime sodium) ranked at an equal rate with urethritis (cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin), gynaecological infections (piperacillin/tazobactam and cefuroxime sodium), upper respiratory tract infections (cefuroxime sodium and fosfomycin) and lower respiratory tract infections (ceftazidime and imipenem/cilastatin). There were also several diseases or groups of infections that were deleted from section 4.1. for a single referral procedure. For instance the following indications were removed (antibiotics between brackets): sinusitis (ceftriaxone), tonsillitis (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), asymptomatic bacteriuria and acute cystitis during pregnancy (fosfomycin trometamol oral solution), hospital-acquired pneumonia (levofloxacin), bronchitis (amoxicillin) or
