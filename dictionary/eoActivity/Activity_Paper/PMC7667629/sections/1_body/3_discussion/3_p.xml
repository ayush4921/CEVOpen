<p>The most notable referral procedure was on colistin/colistimethate sodium. These antibiotics belong to the class of polymyxins that is currently listed among the highest priority critically important antimicrobial medicines [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The usage of colistin was minimal because of its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, however, it was reintroduced during the last years as a result of the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms [
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several publications in the scientific literature claim that owing to limited therapeutic options against serious infections with Gram-negative bacteria, colistin usage has increased considerably in the last years [

 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial that the most up-to-date scientific evidence is included in the SmPC of this class of antimicrobials. During the referral procedure for colistin/colistimethate sodium, the therapeutic indications were restricted to serious infections with selected aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in patients with limited treatment options. This approach is in line with current evidence which shows that polymyxins have assumed an important role as salvage therapy for otherwise untreatable Gram-negative bacterial infections, most notably multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and Enterobacteriaceae [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several therapeutic indications were deleted in line with the national guidelines. For instance, ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of pharyngitis and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should not be used for tonisillitis [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, important changes in SmPC were also made with regard to treatment options for therapeutic indications of respiratory tract infections, including deletion of bronchitis from the amoxicillin SmPC and lower respiratory tract infections from the ceftazidime and imipenem/cilastatin SmPC. According to the literature, acute bronchitis is the most common of lower respiratory tract infections. Despite well-known scientific data that the majority of acute bronchitides in healthy adults are caused by viral infections, antibiotics are still being prescribed [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Deleting acute bronchitis from therapeutic indications (section 4.1. of the SmPC) for amoxicillin is the first step to decrease usage of these antibiotics. The most common disease removed from the SmPC of four referral procedures (ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime sodium, teicoplanin) was septicaemia. This very complex disease triggers sepsis that causes between 6 and 9 million deaths every year worldwide [
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immediate selection of the appropriate antibiotic treatment is essential [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Septicaemia was removed from the SmPC mainly owing to insufficient data provided to support this indication. In addition, it was not considered to represent correct therapeutic indication and was replaced with bacteraemia, however we would expect this replacement to have a minimum impact on antimicrobial stewardship.
