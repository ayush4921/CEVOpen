<p>The oral toxicity studies in the rat model revealed that 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight did not produce any serious adverse effect with respect to general behavior, body weight, feed intake, biochemical parameters, and organ histology. In addition, cytotoxicity analysis showed that nontoxic concentration of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> (2, 1.4, 30, and 1.4 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, respectively) does not affect cell viability or the DNA. Therefore, these concentrations may be practiced for human consumption without any adverse health effect. However, we recommend subchronic and chronic toxicity tests to further exonerate the adverse effects by repeated administration of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis.</italic> Further, it is possible that higher doses of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract would potentially damage DNA, and therefore, we recommend further research towards standardization of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> as preservative of food meant for human consumption and/or as a therapeutic.
