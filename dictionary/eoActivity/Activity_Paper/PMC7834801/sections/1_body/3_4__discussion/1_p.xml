<p>Evaluation of toxicity, if any, of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract is the principal objective of this research since there is little scientific and clinical data on the effectiveness and the safety of 
 <italic>A malaccensis</italic> rhizome extract. Single oral dose administration of 2000 mg/kg body weight of crude 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract did not induce mortality or clinical signs of toxicity in rats throughout the observation period of 14 days. This indicated that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract is greater than 2000 mg/kg body weight. Although all treated rats showed normal behavior during 24 h, some animals showed sign of mild distress during the first 4 h and drank too much water during the first 3 h after oral administration of the extract. According to Teo et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], changes in the body weight can be considered as markers of adverse effects upon oral administration of drugs and chemicals. More than 10% body weight loss from the initial body weight is considered as significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 %) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, none of the animals showed such reduction in body weight, but their body weights increased during the observation period indicating that the plant extract did not produce any adverse effect on the body weight of rats in terms of acute oral toxicity. Similar observations were reported by Karunarathne et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] when they administered 2000 mg/kg body weight of crude 
 <italic>Alpinia galanga n</italic>-hexane extract on rats, which is a plant extract of the same genus having 1'ACA as the major chemical compound. Furthermore, no change of organs was observed in the treated rat with the exception being the liver of rats treated with 2000 mg/kg bw day of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> crude extract. Assessment of liver and kidney function is a very vital index in evaluating the toxicity of the plant extracts. The serum urea, creatinine, and liver enzyme (ALT, AST, and ALP) concentrations of the blood were the indices used to evaluate the function of kidney [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results in respect of BUN, creatinine, ALT, and AST after 14 days of oral administration were not significantly different from the control group and revealed that there was no abnormality of the kidney for all the treated rats. Hematopoietic system is one of the most susceptible targets of toxic compounds, especially the bone marrow where the production of red blood cell occurs [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Acute administration of the plant extract did not cause any significant changes in the hematological profile of rats which received the 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract at different doses, suggesting that the plant extract does not affect the hematopoietic system. The treatment did not bring about any serious histopathological change in the liver, kidney, heart, and spleen. Therefore, it is to be inferred that the plant extract, at least up to 2000 mg/kg, is not toxic in respect to acute oral administration. However, before a final decision, subacute and chronic toxicity testing of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> will be highly relevant.
