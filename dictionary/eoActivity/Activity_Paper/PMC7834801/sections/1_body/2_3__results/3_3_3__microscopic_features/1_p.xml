<p>Hoechst 33528 staining was adopted to find the morphological changes in the nucleus as caused by treatment of IC
 <sub>50</sub> and no toxicity concentrations of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>, and the features are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>. Data collected from manual counting of cells with normal and abnormal nuclear features are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>. In the control cells, the nuclear chromatin was full while after treatment with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extract, changes such as chromatin marginalization, condensation, and fragmentation were noticed. These observations revealed that exposure of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> to IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration alone led to chromatin fragmentation which is a characteristic feature of apoptosis. However, treatment with no toxicity concentration (IC
 <sub>0</sub>) of the extract indicated no difference with the control.
