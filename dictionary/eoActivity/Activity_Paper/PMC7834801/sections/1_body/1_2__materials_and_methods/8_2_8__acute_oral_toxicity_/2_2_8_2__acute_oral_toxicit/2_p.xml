<p>After administration of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract, rats were observed for first 30 min, and first 24 h with special attention during first 4 h, and thereafter daily for 14 days. The rats were weighed and observed for signs of toxicity including mortality, changes in behavioral pattern (salivation, lethargy, and sleep), physical appearance, injury, pain, and signs of illness during the observation period. In addition, the body weight, feed intake, and water consumption were recorded throughout the experimental period. Animals were mildly sedated using gaseous anesthesia, and 1 mL of blood was collected by the lateral tail vein puncture technique for biochemical and hematological analysis. The serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured with commercially available estimation kits (Pointe Scientific, Colombo) using a semiautomated biomedical analyzer (Stat Fax 3300, Ramsey, MN, USA). At the end of the experiment, the rats were humanely euthanized by overdosing gaseous anesthesia, and the liver, kidney, lung, heart, and spleen were collected. The relative organ weights of rats were recorded and also examined macroscopically. The organs were preserved in a fixation medium of 10% solution of formalin for histopathological study.
