<p>Fresh 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> rhizomes were washed in running water, and the outer skin was peeled off. The rhizome was sliced and oven-dried at 40°C for 24 h. The dried slices were pulverized using a grinder (National Super Blender, Taiwan, Model MX-TIIOPN) for 1 minute at 30 seconds interval in each cycle for five times. The powder was stored at −20°C until use. 
 <italic>n</italic>-Hexane was used as the solvent for the extraction. The extract was prepared by adding 10 g of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> powder to 100 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and agitated (160 rpm) for 24 h at 30°C in a rotary shaker (Stuart® orbital shaker SSL1, UK). The mixture was centrifuged at 4500 ×g for 10 min (Centurion Scientific Ltd, UK), and the supernatant was filtered using #1 Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum at 40°C using a rotary evaporator (KIA RV 5, Switzerland) and filter-sterilized through a 0.45 
 <italic>µ</italic>m filter unit (Millex® HA, Germany). The filtrate was N
 <sub>2</sub>-fluxed under heat (40°C) for 3 h until a hexane-free extract was obtained. Finally, the concentrated extract was stored at 4°C until use.
