<p>The morphological characteristics of cells in respect of apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by AO/EB staining [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cells were cultured in 6 well plates and incubated for 24 h with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and no toxicity concentrations of the extract, as found in the MTT assay. The treated and untreated cells were centrifuged (3000 rpm for 4 min) and incubated with acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EB) solutions (1 part of 100 mg/mL each of AO and EB in PBS) and observed in a fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a UV filter (450–490 nm). Three hundred cells per sample were counted, in duplicate, and scored as viable or dead, and if dead whether by apoptosis or necrosis as judged from nuclear morphology and cytoplasmic organization. Then, the percentages of apoptotic and necrotic cells were calculated. The morphological features of interest were photographed.
