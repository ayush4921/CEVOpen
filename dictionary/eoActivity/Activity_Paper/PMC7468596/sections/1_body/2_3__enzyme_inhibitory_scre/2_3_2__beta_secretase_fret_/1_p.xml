<p>The crude extracts and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) were assessed for 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretase inhibitory potential as per standard procedure [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 82.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L buffer contains 50 mM sodium acetate buffer with pH 4.5 was mixed to each inhibitor, in all wells, and after that, 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L from 20 U/100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L solution of the enzyme (0.5 U) should be combined. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 minutes at 25°C. Then, the reaction will be starting by combing 62.5 nM from 12500 nM/1 mL solutions of a substrate; the incubation should be again obtained for 60 minutes at 37°C in the dark condition. After incubation of a 96-well black plate, 1000 nM from 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M/1 mL stock solution of extract/fractions and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) were combined; then, the incubation time of the plate should be read by the fluorometer machine (CHAMELEON-HIDEX) as per reported standard procedure [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] . Emissions, as well as excitation for Mca, are 325 and 400 nm, respectively.
