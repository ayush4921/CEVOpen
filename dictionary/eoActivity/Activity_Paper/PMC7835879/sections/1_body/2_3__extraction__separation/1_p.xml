<p>Phloridzin is solid at room temperature and poorly soluble in ether and cold water but soluble in ethanol and hot water, the melting point of phloridzin is 110 °C and it decomposes above 200 °C. Phloridzin’s extraction method is similar to that of other phenolic substances. Alberti et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported that response surface methodology is an adequate approach for phloridzin extraction from apples, and phloridzin had higher yields (48.4%) in extractions with methanol. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found that an ultrasound-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction strategy had significant advantages, including lower ethanol consumption, lower impurity of sugar and protein and higher extraction efficiency of phloridzin than the traditional solvent extraction with 35% and 80% ethanol. Paudel et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that phloridzin of black raspberry (
 <italic>Rubus occidentalis</italic> L.) fruits was extracted in ethyl acetate, isolated by semipreparative analytical HPLC and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), HPLC–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and ESI-MS/MS techniques.
