<p>Other studies suggest that phloridzin holds potential for food additives, cosmetics, beverages and food preservatives. Phloridzin is also a prospective biomarker for the consumption of phloridzin-containing foods. Phloridzin contributes to the characteristic taste of ciders, when its concentration is within the range of 3â€“16 g/L, while natural dimerized phloridzin plays important roles in the color formation of apple juices and ciders [

Therefore, there is a necessity for more studies to elucidate the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics related to phloridzin and its metabolites in food applications. Moreover, how to apply drug packaging to phloridzin to improve its bioavailability should be paid more attention.
