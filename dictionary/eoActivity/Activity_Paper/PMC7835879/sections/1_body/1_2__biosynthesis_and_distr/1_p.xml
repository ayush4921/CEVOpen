<p>The biosynthesis of phloridzin is different from general flavonoids, and its precursors are malonyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA. First, p-coumaroyl-CoA generates 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamoyl-CoA via the NADPH pathway, then malonyl-CoA and 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamoyl-CoA produce phloretin under the action of chalcone synthase, and the attachment of a glucose moiety to phloretin at position 2â€² is the final step in the formation of phloridzin [
