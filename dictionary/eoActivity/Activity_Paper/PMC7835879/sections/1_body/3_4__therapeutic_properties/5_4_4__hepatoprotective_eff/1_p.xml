<p>Many reports suggested that phloridzin has a hepatoprotective function by regulating lipid metabolism and oxidative stress and inhibiting hepatic inflammation and apoptosis. Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] found that phloridzin decreased body weight gain and the levels of glucose, blood total cholesterol (TC) and blood triglycerides (TG) in blood and, accordingly, ameliorated the hepatic damage of type 2 diabetic mice. Shin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] reported that phloridzin also alleviated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis by decreasing white adipose tissue and collagen accumulation. Khalifa et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] elucidated the protective effects of phloridzin against methotrexate-induced hepatic injury in rats by the mitigation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in hepatic tissues. Parathodi Illam et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] reported that a combination of aqueous extracts of fruits (containing phloridzin) improved hepatic and renal glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and glutathione (GSH) levels in normal Swiss albino mice. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] demonstrated that apple phloridzin increased cell viability, relieved deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis in H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced HepG2 cells by the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and anti-apoptosis genes. David-Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] found that phloridzin restored glycemic control and hepatic glucose metabolism, inhibited hepatic glucose production and ameliorated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic mice.
