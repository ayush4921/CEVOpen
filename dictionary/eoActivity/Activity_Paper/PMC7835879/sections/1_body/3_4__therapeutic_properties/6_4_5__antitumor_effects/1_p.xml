<p>Phloridzin was utilized to trigger cancer cell death through either direct or indirect pathways. Qin et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] showed that phloridzin from crabapple leaves had antitumor effects and, moreover, its derivatives had a stronger protective effect against the four tested tumor cell lines, which suggested that phloridzin and its derivatives could be considered as possible therapeutic agents against cancer. Aguiniga-Sanchez et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that a fruit methanol extract of 
 <italic>Sechium edule</italic> var. 
 <italic>nigrum spinosum</italic> contained phloridzin, and the extract eliminated tumor cells while protecting normal bone marrow cells.
