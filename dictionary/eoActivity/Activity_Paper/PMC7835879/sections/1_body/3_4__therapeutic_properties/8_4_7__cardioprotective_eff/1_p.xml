<p>Phloridzin was efficient in protecting the heart in certain diseases. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that extracts of 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> seed coat contained a large amount of phloridzin, and the extracts attenuated the adhesion of THP-1 to LPS-stimulated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, which suggested that phloridzin was a potential coronary heart disease preventive agent. Cai et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] identified differentially expressed proteins involved in cardiac lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and cardiomyopathy by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics, which implied that phloridzin may prevent the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy by regulating the expression of key proteins in these processes. Hirose et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] indicated that phloridzin prevented ischemia-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia through the improvement of impulse conduction slowing during ischemia in Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts.
