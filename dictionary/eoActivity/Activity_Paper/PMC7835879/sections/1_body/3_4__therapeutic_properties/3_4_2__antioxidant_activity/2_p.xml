<p>In addition to free radical-scavenging properties, phloridzin has been identified as a potent antioxidant in the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Rupasinghe and Yasmin [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] reported that phloridzin had a significant effect in preventing peroxyl radical-induced oxidation by polyunsaturated fatty acid in aqueous emulsions. Thilakarathna et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] found that phloridzin extracted from apple peel effectively inhibited human low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxidation in vitro. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] demonstrated that apple phloridzin extended the life span, improved the viability, alleviated the mortality rate induced by paraquat and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes in fruit flies. Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] found that phloridzin was the main component of E Se tea extracts, which significantly prevented oxidative stress damage and reduced the apoptosis of H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced HepG2 cells.
