<p>Phloridzin had been reported to have a variety of other biological activities. Andlauer et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] found that the natural substance phloridzin (present in apples) improved genistin absorption in isolated rat small intestine. Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] demonstrated that phloridzin acted through the cAMP pathway to increase tyrosinase transcriptional activities, thereby leading to the stimulation of melanogenesis. Gatidis et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] revealed that a novel effect of phloridzin was the blunting of eryptosis, following energy depletion and oxidative stress. Xiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] presented evidence that phloridzin had antiaging effects on yeast by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and SIRT1. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] reported that phloridzin inhibited polycystic kidney disease progression by the MAPK signaling pathway in a rat model. Pei et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] revealed that phloridzin may be a renal protective agent by regulating differentially expressed proteins, which not only affected glomerular dysfunction and tubular transport, but also played active roles in oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] demonstrated that phloridzin increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, and improved triglyceride metabolism via the adenosine 5‘-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in stress-loaded mice. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] found that extracts from the fruits of 
 <italic>Malus baccata</italic> contained phloridzin, and the extracts had radioprotective and immunomodulatory activities. Kanda et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] found that phloridzin strongly decreased high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contraction in phasic muscle (tenia coli), but slightly affected tonic muscle (trachea) because of the inhibition of energy metabolism via SGLT1. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] found that phloridzin increased NO output, suppressed SGLT1 and SGLT2 expression, and promoted the consumption of glucose, which ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway in palmitic acid-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] reported that phloridzin abrogated the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor γ (PPARγ) at the ser273 site by strongly inhibiting Cdk5 activation, which increased insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] found that phloridzin treatment resulted in the enhancement of erectile function, which was similar to that seen with insulin therapy, but phloridzin did not show anabolic effects, such as weight gain, in diabetic rats.
