<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of phloridzin has been investigated in some laboratory-based studies (
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00962-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Shin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] found that phloridzin suppressed plasma pro-inflammatory adipokine levels and, furthermore, attenuated inflammation in diet-induced obese mice. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported that phloridzin metabolites decreased nitric oxide (NO) production and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which showed anti-inflammatory activity. Zielinska et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] demonstrated that apple phloridzin improved the quality of anti-inflammatory response in the intestine and, accordingly, ameliorated cytokine-driven inflammation. Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] reported that the metabolite of phloridzin suppressed the inflammatory response in RAW264.7 murine macrophages that had been stimulated by LPS from Gram-negative bacteria. Zhai et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] showed that phloridzin decreased the expression of ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced acute inflammation infiltration in UVB-exposed skin. Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] showed that phloridzin significantly reduced the concentration of serum and adipose tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated adipose tissue inflammation in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.
