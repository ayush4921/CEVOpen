<p>In 1835, a French scientist first isolated phloridzin from the bark of apple trees [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some studies revealed that phloridzin was a competitive inhibitor of sodium–glucose cotransporters SGLT1 and SGLT2, because it could bind with the carrier that competed with 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose and, consequently, this reduced renal glucose transport, increased urinary glucose excretion and ameliorated plasma glucose concentration [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For decades, an enormous number of studies have been carried out on the pharmacological activities and physiological effects of phloridzin and its derivatives. This review aims to exhaustively sum up phloridzin’s biosynthesis, distribution, extraction and physiological and pharmacological effects.
