 <p>Phloridzin is an important phytochemical which was first isolated from the bark of apple trees. It is a member of the dihydrochalcones and mainly distributed in the plants of the 
  <italic>Malus</italic> genus, therefore, the extraction method of phloridzin was similar to those of other phenolic substances. High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC), resin adsorption technology and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to separate and purify phloridzin. Many studies showed that phloridzin had multiple pharmacological effects, such as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, anticancer and antibacterial activities. Besides, the physiological activities of phloridzin are cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antiobesity, antioxidant and so on. The present review summarizes the biosynthesis, distribution, extraction and bioavailability of the natural compound phloridzin and discusses its applications in food and medicine.
