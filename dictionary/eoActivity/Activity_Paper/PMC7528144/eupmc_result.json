    "Microbial resistance to the few conventional antitrypanosomal drugs, increasing resistance of vectors to insecticides, lack of effective vaccines, and adverse effects of the existing antitrypanosomal drugs justify the urgent need for effective, tolerable, and affordable drugs. We assessed antitrypanosomal effects of the hydromethanolic extract of <i>Echinops kebericho</i> Mesfin roots against <i>Trypanosoma congolense</i> field isolate using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> techniques. Parasite load, packed cell volume (PCV), body weight, and rectal temperature in Swiss albino mice were assessed. This finding is part of the outcomes of drug discovery research for neglected tropical diseases. The extract arrested the motility of trypanosomes within 40 min at 4 and 2 mg/mL concentration, whereas in the untreated control, motility continued for more than 160 min. The extract also reduced parasitemia and prevented drop in PCV and body weight significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05), as compared to control. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids, saponins, glycosides, tannins, and alkaloids. It is observed that this extract has activity against the parasite. Isolation and purification of specific compounds are required to identify hit compounds responsible for the antitrypanosomal activity of the studied medicinal plant."
