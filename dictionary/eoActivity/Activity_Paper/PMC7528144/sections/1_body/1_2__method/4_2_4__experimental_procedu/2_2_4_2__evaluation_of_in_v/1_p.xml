<p>Thirty mice of either sex were randomly grouped into five (I–V) groups containing 6 animals per group. They were intraperitoneally infected with 0.2 mL of 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> parasites/mL) suspension. Groups I and II were administered only 0.3 mL of distilled water per oral administration to serve as negative control and 3.35 mg/kg of DA in distilled water per oral administration to serve as positive control, while groups III, IV, and V were administered with the extract dissolved in distilled water (the solvent for control group) at daily doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight, respectively, for 7 consecutive days per oral administration from the 10
 <sup>th</sup> day of parasite inoculation. Parasitemia and packed cell volume (PCV) were observed every 4 days for 21 days, while body weight and rectal temperature was monitored every 2 days [
