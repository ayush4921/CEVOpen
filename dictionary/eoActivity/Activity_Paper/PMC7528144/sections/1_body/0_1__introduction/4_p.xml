 <italic>Echinops kebericho</italic> root is used for the treatment of animal trypanosomiasis in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there is no laboratory-based evidence for the effectiveness and safety of this plant. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antitrypanosomal effects of the hydromethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> roots using field isolate of 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic>, which is the most important cause of domestic animal trypanosomiasis. Experimental mice infection model has been selected given the provision of this model new insight in both human and animal trypanosomiasis [
