<p>In the present study, antitrypanosomal activities of the 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> roots suggested that the extract could contain trypanocidal constituents that are active in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> environments. Parasites' motility constitutes a relatively reliable indicator of viability of most trypanosomes [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and a complete elimination or reduction in the motility of trypanosomes when compared to the control could be taken as index of trypanocidal activity [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
