<p>Piperine (
 <bold>107</bold>) is a major alkaloid present in black pepper (
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic>), which is known to possess pharmacological benefits, such as antimicrobial, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B173-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. The expression of HO-1 by piperine (
 <bold>107</bold>) is mediated by both JNK pathway and Nrf2, and the expression inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B297-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. Sinomenine (
 <bold>108</bold>), an alkaloid isolated from an oriental medicinal herb 
 <italic>Sinomenium acutum,</italic> which has been used to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatism and arthritis [
 <xref rid="B298-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Sinomenine (
 <bold>108</bold>) pretreatment was able to induce HO-1 expression in donor livers in a dose dependent manner and it protected the liver graft from cold ischemia/reperfusion injury [

 <xref rid="B300-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>]. Higenamine (
 <bold>109</bold>) promotes M2 macrophage activation and reduces Hmgb1 expression dependent on HO-1 induction and then promotes locomotor function after spinal cord injury [
 <xref rid="B301-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>]. Camptothecin (

 <italic>Camptotheca acuminate</italic> [
 <xref rid="B302-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>] as a strong inhibitor of the DNA-replicating enzyme topoisomerase I [

 <xref rid="B307-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. Berberine (
 <bold>111</bold>) can protect against methotrexate-induced liver injury from oxidative stress and apoptosis, possibly through upregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and PPARγ [
 <xref rid="B308-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>]. Capsaicin (
 <bold>112</bold>) is a unique alkaloid that provides spicy flavor of the fruit of the genus 
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> (peppers) [
 <xref rid="B309-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. Joung et al. found that capsaicin (
 <bold>112</bold>) induced expression of HO-1 that resulted in a transient increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and subsequently nuclear translocation of Nrf2, enhancing its binding to ARE [
 <xref rid="B310-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>]. Kim et al. suggested the anti-inflammatory activity of capsaicin (
 <bold>112</bold>) and another derivative, dihydrocapsaicin (
 <bold>113</bold>) is exerted through NO production and iNOS expression and induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B311-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>]. Matrine (
 <bold>114</bold>) is a quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from

 <xref rid="B314-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>]. Matrine (
 <bold>114</bold>) may alleviate early brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats possibly via PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB inhibition and Keap1/Nrf2-dependent HO-1 induction [
 <xref rid="B315-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>]. Cordycepin, a bioactive adenosine derivative, which was found in

 <xref rid="B316-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>]. Cordycepin exhibited protective effects on 
 <italic>N</italic>-nitrosodiethylamine-induced hepatocellular carcinomas via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Nrf2/HO-1/NF-κB pathway in mice [
 <xref rid="B317-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. Chabamide (

 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> (black pepper) [
 <xref rid="B319-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. Among the alkaloids, chabamide (

 <xref rid="B319-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. Piperlongumine (
 <bold>116</bold>), an alkaloid from

 <xref rid="B320-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. Lu et al. reported that HO-1 induction of piperlongumine (
 <bold>116</bold>) may also result in the inhibitory effect on Zika virus replication [
 <xref rid="B321-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. Six isosteroid alkaloids isolated from 
 <italic>Fritillaria cirrhosa</italic> bulbus, a Chinese folk herb with antitussive, expectorant, antiasthma and anti-inflammatory properties demonstrated to protect murine RAW264.7 macrophages against cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B322-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>]. They were cevanine or jervine type alkaloids and decreased the generation of ROS and increased the level of GSH via Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression via activating Nrf2 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B322-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>]. Peiminine (

 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B323-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">323</xref>]. Luo et al. reported peiminine (
 <bold>117</bold>) ameliorates murine osteroarthritis anti-inflammatory activity induced by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, the nuclear transfer of NF-κB and activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B324-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">324</xref>]. Structures of the alkaloids and nitrogen-containing natural products (
