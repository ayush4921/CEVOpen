 <italic>L</italic>-Glutamine (
 <bold>104</bold>) reduced colonic damage in colitis by the mechanism of the protection associated with HO-1 induction effects, which were documented by the decrease in NF-κB expression, MDA, and caspase-3 levels and concurrent increase in GSH levels and HO-1 overexpression in the colonic tissue [

 <bold>105</bold>) is a neurohormone derived from an amino acid tryptophan and released by the pineal gland to regulate the circadian rhythm [
 <xref rid="B288-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. In vertebrates, melatonin (
 <bold>105</bold>) is produced in darkness, by the pineal gland [
 <xref rid="B289-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>], but it is also ingested from plant foodstuff such as bananas, grapes, rice, herbs, plums and olive [
 <xref rid="B290-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>]. Beside the circadian regulation, melatonin (
 <bold>105</bold>) can prevent damages of cells from oxidative stress, especially involved with neurodegeneration in aging and Alzheimer’s disease [

 <xref rid="B292-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>]. Clapp-Lilly et al. suggested that melatonin (
 <bold>105</bold>) induced redox active iron and HO-1 immunoreactivity that it may be a potential therapeutic agent in the prevention of oxidative stress associated with Aβ and Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B293-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>]. The HO-1 induction by melatonin (
 <bold>105</bold>) also potentiates the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol against oxidative injury [
 <xref rid="B294-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>], and inhibits type 1 interferon signaling of TLR4 in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion [

 <xref rid="B296-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">296</xref>]. An unique amino acid derivative present in raw garlic, 
 <italic>S</italic>-allylcysteine (
 <bold>106</bold>) provided potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and mucosa protective effects against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced damages via induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B296-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">296</xref>]. Structures of the amino acid derivatives (
