<p>Another bioactive 
 <italic>O</italic>-methylated flavone isolated from the heartwood of 
 <italic>Dalbergia odorifera</italic>, 6,4′-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone (
 <bold>13</bold>) was also proposed as an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory HO-1 inducer in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells and BV2 microglia cells [
 <xref rid="B126-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Ampelopsin (
 <bold>14</bold>), a flavonoid abundant in Rattan tea (
 <italic>Ampelopsis grossedentata</italic>), was investigated as a potent antioxidant and neuroprotective agent against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells via upregulation of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B127-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Naringenin (
 <bold>15</bold>), a flavonone present in various species of citrus fruit, tomatoes and grapes, has anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic properties [
 <xref rid="B128-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Dihydrofisetin (
 <bold>16</bold>) is a flavanonol, dose-dependently inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced productions of NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in RAW 264.7 macrophage [
 <xref rid="B129-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In addition, dihydrofisetin (
 <bold>16</bold>) inhibited the activation of MAPK pathway and phosphorylation of IκB-α whereas it upregulated the expression of HO-1 [

 <bold>17</bold>) and leachianone A (
 <bold>18</bold>) are anti-inflammatory components found in an oriental medicinal herb 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>, and the compounds belong to a unique and rare class of prenylated flavonoid [
 <xref rid="B130-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. The induction of HO-1 by the prenylated flavonoids was identified as the key mechanism of the protective effect against glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells [
 <xref rid="B131-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Sophoraflavanone G (
 <bold>17</bold>) was also isolated from another allied species, 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic>, and the prenylated flavonoid showed potential to treat some inflammatory diseases by targeting PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways [
