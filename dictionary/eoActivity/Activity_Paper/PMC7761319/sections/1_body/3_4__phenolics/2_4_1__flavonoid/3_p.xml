<p>Catechins are flavan-3-ol compounds contained in tea as the most abundant phenolic chemical species that exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B133-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Among the flavonoids classified as catechins in tea, the major green tea catechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (
 <bold>19</bold>, EGCG) has been intensively investigated as it was discovered a HO-1 expression inducing agent that helps protect the neuron against oxidative stress-induced cell death [
 <xref rid="B134-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], possibly block the pathogenic cycle of Sjögren’s syndrome [
 <xref rid="B135-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], inhibit inflammatory responses by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines during the adipocyte–macrophage interaction [
 <xref rid="B136-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], protect against contrast-induced nephropathy by amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B137-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] and mediate beneficial cardiovascular actions via anti-inflammatory actions in vascular endothelium [
 <xref rid="B138-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Chalcones are one of the major classes of natural products with widespread distribution in plant foodstuff with interesting pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B139-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Chemically they are characterized of open-chain flavonoids in which the two aromatic rings are joined by a three-carbon α, β-unsaturated carbonyl system [
 <xref rid="B140-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Compared to the relevance in nature, chalcones have been identified as a considerably large group of natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents found in foodstuff or medicinal herbs. Lee et al. reported H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced cell death and ROS generation could be inhibited by HO-1 expression induction of butein (
 <bold>20</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B141-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Based on the role of HO-1 in the development of obesity and insulin resistance, Wang et al. proved that butein (
 <bold>20</bold>) activates the p38 MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to act as a potent inhibitor of adipose hypertrophy and inflammation in a diet-induced obesity mouse model [
 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. 3-Deoxysappanchalcone (
 <bold>21</bold>, also known as isoliquiritigenin 2′-methyl ether) is a major bioactive component isolated from 
 <italic>Caesalpinia sappan</italic>, commonly used herbal medicine for inflammation and to improve blood circulation [
 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>,
 <xref rid="B144-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. The molecular mechanism by which 3-deoxysappanchalcone (
 <bold>21</bold>) exerts anti-inflammatory activity was identified as induction of HO-1 expression at the translational level via activating the AKT/mTOR pathway [
 <xref rid="B145-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. 3-Deoxysappanchalcone (
 <bold>21</bold>) also exhibited antioral cancer effects by HO-1 upregulation via a pathway involving MAP kinases, NF-κB and Nrf2 [
 <xref rid="B146-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity by 4,2′,5′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxychalcone (
 <bold>22</bold>) from 
 <italic>Dalbergia odorifera</italic> was revealed as inducing the expression of anti-inflammatory HO-1 via the Nrf2 pathway to inhibit proinflammatory mediators such as COX-2 and iNOS [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Kil et al. suggested anti-inflammatory action of okanin (
 <bold>23</bold>) by virtue of its α-β unsaturated carbonyl functional group, reporting that the underlying mechanism is inhibition of NO production and iNOS expression via Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Cardamonin (
 <bold>24</bold>), a chalcone isolated from 
 <italic>Alpinia katsumadai</italic>, has been investigated to prove anti-inflammatory mechanisms of cardamonin (
 <bold>24</bold>) is related to the decrease in the level of MDA, iNOS, COX-2, NF-κB and MAPK and induction of the HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B149-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Structures of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (
 <bold>19</bold>) and the chalcones (
