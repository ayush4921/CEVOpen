<p>Coumarins are a group of phenolic natural products composed of fused benzene and α-pyrone rings biosynthesized from cinnamic acid via ortho-hydroxylation, trans-cis isomerization of the side-chain double bond and lactonization [
 <xref rid="B195-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. 
 <italic>Peucedanum japonicum</italic> has been used as a folk medicine in East Asia, and the antioxidant and antityrosinase active compounds were found in the leaf extract [
 <xref rid="B196-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. A coumarin derivative, pteryxin (
 <bold>44</bold>) isolated in 
 <italic>P. japonicum</italic> was identified as HO-1 inducing agent through Nrf2-ARE signaling [
 <xref rid="B198-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Another coumarin derivative, corymbocoumarin (
 <bold>45</bold>) from 
 <italic>Seseli gummiferum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>corymbosum</italic> was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect through suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway and induction of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B95-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>) is a polyphenolic stilbene that is frequently found in grapes and other food products, especially well-known as principal active component of red wine and grape peel [

 <xref rid="B200-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. The ability of resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>) to attenuate proinflammatory cytokine expression was investigated [
 <xref rid="B201-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>], and then potential of resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>) to induce HO-1 expression to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action was suggested [
 <xref rid="B202-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>) increased the level of nuclear Nrf2/ARE reporter activity to induce HO-1 expression, which exerts a preventive effect on vascular occlusive diseases [

 <xref rid="B203-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>], potential neuroprotective action [

 <xref rid="B205-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>] and protective effect on cardiomyocyte apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B206-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Piceatannol (
 <bold>47</bold>), structurally almost identical to resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>), with the exception of an additional hydroxyl group at the 3′-carbon is also a phytochemical inducer of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B207-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Brassicaphenanthrene A (
 <bold>48</bold>) isolated from common 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> (turnip) apparently does not look related with resveratrol, but brassicaphenanthrene A (
 <bold>48</bold>) and resveratrol (
 <bold>46</bold>) both belong to stilbenoid. Brassicaphenanthrene A (
 <bold>48</bold>) was also identified as a phytochemical inducer of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B208-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Structures of the phenolic natural products (
 <bold>44</bold>–
 <bold>48</bold>) are presented in
