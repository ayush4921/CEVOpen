<p>Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (
 <bold>32</bold>, CAPE) is a hydrophobic natural phenolic compounds with a variety of bioactivities found in a wide range of plants and honeybee propolis [

 <xref rid="B178-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) is one of the first few natural products identified as an inducer of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B179-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>], and a number of follow-up studies on CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) involving HO-1 induction and the health promoting-potential have been published. Wang et al. proposed the cytoprotective potential of CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) against menadione-induced oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) via upregulation of HO-1 by CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B180-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Interestingly, caffeic acid, a potential metabolite of CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) with similar free radical scavenging ability, however, did not show any cytoprotective effect nor induce HO-1 in the study [
 <xref rid="B180-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Morroni et al. suggested that CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) could potentially be considered as a promising neuroprotective agent against progressive neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating administration of CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) counteracted oxidative stress accompanied by an induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B181-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Kurauchi et al. also investigated the neuroprotective potential of CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) in vivo, examining the expression of HO-1 and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor [
 <xref rid="B182-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. High-level glucose-mediated oxidative stress could be attenuated by HO-1 induction by CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>), and it may be useful in diabetes and other stress-induced pathological conditions [
 <xref rid="B183-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) is putatively biosynthesized from caffeic acid and phenethyl alcohol, and it is not difficult to perform studies on chemical synthesis of derivatives and structure–activity relationship (SAR). Thus, SAR studies for enhancement of HO-1 induction using synthetic derivatives of CAPE (
 <bold>32</bold>) were reported as well [
 <xref rid="B183-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>,

 <xref rid="B185-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. A caffeic acid derivatives, caffeoylglycolic acid methyl ester (
 <bold>33</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] contained in grains of 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> and 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoyl-1-methylquinic acid (
 <bold>34</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B186-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>] from bamboo leaves exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inducing HO-1 expression. Another type of caffeic acid ester derivative found in rosemary and other foodstuff, rosmarinic acid (
 <bold>35</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B187-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>] and a derivative isolated from 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens,</italic> rosmarinic acid methyl ester (
 <bold>36</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B188-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] also exert their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action via induction of HO-1 expression. Salvianolic acid B (
 <bold>37</bold>) is a polyphenolic compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> (Danshen), a traditional oriental medicinal herb, which improves vascular function by inhibiting inflammatory responses and promoting endothelium-dependent vasodilation via induction of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B189-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (
 <bold>38</bold>) is another phenylpropanoid natural product found in 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia,</italic> which has been used as a spice and medicinal herb for inflammatory disorders. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (
 <bold>38</bold>) possibly protects from myocardial I/R-injury due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action by HO-1 induction [
 <xref rid="B190-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Hydroxytyrosol (
 <bold>39</bold>) is commonly found in olive oil and leaves with even stronger antioxidant potential than other natural phenolics but gallic acid [
 <xref rid="B191-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The cytoprotective action against oxidative injury promotion and wound healing in vascular endothelial cells by hydroxytyrosol (
 <bold>39</bold>) could be explained with Nrf2 activation and HO-1 induction [

 <bold>41</bold>), echinacoside (
 <bold>42</bold>) and campneoside I (
 <bold>43</bold>) also reported as HO-1 inducing agents [
