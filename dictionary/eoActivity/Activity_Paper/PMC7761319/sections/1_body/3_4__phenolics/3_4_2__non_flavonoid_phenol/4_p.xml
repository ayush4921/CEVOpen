<p>Aloin (
 <bold>49</bold>) is the major anthraquinone glycoside obtained from the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities via HO-1 induction and reduced NF-κB-luciferase activity [

 <italic>Antrodia camphorate</italic> a mushroom used for pharmaceutical purpose, 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole (
 <bold>50</bold>) has potential anti-inflammatory activity via increased HO-1 expression that attenuated the LPS-induced proinflammatory factors and iNOS and TLR4 protein levels [
 <xref rid="B210-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Another type of hydrophobic phenolic derivatives, 4-methoxydalbergione (
 <bold>51</bold>) and 4′-hydroxy-4-methoxydalbergione (
 <bold>52</bold>) from 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> exhibited HO-1 induction to exert anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B211-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Punicalagin (
 <bold>53</bold>), an ellagitannin polyphenol found in 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> (pomegranates) with antioxidant activity had protective effects on H9c2 cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced toxicity [
 <xref rid="B212-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>] and human retinal pigment epithelium cells from UV radiation-induced oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B213-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>] through activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Another gallic acid derivative from 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic>, 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (
 <bold>54</bold>) is the pentagallic acid ester of glucose that also induces the expression of HO-1 in the PC12 cells and its regulation in the PC12 cells [

 <bold>55</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Mallotus philippinensis</italic>, was originally reported to inhibit PKC δ [
 <xref rid="B215-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>], but it seems to induce upregulation of HO-1 via PKC δ-independent pathway [
 <xref rid="B216-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. The bioactive polyphenols in agrimony, agrimonolide (
 <bold>56</bold>) and desmethylagrimonolide (
 <bold>57</bold>) induce HO-1 expression, which can be regulated partially by the blockade of p38 MAPK signaling pathway and inhibiting nuclear translocation of Nrf2 [
 <xref rid="B217-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Lucidone (
 <bold>58</bold>) from the fruits of 
 <italic>Lindera erythrocarpa</italic>, significantly induced HO-1 production and led to the increase of its production of biliverdin for inducing an antiviral interferon response and inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease activity [
 <xref rid="B218-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. A phlorotannin found in an edible alga 
 <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic>, eckol (
 <bold>59</bold>) attenuates oxidative stress by activating Nrf2-mediated HO-1 induction via extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) and PI3K/Akt signaling [
 <xref rid="B219-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. Malabaricone C (
 <bold>60</bold>) is known to exert a variety of pharmacological activities of nutmeg, and inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation and migration of aortic smooth muscle cells through induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B220-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin (
 <bold>61</bold>), the bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicine 
 <italic>Gastrodia elata</italic>, has been known to display antioxidant activity induce HO-1 expression to exert a cytoprotective role in the dopaminergic cell culture system [
