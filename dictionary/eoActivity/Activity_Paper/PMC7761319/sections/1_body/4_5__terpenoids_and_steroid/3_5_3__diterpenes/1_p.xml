<p>A diterpenoid isolated from the sap of 
 <italic>Podocarpus totara</italic>, totarol (
 <bold>73</bold>) is known for its potent antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B238-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. The neuroprotective activity of totarol (
 <bold>73</bold>) by increased Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation, Nrf2, HO-1 expressions was investigated in a model of acute cerebral ischemic injury in the rat [
 <xref rid="B239-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. Another phenolic diterpene, carnosol (
 <bold>74</bold>), could target 
 <italic>ho</italic>-1 to induce HO-1 expression, and increased the nuclear levels of Nrf2 [

 <xref rid="B241-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. The bioactive diterpene, palbinone (
 <bold>75</bold>) in 
 <italic>Paeonia suffruticosa,</italic> which has been traditionally employed for vitalizing blood circulation and alleviating liver and inflammatory diseases could induce HO-1 expression in the hepatic cells [
 <xref rid="B242-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Oridonin (
 <bold>76</bold>) is an 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene diterpene with an immunosuppressive effect isolated from 
 <italic>Isodon serra</italic> [
 <xref rid="B243-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. According to the study performed by Hu et al., oridonin (
 <bold>76</bold>) had a distinct effect on promoting CD4+/CD25+ Treg differentiation and modulating Th1/Th2 balance, and this effect may be achieved via inducing the anti-inflammatory target HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B244-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. Andrographolide (
 <bold>77</bold>) is a well-known diterpene, characterized of labdane diterpenoid with a five-membered unsaturated lactone moiety, isolated from an oriental medicinal herb 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B245-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Yu et al. suggested that stimulation of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression is involved in the suppression of TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression exerted by andrographolide (
 <bold>77</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B246-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. Another diterpenoid with a five-membered lactone isolated from 
 <italic>Euphorbia fischeriana,</italic> 17-hydroxy-jolkinolide B (
 <bold>78</bold>) could inhibit COX-2, iNOS in a concentration-dependent manner. These inhibitory effects were caused by suppression of MAPK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation and HO-1 induction [
 <xref rid="B247-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. Dihydroartemisinin (
 <bold>79</bold>) is isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> that has prominent immunomodulatory activity that regulates the Th/Treg balance by inducing activated CD4+ T cell apoptosis via HO-1 induction in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease [
 <xref rid="B248-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Rebaudioside A (
 <bold>80</bold>) is a commercially used natural sweetener from 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic>, which has been discovered as a potential candidate hepatoprotective agent that activate Nrf2/ARE, and the expression of HO-1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) [
 <xref rid="B249-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Structures of the diterpenes (
