<p>Desoxonarchinol A (
 <bold>64</bold>), isolated form 
 <italic>Nardostachys jatamansi</italic>, is an effective inducer of HO-1, which regulates neutrophil infiltration in acute pancreatitis via chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 inhibition [
 <xref rid="B226-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Kim et al. investigated the antineuroinflammatory effects via upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling by desoxonarchinol A (
 <bold>64</bold>) along with another derivative narchinol B (
 <bold>65</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B227-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. Zerumbone (
 <bold>66</bold>) is a monocyclic sesquiterpene and the major active phytochemical compound in 
 <italic>Zingiber zerumbet</italic> [
 <xref rid="B228-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] Zerumbone (
 <bold>66</bold>) is known to have antioxidant activity, anti-inflammation, immunomodulatory effect and anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Leung et al. suggested the protective mechanisms of zerumbone (
 <bold>66</bold>) on acute lung injury were exerted via upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling [
 <xref rid="B229-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Shin et al. reported topical application of zerumbone (
 <bold>66</bold>) onto dorsal skin of hairless mice induces activation of Nrf2/HO-1 expression that provides chemopreventive effects on mouse skin carcinogenesis [

 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> has been used as traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, and the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism is, at least, due to HO-1 induction, in which sesquiterpenes such as nootkatone (
 <bold>67</bold>) and valencene (
 <bold>68</bold>) play a crucial role [
 <xref rid="B231-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. Pulchellamin G (
 <bold>69</bold>) is an amino acid-sesquiterpene lactone conjugate isolated from 
 <italic>Saussurea pulchella</italic>, and the anti-inflammatory activity was associated with induction of HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B232-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Jeong et al. suggested the α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone moiety in dehydrocostus lactone (
 <bold>70</bold>) is crucial for cytoprotective HO-1 expression through activation of the Nrf2 [
 <xref rid="B233-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>], and Park et al. suggested that dehydrocostus lactone (
 <bold>70</bold>) might be useful for the treatment of sepsis through the mechanism [
 <xref rid="B234-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. Eupatolide (
 <bold>71</bold>), a sesquiterpene lactone from 
 <italic>Inula britannica</italic> could suppress platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through HO-1 induction via the ROS-Nrf2 pathway and may be a potential HO-1 inducer for preventing or treating vascular diseases [
 <xref rid="B235-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. Nardochinoid B (
 <bold>72</bold>) is a terpene composed of thirty carbons and a nitrogen, but not a triterpene. The putative biosynthetic pathway of nardochinoid B (
 <bold>72</bold>) is dimerization of nardosinane sesquiterpenes, and it exerts significant anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B236-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory action by nardochinoid B (
 <bold>72</bold>) was revealed as activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [
 <xref rid="B237-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Structures of the sesquiterpenes (
