<p>ERK, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, is involved in cellular processes including proliferation [

 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. ERK was reportedly involved in induction of HO-1 by extracellular signals or chemopreventive small molecules [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Chen and Maines utilized PD98059, a selective ERK pathway inhibitor, and showed that inhibition of ERK blocked HO-1 induction by a nitric oxide donor in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Wu et al. also revealed that pretreatment of PD98059 can prevent HO-1 induction by epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) [

 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Several studies using phytochemicals showed that the activation of the antioxidant regulator, Nrf2, is mediated through ERK phosphorylation [
