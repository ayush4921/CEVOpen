<p>The bioactive natural products with HO-1 induction that belong to lipids were small in number. Interestingly, they were all unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives. One of the omega-3 essential fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (
 <bold>91</bold>, EPA) protects against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells by activating Nrf2 and inducing HO-1 expression [

 <bold>92</bold>, DHA) also increased HO-1 expression in U937 cells via activation of ERK1/2 and increased Nrf-2 binding to ARE [
