<p>Hypertension, a long-term medical condition where the blood pressure in the artery is persistently elevated, is now considered as a chronic progressive disease that develops over many years [

In an animal study, transgenic mice that overexpress HO-1 in the lung showed reduced incidence of pulmonary hypertension and vessel wall hypertrophy induced by hypoxia [
