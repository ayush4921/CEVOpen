<p>Obesity, characterized by increased adipose tissue mass that results from both increased number and size of fat cells [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], is one of the major metabolic disorders worldwide [
 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Obesity is also a major risk factor in vascular dysfunction and insulin resistance that leads to hypertension and diabetes, respectively [

 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Decreased level of HO-1 was correlated with the inflammatory cytokine increase and insulin resistance [

 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In animal studies, the beneficial effect of HO-1 induction against adipocyte morphology was observed in the 
 <italic>ob/ob</italic> mouse model [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Zucker diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Administration of 3 mg/kg of cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), the HO-1 inducer that causes a sustained increase in the HO-1 protein level, prevented weight gain by decreasing visceral and subcutaneous fat content compared with the vehicle group [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Upregulation of HO-1 attenuated adipogenesis in bone marrow by increasing serum adiponectin, and decreasing plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β levels [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Upregulating the HO-system with hemin also reduced perirenal adiposity in the Zucker rat model by inhibiting several proinflammatory/oxidative mediators in perirenal fat including macrophage-inflammatory-protein-1α (MIP-1α), endothelin (ET-1), 8-isoprostane, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The increase of HO-1 in perirenal fat was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showing the involvement of the obesity regulator in vivo [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results indicate that the HO-1 level is negatively correlated with obesity-related symptoms and HO-1 induction ameliorates genetically induced obesity in vivo.
