 <p>Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes heme group degradation. Decreased level of HO-1 is correlated with disease progression, and HO-1 induction suppresses development of metabolic and neurological disorders. Natural compounds with antioxidant activities have emerged as a rich source of HO-1 inducers with marginal toxicity. Here we discuss the therapeutic role of HO-1 in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease and hepatic fibrosis, and present important signaling pathway components that lead to HO-1 expression. We provide an updated, comprehensive list of natural HO-1 inducers in foodstuff and medicinal herbs categorized by their chemical structures. Based on the continued research in HO-1 signaling pathways and rapid development of their natural inducers, HO-1 may serve as a preventive and therapeutic target for metabolic and neurological disorders.</p>
