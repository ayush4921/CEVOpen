 <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were incubated at different doses of plant extract (31.7, 62.5, and 125 μg/mL) and incubated for 48 h. Miltefosine at a dose of 3 μg/mL served as positive control, and parasites without treatment were considered as a negative control. Treated and untreated promastigotes were further centrifuged at 3000
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and washed three times in 1× PBS buffer. Further, the pellet was resuspended in 195 μL of 1× binding buffer (10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) containing 5 μL of annexin-FITC and 5 μL of propidium iodide for 25 min in the dark at room temperature in a dark room. After 25 min of incubation, the samples were analyzed through a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 550 nm.
