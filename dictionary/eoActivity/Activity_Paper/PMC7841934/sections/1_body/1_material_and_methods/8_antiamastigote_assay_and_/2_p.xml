<p>Treatment of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> differentiated macrophages with twofold serial dilution of extract was conducted for 24 h. Cells were incubated with 50 μM MTT for 3–4 h; thereafter, the resulting formazan was dissolved in 150 μM DMSO. The amount of formazan produced represented the relative number of viable cells and was recorded spectrophotometrically at 570 nm by an ELISA plate reader. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> value (50% cell cytotoxic concentration) was defined by the graphical extrapolation of the dose–response curve of % viability against the plant extraction concentration. For parasite load study, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> THP-1 cells were seeded on the coverslip, and after proper differentiation to macrophages using PMA, the adherent cells were infected with log-phase virulent promastigotes in a ratio of 1:10 (macrophage to 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>) for 24 h. The noninternalized parasites were washed, and the infected macrophages were further incubated with different concentrations of plant extract, for the next 24 h. The coverslips were washed, fixed with chilled methanol, and stained using a modified Giemsa stain for microscopic observation of amastigotes. About 100 macrophages were counted from different focus to determine the parasite burden.
