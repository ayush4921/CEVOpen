 <italic>L. donovani</italic> infective strain (MHOM/IN/83/AG83) was maintained in M199 media at pH 7.4 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic cocktail at a temperature of 22 °C. The log-phase parasite culture was passaged at regular intervals of 72–96 h with an inoculum density of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> parasites per mL. THP-1 human monocytic cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic in a humidified atmosphere in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C temperature. THP-1 monocytic cells were stimulated with 20 ng/mL of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for differentiation to macrophages.
