After collecting it from the field, selected plant materials were washed and air-dried in shade at room temperature. After the leaves were moisture-free, they were grounded separately in an electric grinder. The prepared powder form of plant materials (100 g) was soaked in 500 mL of methanol and placed on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 24 h. The extract was filtered using a Buchner funnel and Whatman filter paper and concentrated to dryness using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. The dried plant extract was stored at −20 °C until used for bioassay.
