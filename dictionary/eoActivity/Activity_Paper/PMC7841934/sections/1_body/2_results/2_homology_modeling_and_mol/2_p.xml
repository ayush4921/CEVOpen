<p>The

The best model among the hundred generated models was chosen based on the lowest score for the docking study. The energy minimization was carried out by the BIOVIA Discovery Studio. The three-dimensional cartoon representations of 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT,

 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH show stereochemical quality having 99.8, 100.0, and 99.0% residues in allowed regions and only 0.2, 0.0, and 1.0% residues in disallowed region of Ramachandran plot, respectively (

CASTp and Discovery Studio were used to find the key residues and region around the binding cavity of 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH. The active-site residues of the 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>PTR1 enzymes making different numbers of hydrogen bonds within 3.5 Å as well as hydrophobic bonds within 5 Å of the ligands were identified. Among all kinds of various interactions like amide−π interactions, π–π, H-bond, etc., the binding efficiency is being evaluated on the idea of hydrogen bonding.

 </sup> Virtual screening was performed against active-site residues of 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>PTR1 targets using PyRx. After the successful screening of the phytochemicals present in the methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic>, the top ligands with the lowest binding energy were selected. Based on binding energy and inhibitory constant, six complexes having the highest binding affinities were carefully chosen for further analysis (
