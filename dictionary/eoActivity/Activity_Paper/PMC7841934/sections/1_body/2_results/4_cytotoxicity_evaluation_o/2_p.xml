<p>To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf methanolic extract, THP-1 differentiated macrophages were incubated at twofold serial dilution (0–1000 μg/mL), and the viability was assessed by the MTT assay. 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> was found safe and least cytotoxic on human macrophages with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 626 ± 39 μg/mL, while the standard available control drug miltefosine has a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.133 ± 0.65 μg/mL (
