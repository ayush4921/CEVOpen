<p>After infection, 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasites internalize inside macrophages and transform into amastigotes form. These amastigotes are nonmotile and define the parasite pathogenicity. These amastigote phase parasites are in the clinically relevant form, so it is important to check the effect of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> extract on them. THP-1 differentiated macrophages were infected by 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes for 24 h and then treated with different doses of the extract. The extract showed a dose-dependent reduction in parasite burden with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 80.76 ± 3.626 μg/mL (

 </xref>C). Miltefosine was taken as a positive control. A significant reduction in the amastigote count was observed in the micrographs of infected but extract-treated macrophages (
