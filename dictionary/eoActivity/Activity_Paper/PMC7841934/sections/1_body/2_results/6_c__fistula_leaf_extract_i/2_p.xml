<p>Further, to evaluate whether 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic>-mediated antileishmanial activity was based on apoptosis induction in parasites, we performed the annexin V/PI apoptosis assay. Parasites were treated with different concentrations of methanolic leaf extract for 48 h and then stained and analyzed through a flow cytometer. At 62.5 μg/mL concentration of extract, 8.2% of parasites were found in the early apoptotic phase and 14.3% in the late apoptotic phase (

 </xref>). At 125 μg/mL treatment, there were 5.1% cells in the early apoptotic phase and 16.6% cells in the late apoptotic phase (

 </xref>). Plant extract induced apoptosis in parasites in a dose-dependent manner. It is also observed that shifting from early to late apoptotic was in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggested that 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> exerts antileishmanial activity partially through the induction of apoptosis in parasites.
