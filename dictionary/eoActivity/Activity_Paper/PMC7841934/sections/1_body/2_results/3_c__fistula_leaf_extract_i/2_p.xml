<p>It was found that 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> treatment reduced the promastigote proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf methanolic extract was determined by incubating the parasites at different concentrations including 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81, and 3.90 μg/mL. By extrapolating the dose–response curve, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was found to be 43.31 ± 4.202 μg/mL (
