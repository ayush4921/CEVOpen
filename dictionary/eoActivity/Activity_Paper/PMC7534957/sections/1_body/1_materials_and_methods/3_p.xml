 <italic>Protein preparation</italic> - The 3D crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6W63) and RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) were retrieved from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) (http://www.rcsb.org) in PDB format. These receptors were prepared using AutoDock Tools. Briefly, water molecules and bound ligands were removed, polar hydrogens and Kollman charges were added, and the non-polar hydrogens were merged. For both proteins, the protonation states of the amino acid residues were automatically generated by Autodock tools [

Finally, the results were saved as PDBQT format.
