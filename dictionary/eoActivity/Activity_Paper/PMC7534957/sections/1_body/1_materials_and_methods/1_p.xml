 <italic>Ligand preparation</italic> - Initially, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (rutin), quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-3â€™-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate, and quercetin were downloaded from ZINC database (http://zinc15.docking.org/) in spatial data file (SDF) format. These structures were used as templates to generate, via Marvin Sketch software (https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin), kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (nicotiflorin), kaempferol, and some of their putative mono-glucuronide and sulfate derivatives (

 </xref> was downloaded from ZINC database. All explicit hydrogens were added into the structures using Marvin Sketch and the compounds were saved in SDF format. Subsequently, all the structures were subjected to geometry optimisation by the semi-empirical method PM7 using MOPAC2016 software (http://openmopac.net/MOPAC2016.html), being the results saved in protein data bank (PDB) format. Finally, the ligands were prepared for molecular docking using AutoDock Tools.

 </xref> Briefly, Gasteiger charges were added for each compound and non-polar hydrogens were merged, being the results saved in protein data bank, partial charge (Q), &amp; Atom Type (T) (PDBQT) format.
