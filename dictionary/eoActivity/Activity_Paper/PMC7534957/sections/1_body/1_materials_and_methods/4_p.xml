 </xref> in the RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71). For 3CLpro, the grid box was centered at x = -20.810, y = 19.141, and z = -29.186, with x = 27 Å, y = 25 Å, and z = 25 Å size. On the other hand, the RdRp grid box was centered at the x = 117.382, y = 111.853, and z = 121.073, with x = 22 Å, y = 30 Å, and and z = 46 Å size. The interactions and the binding affinity of the protein-ligand complex were predicted via a docking process using Autodock Vina, which use a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, through an Iterated Local Search method, to generate different ligand conformers.
