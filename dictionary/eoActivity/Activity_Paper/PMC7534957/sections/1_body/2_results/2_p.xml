<p>In regards to the observed interactions in the presumed active site of 3CLpro, hydrogen bonds and π-based interactions, such as π-sulfur, π-alkyl, π-π, and π-cation interactions, were dominant in almost all tested compounds (

Since recent studies demonstrated that the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) in the receptor-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (
