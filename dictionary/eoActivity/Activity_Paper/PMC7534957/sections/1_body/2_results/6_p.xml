<p>For rutin, the top-scored compound for 3CLpro, several hydrogen bonds were observed, including a key interaction with His41, from the catalytic dyad, and interactions with Thr25, Cys44, Met165, Gln189, and Thr190 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The observed hydrogen bonds with His41 and Thr190 are in agreement with molecular docking results previously reported to other 3CLpro crystallographic models (PDB ID: 6Y84 and 6LU7).

 </xref> On the other hand, nicotiflorin presented key interactions with both residues of the catalytic dyad of 3CLpro (His41 and Cys145) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), along with key residues observed for x77. In addition to hydrogen bonds with key residues such as Met49, Glu166, and Thr190, this compound presented π-π and π-sigma interactions with His41, and π-sulfur interaction with Cys145 from the catalytic dyad. Key interactions with His41 or Cys145 were also dominant in almost all glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. For example, quercetin-3’-

 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, and kaempferol-4’-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide presented hydrogen bonds with His41, while quercetin-7-
