 </xref> Also, π-anion interactions were observed with the catalytic residues Asp760 and Asp761 from motif C. For nicotiflorin, the top-scored compound for RdRp, hydrogen bond and π-anion interactions were observed with the catalytic residue Asp760, from motif C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, hydrogen bonds with Trp617, along with π-anion interaction with Asp623, from motif A, were also observed to this compound. Also, key interactions were observed to rutin, highlighting hydrogen bonds with Asp623 and Arg624, from motif A, and with the catalytic residue Ser759 and Asp760, from motif C (

 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate, kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, and kaempferol-4’-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulphate, presented key hydrogen bonds and π-anion interaction with the catalytic residue from motif C. The main observed interactions between these compounds and RdRp are summarised in
