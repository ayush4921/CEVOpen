<p>The MeOH twig extract demonstrated extended-spectrum antibacterial properties (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), an observation that stimulated interest in determining its phytochemical profile. Acetone, cold ethyl acetate and hot ethyl acetate were used to partition the compounds in the biologically active extract and the resultant fractions were screened for antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the acetone and methanol sub-fractions demonstrated very weak antibacterial properties (MIC ≥ 2.5 mg/mL). The best antibacterial property was however, exhibited by the cold ethyl acetate sub-fraction which was active against both Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>) and Gram-positive (
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) bacterial strains (MIC range: 0.078–0.6 mg/mL). The hot ethyl acetate sub-fraction demonstrated moderate activities against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (0.3 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (0.6 mg/mL). However, none of the fractions evaluated demonstrated noteworthy antibacterial activities against drug-resistant bacterial strains (
