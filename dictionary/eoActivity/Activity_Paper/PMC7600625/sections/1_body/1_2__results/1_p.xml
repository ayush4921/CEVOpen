<p>The antibacterial MIC values of evaluated plant extracts are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The extracts were classified as having significant (MIC ≤ 0.1 mg/mL), moderate (0.1 &lt; MIC ≤ 0.625 mg/mL) or weak (MIC &gt; 0.625 mg/mL) antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All aqueous extracts yielded MIC values &gt;2.5 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01331">Table S1</xref>). Generally, the evaluated plant parts demonstrated moderate antibacterial properties with MIC values ranging from 0.3–0.6 mg/mL. Interestingly, extracts from the seed (MeOH and petroleum ether) and twigs (MeOH) demonstrated noteworthy antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacterial strains (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>). It was also worth noting that the methanolic leaf and twig extracts of the plant demonstrated promising bacteriostatic properties (MIC = 0.63 mg/mL) against the penicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. However, the other drug-resistant bacterial strains were not susceptible to the plant extracts (MIC &gt; 2.5 mg/mL) and hence were excluded from
