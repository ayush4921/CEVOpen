<p>Given that some plants are inherently toxic [

 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Based on accessed literature, none of the plant species within the genus Protea have been reported to have potential toxic effects on humans. It is, however, important to note that while some medicinal plants exhibit non-mutagenic effects in vitro, they may possess cytotoxic effects [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It should also be kept in mind that besides mutagenesis, carcinogens can also induce cancerous growth in animals through altering intracellular signals and gene expressions both of which are not detected by the Ames test [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is therefore imperative that further toxicological studies be conducted to ascertain the plantâ€™s safety.
