<p>Given that water is one of the most commonly used solvent in folklore medicine [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it was included in the present study to mimic traditionally prepared herbal medicines. However, water extracts have been widely reported to exhibit poor antibacterial activity. This is attributed to the fact that many antibacterial phyto-compounds are non-polar or have intermediate polarity and as such cannot be readily extracted from plant material using water [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the current study, it is possible that the antibacterial compounds in 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> water extracts occurred in very low, sub-lethal concentrations resulting in poor antibacterial activity (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01331">Table S1</xref>). It should, however, be noted that some phyto-compounds indirectly help patients fend off pathogenic infections by acting as immune boosters [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, some of the bioactive compounds in water extracts may exist as pro-drugs, which only become bactericidal once they are modified in the human body [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The presence of immune stimulators and pro-drugs in plant extracts cannot be detected using the techniques employed in the current study, as such, further studies are warranted to determine the chemical profiles of traditionally prepared herbal medicines.
