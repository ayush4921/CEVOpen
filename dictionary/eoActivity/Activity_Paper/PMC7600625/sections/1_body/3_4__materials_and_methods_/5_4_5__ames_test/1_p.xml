<p>The mutagenic properties of different extracts from the plant were evaluated using the Ames Salmonella/ -Microsome assay involving two 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> tester strains, TA98 and TA102, in the absence of S9 metabolic activation [

One hundred microliters of sterile distilled water served as the negative control, while 2 µg/plate of 4NQO were used as the positive control. The assay was conducted twice, and results presented as mean ± standard error number of reverted colonies per plate. Plant samples that induced a 2-fold increase in the number of His
 <sup>+</sup> revertants compared to the negative control were considered to be mutagenic. Additionally, samples that exhibited a dose-dependent increase in the number of His
 <sup>+</sup> revertants were classified as mutagenic [
