<p>Concentrated aqueous (70%) MeOH extract of 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> twigs was sequentially extracted with cold ethyl acetate (10 °C, 3 × 50 mL), hot ethyl acetate (50 °C, 3 × 50 mL) and acetone (room temperature, 3 × 100 mL). The resultant fractions were separately concentrated to dryness 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> to give four solvent fractions: acetone, cold ethyl acetate, hot ethyl acetate and methanol. The four fractions were screened for antibacterial activities against seven bacterial strains (
