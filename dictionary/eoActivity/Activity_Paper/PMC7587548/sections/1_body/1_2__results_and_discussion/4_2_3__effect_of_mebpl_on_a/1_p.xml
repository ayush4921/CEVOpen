<p>The hole-board test model used to exhibit the anxiolytic activity of the extract. After administration of the extract, mice with increased of head dipping behaviour reflect as anxiolytic whereas hesitancy reflects anxiogenic state during the hole-board test. Generally anxiolytic drugs impose their activity by binding with the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor in the brain, increasing GABAergic neurotransmission, as the GABA receptor is important for balancing the neural inhibition as well as excitation [

It is observed in our study that the head dipping behaviour of mice after the treatment of the extract increases as the dose is raised from 200 to 400 mg/kg, which revealed the anxiolytic potentiality of the extract.
