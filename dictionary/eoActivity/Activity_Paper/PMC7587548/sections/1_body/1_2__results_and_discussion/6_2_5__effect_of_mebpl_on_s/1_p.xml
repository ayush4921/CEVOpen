<p>In the sedative activity test, the extract significantly (

The length of sleeping time at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg was 120.59 ± 4.23 min and 132.31 ± 5.05 min, respectively, whereas the reference standard drug exhibited 147.79 ± 3.97 min sleeping. Diazepam (standard drug) produces anxiolytic as well as a sedative effect, as it minimizes the onset of rest and extended the duration of rest as well as reduced exploratory action [
