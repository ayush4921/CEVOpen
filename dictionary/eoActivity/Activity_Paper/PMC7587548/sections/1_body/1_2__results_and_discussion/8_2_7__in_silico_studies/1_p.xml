<p>In this study, molecular docking was performed as it has been greatly used to predict the ligand-target interactions for gaining better insights into pharmacological activity of natural products [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For determining better perceptions of the observed biological activity (anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-diarrheal, anxiolytic, locomotor and sedative) of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>, one compound (beta-sitosterol) was selected for the docking analysis where the result of docking study are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04737-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The present study showed that beta-sitosterol displayed −5.01 kcal/mol docking score against the PDE4 (PDB ID: 4WCU) for anti-inflammatory activity. In the case of analgesic activity, beta-sitosterol did not posses any interaction against the COX1 receptor (PDB ID: 2OYE), whereas −3.865 kcal/mol docking score was exhibited against the COX2 (PDB ID: 6COX) enzyme. The compound displayed −2.041 Kcal/mol and −4.273 kcal/mol docking score against the potassium channel (PDB ID: 4UUJ) and bromodomain of human BRD4 in complex with midazolam (PDB ID: 3U5K), respectively, for anxiolytic activity. In addition, it was found to possess the highest docking score of −6.656 kcal/mol against serotonin transporter (PDB ID: 5I6X) for locomotor activity, while exhibiting −4.494 kcal/mol docking score against bromodomain of human BRD4 (PDB ID: 3U5J). Furthermore, for anti-diarrhoeal docking analysis, beta-sitosterol showed −2.01 kcal/mol against the 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> MARTX toxin (PDB ID: 3CJB). The results of binding interactions of the docking study are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04737-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Here, beta-sitosterol interacts with the 6COX through three hydrogen bonds and twelve hydrophobic interactions as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04737-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>; 5I6X through two hydrogen bonds and 11 hydrophobic interactions; 4WCU through 12 hydrophobic interactions; 4UUJ through one hydrogen bond and three hydrophobic interactions; 3U5K through nine hydrophobic interactions; 3U5J through 14 hydrophobic interactions and 3CJB through nine hydrophobic interactions. Of all the receptors, 6COX, 5I6X and 4UUJ showed the better binding affinity in both hydrogen bond and hydrophobic bonds interaction.
