<p>Moreover, to support our experimental studies, a computer based online tool “PASS” was used to predict different biological activity based on the structure of the compounds. In this study, the possible biological activities of beta-sitosterol were evaluated by the PASS online program (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04737-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). The results of this study were defined as Pa (probable activity) and Pi (probable inactivity), where the values of both Pa and Pi should be ranging from 0.000 to 1.000. The Pa value of beta-sitosterol for anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antisecretory, neurotransmitter uptake inhibitor, neurotrophic factor enhancer and neuropeptide Y4 antagonist activities were 0.558, 0.467, 0.427, 0.266, 0.218 and 0.288, respectively. This outcome is consistent with our experimental studies which exhibited that MEBPL has anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory and neuropharmacological activities, including other biological properties.
