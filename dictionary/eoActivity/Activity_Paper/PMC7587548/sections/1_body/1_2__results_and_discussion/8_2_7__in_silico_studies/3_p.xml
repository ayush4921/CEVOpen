<p>The bioactive compound (beta-sitosterol) was then further characterized by using ADME analysis to pursue the physiochemical, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics characteristics. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of beta-sitosterol for selective activity was assessed with the QikProp module of Schrodinger (
