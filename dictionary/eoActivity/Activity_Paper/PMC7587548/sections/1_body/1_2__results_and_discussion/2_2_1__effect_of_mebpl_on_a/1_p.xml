<p>The possible anti-inflammatory effect of MEBPL was undertaken by membrane stabilization and protein denaturation assay. Lysosomal lysis and enzyme discharging are caused by the inflammation, thus, a different kind of disorder. The NSAIDs possess their remedial effect either by stabilizing lysosomal membranes or by preventing the release of enzymes from lysosomes [

There are similarities between human red blood cell (HRBC) membranes and lysosomal membranes, as HRBC membranes may be lysed by the use of an injurious agent (e.g., phenyl-hydrazine), a hypotonic medium and heat. In our study, dose dependent haemolysis inhibition of MEBPL was found and the protection of haemolysis persuaded by the hypotonic solution significantly (

The percentages of inhibition of haemolysis were 4.67 ± 1.24%, 15.41 ± 3.04%, 33.44 ± 1.61% and 44.88 ± 2.27% for the extract, whereas the standard hydrocortisone exhibited inhibition of 60.56 ± 2.67%, 70.66 ± 1.83%, 78.17 ± 1.47% and 85.45 ± 0.84%, respectively, at the doses of 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 μg/mL (
