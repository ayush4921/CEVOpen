<p>The chronic inflammatory response, such as arthritis, causes protein denaturation. The key mechanism of action of NSAIDs is to provide protection against denaturation of protein and play an important role in the treatment of inflammation [

The highest percentage of inhibitory activity was found of 56.57 ± 4.11% at the dose of 500 μg/mL for the extract; while at the same dose standard the drug diclofenac sodium produced 85.32 ± 3.22% inhibition. The ability to inhibit hypotonic protein denaturation by MEBPL may provide a significant contribution to the anti-inflammatory properties. As a result, the extract exerts anti-inflammatory activity, as it gives significant protection against HRBC membrane lysis and provides reduction of protein denaturation. Several researches reported that presence of various phytoconstituents such as phenols, terpenoids and flavonoids [
