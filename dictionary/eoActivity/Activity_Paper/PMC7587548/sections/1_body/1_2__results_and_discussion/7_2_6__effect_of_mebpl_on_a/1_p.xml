<p>Castor oil, its most active metabolite (ricinoleic acid), is regarded as a well-known diarrheal agent. Irritation of the intestinal mucosa is attempted when ricinoleic acid is released from castor oil by the action of the lipase enzyme, this causes secretion of the prostaglandin and nitric oxide (inflammatory mediators) that lead to stimulation of the intestinal motility by suppressing electrolyte and water reabsorption [
