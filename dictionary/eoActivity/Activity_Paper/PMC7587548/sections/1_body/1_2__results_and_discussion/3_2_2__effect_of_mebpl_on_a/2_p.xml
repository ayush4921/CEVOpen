<p>Besides, the formalin induced licking test is a biphasic technique for both centrally and peripherally anti-nociceptive pain mediated by two different mechanisms. The early phase is related to the neurogenic pain and the late phase is due to the inflammatory pain. The NSAIDs inhibit the late phase whereas the narcotic drugs inhibit both phases [

Such significant inhibition in the analgesic activity exhibited by the plant might be due to the availability of several bioactive phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, phenols [
