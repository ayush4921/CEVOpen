<p>Nociception can cause oedema, leukocyte eruption and inflammation, which is activated or triggered by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators. The manifestation of abdominal constriction (writhing response) after inducing acetic acid (intraperitoneally) into the mice is a well-designed model for the study of visceral pain. This animal model also helps to evaluate the peripherally analgesic effect of the plant extract [

In this test, pain sensation is perceived by producing pro-inflammatory endogenous mediators (prostaglandins, cytokines, histamine, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase and serotonin) in the peripheral tissue which not only influence the stimulation of prostaglandin but also enhance the capillary permeability progresses of inflammatory ache [

The MEBPL respectively exhibited 24.73% and 33.87% inhibition of writhing response at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses, while the reference drug diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg) showed 65.59% inhibition compared to the control (
