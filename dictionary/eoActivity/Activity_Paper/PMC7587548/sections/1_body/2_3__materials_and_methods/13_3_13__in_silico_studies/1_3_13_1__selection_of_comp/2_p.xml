<p>In the present study, we have collected data regarding detailed pharmacological activities and analytical aspects of beta-sitosterol, which could be beneficial to the researchers, scientist including in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. Moreover, there are no previous reports on isolated compounds from 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> to date except the isolation of beta-sitosterol. From this perspective, we have selected beta-sitosterol for computational studies such as molecular docking, PASS prediction, and ADME analysis.
