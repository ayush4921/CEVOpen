<p>Membrane stabilization activity of MEBPL was done by following a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The test solution contained 0.5 mL of dissimilar concentrations (62.5, 125, 250 and 500 µg/mL) of MEBPL with 1 mL of buffer (phosphate) solution, 2 mL of hyposaline and 0.5 mL of suspension of HRBC (human red blood cell). For the standard (diclofenac sodium), the same procedure was followed. The control solution contained all the chemicals except the extract and reference drug. Then the mixtures were placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min, and followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant solutions were collected and the haemoglobin content in the supernatant solution was measured at 560 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer. The membrane stabilization of MEBPL was calculated by using the following formula (Equation (1)):
