<p>Briefly, the experimental evidences support the medicinal value and potentiality of 
 <italic>B. pilosa.</italic> Our study provides notable proof of significant and dose dependent anti-inflammatory activity of MEBPL. The experimental study also showed that MEBPL exhibited noticeable analgesic activity in different pain models. It has also been revealed that MEBPL possesses remarkable anxiolytic, locomotion and sedative effect. Furthermore, expressive anti-diarrheal activity increases the importance of this plant. In addition, molecular docking, PASS prediction and ADME analysis revealed that the selective compound beta-sitosterol could be a potential candidate for the named biological activity. Therefore, 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> can be considered as a viable candidate for the development of new drugs as it has numerous pharmacological activities. However, to explore its biological activity and mechanisms on animals and humans necessitates further extensive studies.
