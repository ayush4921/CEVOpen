<p>There was an increase in DPPH scavenging activity with an increase in callus extract and ascorbic acid concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The DPPH scavenging activities between ascorbic acid and callus extract were also expressed as 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of callus extract and ascorbic acid were recorded at 85.59 ± 6.09 µg/mL and 32.16 ± 0.29 µg/mL, respectively. The result was also expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity, and the value obtained was 1.879 ± 0.22 mg AEAC/g FW of extract.
