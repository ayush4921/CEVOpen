<p>The use of woody plant medium (WPM) with different concentrations and types of auxins showed that dicamba was not the best auxin to induce calluses from all 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> explants (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01772-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The negative response was also observed for WPMO medium where no callus was produced from all explants and both conditions. However, when compared with MS, the midrib cultured on WPM + 16.56 µM picloram in dark produced the highest callus at 53.33 ± 22.06% after 78 days of culture.
