<p>The relationships between antioxidant activity with TPC and TFC are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01772-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The positive correlations obtained between DPPH scavenging activity with TPC and TFC were at 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.869 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.904, respectively. The TFC showed the highest correlation with DPPH scavenging activity as compared to TPC in methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus.
