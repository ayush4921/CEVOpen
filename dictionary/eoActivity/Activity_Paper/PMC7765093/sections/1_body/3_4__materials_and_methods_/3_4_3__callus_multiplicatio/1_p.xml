<p>To determine the effect of auxins on callus multiplication, 100 mg of the calli obtained were cultured on MS and WPM media containing 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 µM of 2,4-D, picloram, dicamba, IAA, IBA, and NAA, respectively. The calli grown on MS and WPM without addition of auxins served as controls. The cultures were then incubated at 25 ± 2 °C under dark conditions. The calli were grown in glass vials (25 mm × 100 mm), respectively. Each of the treatments consisted of six replicates.</p>
