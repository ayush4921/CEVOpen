<p>The growth of calli was determined by measuring the calli fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) every week for 6 weeks. The same calli used for fresh weight determination were later dried in the oven at 50 Â°C until they reached a constant weight for determination of callus dry weight. The morphological changes of callus in different treatments were also observed every week for 6 weeks.</p>
