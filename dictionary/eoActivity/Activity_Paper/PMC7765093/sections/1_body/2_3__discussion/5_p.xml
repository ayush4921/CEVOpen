<p>Two growth conditions, the dark and light, were also tested for callus induction of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>, and the results showed the dark condition was more favorable for this plant. A similar result was obtained by Habibah et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Their findings showed that the incubation of 
 <italic>Stelechocarpus burahol</italic> explants exhibited the highest callus formation in the dark compared to the light condition. 
 <italic>S. burahol</italic> is a tropical species, which can be found in Java, Indonesia. The plant likes hot and humid secondary forest on deep soil that is dominated with moist clay soils. It can grow up to 25 m tall with a trunk diameter of up to 40 cm [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] also obtained maximum callus fresh weight of 
 <italic>Cnidium officinale</italic> grown in completely dark condition. The 
 <italic>C. officinale</italic> is a perennial plant from the family Umbelliferae or Apiaceae that is mainly cultivated in Korea, China, and Japan for its condiment and medicinal uses [
