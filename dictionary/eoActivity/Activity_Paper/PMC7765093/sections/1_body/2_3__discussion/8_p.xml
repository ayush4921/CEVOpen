<p>The presence of auxins enhanced the proliferation and growth of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus. Dicamba produced the highest callus weight at the third week, which was earlier compared to 2,4-D and picloram. This is due to the already reported ability of dicamba to initiate the growth of callus even after two to three days of culturing on nutrient medium [

 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> was reported to be effective in promoting callus growth [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is a tropical medicinal plant from the Apiaceae family, native to Southeast Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia as well as South Africa and Madagascar [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the rate of callus growth induced by dicamba increased with the increase of its concentration. This is contrary to the present study since the higher concentrations of dicamba at 40 and 50 μM reduced the growth of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus. On the other hand, Behrens et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that most dicotyledonous plants, like tobacco, are quite sensitive to the application of auxin herbicide like dicamba. According to Bienaimé et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the presence of auxins is vital in maintaining cellular activity in callus as well as photosynthesis in the culture. The use of hormone free medium leads to necrosis of the callus cell.
