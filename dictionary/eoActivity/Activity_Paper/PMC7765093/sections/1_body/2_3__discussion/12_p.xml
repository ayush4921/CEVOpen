<p>From the results obtained, the total phenolics and flavonoids showed a high correlation with the DPPH scavenging activity. In line with a previous study conducted by Krishnan et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the high correlations between DPPH with TPC and TFC were observed in 
 <italic>Gynura procumbens</italic> callus at 0.762 and 0.691, respectively. Similar findings were also demonstrated by Kapoor et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] where the TPC was significantly correlated with DPPH scavenging activity in callus of 
 <italic>Rhodiola imbricate</italic>. It could be deduced that TPC and TFC contributed to the antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus.
