<p>The presence of phenolics and flavonoids was also quantified in the callus of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>, which further proves the capability of leaf-derived (from leaf midrib) callus to produce antioxidant compounds. 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> leaf was recently reported to contain TPC and TFC as well as having high antioxidant capacity [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The TPC and TFC of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> leaf were recorded at 1042.52 ± 1.97 mg GAE/g DW and 80.88 ± 0.24 mg QE/g DW, respectively, which was slightly higher than that of TPC and TFC in the 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus. The DPPH scavenging activity of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus (67.79 ± 0.24%) was found to be lower than 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> leaf (85.19 ± 0.67%). Phenolics and flavonoids possess antioxidant properties by working as chain breakers, free radical scavengers and electron donors. The high amount of phenolics and flavonoids in the plant extract suggests a great radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity of the extracts [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A stable free radical, DPPH, was used to accept hydrogen atoms donated by antioxidants present in the extracts. This method is reliable due to its simplicity and ability in scavenging ROS [

 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The lower DPPH scavenging activity in callus as compared to ascorbic acid might be due to the low amount of phenolic and flavonoid compounds present in the callus extract compared to that of the pure compound. Similarly, a study by Esmaeili et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] also found a lower DPPH scavenging activity in callus extract of 
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> as compared to ascorbic acid.
