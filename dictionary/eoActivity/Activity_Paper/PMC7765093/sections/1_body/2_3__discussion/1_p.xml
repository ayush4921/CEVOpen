<p>Auxins are the best PGRs to enhance chances of callus formation [

 <italic>P. bullata</italic> followed by NAA. The treatment with dicamba, however, failed to induce callus. The callus formed in picloram containing medium was friable. Meanwhile, the compact callus was produced on 2,4-D containing medium, and the friable callus was produced from NAA containing medium. The difference in callus formation and its morphology are due to the variation in physiological activity of the respective auxin within the plant tissue [
