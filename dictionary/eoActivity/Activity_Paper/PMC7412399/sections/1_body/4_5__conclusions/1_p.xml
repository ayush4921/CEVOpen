<p>Many medicines were developed from ethnomedicinal uses. Species in the ginger family are some of the most commonly used among Thai medicinal plants. The majority of studies on gingers focus on 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. Here, we document the large number of ethnomedicinal uses for the 76 ginger species in Thailand, and suggest additional species which might have potential applicability in the treatments, especially the 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> species. The result strongly suggests that the ICPC-2 standard can identify an important medicinal category, in the treatment of which gingers have therapeutic effect, especially for symptoms and health conditions related to digestive system disorders. We highlight the ginger genera and species that have potential for use in the treatment of health conditions, specifically for abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and peptic ulcers. We hope that our results will encourage other scholars to use this information for pharmacological development, which can help people around the world.
