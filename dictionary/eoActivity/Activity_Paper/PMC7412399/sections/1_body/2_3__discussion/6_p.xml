<p>Ginger species have a long history in academic research. There are thousands of results from a search in the Scopus database using the keywords ‘Zingiberaceae’ and ‘medicinal plants.’ However, most research on the pharmacological uses of ginger species focuses on 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. Our analysis suggests that many gingers may have the potential for pharmacological development, in order to produce medicines for specific treatments related to digestive system disorders. Especially, we identify 
 <italic>Zingiber montanum,</italic> but also to a lesser degree 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. ottensii</italic>, as candidates for the treatment of flatulence (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00906">Table S2</xref>). These plants produce a range of terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the main secondary compounds being zerumbone and kaempferol derivatives [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Clinical trials, both in vitro and in vivo, found that the plants have antioxidant activities, anti-inflammatory activities, anti-allergic activities, hypotensive activities, antiarrhythmic activities, local analgesic and anesthetic activities, antibacterial and antifungal activities, and antihistaminic actions [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, we still lack pharmacological evidence that the plants will be efficient in the treatments of flatulence, even if they are widely used for that purpose in many places including Thailand. Abdominal pain is another symptom which was often treated with gingers in Thailand. Our results suggests that eight ginger species might genuinely have potential as treatments for abdominal pain and peptic ulcers, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00906">Table S2</xref>). Phytochemical studies have proven that the plants contain high amounts of secondary metabolites, which are effective for various treatments, such as curcumin [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], zingiberene [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], gingerol [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and zerumbone [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Several studies have provided scientific evidence that gingers have a broad variety of pharmacological activities. However, we rarely found evidence-based pharmacological research confirming that gingers have the potential for the treatment of abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, flatulence, laxative or peptic ulcers, except in studies of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. Many modern medicines were developed from traditional uses [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An example is artemisinin [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we recommend further research on the effect of ginger species in treating conditions related to digestive system disorders, especially for abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and peptic ulcers. Specifically, we suggest the plant taxa from 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00906-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00906">Table S2</xref>, which have high values for specific symptoms.
