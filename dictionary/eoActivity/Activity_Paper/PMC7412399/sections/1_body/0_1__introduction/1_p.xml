<p>Traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge is not only important to local people who own the knowledge, but is also important for people around the world, as sources of knowledge for modern drug development [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. So, ethnobotanical study plays an important role in supporting findings. Using similar plants for the same or similar purposes as those of people living in different areas implies the efficacy of the plants [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For these reasons, being guided by ethnomedicinal uses would facilitate more opportunities for drug developments. Connecting the ethnomedicinal study and the modern medical study needs an appropriate link. Most of the ethnobotanical studies use the 
 <italic>Economic Botany Data Collection Standard</italic> (EBDCS) [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which classifies uses into categories based on local peoplesâ€™ perceptions [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, the EBDCS categories would not be appropriate guides for drug development. The 
 <italic>International Classification of Primary Care</italic> (ICPC), which is now updated to ICPC-2 [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-00906" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], is an interesting standard supported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The standard provides categories more related to modern medical terms. This study, therefore, proposes to use this standard in classifying ethnomedicinal use reports, so as to identify Zingiberaceae plants as candidates for drug development research based on ethnomedicinal knowledge in Thailand.
