<p id="Par50">Psoriasis is a chronic immune related skin disease. It is characterized by erythema, scales and pruritus, which is determined by polygenic inheritance and induced by multiple environmental factors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. According to the modern research results, indigo naturalis mainly treats psoriasis by inhibiting the excessive proliferation of keratinocytes, regulating the body immunity, reducing inflammation and anti angiogenes [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It should be noted that in a clinical report, 4 out of 42 subjects had pruritus after using indigo naturalis ointment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The safety of indigo naturalis for external use needs further evaluation. Moreover, the indigo naturalis ointment are prepared by the hospital itself without no unified standard. Therefore, it is necessary to develop indigo naturalis into qualified patent medicine as soon as possible.
