<p id="Par47">Tryptanthrin in indigo naturalis also has antitumor activity. Tryptanthrin can make the murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells stay in G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> phase, and down-regulate the expression of cyclin D2, D3, CDK2, 4, 6 genes, so as to inhibit the proliferation of WEHI-3B JCS and play an anti-tumor role [

 <sub>1/2</sub> and p38 and reducing the expression of

 <sub>1/2</sub> signaling pathways and reducing the level of Ang-1, PDGFB and MMP2 [
