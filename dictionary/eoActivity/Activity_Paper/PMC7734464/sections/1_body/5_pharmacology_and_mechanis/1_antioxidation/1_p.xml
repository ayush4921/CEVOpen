<p id="Par40">Excessive oxygen free radicals can cause aging, inflammation and other diseases, which affect human health. Some components of medicinal plants have natural antioxidant effect, which is important in preventing and treating diseases caused by abnormal increase of oxygen free radicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has been shown that indigo naturalis can play an antioxidant role by scavenging oxygen free radicals, improving the activity of superoxide dismutase, inhibiting the production of malondialdehyde, and stabilizing cell membrane permeability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Lin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found that the extract of indigo naturalis could inhibit the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> or derived hydroxyl radicals induced by exogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, it could interfere with protein modification induced by a lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), and protect keratinocytes from the electrophilic attack of HNE. Zhao [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found that indigo and indirubin, the main components of indigo naturalis, could effectively scavenge superoxide anion. The mechanism may be associated with some electrophilic groups, such as ketones or aldehydes. These electrophilic groups could promote the release of hydrogen ion from hydroxyl groups and form non free radical superoxide anion, thus stabilizing superoxide anion. Another study found that indigo and indirubin could promote clearing of ROS, reduce the malondialdehyde content, promote the balance between the antioxidant system and ROS, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and protect cell membranes from oxidative damage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. What’s more, indigo naturalis can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6, indirectly reduce the level of ROS, and play the role of oxygen oxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These results indicate that indigo naturalis and its some main components have potential as antioxidants.
