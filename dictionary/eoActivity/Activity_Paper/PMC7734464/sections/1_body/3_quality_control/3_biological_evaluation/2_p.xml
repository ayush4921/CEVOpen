<p id="Par38">Different from other traditional Chinese medicine, indigo naturalis has the characteristics of diverse plant sources and complex manufacturing technology. The quality of indigo naturalis can be affected by plant source, ratio of plant raw materials to lime, soaking time, climate and production season, which makes it difficult to standardize and standardize the manufacturing of indigo naturalis. At present, researches on the quality control of indigo naturalis are mainly focused on the organic compounds such as indigo, indirubin and tryptamine. However, lime is an essential raw material in the process of indigo naturalis manufacture. There are few studies on the problem of adding excessive lime. Shi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found that many commercial indigo naturalis is a qualified product according to the standard, but most of them have high the total ash content and strong alkaline due to the addition of excessive lime. Obviously, excessive lime will affect the quality of indigo naturalis, and even affect the clinical efficacy and safety. Therefore, researchers should also focus on the control of inorganic content in indigo naturalis, except for the control of organic matter content.
