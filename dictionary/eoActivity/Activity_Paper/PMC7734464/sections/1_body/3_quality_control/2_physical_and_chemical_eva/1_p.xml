<p id="Par36">At present, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are the most commonly used quality control methods for indigo naturalis. For instance, the 2015 Chinese pharmacopoeia used TLC to identify indigo and indirubin in samples. The indigo content was more than 2% and that of indirubin was more than 0.13%. Besides TLC and HPLC, there are many other quality control methods for indigo naturalis. Degani et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] describe an analytical procedure based on the silylating agent N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane for pure molecules of indigo, indirubin and plant extracts of indigo naturalis. Gas Chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry turns out to be an efficient and fast analytical tool for the identification of natural indigo in plants and textile artifacts. Li et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] established a reversed phase HPLC method of simultaneous determination of five nucleosides in indigo naturalis: uracil, cytidine, hypoxanthine, inosine, and thymidine. The method was applied to compare the contents of nucleosides in indigo naturalis from different producing areas and batches. It was found that there were obvious differences in nucleoside content of indigo naturalis from different producing areas or batches. Liao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] determined the contents of copper, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury in indigo naturalis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This method can accurately and rapidly determine the content of heavy metals mentioned above. It is very useful for controlling the quality of indigo naturalis and ensuring its safety.
