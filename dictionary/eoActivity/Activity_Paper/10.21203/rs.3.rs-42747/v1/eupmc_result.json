    "<h4>Background: </h4> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 has devastating effects on people in all countries and getting worse. We aim to investigate an in-silico docking analysis of phytochemical compounds from medicinal plants that used to combat inhibition of the COVID-19 pathway. There are several phytochemicals in medicinal plants, however, the mechanism of bioactive compounds remains unclear. These results are obtained from in silico research provide further information to support the inhibition of several phytochemicals. Methods  Molecular docking used to determine the best potential COVID-19 M pro inhibitor from several bioactive compounds in Moringa oleifera, Allium cepa, Cocos nucifera, Psidium guajava , and Eucalyptus globulus . Molecular docking was conducted and scored by comparison with standard drugs remdesivir. ADME properties of selected ligands were evaluated using the Lipinski Rule. The interaction mechanism of the most recommended compound predicted using the STITCH database. Results  There was no recommended compound in Moringa oleifera as a potential inhibitor for COVID-19. Oleanolic acid in Allium cepa , α-tocotrienol in Cocos nucifera , asiatic acid in Psidium guajava and culinoside in Eucalyptus globulus were the most recommended compound in each medicinal plant. Oleanolic acid was reported to exhibit anti-COVID-19 activity with binding energy was − 9.20 kcal/mol. This score was better than remdesivir as standard drug. Oleanolic acid interacted through the hydrogen bond with HIS41, THR25, CYS44, GLU166. Oleanolic acid binding with CASP-3, CASP-9, and XIAP signaling pathway. Conclusions  Oleanolic acid in Allium cepa found as a potential inhibitor of COVID-19 M-pro that should be examined in future studies. These results suggest that oleanolic acid may be useful in COVID-19 treatment."
