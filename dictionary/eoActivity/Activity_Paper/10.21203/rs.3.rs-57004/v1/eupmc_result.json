    "The main aim of present paper is to determine bioactive compounds in Pleione maculata extracts using Gas chromatographic technique and to investigate their drug-likeness potential using molecular docking algorithm and ADME studies on the recent intractable disease for example; SARS-CoV-2. P. maculata sample was prepared for GC-MS analysis. The peak components are identified based on NIST Library. Molecular docking was performed using PatchDock and energy refinement was carried out using FireDock algorithm followed by drug-likeness analysis using Swiss ADME tool. Mass spectrum revealed various pharmacologically important compounds and novel compounds 8-oxatetracyclo{5.2.1.1(2,6). 1(4,10)}Dodecane, 7-tert-Butyl-1,9,9-Trimeth, Cholesterol Isocaproate, Docosane, 2,4-Dimethyl, 7.dehydrocholesterol isocaproate, Kryptogenin 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine, N-decyl-Alpha,D-2-Deoxyglycoside, pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-Trione-1-octadecyl) which are reported for the first time. Molecular docking using PatchDock illustrates GC-MS compounds Nor-diazepam,3-{N-hydroxymethyl}aminocarbonyloxy a good docking and high binding affinity with Atomic contact energy -10.95 kcal/mol against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S2 subunit. ADME analysis predict Nor-diazepam,3-{N-hydroxymethyl}aminocarbonyloxy and andrographolide showed very high drug-likeness parameters with no metabolism disturbances. The random control anti-viral drug arabidiol revealed a lower binding energy and lower solubility compared to bioactive compounds of P. maculata . The study depicts the first and novel report on various pharmaceutical important GC-MS bioactive compounds and molecular docking study of Pleione maculata having potential against various intractable diseases."
