  <p>The population structure analysis of 208 
   <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples collected from three locations. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The UPGMA cluster analysis. Light pink, blue and purple colors corresponding to the Puling (PL001-070), Gaofeng (GF071-139), and Langping (LP140-208) populations, respectively. The light green and yellow blocks explain two clustering groups. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The light pink, blue and purple dots represent samples collected from the Puling, Gaofeng, and Langping locations, respectively. The orange dot explains the distribution of the core collection materials in the original germplasm. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The population structure of 
   <italic>A. biserrata</italic> when 
   <italic>K</italic> = 2. Green color explains the first genetic group mainly including samples from the Puling and Gaofeng locations, while red represents the other genetic group with samples from Langping.
