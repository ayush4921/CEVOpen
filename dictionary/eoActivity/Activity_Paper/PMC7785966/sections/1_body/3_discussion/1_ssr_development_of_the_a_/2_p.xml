<p>Currently, transcriptome derived SSR markers have been widely applied in population genetic analyses of medicinal plants, such as 
 <italic>Picria felterrae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2019</xref>), 
 <italic>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), and 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sa et al., 2018</xref>). Researches on constructing core collections of medicinal plants using transcriptome derived SSRs are also quickly increased in recent years. An example came from the successful development of a core collection of 
 <italic>Dalbergia odorifera</italic>, in which 19 microsatellite markers developed from its transcriptome were used (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). For 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic>, no SSR markers have been previously reported and the genomic resources of this species is also limited. To our knowledge, this study represented the first report for the genome information (transcriptome) of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic>. The transcriptome information and the developed SSR markers presented here therefore provide important molecular resources for future genetic analysis of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> germplasm.
