<p>Microsatellite tandem repeats are widely distributed throughout plant genome and SSR markers derived from these repeats are the most frequently used molecular tool for evaluating plant genetic diversity and population structure (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2015</xref>), for constructing genetic maps (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), and for marker-assisted breeding (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). SSRs generally consist of one to six nucleotide basic units repeated multiple times (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Vieira et al., 2016</xref>), and are co-dominance with good repeatability and high polymorphism (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2018</xref>). However, developing SSR markers is relatively difficult in non-model plants without genomic resources (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Most medicinal plants are non-model organisms and their genetic information is scarce, causing a lag in molecular biology and genetic breeding researches (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xin et al., 2017</xref>). Given the cost of RNA-seq have fallen dramatically in recent years, transcriptome sequencing therefore provided a convenient and economical way for quickly obtaining SSR markers in non-model plants. Moreover, most SSR markers derived from transcriptome are directly or indirectly related to functional loci. Compared to those SSRs derived from the neutral parts of a plant genome, these transcriptome derived SSRs are potentially more useful, in particular for constructing crop core collections in which selection in relation to focused phenotypic traits is the primary purpose.
