<p>Core collections are the most representative subsamples from the original germplasm, which must be as comprehensive as possible to effectively represent the characteristics of the original germplasm and to ensure that not too much genetic diversity is lost (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frankel and Brown, 1984</xref>). For medicinal plants, the intrinsic quality (in terms of the contents of active ingredients) and appearance characteristics are both important phenotypic traits (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, for constructing a core collection of a medicinal herb, it is necessary to consider both genetic and metabolic diversity simultaneously. Many previous studies of medicinal plants for constructing core collections are only based on genetic diversity, such as those reported in 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2010</xref>) and 
 <italic>Dalbergia odorifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we simultaneously determined genetic variation and metabolic contents of the 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> germplasm, which may be more comprehensive and indicative for selection of core samples. Moreover, a series of results (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) further demonstrated that our trade-off method which was mainly based on genetic diversity and supplemented by metabolic components was feasible and reliable.
