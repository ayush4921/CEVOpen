<p>Here, we combined genetic and metabolic analyses of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples collected from areas within and around the Changyang region to construct core collection. Due to the limited genomic resources of this medicinal plant, we first conducted RNA-sequencing of a representative sample of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> to develop simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers based on the assembled transcripts to investigate the overall genetic variation of the samples. Moreover, six main kinds of coumarins previously reported in 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 1987</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) were characterized in all corresponding samples used in the genetic analysis. A core collection was finally prepared using data from a least distance stepwise sampling strategy (LDSS) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Our study will promote the protection and management of the extant 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> germplasm resource, and provide core materials for future selection and breeding of this plant. Our method of constructing a core collection will also serve as a reference for other medicinal plants in terms of germplasm conservation and utilization.
