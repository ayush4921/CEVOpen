<p>Diverse germplasm resources are critical for crop breeding and improvements (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). However, the conservation and management of genetic resources for most crops are tedious and costly. Establishing core collections provides a convenient solution to conserve and effectively utilize genetic resources (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>). The concept of “core collection” was first proposed by 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frankel and Brown (1984)</xref>, and further supplemented and broadened by 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brown (1989)</xref>. A core collection is a subset of germplasm resources that fully represents the genetic diversity of the entire population with the fewest samples (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Guzmán et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The core collection should have a sufficiently small sample size, but preserve overall genetic variation. Genetic diversity is the basis of biological diversity which determines the ability of a species to adapt to the external environment and evolve (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ndjiondjop et al., 2017</xref>). A lower genetic diversity of a species means less genetic variation and adaptability, which threatens its long-term survival (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Linde and Selmes, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez-Nevado et al., 2018</xref>). Genetic diversity is also an important factor affecting synthesis of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, analyzing the genetic diversity of plant populations is a critical step to construct a core collection.
