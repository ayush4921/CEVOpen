<p>Among the six coumarins investigated in the samples, columbianadin was the most abundant compound (up to 8.27 mg/g in samples), followed by osthole (average 1.17 mg/g), columbianetin acetate (average 0.56 mg/g), 8-methoxypsoralen (average 0.55 mg/g), and bergapten (average 0.20 mg/g). In addition, osthole and columbianadin contents revealed clear differences among 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS12">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Among the 208 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> samples collected from three sampling locations, most samples from the Puling and Gaofeng population had higher columbianadin content, in particular the Puling049 sample revealed the highest columbianadin content (18.58 mg/g). In contrast, 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> samples from the Langping location had higher osthole content but relatively lower columbianadin content (
