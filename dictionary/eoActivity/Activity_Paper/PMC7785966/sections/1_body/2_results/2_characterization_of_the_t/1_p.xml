<p>For the assembled 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> transcripts, 6,651 sequences contained SSRs and 1,343 sequences contained more than one SSR loci. A total of 8,371 SSR loci were detected with a frequency of 21.06% and an average of one locus per 4.9 kb. Among all SSRs, 7,566 (90.38%) were simple repeat motifs and 805 (9.62%) presented in compound formation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The repeat types of these SSRs were diverse, of which mononucleotide (3,045, 36.38%) and dinucleotide (3,713, 44.35%) repeats were the major types, followed by trinucleotides (1,472, 17.58%). The total proportion of tetranucleotides (1.03%), pentanucleotides (0.3%), and hexanucleotides (0.36%) was &lt;2% (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The number of motif repetitions for different SSR types varied broadly, as a whole with a maximum frequency repeat for six repetitions (19.08%), followed by ten (17.86%), seven (10.80%), five (10.74%), and eleven (9.35%) repetitions. Among the three SSR types with the highest frequency, the primary numbers of repetitions of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and trinucleotides were ten, six and five, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Moreover, the A/T repeat type was predominant (96.95%) among mononucleotides, and AG/CT (61.24%) was the primary repeat type among dinucleotides, while AAG/CTT accounted for 23.23% of trinucleotides (
