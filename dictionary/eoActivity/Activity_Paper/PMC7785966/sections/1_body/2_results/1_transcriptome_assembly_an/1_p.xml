<p>After filtering, a total of 5.9 Gb clean reads were retained and used for the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, leading to 39,748 unigenes were finally obtained with a N50 sequence length of 1,636 bp, and the percentage of GC was 40.36%. The benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) analysis based on plant gene models showed that 73.71% of the BUSCO sequences were completely present in the 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> transcripts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). About 70.42% (27,989) of the unigenes were annotated in five public databases, in which 27,385 unigenes (68.90%) matched in the Nr database and 25,780 (64.86%) can be annotated in the Swiss-prot database (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a total of 19,193 unigenes (48.29%) could be classified into 57 functional groups categorized in three major GO categories based on sequence homology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Amongst, biosynthetic process and cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, nucleus, ion binding are the most abundant GO terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that a total of 8,371 unigenes were clustered into 24 function categories in the COG database, and signal transduction mechanisms (473) was the major category, followed by translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (354), transcription (311), posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (279) and Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (211) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The annotated unigenes of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> were also mapped into 28 KEGG pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), of which metabolism was the most represented category. Twelve metabolic pathways were included in the category and the carbohydrate metabolism was the most dominant pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).
