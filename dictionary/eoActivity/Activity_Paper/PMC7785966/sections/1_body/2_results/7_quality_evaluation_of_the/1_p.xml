<p>The main genetic parameters, including 
 <italic>Ne</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>, and 
 <italic>I</italic> were not significantly different between the core collection and the original germplasm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS14">Supplementary Table 14</xref>), indicating no significant genetic difference between them. The retention ratio of the core collection to the original germplasm was greater than 100% for each genetic parameter evaluated, except 
 <italic>Na</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS15">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). The seven genetic diversity parameters of the removal samples were all lower than the original germplasm, which means that these removal samples can lead to an increase in the genetic duplication rate of the population (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS15">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). Moreover, it could be seen from the PCoA diagram that the materials in the core collection were not only similar to the distribution of the original germplasm, but also had a relatively comprehensive and uniform coverage, which represented the geometric distribution of the original germplasm, indicating that the genetic structure of the original germplasm was well maintained by the core collection and further confirming the representativeness of the selected 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> core collection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).
