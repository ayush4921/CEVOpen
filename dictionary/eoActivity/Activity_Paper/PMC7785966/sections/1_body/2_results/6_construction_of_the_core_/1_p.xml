<p>An LDSS sampling strategy was adopted to obtain seven preliminary core collections named 40CCC, 35CC, 30CC, 25CC, 20CC, 15CC, and 10CC. Each collection included 83, 73, 63, 52, 42, 31, and 21 accessions, accounting for 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10% of the original germplasm, respectively (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As the sampling ratio decreased, the number of alleles (
 <italic>Na</italic>) and the retention rates of the alleles (
 <italic>Ra</italic>) decreased gradually. 
 <italic>Na</italic> ranged from 7.41 (40CC) to 6.65 (10CC) in different collections. Neither 15CC nor 10CC reached 90% of the original germplasm for 
 <italic>Ra</italic>, and others varied from 90.20% (20CC) to 95.50% (40CC) of the original germplasm. The genetic parameters of the seven preliminary core collections were all higher than those estimated for the original germplasm. In particular, the genetic diversity estimates, including all genetic parameters investigated except 
 <italic>Ne</italic>, were higher in 20CC than the others, suggesting better representativeness by the 20CC set than the others (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
