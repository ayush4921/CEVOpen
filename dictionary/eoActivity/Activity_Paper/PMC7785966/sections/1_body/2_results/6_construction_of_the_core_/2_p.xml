<p>As the sampling ratio decreased, the average contents of the six coumarins increased gradually (1.81â€“2.46 mg/g), which may be the reason why individuals with lower total coumarin content were removed during the clustering process. However, when looking at the content of a single coumarin component, umbelliferone content was essentially unchanged, which may have been caused by the low content itself (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS13">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). According to the genetic data obtained here, 20CC had the richest genetic diversity among all of the preliminary core collections and retained the maximum genetic diversity of the original germplasm. The average total coumarin contents of 10CC reached the maximum value, followed by 15CC and 20CC. However, the retention rates (
 <italic>Ra</italic>) of 10CC and 15CC alleles did not reach 90%, which means that the alleles of the original germplasm were not effectively retained, and genetic diversity was not as rich as that of 20CC. In this study, we simultaneously focused on genetic diversity and the metabolic ingredient contents to select the best core collection. Not only the 20CC collection preserved the overall genetic diversity of the original germplasm to the greatest extent, but also the average content of total coumarins increased from 1.81 to 2.20 mg/g compared to the original germplasm. As a consequence, 20CC composed of 42 accessions was the first choice for the best core collection, in which approximately 50% of the germplasm came from the Langping location (
