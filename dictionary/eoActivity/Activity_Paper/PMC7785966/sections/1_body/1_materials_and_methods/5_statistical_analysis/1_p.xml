<p>POPGENE version 1.3.2 (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 1997</xref>) was used to calculate the genetic diversity parameters, including allele frequency, number of alleles (
 <italic>Na</italic>), effective number of alleles 
 <italic>(N</italic>e), observed heterozygosity (
 <italic>Ho</italic>), expected heterozygosity (
 <italic>He</italic>), Shannon’s information index (
 <italic>I</italic>), and Nei’ s gene diversity index (
 <italic>H</italic>). Polymorphism information content (
 <italic>PIC</italic>) was estimated using PIC Cale software (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rohlf, 2000</xref>) was used to perform the cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic method (UPGMA) based on similarity matrices calculated according to the simple matching coefficient. GenAlEx version 6.5 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Peakall and Smouse, 2012</xref>)was used to perform the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the Nei’s genetic distance. The population structure was determined using STUCTURE version 2.0 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pritchard et al., 2000</xref>) and further hierarchical analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out using GenAlEx.
