<p>For RNA-sequencing, oligo (dT) magnetic beads were used to enrich the eukaryotic mRNA. The first-strand of cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers and dNTPs, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H were then added to synthesize the second-strand, which was further purified using AMPure XP beads. cDNA libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencing platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States). To obtain high-quality RNA-Seq data, the raw sequencing reads were filtered by deleting the invalid reads with adaptor contaminations, reads containing polyA, reads with “N” bases (“N” means that the base information cannot be determined) at a ratio &gt; 5%, and reads with a mass ratio &lt; 5 and a base ratio &gt; 50%.</p>
