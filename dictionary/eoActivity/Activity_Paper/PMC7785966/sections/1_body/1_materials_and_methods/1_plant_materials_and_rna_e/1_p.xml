<p>A total of 208 wild 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples were collected from three different locations of Puling, Gaofeng, and Langping (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) in the Changyang region and its adjoining Wufeng country, Hubei Province. These counties have the most concentrated distribution of wild 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> in China. Four tissues, including the roots, stems, flowers, and leaves were selected from a representative 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> individual, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until the RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, at least 10 young leaves collected from each individual were dried in silica gel and ground into powder in liquid nitrogen to extract genomic DNA as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The roots collected from each plant were sampled and washed with ultrapure water and dried to the no-moisture state in an oven at 50°C. The dried root samples were pulverized into powder with an automatic sample rapid grinding instrument and passed through a 65-mesh sieve to determine the metabolic components.
