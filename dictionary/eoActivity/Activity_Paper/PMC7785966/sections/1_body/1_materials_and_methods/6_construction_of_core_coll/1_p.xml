<p>Previous studies have shown that the size of a core collection generally accounts for 5–30% of the original population samples (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) was used to identify a group with the smallest genetic distance, and delete the sample with the lowest coumarin content. The seven preliminary core collections with different sampling ratios accounted for 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10% of the original germplasm and were retained by repeated clustering. The retention degree of genetic diversity of these preliminary core collections was manually checked by determining their corresponding genetic diversity indices (

 <italic>Ne</italic>, 
 <italic>Ho</italic>, 
 <italic>He</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>, 
 <italic>I</italic>, and 
 <italic>PIC</italic>). The average content of each coumarin and the total coumarins in the seven preliminary core collections were also calculated using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 software (
