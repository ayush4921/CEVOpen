Further comparative analysis of genetic variation between the original germplasm and the core collection or the removed samples (The remainder of the original germplasm after removing the core collection) was also conducted. A PCoA analysis for the original and core germplasms to verify the sample distributions. The difference in coumarin contents between the core collection and original germplasm was assessed by comparing single coumarin and total coumarin contents using GraphPad Prism.
