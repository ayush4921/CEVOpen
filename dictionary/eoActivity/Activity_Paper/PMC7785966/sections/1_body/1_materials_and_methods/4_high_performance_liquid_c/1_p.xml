<p>A 0.5 g portion of plant tissue (root) powder was accurately weighed and ultrasound extracted with 20 ml of 50% methanol-dichloromethane solution (v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Extraction solvent was added, and the extract was shaken and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. Standards of umbelliferone (L/N: A04A6L1), 8-methoxypsoralen (L/N: P30J7M16998), bergapten (L/N: W30M9Z57633), columbianetin acetate (L/N: P08F9F54518), osthole (L/N: T08M8B30733), and columbianadin (L/N: P13J9F65515) were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and were dissolved in 50% methanol-dichloromethane to make stock solutions, which were mixed and diluted with methanol to prepare final standard solutions at a concentration of 100 μg.mL
