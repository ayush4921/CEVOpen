<p>Next, 2-chloro-6-nitro-3-formilquinoline (0.75 g) was dissolved in hot methanol (6 mL), added to the above solution containing sodium hydrogen sulfide, and shaken. The reaction mixture refluxed for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool and was then placed into ice water (20–40 mL) to filter the reduced compound, and it was then recrystallized from methanol. m.p.208–210 °C. Yield: 82%. Color: dark brown.</p>
