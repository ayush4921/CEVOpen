<p>Dissolve sodium sulfide (2 g) in water (5–6 mL) was added to NaHCO3 (0.7 g) in small portions and stirred. When the added NaHCO3had dissolved, methanol (5–6 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was cooled to below 20 °C. Filtering off of the precipitated sodium carbonate was performed with pump. The precipitate was then washed with a small amount of methanol. The filtrate was then used for further reactions.</p>
