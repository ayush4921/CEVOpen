<p>To the solution of p-nitro acetanilide (5 mmol) in dry DMF (15 mmol) at 0–5 °C, POCl3 (35 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred, and then the mixture was stirred at 80–90 °C for 16–19 h. The mixture was poured on to crushed ice, stirred for 5 min, and the resulting solid was filtered, washed well with water, and dried.
