<p>To the solution of 6-amino-2-chloro quinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1.5mmol) in dry DMF, fused sodium sulfide was added and stirred for 3–4 h at room temperature. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride and sodium acetate were further added with continued stirring for 4–5 h. On completion, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water and the crude product of 6-amino-3-hydroxyiminomethylquinoline-2(1
