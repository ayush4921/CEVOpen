<p>Now, for this monoacid derivative of PEG coupled to a 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (3a), it was necessary to activate the PEG by maleic anhydride. In the present study, the solution synthesis of a novel family of PEGylating reagent was presented, which contained a free -COOH terminus. Conditions were developed for the coupling of this novel PEGylating reagents to the -NH 
 <sub>2</sub> function of model quinoline to illustrate their general utility. Together, this study demonstrated that these PEGylating reagents were well-suited for conjugation peptide and protein containers, either free -COOH or -NH 
 <sub>2</sub> functions. These reagents might have wide utility in therapeutic expansion, as branched PEGylation has been observed to deliver more effective protection of proteins from proteolysis by protecting the protein surface approaching the macromolecules.
