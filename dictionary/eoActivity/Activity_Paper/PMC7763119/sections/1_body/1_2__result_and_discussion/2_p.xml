<p>The PEGylation chemistry successfully demonstrated at the amino group was situated at C-7 of the quinoline hybrids. To couple a PEG to a quinoline molecule, it is first necessary to activate the polymer by converting the hydroxyl terminus to some functional group proficient reacting with the functional group situated on quinoline molecule. Herein, it was opted to activate the PEG by turning it to its acid derivative and coupling it with an amino group of quinoline molecules. This PEGylation methodology involved the conjugation of quinoline onto hetero-bifunctional PEG derivatives that had -OH on one terminus and -COOH on the other for covalent attachment of the amino group. The free carboxyl group of compounds was used for conjugation through an amine connection. It was determined that this conjugation proceeded through the formation of amide linkage between the PEG chain and quinoline under mild reaction conditions.</p>
