<p>PEG 
 <sub>200(n)</sub> (5 mL, 0.028 moles, 200 g/mole) was dissolved in 20 mL of dry CH 
 <sub>2</sub> Cl 
 <sub>2</sub> . Added to this solution was tetrahydrofuran (THF) containing maleic anhydride (0.056 mol, 0.54 mg) and pyridine (0.056 mol, 0.46 mL). After stirring overnight at room temperature, the reaction was completed, as indicated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (methanol:ethyl acetate, 7:3) (no anhydride left and the detection of a single polar PEG compound). The monoacid derivative of the poly (ethylene glycol)200(n) was used without purification. The most useful for polypeptide modification is monoacid PEG, which has the general structure:
