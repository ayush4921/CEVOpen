<p>An extension of PEG-supported chemistry was linked in the arena of functionalized polymers as reagent supports. Prepared was novel PEG N-terminal quinoline substituted derivatives and it was shown that, when related to a heterogeneous commercially-existing counterpart, they held promising reaction kinetics equal to the Staudinger and Mitsunobu etherification reactions. They were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. The present study expanded on those preliminary investigations to explore the synergistic effects of such pharmacophores.</p>
