<p>PEG is the covalent link of nonpoisonous, hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) to dynamic pharmaceutical constituents [18]. The technology established from revolutionary work was conducted in the 1950s and 1960s on the coupling of polymers to protein. The amendment of a biopharmaceutical with polyethylene glycol increases its hydrodynamic area and reduces its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Other achievements included braked renal evacuation, enhanced stability in the direction of proteolysis, and increased solubility of the biopharmaceutical in aqueous solution [19]. The synthesis of macromolecules with different functional groups in 2 ends is a promising field of research. A lot of useful materials can be designed from the macromolecules. However, due to the difficulty of separation of the reacted mixture, significant achievements have not yet been made. Pozzo et al. reported that some monofunctional derivatives of PEG could be prepared and separated using excess PEG, but the molecular weight of the monosubstituted PEGs was no more than 1000. It was evident that the higher the molecular weight of the starting PEG, the more difficult it was for the isolation of monosubstituted PEG from the reacted mixture. This is because there was no sharp difference between monosubstituted, disubstituted, and raw PEGs in the chemical and physical properties [20–22].Heterocyclic mixes have increased gigantic significance as a result of their low reverberation vitality and solid hydrogen‐bonding capacities [23]. A recent investigation reported the fruitful synthesis of new heterocyclic-like ester and amide under water as a solvent and the surface of silica-coated CoFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles for the synthesis of 3-pyrrolin-2-ones [24], as well as for the preparation of 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicotinonitrile under microwave irradiation [25].</p>
