<p>The data evident in Table 3 led to another noteworthy deduction, that the molecules with unsaturated centers at C-3 position exhibited good to moderate anticancer activity against the cancer cell lines. In contrast, the quinoline scaffold that amalgamated with the fused pyrazole and pyrimidine ring structures showed excellent anticancer activity against the SW620, MD468, and MD468-2 colon cancer cell lines. However, the imine derivatives of the PEGylated quinoline did not display significant activity. These annotations proposed that C-2 and C-3 played a vital role in the structure-activity relationship of compounds 4aâ€“4i.Compounds 4a and 4i were found to be most potent amongst the synthesized compounds against the microbial strains of E. Coli. The rest of these compounds showed moderate to potent activities against S. Aureus. All of the compounds screened against S. Aureus showed moderate to potent activities, confirming the fact that the substituted quinoline, with an adjacent ring C like the cyano group and pyrazole, played a vital role in enhancing the efficacy of the compounds, thus modulating the antibacterial activity.</p>
