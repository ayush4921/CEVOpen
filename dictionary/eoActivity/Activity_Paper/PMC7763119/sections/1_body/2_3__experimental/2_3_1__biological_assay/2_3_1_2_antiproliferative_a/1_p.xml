<p>All 24 compounds were tested via AB assay (in the case of leukemia cells) for their antiproliferative activity in vitro against 2 cancer cell lines: SW620, MD468, and MD468-2 were all colon cancer cell lines obtained from the ATCC. MD468 is a mismatched repair-deficient cell line, and MD468-2 has a p53 mutation. The results of the cytotoxic activity in vitro were expressed as an ID50 (nM/mL), as stated above. Camptothecin (10nM), Paclitaxel (10 nM), Doxorubicin (250 nM), and Oxaliplatin (2000 nM) were applied as referential cytotoxic agents (positive test controls). A value of less than 10 nM/mL was considered as an antiproliferative activity criterion for synthetic compounds. The results of the cytotoxicity studies are summarized in Table 3.</p>
