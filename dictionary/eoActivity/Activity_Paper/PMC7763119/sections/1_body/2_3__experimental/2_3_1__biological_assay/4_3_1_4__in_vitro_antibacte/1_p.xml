<p>All of the newly synthesized compounds were screenedin vitrofor their antimicrobial activity and antifungal activity against a variety of bacterial and fungal strains, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> (gram +ve), 
 <italic>Escherichia Coli</italic> (gram –ve), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</italic> (Gram –ve), and 
 <italic>Candida Albicans</italic> using the disc diffusion method. The nutrient agar broth was prepared by aseptic inoculation with 0.5 mL of 24-h-old subcultures of 
 <italic>S. Aureus</italic> , 
 <italic>E. Coli</italic> , and 
 <italic>C. Albicans</italic> in separate flasks at 40–50 °C and mixing well by gentle shaking.
