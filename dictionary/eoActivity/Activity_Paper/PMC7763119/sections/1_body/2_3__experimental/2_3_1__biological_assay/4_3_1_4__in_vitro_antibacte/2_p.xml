<p>About 25 mL of the contents of the flask were poured and evenly spread in a Petri dish (13 cm in diameter) and allowed to set for 2h. Each test compound (20 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was used as a sample solution. A concentrated (100 µg/mL) solution was prepared using the dilution method. The sample size for all of the compounds was fixed as 10 µL.</p>
