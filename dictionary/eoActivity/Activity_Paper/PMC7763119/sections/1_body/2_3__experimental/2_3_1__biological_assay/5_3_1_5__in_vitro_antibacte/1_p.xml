<p>The newly synthesized compounds (3a–3i and 4a–4i) were tested for theirin vitro antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria S.Aureus, gram-negative bacteria E.coli and P. Aeruginosa, and the fungus C. Albicans. For all of the compounds, along with the standards for the bacteria, doxycycline, ampicillin, and fungi, fluconazole was used at a concentration of 100 µg/mL in DMSO as the solvent control and nutrient agar was used as the culture method [26–29]. After 24h of incubation at 37 °C, the zones of inhibition were measured in mm.</p>
