<p>Protocol: Standard AB assay protocol for cell viability assay was used. Confluently-grown cells were trypsinzed, and around 10,000 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. The next day, the medium was replaced with medium containing the appropriate concentration of the drug. The maximum concentration of each drug was 400µg/mL, and a one-quarter dilution was used for each drug. The cells were treated for 48 h and 2µL of AB was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence intensity was read with a plate reader. From the graph, the IC50 value was calculated. SW620, MD468, and MD468-2 were all colon cancer cell lines obtained from the ATCC. MD468 is a mismatched repair-deficient cell line, and MD468-2 has a p53 mutation. The effects of all of the new compounds on colon cancer cell lines SW620, MD468, and MD468-2, were observed and the results are depicted in Figures 1and 2. The growth inhibition percentages were compared with those of standard drugs Camptothecin, Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, and Oxaliplatin (Table 3, Figures 1 and 2). For the rows, alcohol was added to generate killed cells.</p>
