<p>All of the recorded melting points were taken in open capillary tubes and were uncorrected. The IR spectra were recorded with a FTIR PerkinElmer Rx-I instrument (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using Nujol.1HNMR spectra were recorded on 400 MHz Bruker AC-300 F instrument (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard and deuterated chloroform as the solvent, and the mass spectra were recorded on a VG.70 S instrument at SAIF Chandigarh. The TLC technique was used to check the purity of the compound using silica gel G.</p>
