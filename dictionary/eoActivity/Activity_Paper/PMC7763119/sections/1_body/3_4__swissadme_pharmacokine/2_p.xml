<p>The pink location inside the hexagon speaks to the perfect range for each property (lipophilicity: XLOGP3 somewhere in the array of −0.7 and +5.0, size: extremity: topological polar surface area (TPSA) somewhere in the field of 20 and 130 Å2, MW somewhere in the scope of 150 g/mol and 500g/mol, solubility: log S not higher than 6, adaptability: close to 9 rotatable bonds, and saturation: some portion of carbons in the sp3 hybridization at any rate 0.25). The recommended run for the compound as bioavailable medication is portrayed in Table 5.</p>
