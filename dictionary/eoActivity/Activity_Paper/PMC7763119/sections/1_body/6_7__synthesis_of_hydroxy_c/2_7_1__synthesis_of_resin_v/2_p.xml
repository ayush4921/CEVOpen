<p>The resin was dried in a vacuum for IR, H1NMR, C13NMR, and mass spectral analysis. At this stage, the resin did not stick to the glass wall anymore. The IR spectrum of the resin showed the characteristic absorption band of the PEG ether backbone (1120 cm–1) and absorption bands at 1760 and 1685 cm–1 for the ester and amid bond, respectively (C=O).</p>
