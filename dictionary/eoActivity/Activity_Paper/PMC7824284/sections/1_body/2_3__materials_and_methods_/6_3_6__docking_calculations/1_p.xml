<p>Eight compounds which were identified as major components, namely, cimifugin 
 <bold>(36)</bold>, europine 
 <bold>(4)</bold>, heliotrine 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, 11-hydroperoxy-12, 13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid (
 <bold>43</bold>), lithospermic acid 
 <bold>(42)</bold>, salvianolic acid A 
 <bold>(41)</bold>, supinine (
 <bold>3</bold>), and 5, 8, 12-trihydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid (
 <bold>44</bold>), were selected for the docking study. The target enzymes of these compounds were α-amylase, AChE, BChE, α-glucosidase, and tyrosinase enzymes. The initial 3D structures of these inhibitors were downloaded from the ZINC database [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The structures were prepared for the docking calculations through an optimization process using the semi-empirical AM1 method [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and saved in the format of mol2 files. The crystal structures of the five enzymes were downloaded from RCSB PDB with the following pdb codes: 4EY6 for the AChE enzyme in complex with galantamine; 1P0P for BChE in complex with butyrylthiocholine; 5I38 for tyrosinase with kojic acid; and 7TAA and 3W37, which were used to represent the α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes with the acarbose inhibitor, respectively. Water molecules and all the co-crystalized molecules were removed from the protein structure. Autodock 4 (Molinspiration Database) was used to calculate the binding affinity of the eight compounds with the active site of the enzymes where Kollman united atom charges were used to neutralize the protein which was immersed in a grid box of 60 × 60 × 60 dimensions with 0.375 Å distance. A total of 250 conformations were scanned for each inhibitor using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm, and the interactions were analyzed using Discovery studio 5.0 visualizer.
