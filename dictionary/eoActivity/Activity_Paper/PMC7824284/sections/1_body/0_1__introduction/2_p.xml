 <italic>Heliotropium,</italic> comprising ~250–300 species, is among the largest genera of the plant family Boraginaceae. They are distributed throughout the world; however, only about 23 species are growing in various regions of Pakistan [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The word “heliotrope” has been specified for plants that have the property of turning their leaves in the direction of the sun [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>Heliotropium</italic> is famous for its medicinal use in various countries such as Malaysia, Mauritius, and Tanzania. For example, in Malaysia, 
 <italic>H. indicum</italic> paste has been used against pyoderma, putrefaction, and ringworm infection [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. strigosum</italic> juice is effective for eye sores and against snake bites, while its powdered form has been reported as an effective treatment in rheumatic arthritis. Furthermore, laxative, diuretic, blood cleanser, and jaundice treatment has been achieved through a decoction of 
 <italic>H. strigosum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Leaf juice of 
 <italic>H. dasycarpum</italic> has useful coagulating properties to stop wound bleeding and to treat throat infection in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Mauritius, leaves of 
 <italic>H. indicum</italic> are used against urinary tract infections, rheumatism, and small wounds [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This plant has been documented to contain the important anticancer compound indicine-
 <italic>N</italic>-oxide, which shows significant activity against P388 leukemia. It is also active against B16 melanoma, and the aqueous, ethanol, and acidic extracts of the plant are reported as antifungal [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. crispium</italic>, growing in the Lal-suhanra forest of the Punjab in Pakistan, is commonly known as Kharsan. Its powdered dry extract, along with candy and water, is used as a cooling agent. It is used for increasing the lactation of animals [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Silver nanoparticles of aqueous plant extract have shown excellent potential in different drug resistance bacteria [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The extensive collection of medicinal plants from this genus and their potential uses in the local medicinal system prompt us to investigate 
 <italic>H. crispium</italic> for its detailed biological activity. Chemical profiling of the methanolic extract was done to establish a possible link between the bioactive contents and their biological activity. Various assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelation assays) were performed to dig out the antioxidant potential of the extract. In addition, the inhibitory potential of the extract against the key enzymes responsible for world-alarming diseases like neurodegenerative disorder (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)), diabetes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase), and skin problems (tyrosinase) were estimated. Moreover, in silico docking studies were also performed.
