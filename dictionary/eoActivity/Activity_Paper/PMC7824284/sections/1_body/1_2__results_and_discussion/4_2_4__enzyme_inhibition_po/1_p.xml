<p>Interest is increasing in the use of natural enzyme inhibitors to combat global health problems including Alzheimer’s disease, Diabetes mellitus, hyperpigmentation, and hypertension. The prevalence of these diseases is critically increasing worldwide, and thus, effective strategies are required to control these diseases. With this in mind, the discovery of natural and safe enzyme inhibitors is one of the most investigated subjects in science [

 <italic>H. strigosum</italic> showed an amylase inhibition potential with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 9.97 + 0.01 μg/mL. Heliotropamide, a new alkaloid with a novel oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamide central moiety, has been isolated as the major product of the dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>H. ovalifolium</italic> aerial parts, which showed inhibitory potential toward acetylcholinesterase [

 <italic>H. digynum</italic> was tested against a glucosidase enzyme at 25 ppm and showed a weak percentage inhibition [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present study, we tested the enzyme inhibitory effects of the 
 <italic>H. crispum</italic> extract against cholinesterases, tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase enzymes. The results are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The extract of 
 <italic>H. crispum</italic> possesses the highest activity against AChE (3.80 mg GALAE/g extract) and BChE (3.44 mg GALAE/g extract), while in the α-glucosidase assay, it showed a 1.86 mmol ACAE/g extract inhibitory activity; however, in the α-amylase inhibition assay, the extract was found comparatively less active, with a value of 0.57 mmol ACAE/g extract. The same extract showed the promising tyrosinase inhibition with a 129.65 mg KAE/g extract inhibition potential.
