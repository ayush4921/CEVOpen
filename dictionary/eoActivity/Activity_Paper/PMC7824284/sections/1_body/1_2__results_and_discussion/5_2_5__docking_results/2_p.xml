<p>In order to investigate the interactions of the highest affinity compounds, lithospermic acid (
 <bold>42</bold>) and salvianolic acid A (
 <bold>41</bold>) were further studied; the affinity of these compounds against the studied enzymes, along with their interactions with the active site of the corresponding enzymes, are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Hydrogen bonds and the π–π interactions may represent the strongest non-bonded interactions. Although the highlighted two compounds have shown a similar binding affinity, they may interact with similar or different amino acids at the active site of the enzyme. For example, lithospermic acid (
 <bold>42</bold>) was involved with Asn298, Asp297, Arg204, Leu232, and Gly230 of the α-amylase enzyme, while in the case of salvianolic acid A (
 <bold>41</bold>), the formed hydrogen bonds are with Tyr155, Asp206, Asp340, Glu35, and Tyr79 amino acids. This difference is attributed to the difference in the docked conformations of these compounds, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00053-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The same two compounds have shown different behavior in the case of AChE, in which they have formed hydrogen bonds with the same amino acids, such as Phe295, Phe383, Tyr124, and Ser293. In the case of BChE, α-glucosidase, and tyrosinase enzymes, these two compounds have interacted with different amino acids. Similarly, the π–π interactions of the selected compounds did not follow a specific trend. For example, both compounds formed a π–π interaction with the Phe601 and Pro201 of the active site of α-glucosidase and tyrosinase enzymes, respectively, and with different amino acids of the rest of the enzymes.
