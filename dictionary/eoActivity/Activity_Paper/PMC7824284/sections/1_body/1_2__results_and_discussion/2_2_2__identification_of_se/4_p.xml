<p>Among other metabolites, nine secondary metabolites that were tentatively identified from the negative ionization mode of screening were from pyruvic acid derivatives such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxypyruvic acid (
 <bold>25</bold>) and nonic acid (
 <bold>26</bold>). Further coumaric acid derivatives include compounds isobergaptene (
 <bold>27)</bold>, 2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (
 <bold>28</bold>), 3-methoxymandelic acid-4-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate (
 <bold>29</bold>), 
 <italic>p</italic>-salicylic acid (
 <bold>30</bold>), cis-ferulic acid [arabinosyl-(1→3)-[glucosyl-(1→6)]-glucosyl] ester (
 <bold>31</bold>), and ferulic acid (
 <bold>32</bold>). These important phenolic compounds are known for various potent antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The tentatively identified polyphenolic compounds included 2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-6-methyl-5-(sulfooxy) (
 <bold>33</bold>), 1-hexanol arabinosylglucoside (
 <bold>34</bold>), (S)-chiral alcohol, and (3S)-4-(3-acetyl-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetra hydronaphthalen-2-yl)-3-hydroxy butanoic acid (
 <bold>35</bold>). Flavonoids which were identified included cimifugin (
 <bold>36</bold>), rivenprost (
 <bold>37</bold>), eupatin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate (
 <bold>38</bold>), tamadone (
 <bold>39</bold>), wightin (
 <bold>40</bold>), salvianolic acid A (
 <bold>41</bold>), and lithospermic acid (
 <bold>42</bold>). In addition, eight long-chain fatty acids were also tentatively identified through the negative ionization mode of UHPLC-MS analysis, which included 11-hydroperoxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid (
 <bold>43</bold>), 5,8,12-trihydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid (
 <bold>44</bold>), 9,16-dihydroxy-palmitic acid (
 <bold>45</bold>), 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxystearate (
 <bold>46</bold>), α-9(10)-EpODE (
 <bold>47)</bold>, 12-oxo-10Z-octadecenoic acid (
 <bold>48</bold>), 9Z,12Z,15E-octadecatrienoic acid (
 <bold>49</bold>), and 6E,9E-octadecadienoic acid (
 <bold>50</bold>).
