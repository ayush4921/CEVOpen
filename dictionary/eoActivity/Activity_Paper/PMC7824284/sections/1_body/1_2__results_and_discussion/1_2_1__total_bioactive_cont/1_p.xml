<p>Recently, researchers have shown a renewed interest in the investigation of the bioactivities of phenolics, especially in flavonoids from higher plants, due to there being fewer or no side effects resulting from their use and that they can be taken as major dietary constituents [

 <italic>H. crispum</italic> showed high total phenolic contents (24.84 mg GAE/g extract) compared to the flavonoid contents (19.73 mg GAE/g extract), as presented in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In a published report on the outcome of a spectrophotometric assay of 
 <italic>H. strigosum</italic>, the methanol extract showed a higher amount of total phenolic contents than the aqueous, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fractions [

 <italic>H. indicum</italic> showed a higher amount of phenolic contents in a hydro-alcoholic crude extract compared with the methanolic, ethyl acetate, and hexane fractions [
