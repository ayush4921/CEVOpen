As shown, the lowest concentration of sodium (98 mEq/L) was observed on the seventh day for 200 mg/kg and the control group had the highest sodium concentration (130 mEq/L) on day seven (
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The lowest concentration of potassium (3.03 mEq/L) was related to the second and third day for 200 mg/kg and the control group had the highest potassium concentration (10.5 mEq/L) on the second day (
 <xref rid="T8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The lowest concentration of urine osmolality (368 mOsm/kg) was found on the first day for PO 200 (mg/kg) and the control group had the highest osmolality concentration (567.33 mOsm/kg) on the seventh day (
 <xref rid="T9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>).
