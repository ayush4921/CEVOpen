<p>Accordingly, future studies must investigate pharmacological activities related to the traditional uses of PO, especially regarding its effect on body resistance to thirst. Moreover, clinical examinations should be run to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and suitable dosage of PO in order to develop safe and efficient dosage forms of this plant. Finally, it is recommended to study the beneficial effects of this plant on diseases that lead to hypokalemia or blood potassium depletion. Although our findings may not be directly applicable to all kinds of species, they represent a basic framework for using PO and other species to examine the thirst-quenching condition. </p>
