<p>Wounds infected by pathogenic bacteria such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are believed to be serious challenges for regarding their management and treatment (Manzuoerh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT1125" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Different agents are employed for the treatment of wounds. Active compounds of the essential oils can have pivotal roles in their treatment. The findings indicated that thymol (52.90%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9.10), γ-terpinene (8.10%) and carvacrol (6.80%) were the major constituents in the essential oil. Similar to our results, previous studies demonstrated that the major compounds of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> essential oil were thymol, carvacrol and p-cymene (Aida et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), thymol, c-terpinene, p-cymene, and carvacrol (Saei-Dehkordi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), carvacrol (Misaghi and Basti 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), thymol, carvacrol, and p-cymene (Sharififar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The results showed that ZMEO accelerated wound healing compared to the NCG group and synthetic agent of mupirocin. Herein, the results are described based on the mechanisms and active compounds, step-by-step.
