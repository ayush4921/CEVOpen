<p>Our findings implied that the topical application of ZMEO improved the proliferative phase. The results showed that the genes expression of VEGF, FGF-2 and IGF-1 increased in ZMEO groups. IGF-1 increases the transport of glucose during the wound healing process and improves the proliferative phase (Daemi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>). VEGF induces angiogenesis and stimulates cell migration and proliferation (Norton &amp; Popel

 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Gharaboghaz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). FGF-2, a protein that participates in the wound healing process (Souto et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), together with other growth factors, such as VEGF, are reported to increase the angiogenesis and indirectly support the cellular nutrient, oxygen and energy supplements (Harding et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). So far, studies have not investigated the effect of ZMEO on genes expression of VEGF, FGF-2 and IGF-1. It means that VEGF improves angiogenesis, and vessel number was significantly higher in ZMEO groups. VEGF improved angiogenesis and number of vessels. Other genes involved were TGF-β, and IL-10 whose expressions increased on day 7. IL-10 is a factor that reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, but TGF-β leads the phase towards the proliferative phase by improving the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts, collagen production, and wound contraction (Khezri et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Seemingly, both genes are of greatly important roles in decreasing the inflammation and passing to the proliferative phase. The IHC results indicated improved collagen deposition. The biosynthesis of collagen during the proliferation stage has pivotal roles in dermal maturation in which some factors are involved (Yakaew et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). The results showed that the topical application of ZMEO increased fibroblast, which is due to its effect on IGF-1. It was reported that IGF-1 increases fibroblast cells in

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Proliferative effect of ZMEO is partly owing to its antioxidant activity. The topical application of ZMEO improved antioxidant activity. Previous studies have reported antioxidant activity of

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Karimian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kavoosi and Teixeira da Silva 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Oxidative stress in the wound area increases the damage of proteins, nucleotides and lipid levels (Cano Sanchez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Farahpour et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Gharaboghaz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and decreases the antioxidant activity. This fact is associated with increased changes in the antioxidant profile, which are contributed to the increase in the levels of MDA content (Sharma et al.
