 <p>Hybridization of reported weakly active antiproliferative hit 5-amino-4-pyrimidinol derivative with 2-anilino-4-phenoxypyrimidines suggests a series of 2,5-diamino-4-pyrimidinol derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents. Few compounds belonging to the proposed series were reported as CSF1R/DAPK1 inhibitors as anti-tauopathies. However, the correlation between CSF1R/DAPK1 signalling pathways and cancer progression provides motives to reprofile them against cancer therapy. The compounds were synthesised, characterized, and evaluated against M-NFS-60 cells and a kinase panel which bolstered predictions of their antiproliferative activity and suggested the involvement of diverse molecular targets. Compound 
  <bold>6e</bold>, the most potent in the series, showed prominent broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity inhibiting the growth of hematological, NSCLC, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast cancers by 84.1, 52.79, 72.15, 66.34, 66.48, 51.55, 55.95, 61.85, and 60.87%, respectively. Additionally, it elicited an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 1.97 µM against M-NFS-60 cells and good GIT absorption with P
  <sub>e</sub> value of 19.0 ± 1.1 × 10
  <sup>−6 </sup>cm/s (PAMPA-GIT). Molecular docking study for 
  <bold>6e</bold> with CSF1R and DAPK1 was done to help to understand the binding mode with both kinases. Collectively, compound 
  <bold>6e</bold> could be a potential lead compound for further development of anticancer therapies.
