<p>All manipulations and reactions were performed using standard Schlenk techniques. The starting materials, reagents, and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with Merk silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> pre-coated glass sheets. Column chromatography was performed on Biotage Isolera One™ flash chromatography system and the eluting solvents are noted as a mixed solvent with given volume-to-volume ratios or as a percentage. Uncorrected melting points were measured using Optimelt Automated Melting Point System (Stanford Research Systems). 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR were measured on a 400 MHz Bruker Avance or a 500 MHz Agilent 500 NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts and coupling constants are presented in parts per million (ppm) relative to Me
 <sub>4</sub>Si and hertz (Hz), respectively, and the following abbreviations are used: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, a doublet of doublets; t, triplet; m, multiplet. High-resolution mass spectra were performed on Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7µ−Q-TOF SYNAPT G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometry.
