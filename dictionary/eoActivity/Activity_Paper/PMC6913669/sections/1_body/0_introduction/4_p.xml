<p>Death-Associated Protein Kinase-1 (DAPK1), which controls several functions of the human cell, is well-known for its role in apoptosis, autophagy, and suppressing tumour growth

 </xref>. Interestingly, DAPK1 Knockdown or inhibition significantly suppressed the growth of the HCC1143, HCC1937, HCC1954 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines by 80–90% suggesting the development of DAPK1 inhibitors to target TNBC

 </xref>. Besides, ZIP kinase (DAPK3) is activated by DAPK1, which makes DAPK1 inhibitors potential downregulators of ZIP kinase activity

  <sup>27</sup>
 </xref>. As the activity of the downstream ZIP kinase is critically required in several cancers including prostate, colon and lung cancers, inhibitors of the upstream DAPK1 activity could be beneficial for the treatment of multiple types of cancer
