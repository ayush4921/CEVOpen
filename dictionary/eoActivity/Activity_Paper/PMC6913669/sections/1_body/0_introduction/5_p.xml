<p>On the other hand, CSF1R kinase and/or its ligands are overexpressed in several human cancers including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers in addition to controlling the proliferation and survival of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)
