<p>The early assessment of important parameters influencing pharmacokinetics is important to avoid wasting precious resources on a lead compound with unfavourable properties, which might cause hurdles in the later development of the clinical candidate(s). Thus, the GIT permeability of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was evaluated 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> employing PAMPA assay. The measured good effective permeability (P
 <sub>e</sub>) of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> predicted good absorption after oral administration. The conducted molecular docking study of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> provided insights into the binding modes with CSF1R and DAPK1 and were in conform with the level of CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibitory activity this class of compounds showed. Together, the results present compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> as a promising broad-spectrum antiproliferative lead compound with predicted good GIT permeability that deserves further exploration of its molecular targets and further assessment of its potentiality as a novel polypharmacological anticancer agent.
