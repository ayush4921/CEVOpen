<p>Except for SNB-75 brain cancer whose growth was inhibited by 25.17%, the hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was ineffective against other brain cancers as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>. Surprisingly, 
 <bold>6h</bold>, which possesses 4-trifluoromethyl substituent on the phenoxy moiety, picolinamide moiety, and 6-morpholinopyridin-3-ylamino at 2-position of pyrimidine, showed a dramatic lethal activity against SF-539 with 153.05% growth inhibition value. Intriguingly, its activity against other brain cancers was comparatively negligible which gives the compound a high selectivity to the SF-539 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5)</xref>. Replacement of only picolinamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> by 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety resulted in encouraging activities of compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> as it inhibited the growth of three brain cancer cell lines namely SNB-75, SF-539, and SNB-19 by 114.54, 66.02, and 55.94%, respectively. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>, compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold>â€“
 <bold>d</bold> and 
 <bold>6f</bold> were significantly impotent as the growth inhibition was less than 20% against most of the tested six brain cancer cell lines. However, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was comparatively highly active inhibiting all tested brain cancers by more than 50% despite the minor structural difference from compound 
 <bold>6d</bold>, which might imply the presence of a possible activity cliff by this simple change. To exemplify, 
 <bold>6e</bold> inhibited the growth of SF-295 and SF-539 cell lines by nearly 80%, SNB-75, and U251 cell lines by around 65%, SNB-19 by around 60% and finally SF-268 by around 55%. These results suggest compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold>, 
 <bold>6g</bold>, and 
 <bold>6h</bold> as a leading compound for the development of potential CNS tumour therapies.
