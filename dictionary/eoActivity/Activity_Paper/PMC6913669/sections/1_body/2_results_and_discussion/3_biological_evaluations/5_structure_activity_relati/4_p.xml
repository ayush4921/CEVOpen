<p>In addition, compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> is structurally different from compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> by lacking the cyclic amine moieties, as well as the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic pyridine ring which resulted in relatively lower activities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. The influence of the 4-methoxy substituent on the phenoxy moiety might be deduced from the lower activity of compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> possessing 4-trifluoromethyl substituent relative to compound 
 <bold>6d</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. The positive influence of the 3,5-dimethoxy substitution pattern on the benzamide moiety might be concluded from comparing the activities of 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold> in which 
 <bold>6b</bold> possesses 3-methoxy substituent instead. Additionally, this influence can be understood by comparing compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> with 
 <bold>6h</bold> in which 
 <bold>6h</bold> possesses 2-pyridineamide as a replacement to the benzamide moiety (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. However, comparing the activities of compound 
 <bold>6c</bold>, possessing 3-trifluoromethyl with 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold>, possessing 3,5-dimethoxy and 3-methoxy substituents, respectively might indicate an activity tolerance to the incorporation of this type of substituents. It was noticed that the activities of compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6c</bold>, 
 <bold>6d</bold>, 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6f</bold> bearing 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety were more prominent against hematological cancer rather than other cancer types as shown from data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>.
