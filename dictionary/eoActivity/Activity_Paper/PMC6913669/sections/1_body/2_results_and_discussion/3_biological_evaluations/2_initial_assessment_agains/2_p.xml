<p>To explore whether this series triggers antiproliferative activity, selected compounds of the general skeleton 
 <bold>6</bold> were initially assessed using M-NFS-60 mouse myelogenous leukaemia cells, which is a virus-induced lymphoblastoid murine cancer cell that overexpresses CSF1R, prior to reprofiling against human cancer cells. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the 10 µM dose of compounds 
 <bold>6a–e</bold> triggered significantly high growth inhibition of the M-NFS-60 cells. Compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold> showed the highest measured growth inhibition values by 99.2 and 92.3% while compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> was less effective showing 52.6% growth inhibition. Interestingly, attempts to relate the previously known kinase inhibition data of compounds 
 <bold>6a–h</bold> revealed that the best growth inhibitor, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold>, possessed less CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibitory activities relative to the second most active M-NFS-60 growth inhibitor compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In fact, 
 <bold>6d</bold> is 2.5-folds less potent than 
 <bold>6e</bold> as an M-NFS-60 growth inhibitor, even though compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> had a similar CSF1R/DAPK1 inhibition profile. In addition, compound 
 <bold>6b</bold>, despite the high activity as a DAPK1 inhibitor, possessed a similar CSF1R inhibitory activity to compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> that was the least active as M-NFS-60 growth inhibitor (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results might suggest a partial contribution of CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibition to the overall elicited activity while other unknown targets might be involved in mediating the antiproliferative activities of these compounds. The results of this initial antiproliferative assay, though conducted employing non-human cancer cell, raised hopes that this class of compounds might possess potential anticancer activities. Therefore, we were encouraged to investigate the underlying molecular targets and to profile the series against human cancers.
