<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, the hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was ineffective against colon cancers, however compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed significant, yet humble growth inhibition of HCT-116 cancer cells by 38.08%, albeit ineffective against other colon cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4)</xref>. Interestingly, replacement of picolinamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> by 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety to afford compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> resulted in activity enhancement against all cells, especially HCT-116 cell line which was inhibited by a high value of 83.91%, and HT29 cell line which was inhibited by 53.18%. Even though compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> was derived from compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> by replacing the 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety by 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety and the pyridinylamino moiety by 4-fluoroanilino moiety, it was less active against HCT-116 cells. Despite that, 
 <bold>6f</bold> maintained the same growth inhibition of 
 <bold>6g</bold> against HT29 cells and elicited relatively higher growth inhibition values against most of the other tested colon cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4)</xref>. Introducing the polar morpholino group to 
 <bold>6f</bold> by replacing its fluoro atom resulted in compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> which was less active compared to 
 <bold>6f</bold> against six of the tested colon cancer cell lines. Further activity loss was found for compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> which differs from 
 <bold>6a</bold> by having 3-methoxy group instead of the 3,5-dimethoxy groups on the benzamide moiety. Unlike the activity trend observed in the majority of tested NSCLC cell lines, the increase in activity was more significant in the case of compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> relative to 
 <bold>6b</bold>. For instance, HT29 cells were significantly inhibited by 57.77% while the growth inhibition values of HCT-15 and KM12 cells were around 40% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4)</xref>. In the case of 
 <bold>6d</bold>, the positive change in activity was not high, despite that the growth inhibitory activity of HCT-15 cells approached 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4)</xref>. Interestingly, a highly active compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was obtained by a minor structure modification of compound 
 <bold>6d</bold>. To illustrate, 
 <bold>6e</bold> triggered almost 80% growth inhibition against four colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HCT-15, HT29 and KM12; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>) and around 70% growth inhibition against one colon cancer cell line (SW-620) while only HCC-2998 cell showed relatively low inhibition near 35% (it was not tested against COLO 205).
