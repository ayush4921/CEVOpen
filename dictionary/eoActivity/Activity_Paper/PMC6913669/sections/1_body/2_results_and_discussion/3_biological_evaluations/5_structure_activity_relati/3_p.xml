<p>The trade of carbon with a nitrogen atom at the 3-position of the 2-anilino moiety of the pyrimidine core was intended to allow for possible hydrogen bonding with the host molecule. This modification resulted in a slight improvement in the overall average antiproliferative activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>), yet lead to a loss of the potency over the A498 renal cancer cell line. This is exemplified by comparing the activities of 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold>. In fact, the dissymmetry of the pyridine ring compared with the phenyl ring could cause a change in the relative geometry of the morpholino group; it did not have a drastic effect on the activity as noticed with the 
 <bold>6d</bold>-to-
 <bold>6e</bold> structural change.
