<p>The results revealed that the starting hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> triggered low inhibition of breast cancers that did not exceed 10.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10)</xref>. In contrast, compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6g</bold> were active eliciting excellent to good growth inhibition. For example, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> excellently inhibited the growth of the estrogen-dependent MCF7 cells by 90.2% as well as the TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells by 76.4%. It also triggered 55.5% growth inhibition of HS 578 T cells and 43.5% inhibition of BT-549 cells. Compound 
 <bold>6g</bold>, which possesses 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy and morpholino moieties instead of the 4-methoxyphenoxy and piperidino moieties of the compound 
 <bold>6e</bold>, was more active against HS 578 T cells eliciting 69.6% growth inhibition and also inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells by 56.0%. It is noteworthy that the excision of the cyclic amine piperidine moiety of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> to afford compound 
 <bold>6f</bold>, which bears fluorine atom instead, resulted in diminished activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10)</xref>. The activities of other compounds (
 <bold>6a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> and 
 <bold>6h</bold>) were lower relative to compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6g</bold>. These data suggest that among the tested compounds, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> might be advanced as a lead compound for further development of breast cancer therapies.
