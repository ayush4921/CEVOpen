<p>As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>, the hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> did not inhibit the growth of three ovarian cancer cell lines while the highest-recorded inhibition against other ovarian cancer cells was 7.04%. Profiling compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>, 
 <bold>6f</bold>, and 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed that these compounds elicited more significant growth inhibition relative to the starting hit compound albeit weak. To clarify, the maximum inhibition values for compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> were around 18.7–16.2% against OVCAR-4, NCI/ADR-RES, OVCAR-3 and IGROV1 cells; for compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> was 28.5% against IGROV1; for compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> were 21.5–20.3 against OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES; for compound 
 <bold>6d</bold> were 24.0–20.0% against NCI/ADR-RES, OVCAR-8, OVCAR-4 and IGROV1; for compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> were 29.5–18.6% against OVCAR-3, NCI/ADR-RES, SK-OV-3, OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-5; and for compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> were 19.7–13.4% against OVCAR-4, OVCAR-3, NCI/ADR-RES, and OVCAR-8. Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6g</bold> elicited excellent growth inhibition against several ovarian cancer cell lines. The structural differences between the two compounds are the presence of 4-methoxy substituent on the phenoxy moiety and the piperidino moiety in compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> instead of the 4-trifluoromethyl and the morpholino moiety, respectively in compound 
 <bold>6g</bold>. Thus, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> produced excellent inhibition of the growth of OVCAR-3 and NCI/ADR-RES cells by 93.3 and 73.9%, respectively, but the growth of OVCAR-4, OVCAR-8, and IGROV1 was less inhibited showing 43.3–41.7%. Interestingly, this inhibition profile was reversed in compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> as it produced excellent inhibition of the growth of OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-8 by 91.2 and 60.3%, respectively, but the growth of OVCAR-3 and NCI/ADR-RES was less inhibited showing 39.9–37.2%.
