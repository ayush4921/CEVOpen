<p>The kinase panel consisted of 14 different kinases correlated with cancer and representing diverse kinase families and groups. The employed kinase panel included EGFR as the starting hit compound was found as an EGFR inhibitor. In contrast to hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold>, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was unable to inhibit EGFR as shown by the results in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In addition, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> did not inhibit the kinase reaction of any of AXL, c-MER, CDK2/cyclin A, FLT1/VEGFR1, JAK3, KDR/VEGFR2, PDGFRa, PDGFRb, RET, TYRO3/SKY, and c-MET kinases. Only c-Kit and FLT3 kinases were poorly inhibited by compound 
 <bold>6e</bold>. Accordingly, by considering the moderate enzyme inhibition ability of 
 <bold>6e</bold> against DAPK1 and CSF1R and the relatively higher potency in the cellular assay, we anticipate that DAPK1 and CSF1R inhibitions could be partial drivers to the observed cellular activity and that there could be other molecular target(s) involved.
