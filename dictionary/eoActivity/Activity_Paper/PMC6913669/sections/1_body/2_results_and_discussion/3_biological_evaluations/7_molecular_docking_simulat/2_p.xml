<p>As noted in the introductory section, the investigated compounds are non-ATP-competitive DAPK1, ATP-competitive CSF1R kinases dual inhibitors. To explore the binding mode of the most active compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> to CSF1R and DAPK1, a molecular docking simulation study was conducted following the previously reported protocol

 </xref>. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">Figure 12(A,B)</xref> illustrates, the calculated binding mode of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> into the kinase binding site of CSF1R showed that the pyrimidine ring interacts with the crucial amino acid residue in the hinge region, which is Tyr 665, and the 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety is buried deep into the hydrophobic pocket while the piperidino moiety is protruding out of the pocket towards the solvent region. This calculated binding mode is stabilised with a network of favourable binding interactions involving π–π interactions with Tyr 665, Phe 797, π–alkyl interactions with Leu 588, Val 596, Ala 614, Lys 616, Ala 800, π–cation interaction with Arg 801, and finally hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr 663. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">Figure 12(C,D)</xref> illustrates for the predicted binding mode within the substrate-binding site of DAPK1, the calculated binding mode showed that compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> fitted within the hydrophobic groove orienting the methoxy substituents on the phenyl groups to face the more hydrophilic region to establish hydrogen bonding interactions with Leu 111, Leu 211, Glu 239, Tyr 240 and Asn 243. In addition to these favourable interactions network, the predicted binding mode establishes π–alkyl and alkyl–alkyl interactions with Ala 106 and hydrogen bonding interaction Asp 103. These results conform with the binding mode of this class of compounds with CSF1R and DAPK1 and provide insights into the binding modes of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold>.
