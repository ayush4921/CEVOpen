<p>Profiling hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> against nine different non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, showed a weak activity as only three cell lines were inhibited by 20.73â€“13.54% while the other cell lines were not significantly inhibited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed modest activity improvement relative to starting hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>6g</bold>, having 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety instead of the picolinamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6h</bold>, showed significantly increased growth inhibition that approached or surpassed 60% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) against four cell lines. However, the activity of 
 <bold>6g</bold> against other lung cancer cell lines was around or below 20% growth inhibition. Modifying compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> into compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> resulted in significant lower activities against four cell lines (A549/ATCC, HOP-62, NCI-H226, and NCI-H460) relative to compound 
 <bold>6g</bold>. Nevertheless, 
 <bold>6f</bold> was more active than 
 <bold>6g</bold> only in the case of NCI-H522 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>. Replacement of the 4-fluoroanilino moiety of compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> with 4-morpholinoanilino resulted in compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> with lower activity against the tested NSCLC cell lines except for HOP-92 and NCI-H226 which were inhibited by slightly higher values relative to compound 
 <bold>6f</bold>. Similar to the activity trend against hematological cancers, removal of one the methoxy groups from the benzamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> resulted in attrition of activity of compound 
 <bold>6b</bold>. Replacing the 3-methoxy substituent on the benzamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> with 3-trifluoromethyl resulted in a significantly high increase of activity of compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> against NCI-H522 NSCLC cell line (99.36% growth inhibition, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>. However, the enhancement of activity against other cell lines was modest suggesting a high affinity for a vulnerable target specifically overexpressed in this cell line. Converting the phenyl ring of the anilino moiety of compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> into a heterocyclic pyridinyl ring afforded compound 
 <bold>6d</bold> which did not show significant activity improvement relative to 
 <bold>6a</bold>. Further modification of 
 <bold>6d</bold> via isosteric replacement of the oxygen atom of the morpholino moiety by methylene group afforded compound 
 <bold>6e</bold>, which possessed significantly high growth inhibitory activities against seven of the tested NSCLC cell lines, which were near 80% growth inhibition against two cell lines and 60% against three cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>.
