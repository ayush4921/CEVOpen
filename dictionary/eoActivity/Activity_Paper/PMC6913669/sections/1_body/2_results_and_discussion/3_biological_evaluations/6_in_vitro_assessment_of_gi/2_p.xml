<p>Early assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters of lead compounds is imperative for the development of successful drug discovery programmes. It would help to invest time and effort in developing a worthy series of compounds that possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties and minimise wasting resources on compounds that are unlikely to afford real drugs. Passive permeability across the GIT membrane is an important pharmacokinetic parameter responsible for the absorption of the majority of orally administered drugs. In light of its importance, we checked the permeability of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> across the GIT membrane employing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA). The PAMPA assay might be used to simulate passive diffusion across biological barriers such as membranes of GIT and BBB

 </xref>. Simply, the compound of interest is located in a chamber that is separated from another chamber by a suitable membrane, then detecting the amount of the compound reached the other chamber via passive diffusion across the membrane. Compounds showing effective permeability (P
 <sub>e</sub>) value greater than 1.5 × 10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm/s are considered highly permeable and in case of using GIT-simulating membrane are anticipated to be well-absorbed from GIT. In the course of the conducted assay, 50 μM concentrations of the ultra-highly permeable verapamil and the poorly permeable ranitidine were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the measured P
 <sub>e</sub> of 12.5 μM concentration of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> showed an excellent value of 19 × 10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm/s which was 4.4 folds less than the ultra-highly permeable verapamil, but it is 73-folds the P
 <sub>e</sub> value of the poorly permeable ranitidine. As the P
 <sub>e</sub> of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> is more than 12-folds the required limit (1.5 × 10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm/s) to confer a good permeability property to a compound, it might be claimed that 
 <bold>6e</bold> is a promising anticancer compound with favourable pharmacokinetic properties considering the anticipated oral absorption.
