<p>As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref> illustrates, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> inhibited the growth of UO-31 cells among the tested eight renal cancer cells slightly by 23.5% while the growth of other renal cancers was not inhibited or showed very low inhibition. The results of the profiling of compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold>–
 <bold>h</bold> against different renal cancers showed that all compounds were more active relative to the starting hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold>. While compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> was of low activity showing less than 20% growth inhibition for all tested renal cancer cells, other compounds showed notable growth inhibition against several renal cancers. Among them, activity profiles of compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6g</bold> were distinguished by pronounced activity. All three compounds share the same 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety, while the 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety is common between compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6e</bold> and the morpholino moiety is common between compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6g</bold>. The activity profile of compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold> elicited an exceptionally high inhibition of A498 cells by 91.7% in addition to average growth inhibition of RXF 393 and UO-31 cells by 47.7 and 44.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> triggered 56.4, 45.2, 41.9 and 40.3% growth inhibition of SN12C, 786-0, UO-31, and CAKI-1 cells, respectively. The best activity profile was detected for compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> which produced good inhibition of six cell lines out of the tested eight renal cancers. To clarify, 
 <bold>6e</bold> inhibited the growth of ACHN, UO-31, A498, 786-0, RXF 393 and CAKI-1 cells by 71.2–58.2%. From these results, it is inferred that compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> might serve as a lead compound for the development of potential anti-renal cancers.
