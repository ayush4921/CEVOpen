<p>The results of profiling against six different hematological cancers showed that the highest growth inhibition triggered by the starting point hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was around 20% against two cell lines while the triggered growth inhibition was weaker against the remaining four cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. When the trifluoromethyl substituent on the phenoxy moiety of hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was shifted to the 4-position, a picolinamido moiety replaced the 4-aminobenzamido moiety and 6-morpholinopyridin-3-ylamino was introduced at 2-position of the pyrimidine core, compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> was obtained that showed potent inhibitory activity against SR cell line (80.74% growth inhibition, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. Surprisingly, compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed no or weak inhibition against other hematological cancer cell lines indicating an excellent selectivity to the SR cell line. Replacing the picolinamido moiety of compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> with 3,5-dimethoxybenzamido afforded compound 
 <bold>6g</bold>, which showed poor activity similar to the starting hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold>. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> in which the phenoxy moiety bears a 4-methoxy substituent, 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety maintained and 4-fluoroanilino moiety is affixed at 2-position of the pyrimidine ring showed enhanced activity relative to hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> against all cell lines, especially against K-562 cell line (72.24% growth inhibition, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. Replacement of the 4-fluoroanilino moiety of compound 
 <bold>6f</bold> with 4-morpholinoanilino resulted in further enhancement of the inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> against almost all the tested hematological cancer cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. Removal of one the methoxy groups from the benzamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> resulted in attrition of the activity of compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> with only moderate activity against RPMI-8226 myeloma cell line. However, replacement of the 3-methoxy substituent on the benzamide moiety of compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> with trifluoromethyl resulted in the significantly more active compound 
 <bold>6c</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. Modifying the structure of compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> through converting the phenyl ring of the anilino moiety into the heterocyclic pyridinyl ring afforded compound 
 <bold>6d</bold> which did not show activity improvement relative to 
 <bold>6a</bold>. Pleasantly, further modification of 
 <bold>6d</bold> via converting the morpholino moiety into piperidino moiety afforded compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> possessing excellent activities against all the tested hematological cancer cell lines. Interestingly, 
 <bold>6e</bold> was able to completely inhibit the growth of the acute promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60(TB) cell line.
