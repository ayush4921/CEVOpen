<p>In general, the activities of compounds 
 <bold>6g</bold> and 
 <bold>6h</bold> bearing 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety were more prominent against CNS cancer cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. Being the only member that bears 2-picolinamido moiety on the 4-posisiton of the pyrimidine core, compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> might engage in an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amido NH and the pyridino nitrogen resulting in a pseudo imidazopyridine ring. Owing to this extra rigidification, the geometry of 
 <bold>6h</bold> should be significantly different from other members of the series which might allow it to hit a biomolecule that is exclusively overexpressed in the SF-539 gliosarcoma cell line rationalising its selective lethal activity against this cell line. In addition, this might reflect the involvement of different molecular targets in mediating the activities of these compounds depending on the substitution pattern. Together, these data present compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6h</bold> as potential anticancer lead compounds against diverse cancer types.
