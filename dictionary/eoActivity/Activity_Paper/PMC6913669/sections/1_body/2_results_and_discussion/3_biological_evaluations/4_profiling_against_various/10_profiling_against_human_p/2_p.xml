<p>The starting hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> triggered low inhibition of the prostate cancer PC-3 cells by 12.9% and did not show inhibition of DU-145 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9)</xref>. Herein also compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was the best compound showing promising good inhibition of both PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Among other tested compounds, compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> which showed a near balanced, albeit weak inhibition of both tested prostate cancers. There was a wide gap between the triggered growth inhibition of the two cell lines by all other compounds reflecting a difference in the tendencies of these compounds to inhibit both cells equally. Thus, compound 
 <bold>6aâ€“d</bold> and 
 <bold>6f</bold> were more potential growth inhibitors of PC-3 cells rather than DU-145 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9)</xref>. On the contrary, compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed higher potentiality as an inhibitor of DU-145 cells. These results nominate compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> to serve as a lead compound for the development of anti-prostate cancer therapies.
