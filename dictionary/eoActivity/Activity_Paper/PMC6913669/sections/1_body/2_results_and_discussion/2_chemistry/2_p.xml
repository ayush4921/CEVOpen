<p>The reported compounds (
 <bold>6a–f</bold>) were resynthesised following the reported procedure
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>16</sup>
 </xref>. The new compounds 
 <bold>6g</bold> and 
 <bold>6h</bold> were obtained by reacting 2-chloro-5-nitro-4–(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)pyrimidine (
 <bold>7</bold>) with 2-morpholino-5-aminopyridine in THF at room temperature to obtain compound 
 <bold>8</bold> which was reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to obtain the amino derivative 
 <bold>9</bold>, which was reacted with 3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride in DCM and DIPEA to obtain 
 <bold>6g</bold> or with α-picolinlyl chloride in DCM and pyridine to obtain 
 <bold>6h</bold>. The structures of the new compounds were fully elucidated by 
 <sup>1</sup>HNMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>CNMR, and HRMS, and the experimental details are summarised in the experimental section (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>).
