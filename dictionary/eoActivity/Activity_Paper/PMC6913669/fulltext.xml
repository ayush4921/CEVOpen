Few compounds belonging to the proposed series were reported as CSF1R/DAPK1 inhibitors as anti-tauopathies. However, the correlation between CSF1R/DAPK1 signalling pathways and cancer progression provides motives to reprofile them against cancer therapy. The compounds were synthesised, characterized, and evaluated against M-NFS-60 cells and a kinase panel which bolstered predictions of their antiproliferative activity and suggested the involvement of diverse molecular targets. Compound <bold>6e</bold>, the most potent in the series, showed prominent broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity inhibiting the growth of hematological, NSCLC, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast cancers by 84.1, 52.79, 72.15, 66.34, 66.48, 51.55, 55.95, 61.85, and 60.87%, respectively. Additionally, it elicited an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.97&#x02009;&#x000b5;M against M-NFS-60 cells and good GIT absorption with P<sub>e</sub> value of 19.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6&#x02009;</sup>cm/s (PAMPA-GIT).

Furthermore, cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases with multifactorial etiology and inevitability for resistance evolvement. These challenges along with our continuous understanding of oncogenesis suggest that a multitarget single molecule with polypharmacological mechanisms might afford a novel promising chemotherapeutic agent<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>.</p><p>Substituted and/or fused bicyclic pyrimidine-containing scaffolds are privileged structures in medicinal chemistry with diverse bioactivities and success stories reported including the development of anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial pyrimidine-based chemical entities<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#x02013;13</sup></xref>. Starting from fused-pyrimidine scaffolds known in anticancer agents, such as lapatinib (<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), TAK285 (<bold>2</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), compound <bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), our team has identified 5-amino-4-pyrimidinol hit compound <bold>4</bold> out of a small library. This library was originally developed by decomposing the ring fused to the pyrimidine ring while maintaining the relative positions of the other substituents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>)<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>. While screening the reported generated library for anticancer activity, we have noticed that the derivatives having a chloro substituent at the 2-position of the pyrimidine core possessed slightly enhanced antiproliferative activity; yet they lacked EGFR inhibitory activity. Additionally, among unfused anticancer pyrimidines, literature reports promoted 2,4-diarylpyrimidine derivatives, such as WZ4002 (<bold>5</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), to have excellent antiproliferative activity<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. Consequently, we thought of using hit compound <bold>4</bold> as a starting point to design hybrid compounds combining the pharmacophoric features of both hit compound <bold>4</bold> and the 2-amino-4-pyrimidinol-based 2,4-diarylpyrimidine derivatives. Thus, in addition to the 4-phenoxy feature shared by both hit compound <bold>4</bold> and WZ4002, the offspring molecules (<bold>6</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) would also inherit the 5-benzamide feature from hit compound <bold>4</bold> and the 2-anilino feature from WZ4002. Noteworthy, some recently reported non-ATP-competitive DAPK1, ATP-competitive CSF1R kinases dual inhibitors for the treatment of the neurodegenerative tauopathies possess similar structures to this design rationale even though they were designed via different approach and for a different therapeutic purpose<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. Therefore, reprofiling the bioactivity of such compounds against cancer cells was strongly encouraged. Reprofiling i.e. repurposing or repositioning is a powerful tool of modern medicinal chemistry that offers many advantages and resulted in several successful outcomes<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17&#x02013;20</sup></xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Reported pyrimidine-based anticancer molecules and design rationale for anticancer 2,5-diamino-4-pyrimidinol derivatives.</p></caption><graphic content-type="color" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1699554_F0001_C"/></fig><p>Death-Associated Protein Kinase-1 (DAPK1), which controls several functions of the human cell, is well-known for its role in apoptosis, autophagy, and suppressing tumour growth<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>.

Interestingly, DAPK1 Knockdown or inhibition significantly suppressed the growth of the HCC1143, HCC1937, HCC1954 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines by 80&#x02013;90% suggesting the development of DAPK1 inhibitors to target TNBC<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>.

Replacement of the 4-fluoroanilino moiety of compound <bold>6f</bold> with 4-morpholinoanilino resulted in compound <bold>6a</bold> with lower activity against the tested NSCLC cell lines except for HOP-92 and NCI-H226 which were inhibited by slightly higher values relative to compound <bold>6f</bold>. Similar to the activity trend against hematological cancers, removal of one the methoxy groups from the benzamide moiety of compound <bold>6a</bold> resulted in attrition of activity of compound <bold>6b</bold>. Replacing the 3-methoxy substituent on the benzamide moiety of compound <bold>6b</bold> with 3-trifluoromethyl resulted in a significantly high increase of activity of compound <bold>6c</bold> against NCI-H522 NSCLC cell line (99.36% growth inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>. However, the enhancement of activity against other cell lines was modest suggesting a high affinity for a vulnerable target specifically overexpressed in this cell line. Converting the phenyl ring of the anilino moiety of compound <bold>6a</bold> into a heterocyclic pyridinyl ring afforded compound <bold>6d</bold> which did not show significant activity improvement relative to <bold>6a</bold>. Further modification of <bold>6d</bold> via isosteric replacement of the oxygen atom of the morpholino moiety by methylene group afforded compound <bold>6e</bold>, which possessed significantly high growth inhibitory activities against seven of the tested NSCLC cell lines, which were near 80% growth inhibition against two cell lines and 60% against three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3)</xref>.</p><fig id="F0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Measured % growth inhibition of various NSCLC cells triggered by 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M doses of compounds <bold>6a&#x02013;h</bold> and hit compound <bold>4</bold>.

In our case, several conclusions can be drawn about the relation between the structural modifications and their effect on the antiproliferative activity as shall be discussed in this section. In contrast to the low activity of the hit compound <bold>4</bold>, the developed lead compound <bold>6e</bold> was able to inhibit the growth of multiple cancer cell lines, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>. The structural features of compound <bold>6e</bold> involve 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety, 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety and piperidino substituent on the pyridineamino moiety. These distinct structural features might be the reason behind the observed antiproliferative activity of <bold>6e</bold>. In this series, the piperidino moiety seems to be of crucial importance for a highly potent broad-spectrum antiproliferative agent. This could be inferred from the comparison of the activities of compounds <bold>6e</bold> and <bold>6d</bold> in which <bold>6d</bold> processes a morpholino group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1)</xref>. One plausible explanation for this significant difference in the antiproliferative activity might be related to the hydrophobicity of the piperidine moiety<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref>. This hydrophobicity might facilitate the desolvation of <bold>6e</bold> with respect to <bold>6d</bold>. Additionally, enhanced binding between <bold>6e</bold> and the host macromolecule might be gained from a potential entropy-driven water displacement at the binding site by the hydrophobic effect of the piperidine. In other words, the oxygen of the morpholino moiety of <bold>6d</bold> might encourage an unfavourable solvated state at the pocket of the target site, while the piperidine moiety displaces the water of solvation resulting in filling a hydrophobic pocket and gaining a higher binding affinity. Despite the notion that this simple isosteric replacement of the oxygen with methylene group (<bold>6d</bold> vs. <bold>6e</bold>) could results in drastic change in the whole molecular geometry and binding mode, the assumption that the two molecules bind the same pocket of a certain molecular target in the same binding fashion might make the solvation hypothesis plausible. In addition, the assumed higher affinity of <bold>6e</bold> for the host macromolecule(s) might reflect the higher antiproliferative activity at the cellular level.</p><fig id="F0011" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Average % values of measured growth inhibition of nine cancer diseases triggered by 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M doses of compounds <bold>6a&#x02013;h</bold> and hit compound <bold>4</bold>.

This modification resulted in a slight improvement in the overall average antiproliferative activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>), yet lead to a loss of the potency over the A498 renal cancer cell line. This is exemplified by comparing the activities of <bold>6a</bold> and <bold>6d</bold>. In fact, the dissymmetry of the pyridine ring compared with the phenyl ring could cause a change in the relative geometry of the morpholino group; it did not have a drastic effect on the activity as noticed with the <bold>6d</bold>-to-<bold>6e</bold> structural change.</p><p>In addition, compound <bold>6f</bold> is structurally different from compound <bold>6e</bold> by lacking the cyclic amine moieties, as well as the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic pyridine ring which resulted in relatively lower activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. The influence of the 4-methoxy substituent on the phenoxy moiety might be deduced from the lower activity of compound <bold>6g</bold> possessing 4-trifluoromethyl substituent relative to compound <bold>6d</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. The positive influence of the 3,5-dimethoxy substitution pattern on the benzamide moiety might be concluded from comparing the activities of <bold>6a</bold> and <bold>6b</bold> in which <bold>6b</bold> possesses 3-methoxy substituent instead. Additionally, this influence can be understood by comparing compound <bold>6g</bold> with <bold>6h</bold> in which <bold>6h</bold> possesses 2-pyridineamide as a replacement to the benzamide moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. However, comparing the activities of compound <bold>6c</bold>, possessing 3-trifluoromethyl with <bold>6a</bold> and <bold>6b</bold>, possessing 3,5-dimethoxy and 3-methoxy substituents, respectively might indicate an activity tolerance to the incorporation of this type of substituents. It was noticed that the activities of compounds <bold>6a</bold>, <bold>6c</bold>, <bold>6d</bold>, <bold>6e</bold> and <bold>6f</bold> bearing 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety were more prominent against hematological cancer rather than other cancer types as shown from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>.</p><p>In general, the activities of compounds <bold>6g</bold> and <bold>6h</bold> bearing 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety were more prominent against CNS cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11)</xref>. Being the only member that bears 2-picolinamido moiety on the 4-posisiton of the pyrimidine core, compound <bold>6h</bold> might engage in an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amido NH and the pyridino nitrogen resulting in a pseudo imidazopyridine ring. Owing to this extra rigidification, the geometry of <bold>6h</bold> should be significantly different from other members of the series which might allow it to hit a biomolecule that is exclusively overexpressed in the SF-539 gliosarcoma cell line rationalising its selective lethal activity against this cell line.

In the course of the conducted assay, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M concentrations of the ultra-highly permeable verapamil and the poorly permeable ranitidine were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the measured P<sub>e</sub> of 12.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M concentration of compound <bold>6e</bold> showed an excellent value of 19&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6&#x02009;</sup>cm/s which was 4.4 folds less than the ultra-highly permeable verapamil, but it is 73-folds the P<sub>e</sub> value of the poorly permeable ranitidine.

To explore the binding mode of the most active compound <bold>6e</bold> to CSF1R and DAPK1, a molecular docking simulation study was conducted following the previously reported protocol<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">Figure 12(A,B)</xref> illustrates, the calculated binding mode of compound <bold>6e</bold> into the kinase binding site of CSF1R showed that the pyrimidine ring interacts with the crucial amino acid residue in the hinge region, which is Tyr 665, and the 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety is buried deep into the hydrophobic pocket while the piperidino moiety is protruding out of the pocket towards the solvent region. This calculated binding mode is stabilised with a network of favourable binding interactions involving &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions with Tyr 665, Phe 797, &#x003c0;&#x02013;alkyl interactions with Leu 588, Val 596, Ala 614, Lys 616, Ala 800, &#x003c0;&#x02013;cation interaction with Arg 801, and finally hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr 663. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">Figure 12(C,D)</xref> illustrates for the predicted binding mode within the substrate-binding site of DAPK1, the calculated binding mode showed that compound <bold>6e</bold> fitted within the hydrophobic groove orienting the methoxy substituents on the phenyl groups to face the more hydrophilic region to establish hydrogen bonding interactions with Leu 111, Leu 211, Glu 239, Tyr 240 and Asn 243. In addition to these favourable interactions network, the predicted binding mode establishes &#x003c0;&#x02013;alkyl and alkyl&#x02013;alkyl interactions with Ala 106 and hydrogen bonding interaction Asp 103. These results conform with the binding mode of this class of compounds with CSF1R and DAPK1 and provide insights into the binding modes of compound <bold>6e</bold>.</p><fig id="F0012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Calculated binding modes and interactions of compound <bold>6e</bold>: (A) Compound <bold>6e</bold> docked within kinase binding site of CSF1R (PDB code: 3KRJ); (B) Predicted interactions of compound <bold>6e</bold> within the binding pocket of CSF1R (PDB code: 3KRJ); (C) Compound <bold>6e</bold> docked within substrate-binding site of DAPK1 (PDB code: 4TXC); (D) Predicted interactions of compound <bold>6e</bold> within the substrate binding pocket of DAPK1 (PDB code: 4TXC).</p></caption><graphic content-type="color" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1699554_F0012_C"/></fig></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S0004" disp-level="1"><label>4.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Heterogeneity and insensitivity of cancers, resistance evolvement, and adverse reactions of anticancer agents create a continuous need to look for new anticancer drugs to meet such unmet clinical needs. In light of this, herein we start from previously identified weak anticancer pyrimidine derivative to design new anticancer agents through hybridisation with 2,4-diarylpyrimidines. The designed series combined the structural features of the starting hit compound and 2-anilino-4-phenoxypyrimidines. The literature reported few compounds belonging to the proposed structures as potential antitauopathies. Provided the additional supportive background, the fact that CSF1R and DAPK1 were found to correlate with cancer diseases promoted these compounds as potential antiproliferative molecules. Synthesis and initial testing of these compounds against leukemic M-NFS-60 mouse cells, which is known to overexpress CSF1R, supported these predictions and suggested the presence of other molecular targets for these compounds in addition to CSF1R and DAPK1. In an attempt to identify molecular targets that cooperate with CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibition to trigger the observed antiproliferative activity, the kinase inhibitory activity of compound <bold>6e</bold> against 14 kinases was assessed. The results showed that <bold>6e</bold> did not disclose the potential inhibition of these kinases. Accordingly, other kinases or non-kinase molecular targets might be involved in mediating the anticancer activity of these compounds. Encouraged by their activity over M-NFS-60 cell line, the synthesised compounds were profiled for their antiproliferative activities against diverse human cancer diseases from nine origins; blood, lung, colon, brain, skin, ovary, renal, prostate and breast. The results showed that compound <bold>6e</bold> (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was the most promising among the tested compounds showing high and broad-spectrum activity against the tested cancer diseases. Compound <bold>6g</bold> possessing 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety showed broad-spectrum yet lower activity. In addition, a high selective inhibition of some cell lines was found as in the case of compound <bold>6h</bold> which inhibited the growth of SF-539 and SR cell lines by 153.1% and 80.7%, respectively.</p><p>The early assessment of important parameters influencing pharmacokinetics is important to avoid wasting precious resources on a lead compound with unfavourable properties, which might cause hurdles in the later development of the clinical candidate(s). Thus, the GIT permeability of compound <bold>6e</bold> was evaluated <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> employing PAMPA assay. The measured good effective permeability (P<sub>e</sub>) of compound <bold>6e</bold> predicted good absorption after oral administration. The conducted molecular docking study of compound <bold>6e</bold> provided insights into the binding modes with CSF1R and DAPK1 and were in conform with the level of CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibitory activity this class of compounds showed. Together, the results present compound <bold>6e</bold> as a promising broad-spectrum antiproliferative lead compound with predicted good GIT permeability that deserves further exploration of its molecular targets and further assessment of its potentiality as a novel polypharmacological anticancer agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0421"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IENZ_A_1699554_SM0421.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA for performing NCI-60 human tumour cell lines screen.
