  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>L. regularis</italic> (Lr) extract on STZ-induced pathological changes in liver samples as visualized in the histopathological slides stained with H&amp;E (400x). (a) Liver samples from control rats showing normal central vein (CV) and regular hepatic cords. (b) Liver samples from diabetic-untreated animals showing fatty degeneration, dilated central vein (CV), and leukocyte infiltration (arrowhead). (c) Liver samples from Lr (150) group showing partial regenerating hepatocytes in the midzone around central vein with dilatation in hepatic sinusoids. (d) Liver samples from Lr (300) group showing binuclear regenerating hepatocytes with regular central vein.
