<p>Animals were divided in to four groups by taking six rats in each as follows: (1) control animals treated with vehicle (control), (2) diabetic rats treated with vehicle (STZ), (3) diabetic rats treated with 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> 150 mg/kg/day (Lr (150)), and (4) diabetic rats treated with 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> 300 mg/kg/day (Lr (300)). 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> extract was suspended in 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) solution and given orally once a day by gavage for 4 weeks starting one week after STZ injection [

Blood samples were collected through cardiac puncture under anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (92 mg/kg, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Amman, Jordan) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, Bayer, Turkey) mixture. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1800 RCF for 10 min. Serum samples were labeled and stored at −20°C until analysis. Finally, animals were decapitated and immediately liver samples were dissected. Cross sections of liver samples were preserved 10% formalin for histopathology, and the remaining tissues were dipped in liquid nitrogen for a minute then stored at −80°C until analysis.
