<p>Liver portions were homogenized in physiological buffer (1 : 10, w/v). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured using diagnostic kits (Cayman Chemical Co., USA). In postmitochondria supernatants of hepatic tissues, the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reeducates (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were determined by assay kits (R&amp;D systems Inc., USA).</p>
