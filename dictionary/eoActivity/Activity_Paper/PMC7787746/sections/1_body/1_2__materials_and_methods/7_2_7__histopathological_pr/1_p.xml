<p>A cross-sectional portion of liver tissues from each group was preserved in 10% buffered formalin. The samples were embedded in paraffin blocks, and sections of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thickness were cut using a Leica CM3050 S Research Cryostat (Leica Biosystems, USA). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Finally, they were examined under the microscope for histopathological changes by an observer who was blind with respect to the treatment groups. The extent of hepatic necrosis and inflammation were semiquantitatively scored as follows: (0) no inflammatory or necrotic foci, (1) less than 2 inflammatory or necrotic foci, (2) between 2 and 4 inflammatory or necrotic foci, and (3) more than 4 inflammatory or necrotic foci. The mean score of each group was calculated and determined on five randomly chosen fields.
