<p>Collection and extraction of the plant materials were conducted as described before [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Aerial parts including leaves, flowers, and twigs of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> was collected from Al-Mahwit governate (Yemen) and identified at the pharmacognosy department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sana'a University. Voucher specimen (Mo-M05) was deposited at the pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sana'a University. One kilogram of air-dried and grinded plant material was extracted with 3000 ml methanol (CH
 <sub>3</sub>OH) for 5 hours by utilizing a Soxhlet apparatus. The obtained methanol extract was filtered and evaporated by using a rotary evaporator to give the crude methanol extract (114 g). In our previous work, we conducted complete extraction, fractionation, and isolation methodology for 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic>. These procedures resulted in separation and purification of three biologically active flavonoids: quercetin 3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside, quercetin 3-Ob-L-arabinopyranoside, and quercetin 3-Oa-L-rhamnopyranoside [
