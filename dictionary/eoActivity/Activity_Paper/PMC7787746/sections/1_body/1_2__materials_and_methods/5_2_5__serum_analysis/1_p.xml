<p>In serum, the levels of glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were estimated using commercially available diagnostic kits (Human, Wiesbaden, Germany). Moreover, the concentrations of proinflammatory biomarkers were estimated using diagnostic kits (R&amp;D systems Inc., USA). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) were estimated using rat ELISA kits (Catalog #RTA00, RLB00, R6000B, and KGE004B; respectively). Caspase-3 was assayed using colorimetric assay kit (Catalog #K106-100), while nitric oxide (NO) was determined using total nitric oxide and nitrate/nitrite assay.
