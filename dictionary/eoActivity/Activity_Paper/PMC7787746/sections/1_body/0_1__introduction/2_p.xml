<p>Diabetic-associated hepatotoxicity is major complication of DM. Studies have found that DM could be considered as a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, hyperglycemia was reported to exaggerate acute liver injury through inflammasome activation [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The deficiency of intracellular glucose in hepatic cells during DM results in damaging and necrotic effects, which stimulate apoptotic response [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, several hepatic inflammatory responses were reported in reaction to DM [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Oxidative stress and the associated formations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered the major causative factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic-induced hepatotoxic injuries [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During this event, the intracellular generation of free radicals exceeds the antioxidant capacity of hepatocytes leading to lipid peroxidation and oxidative necrosis. Moreover, the hepatocyte injury results in complex biological events that include neutrophil infiltration and activation of Kupffer cells. Such response stimulates apoptotic pathways and the release of inflammatory cytokines [
