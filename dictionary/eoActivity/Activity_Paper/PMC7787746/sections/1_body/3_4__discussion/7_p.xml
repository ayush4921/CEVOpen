<p>Other species from the family Loranthaceae showed similar antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. A recent study reported that 
 <italic>Loranthus acaciae</italic> Zucc. might reduce blood glucose levels and downregulate markers of proinflammation and oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>Loranthus micranthus</italic> showed marked aphrodisiac as well as antidiabetic properties, which were attributed to restoring redox status [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Loranthus micranthus</italic> enhanced diabetic-induced damages in liver and kidney tissues and repaired glycolytic flux in STZ diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar antidiabetic and antihyperglycemia activities of 
 <italic>Loranthus micranthus</italic> extract were demonstrated in alloxan-induced diabetic rodents [
