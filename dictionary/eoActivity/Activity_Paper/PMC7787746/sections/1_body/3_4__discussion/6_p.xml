<p>Medicinal plants, containing phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, are known for their antioxidant activities. These effects arouse from the ability of their chemical structures to donate electrons or hydrogen molecules, which accordingly act as free radicals scavenging factor [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic> markedly corrected STZ-induced hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency. We reported improved serum levels of glucose and insulin after 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> treatment, suggesting pancreatic beta cell restorative effects against STZ-induced DNA alkylation and free radical damage. In addition, the reported impaired lipid profile and systemic inflammation were restored in diabetic animals treated with
