<p>Diabetic-induced hepatotoxic injury is an important metabolic complication of DM, which might diminish the metabolic function of the liver. It has been suggested that persistent hyperglycemia will trigger oxidative stress and the formation of free radicals, which damage the intracellular integrity and physiological functions. In the present study, it was documented that 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> protects the systemic and hepatic tissue form the deleterious consequences of hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. Treatment of the diabetic animals with the natural compound markedly improved the altered liver function markers and restored hepatocellular construction and integrity. The reported favorable effects are mediated by the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of the active constituents present in 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> extract.
