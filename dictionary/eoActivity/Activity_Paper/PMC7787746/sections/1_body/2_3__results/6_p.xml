<p>Semiquantitative histological scoring of liver samples from all groups is presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Histological analysis of the liver sections from control animals revealed normal architecture of hepatocytes. There was a moderate steatosis, fatty degeneration, and inflammatory infiltrating cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in diabetic-untreated animals. Animals treated with 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> (150 mg/kg) showed partial regeneration of the hepatocytes and mild inflammatory infiltrate. Animals treated with 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> (300 mg/kg) demonstrated regenerated hepatocytes with minor inflammatory infiltrate (
