<p>The lipid peroxidation marker, TBARS, was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) augmented, while the endogenous antioxidant, GSH, was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) repressed in diabetic animals as compared with the control group. Both doses of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> (150 and 300 mg/kg) significantly inhibited TBARS level (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001, respectively) and raised GSH concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01, respectively) in hepatic tissues from diabetic animals as compared with the STZ group (
