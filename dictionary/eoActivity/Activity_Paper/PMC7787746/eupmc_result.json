    "Earlier studies revealed the potential therapeutic values of <i>Loranthus regularis</i> (<i>L. regularis</i>). This study evaluated <i>Loranthus regularis</i> (<i>L. regularis</i>) extract systemic antidiabetic effects and benefits against diabetic hepatocellular injuries through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways using the streptozotocin (STZ) model in Wistar albino rats. After diabetes induction, animals were orally treated with <i>L. regularis</i> extract for 4 weeks. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were estimated. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<i>α</i>), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1<i>β</i>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), caspase-3, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) were estimated in serum. In liver, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as the proinflammatory cytokines and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reeducates (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were assayed. Finally, the degree of hepatic tissue damage was evaluated histologically. Treatment of the diabetic rats with <i>L. regularis</i> extract markedly reduced the elevated serum levels of glucose, ALT, AST, TC, TG, LDL, TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-6, caspase-3, NO, and PGE-2. <i>L. regularis</i> extract also improved serum levels of insulin and HDL. The elevated TBARS, TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, and IL-6 levels in hepatic tissue of diabetic animals were reduced by <i>L. regularis</i>. Moreover, <i>L. regularis</i> extract significantly restored the diminished hepatic GSH level and enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GST in diabetic animals. The biochemical protective effects of <i>L. regularis</i> were associated with improved histological hepatocellular integrity and architecture. Taken together, <i>L. regularis</i> has therapeutic effects against diabetic-induced hepatic complications. The restored liver functions and cellular damage might be mediated through free radicals scavenging and proinflammatory cytokine inhibition."
