<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder of multiple causes characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long–term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs [

Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is an autoimmune disorder developing when insulin-producing cells of the pancreas in the body have been destroyed and the pancreas produces little or no insulin. A person who has type 1 DM must take insulin daily to live. It develops most often in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes has also been known as another term “insulin-independent diabetes mellitus” which accounted for more than 90% of diagnosed cases of DM in adults. It is a diagnosis in which the pancreas produces enough insulin but the body cannot use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition in the second or third trimester of the period of pregnancy. GDM is caused by the hormone of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. GDM is one of the most popular disorders of metabolism during pregnancy.
