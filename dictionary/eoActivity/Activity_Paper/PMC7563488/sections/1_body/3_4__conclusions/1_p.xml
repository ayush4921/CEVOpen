<p>Diabetes mellitus has been considered to be a major cause affecting the economy of patients, their families and society. Furthermore, uncontrolled diabetes leads to serious chronic complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and heart failure. In order to decrease this problem, researches on new antidiabetic agents are concerned. Because of the adverse effects of modern therapies, many traditional medicines have been noticed. Moreover, herbal extracts nowadays can be used with standard drugs for combinatorial therapies. Each herb has its own active ingredients that can lower blood sugar levels as well as control the complications of diabetes. Future research will focus on isolation, purification, and identification of bioactive substances in plants. This review is looking forward to providing the necessary information in the management of diabetes. In our review, we have introduced a complete list of anti-diabetic plants taken from the Vietherb database [
