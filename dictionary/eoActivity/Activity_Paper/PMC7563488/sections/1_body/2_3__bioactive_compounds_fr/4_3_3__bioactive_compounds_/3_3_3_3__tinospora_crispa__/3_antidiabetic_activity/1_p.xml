<p>The investigation of Noor and Ashcroft [
 <xref rid="B106-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] indicated that the orally administrated extract of 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> exhibited a potential antidiabetic effect. The mechanisms of these activities were predicted so that this plant could stimulate insulin secretion through the modulation of β-cell Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. In Noipha’s experiment, 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> extracts improved the glucose transport activity of L6 myotubes by increasing GLUT1 transporter [
