<p>In many previous investigations, 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> is a rich source of secondary metabolites, divided into several groups, including alkaloids, flavonoid, terpenoids, lignans, sterols, etc. [

 <italic>N</italic>-formylasimilobine 2-O-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, 
 <italic>N</italic>-formylasimilobine 2-O-β-

 <italic>T. crispa</italic> extract, such as apeginin, diosmetin, genkwanin, luteolin 4′-methyl ether 7-glucoside, genkwanin 7-glucoside, luteolin 4′-methyl ether 3′-glucoside [
