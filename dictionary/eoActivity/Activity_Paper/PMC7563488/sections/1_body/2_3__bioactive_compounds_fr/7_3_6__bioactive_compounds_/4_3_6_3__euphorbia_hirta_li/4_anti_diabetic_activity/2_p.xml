<p>An in silico study, In 2013 Dr. Ly Le and her group investigated antidiabetic activities of bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>Euphorbia hirta</italic> Linn using molecular docking and pharmacophore [
 <xref rid="B164-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. This study demonstrated the effect of bioactive compounds isolated in 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> on some proteins relating to diabetes type 2, including α-glucosidase and α-amylase by evaluating whether a relationship exists between various bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> and targeted protein relating diabetes type 2 in human. By calculating the binding energy and pharmacophore modeling, eight promising compounds in 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> were obtained, including cyanidi 3,5-O-diglucose, myricitrin, pelargonium-3,5-diglucose, quercitrin, rutin, α-amyrine, β-amyrine, and taraxerol. The results of that investigation showed that those bioactive compounds have the potential in developing medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the combination of using the molecular dynamic technique is required to determine more accurate binding affinities and the stability of ligand–proteins’ interactions. Thus, the research results in silico and in vitro studies have shown that this plant has the ability to inhibit two enzymes.
