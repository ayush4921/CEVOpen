<p>It was reported that leaf power extract lowered plasma glucose level by the presence of many active phytochemicals including eugenol, carvacrol, linalool, caryophylline, β-sitosterol which have been studied about potent hypoglycemic effects efficiency [

 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> by in vivo investigation [
 <xref rid="B129-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The mechanisms of the antidiabetic and hypoglycemic potential of this compound were elucidated to increase the pancreatic secretion of insulin from β-cells, and enhance glucose utilization [
 <xref rid="B129-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. It was suggested that this triterpenoid should be considered to be developed as a potential antidiabetic medicine. This evidences support that 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> has many benefits in the management of diabetes, and this plant should be encouraged to be a potential anti-diabetic activity [
