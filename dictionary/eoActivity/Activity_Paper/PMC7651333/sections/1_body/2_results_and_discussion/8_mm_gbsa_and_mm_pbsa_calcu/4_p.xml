<p>The hydrogen bonds formed during the simulation time in all the six complex molecules were calculated using CPPTRAJ (Roe &amp; Cheatham, 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The amino acids His164, Gly143 (M
 <sup>pro</sup>-nelfinavir), His164, Gln189 (M
 <sup>pro</sup>-withanolide A), Glu484, Cys480 (S-protein-nelfinavir), Gly381, Glu484 (S-protein-taraxerol), His34, Asp30 (ACE2-nelfinavir) and Gln76, Glu75 (ACE2-taraxerol) are the top two residues interacting with the respective ligands.
