<p>The lipophilicity (LogP) is an essential factor in drug-likeness properties, which influences the absorption rate of the drug molecule in the body. A higher LogP value represents a lower absorption. The standard drugs and medicinal plant bioactives were further screened for Ghose filter rule, Veber rule, Egan rule and Muegge rule, which are also associated with the drug-likeness properties. Most of the standard drugs have qualified all the drug-likeness features, as shown in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0001 t0004" ref-type="table">Table S4.1</xref>. In medicinal plant bioactives, tinosporide has qualified all the drug-likeness features, as shown in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0002 t0004" ref-type="table">Table S4.2</xref>. All the other chosen medicinal plant bioactives may have good oral bioavailability and optimal cell permeability as they have low molecular weight and less TPSA value similar to standard drugs. Synthetic accessibility (SA) evaluates the feasibility of the chemical synthesis of the compound. The SA value 1 signifies easy to synthesize, whereas 10 means challenging to synthesize (Ertl &amp; Schuffenhauer, 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The SA value of these selected bioactives was in between 4.05 and 6.60, which implies that they can be chemically synthesized with a moderate effort.
