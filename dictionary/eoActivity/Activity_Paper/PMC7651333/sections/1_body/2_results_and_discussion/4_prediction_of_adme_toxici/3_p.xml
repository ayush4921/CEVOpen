<p>After intestinal absorption, the bioactive molecules circulate into the different parts of the body through blood. Most of the selected bioactives have shown a lesser affinity to bind with plasma protein (PPB) in contrast to some of the standard drugs and, therefore, they are expected to be freely available at the required tissue or organ. After the circulation, the bioactives are metabolized in the liver by the family of the Cytochrome P450 enzymes (Glue &amp; Clement, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Here, few drugs and bioactives functioned as the substrate for these enzymes; consequently, the corresponding CYP450 enzyme might metabolize them.
