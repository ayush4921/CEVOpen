<p>ADME/T analysis is aimed to analyze the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity of the medicinal plant bioactives 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. The ADME/T results are calculated for the standard drugs and bioactives are represented in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Tables 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>, respectively. A desirable compound should have excellent human intestinal absorption (HIA) and Caco-2 cell permeability (Radchenko et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Generally, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug permeability is analyzed using the Caco-2 cell line. We found that most of the chosen medicinal plant bioactives have shown an optimal Caco-2 permeability with higher HIA– and GI-absorptions. In contrast, some of the standard drugs including remdesivir and nelfinavir have not shown an optimal Caco-2 permeability and high GI-absorption. Irrespective of absorption and probable toxicity, a recent double-blind study has shown that the administration of remdesivir improved the recovery of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and lower respiratory tract infections (Beigel et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Advantageously, the selected bioactives not only having comparable BEs but also have better pharmacological distributions over selected standard drugs. Further, we also found that bioactives have the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as similar to standard drugs. P-gp is one of the important drug efflux transporters involved in maintaining intracellular drug concentrations (Sève &amp; Dumontet, 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
