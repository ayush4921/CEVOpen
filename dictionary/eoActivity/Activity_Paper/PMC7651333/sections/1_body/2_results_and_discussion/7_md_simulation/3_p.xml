<p>The S-protein-nelfinavir complex (Supporting Information video S3) showed quite interesting binding patterns during the simulations. The nelfinavir molecule is initially bound at the cavity formed by the amino acids Leu452-Phe456, and Glu484-Gly496 of S-protein, and it retained its pose up to 24 ns. It then dissociates from the binding pocket, floats free among the bulk solvent and binds again to the protein between 40 and 69 ns. It dissociates from the second position too and it finally moves to a third pose at a site diametrically across the molecule from the starting pocket and stays stable from 80 to 100 ns (
