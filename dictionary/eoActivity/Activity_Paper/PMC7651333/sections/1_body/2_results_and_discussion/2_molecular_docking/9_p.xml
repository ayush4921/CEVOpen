<p>Further, we determined inhibition constant (Ki) for the bioactives from the medicinal plants and standard drugs. Ki measures the concentration required to produce half-maximum inhibition and 1–40 µM is considered as a preferred range for a hit compound (Naidoo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The Ki calculated for the bioactives from medicinal plants for all three target proteins are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In comparison with bioactives, some of the standard drugs such as favipiravir have demonstrated higher Ki values for all three protein targets. Overall, these results suggest that selected medicinal bioactives have a significant binding affinity towards all the protein targets.
