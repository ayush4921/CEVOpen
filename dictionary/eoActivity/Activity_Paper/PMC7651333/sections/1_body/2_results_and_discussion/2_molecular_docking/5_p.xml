<p>During viral transmission, the residues of the receptor-binding motif of S-protein bind with ACE2 receptor hotspots. The receptor-binding motif of S-protein consists of Leu455, Phe486, Gln493 and Ser494 residues, which play a critical role in interacting with the ACE2 receptor (Lan et al.,

In our current study, the selected bioactives from medicinal plants as well as standard drugs have shown interaction towards the key residues of the S-protein receptor-binding motif, as shown in Supporting Information Fig. S4 and S5. The frequency of H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions are also summarized in Supporting Information Fig. S6. Among the bioactive from medicinal plants, withametelin from

The common amino acids of the S-protein receptor-binding motif interacting with the standard drug nelfinavir, and bioactives withanolide A, as well as taraxerol, are compared and the results are highlighted in
