<p>Similarly, bioactives of porcupine (
 <italic>Barleria prionitis</italic>) and licorice (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) have shown a higher binding affinity towards S-protein and ACE-2 receptor. Bioactives from medicinal plant 
 <italic>B. prionitis</italic>, is already known to have potent activity against the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> has been known to inhibit the viral replication of SARS-CoV and function as an inhibitor of Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1; Fiore et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Estari et al. have shown an extract of 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> (Amla) exert anti-HIV activity via inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase activity (Estari et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In concurrence, we also found that bioactives of amla had a higher binding affinity with the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results suggest that the selected medicinal plant bioactives may potentially attenuate the interaction between S-protein and ACE2 receptor as well as inhibit the activity of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Thus, inhibition of M
 <sup>pro</sup> and attenuation of S-protein-ACE2 interaction may affect replication, maturation and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by analyzing the additional properties such as druggability and pharmacological features one can gain knowledge about the druggable option of these bioactives.
