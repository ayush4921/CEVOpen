<p>Based on the recent structural and MD studies, many key amino acid residues of the ACE2 receptor are identified in interacting with its partner proteins (Lan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Veeramachaneni et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The human ACE2 receptor contains two hotspot residues Lys31 and Lys353. The S-protein recognizes these hotspots, and their interaction is essential for viral infection. The selected bioactives from the medicinal plants have also shown a higher affinity towards hotspot residues of the ACE2 receptor (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Supporting Information Fig. S8). The interactions of the standard drugs and medicinal plant bioactives were also similar towards hotspot residues of the ACE2 receptor as shown in Supporting Information Fig. S7 and S8. Several chosen bioactives had shown a strong interaction with hotspot Lys353 residues, e.g. echinacin (–7.8 kcal/mol) and withametelin (–7.3 kcal/mol). Apart from hotspot Lys353, taraxerol (–7.2 kcal/mol) and quercetin 3-O-robinobioside (–6.2 kcal/mol) have shown strong interactions with the hotspot Lys31. These interactions at the hotspot residues suggest that chosen bioactives can act as ACE2 receptor blockers and can hinder the binding of S-protein.
