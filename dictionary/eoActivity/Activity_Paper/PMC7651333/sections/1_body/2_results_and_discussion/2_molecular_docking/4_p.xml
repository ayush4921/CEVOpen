<p>Recently, Jin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) solved the structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> from SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7), and it is complex with an inhibitor known as N3 (PDB ID: 7BQY; Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The N3 inhibitor forms H-bond with amino acids Phe140, Gly143, Cys145, His163, His164, Glu166, Gln189 and Thr190 of M
 <sup>pro</sup> and hydrophobic contacts with Thr26, Leu27, His41, Leu141, Asn142, Met165, Pro168, His172, Arg188 and Gln192 (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Our docking results also mimic the effects of N3, and these interactions identify some more amino acids of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which may facilitate the drug interactions (Supporting Information
