<p>The primary symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, headache and diarrhea (Lan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As the SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses, a hyperinflammatory reaction is mediated through exaggerated cytokine response, intense lymphopenia, as well as considerable mononuclear cell infiltration into the various organs (Merad &amp; Martin, 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The mortality owing to COVID-19 is mainly due to the clinical features in the advanced stages like acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe cardiac injury (Bonow et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Currently, there is a lack of specific anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 (Rodr√≠guez-Morales et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Some clinical studies have aimed to explore the available protease inhibitors, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial drugs. However, there is no evidence of the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of these drugs to overcome the morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19.
