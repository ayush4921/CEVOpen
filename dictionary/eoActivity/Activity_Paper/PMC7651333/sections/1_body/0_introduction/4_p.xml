<p>Human civilization has been marred with the occurrence of epidemic and pandemics like SARS-CoV. At the same time, the ‘survival of the fittest’ taught to develop treatment practices and medicines within the natural bounty. ‘
 <italic>Ayurveda</italic>’ is one of the traditional Indian medicinal practices that has appealed attention as complementary approaches against various diseases, including viral infection (Mukhtar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Medicinal plant extracts are known to act as antipyretics, anti-inflammatory, expectorant, analgesic, etc. Several studies have also shown bioactives from medicinal plants function as potential anti-viral agents by boosting the inherent immune system (Ganjhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mukhtar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory properties of medicinal plants can reduce severe respiratory distress syndrome and acute cardiac injury, which are the leading cause of COVID-19 morbidities (Cornélio Favarin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Liperoti et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is known that more than 25,000 plant-based formulations have been used in traditional Indian medicine (Vellingiri et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Traditional medicines often pioneered the discovery of modern drugs yet underestimated due to the latter’s target specificity and translational potential. Unlike modern medicine, a single herb may contain many bioactives that may function alone or in combinations to produce the desired relief. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the therapeutic prospects of bioactives from the traditional medicinal plants against COVID-19.
