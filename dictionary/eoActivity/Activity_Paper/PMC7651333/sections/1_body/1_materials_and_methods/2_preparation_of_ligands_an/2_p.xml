<p>Approved drugs for the treatment of HIV (Darunavir, Favipiravir, Nelfinavir, Remdesivir), ACE2 inhibitors (Enalapril, Losartan, Olmesartan) and Dexamethasone were chosen as the standard drugs for docking against SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, S-protein and ACE2 receptor proteins (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The standard drugs were selected based on the existing anti-viral activities and ongoing clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the literature evidences, 60 bioactives from 22 medicinal plants were selected for docking studies with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, S-protein and ACE2 receptor proteins (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). The structural information of ligands, including eight standard drugs and sixty bioactives from the medicinal plants, were retrieved from PubChem (

 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The ligands were converted from 2D to 3D using Marvin sketch and Open Babel software tools (Oâ€™Boyle et al.,
