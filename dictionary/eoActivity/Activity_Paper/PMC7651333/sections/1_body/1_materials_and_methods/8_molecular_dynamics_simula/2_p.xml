<p>The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on three proteins, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, S-protein and ACE2 receptor proteins. Nelfinavir was selected as a common inhibitor, as it has shown a higher binding affinity with all the three target proteins. In addition to that based on the binding energies of selected bioactives from medicinal plants, withanolide A was taken for M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and taraxerol was taken for both S-protein and ACE2 to perform MD. The MD simulations were performed using the AMBER20 package (Case et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The ff14SB forcefields were applied for proteins and ions, respectively. The antechamber program was used to develop forcefield for all inhibitors using the gaff2 force field. The topology and coordinated files for protein and complex were created using the 
 <italic>tleap</italic> program. For each complex system including protein and the ligand, TIP3P water molecules were placed in a 12 Å cubic box in each direction from the surface of the protein. To neutralize the system, 4 Na
 <sup>+</sup>, 2 Cl
 <sup>–</sup> and 28 Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions were added to M
 <sup>pro</sup>, S-protein and ACE2 proteins, respectively. The combined system was submitted to 
 <italic>sander</italic> for energy minimization in four stages, using 5000 cycles steepest descent algorithm. For heating, the NVT ensemble was employed, and the temperature was gradually increased until it reached 300 K. Langevin dynamics (thermostat) with a collision frequency of 2.0 ps
 <sup>−1</sup> were employed. For the equilibration phase, the NPT ensemble was employed. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to restrict the protein backbone atoms, while inhibitor and solvent molecules allowed free movement. Further, the well-equilibrated complex molecules M
 <sup>pro</sup> with nelfinavir, M
 <sup>pro</sup> with withanolide A, S-protein with nelfinavir, S-protein with taraxerol, ACE2 with nelfinavir and ACE2 with taraxerol were subjected to the production phase without any restraints for 100 ns MD with a time step of 2 fs. Coordinates and energy parameters were saved every 2 ps during the simulation for downstream analysis. The root means square deviation (RMSD) and hydrogen bond analysis were calculated using the 
 <italic>CPPTraj</italic> module on the trajectories obtained.
