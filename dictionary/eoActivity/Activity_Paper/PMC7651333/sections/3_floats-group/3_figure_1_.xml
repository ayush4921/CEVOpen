  <p>The 2D interaction plots displaying the interacting and common amino acids of the target proteins with the standard drug nelfinavir (i), and medicinal plant bioactives withanolide A (ii), taraxerol (iii). (A) M
   <sup>pro</sup> catalytic dyad, (B) S-protein receptor-binding motif, (C) ACE2 receptor. The amino acids of target proteins within 4 Å proximity are shown, and the hydrogen bonds are represented in dotted lines and colored in green. Hydrophobic contacts are illustrated by an arc with spokes radiating towards the ligand atoms. Common amino acids are shown within red circles.
