  <p>MD simulation and MM-PBSA analysis: (A) Root mean square deviation in the positions of protein backbone atoms (in angstrom units) during the MD simulation as superposed with their respective starting structures, calculated over 100 ns trajectory. Series color codes are given in the embedded box. Binding energy (kcal/mol) calculated by MM-PBSA analysis calculated from 10 to 100 ns of the MD simulations of (B) M
   <sup>pro</sup>:nelfinavir (black) and M
   <sup>pro</sup>:withanolide A (red) complex structures, (C) S-protein:nelfinavir (black) and S-protein: taraxerol (red) complex structure and (D) ACE2-nelfinavir (black) and ACE2-taraxerol (red) complex structures.
