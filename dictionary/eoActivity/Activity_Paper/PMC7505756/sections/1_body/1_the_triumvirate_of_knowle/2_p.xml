<p id="p0050">Global medicinal plant value chains provide a classic example of coupled Human-Environment (H-E) systems with potential to exacerbate ecological perturbation. H-E interactions are associated with complex problems, as well as the role of human agency on environmental governance and sustainability assessments has gained attention in policy and implementation spaces [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We use 
 <italic>prunus africana</italic> and a number of other endemic medicinal plants, to critically examine the coupled interactions in medicinal plant value chain and associated ecological impacts. We thus extrapolate H-E interactions in medicinal value chain from political ecology angle in synthesising existing literature and providing a holistic framework for the assessment of sustainability in global medicinal value chains.
