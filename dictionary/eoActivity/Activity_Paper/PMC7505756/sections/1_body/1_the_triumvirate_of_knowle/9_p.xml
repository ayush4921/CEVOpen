<p id="p0085">Power broadly refers to processes through which individuals and collectives cooperate and collude in order to govern their affairs [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Authority captures competition for influence and ability to exert agendas by one individual or an institution over the other [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This is significant in that actors with significant presence and clout in public and private spheres may have greater opportunities to help bias the parameters of decision making to their benefit [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], or between different social groups. Biased decision making may in turn result in lost opportunities and mis-characterisation of the underlying risks [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The enactment of power could thus have negative or positive outcomes on livelihoods [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The foregoing is critical in frameworks that attempt to link value chains and environmental vulnerability assessments.
