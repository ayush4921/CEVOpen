<p id="p0285">Overexploitation of medicinal plant resources, such as 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> can be explained by Micro-social theory [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] on interdependent collective action. Since bioprospecting licensees require a critical mass of individual suppliers to reduce cost of production and maximise profits, a system that by default undermines legal, regulatory and compliance frameworks is deliberately promoted by concentrating organising effort on individuals whose potential contributions are the largest. The micro social theory on interdependent collective action can thus be contextualised in explaining how free rider behaviour is incentivised and the resulting degradation risks under evolving open resource access governance systems that emerge to replace CPR governance systems in the bioprospection and commercialisation of medicinal floral. Given that open access natural resource governance systems are characterised by uncertainty in the value chain, free riding appropriation of medicinal flora, minimises risks for competing entrepreneurs but increase ecological degradation risks.
