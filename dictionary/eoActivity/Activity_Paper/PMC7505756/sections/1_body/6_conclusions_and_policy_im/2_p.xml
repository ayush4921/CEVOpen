<p id="p0310">In this paper, we examined the interaction of power, knowledge and subjectivity on the one hand and the concept of property rights and collective action as institutional frameworks that influence ecological outcomes in medicinal plant value chains. The interactions were contextualised through a critical analysis and reference to policy failures associated with commercialisation of 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic>. We posited that value chains are critical to sustainable exploitation of medicinal plant resources. Environmental vulnerability was thus conceptualised as a cognitive attribute associated with actions and related conflict between PR systems and noncompliance outcomes arising from delocalisation processes in bioprospection initiatives. We adopted coupled H-E systems and political ecology lens to hypothesize the influence of value chain actors in degradation of endemic medicinal plant resources. Key among this is associated with lack of adequate information about consequences of human actions on the environment in coupled social-ecological interactions [

 <italic>P.Â Africana</italic> appear to require disturbance of the environment for its regeneration. This increases its vulnerability to extinction and/or loss of genetic diversity, presenting a formidable challenge to its conservation [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The analogy on high international demand as driver for increased vulnerability to overexploitation and/or extinction, breeding and governance challenges, could thus be extended to other endemic medicinal species such as 
 <italic>Ledebouria hypoxidoides, warburgia salutaris, Brackenridgea Zanguebarica and siphonochillus aethiopicus</italic>. This has implications for their exploitation, sustainability and conservation.
