<p id="p0145">In Natural Resource Management discourses, communities are viewed from different analytical lenses such as the spatial and Institutional model. Under the spatial model lenses, a community is defined as a geographically bound entity with strong bonding and interactions taking place within the spatial boundary. The institutional model [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a community is conceptualised as an entity that is concurrently embedded in both local, regional and global networking. Though global value chains are critical drivers in delocalisation processes, there exists opposing scholarly views on the impact of delocalisation on natural resources management outcomes.
