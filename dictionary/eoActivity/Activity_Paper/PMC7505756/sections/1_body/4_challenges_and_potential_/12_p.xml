<p id="p0215">The controversy between India and a USA firm (W.R.Grace &amp; Co) on the patenting of products from Neem tree (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica)</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa, commonly</italic> known as turmeric [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], is illustrative of the role documentation, biotechnology, a priori information, conflict and compliance to International conventions vis avis territorial jurisdictions on patents and the diminishing power of indigenous property rights. Though India had for a long time been identified with the IK and processing of an oil based pesticide from the neem tree, it lost the patent contest on the basis that the USA based firm had modified the IK to improve the shelf life of the active ingredients, in itself an intellectual novelty [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In contrast, it won the turmeric contest on evidence of extensive documentation of traditional knowledge databases concerning the use of the plant in the treatment of cancer. Documentation of indigenous knowledge alongside research that validates such knowledge (through documentation, clinical and efficacy trials) could thus strengthen IK and reduce biopiracy.
