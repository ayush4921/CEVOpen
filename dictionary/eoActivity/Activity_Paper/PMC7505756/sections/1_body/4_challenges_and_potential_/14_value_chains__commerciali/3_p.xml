 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> bark occurred for local medicinal use. This changed dramatically in 1972 when Plantecam, a subsidiary of the French company Laboratories Debat, obtained a monopoly over the commercial trade in 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> bark. Although commercial harvesting started to take place, a system of controlled harvest by teams of Plantecam workers was maintained. This worked relatively well until 1985 when the Government of Cameroon issued fifty additional licenses, in essence liberation and the emergence of free market regime in the exploitation of 
 <italic>P.Â africana</italic> bark. However, the licensing of additional entrepreneurs was not based on any forest inventories or assessments of sustainable harvest technologies [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The adoption of a free market model created pervasive incentives among suppliers (middlemen and local individual harvesters) and buyers. Since no incentives for seeking or maintaining stocks in their area were in place, increasing the number of permitees by default transformed CPR into an open access resource.
