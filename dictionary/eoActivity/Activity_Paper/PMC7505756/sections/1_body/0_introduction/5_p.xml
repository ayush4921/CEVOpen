<p id="p0025">The importance of medicinal plants in the provision of health care is critical in many countries [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, 80% of the South African population use traditional medicine to meet their primary health care needs, with the diverse genetic base of medicinal plants offering opportunity for bio-prospecting [

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is also reflected in medicinal commodities global value chain. Currently, the global trade value of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) is US$800 million per year and projected to grow at a rate of 15–25%, with an estimated value of US$ 50 trillion by 2050 [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], 35,000 to 70,000 plant species have been used so far as medicaments. This corresponds to 14–28% of the 250,000 plant species estimated to occur around the world. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table (1)</xref> provide some statistics [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], on the value and trends in the global value chain of Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). The figures depict various trajectories in the global medicinal value chain. While exports of medicinal plants by China between 2000 and 2015 grew 8 fold, the imports decreased by 25%.This is attributed to policy initiatives in incentivising local production, domestication and cooperative marketing of medicinal plants. For German, exports grew two-fold while imports grew fourfold in the same period suggesting expanding domestic consumption and its strategic position as a leading commercial hub in Europe. Lack of data from African countries could be as a result of poor traceability mechanisms.
