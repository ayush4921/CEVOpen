<p>Essential oils and their components are important because of their low cost, availability, and wide range of biological activities. Another advantage is that when they are used in appropriate proportions, they do not disturb the taste and aroma and thus improve the shelf-life of the food material. While antibacterial and antioxidant abilities of EOs are well documented, studies on antifungal and antimycotoxigenic activities are still limited. From the health and economical aspects, it is essential to find effective, safe, and economical antifungal agents to control both the growth and mycotoxin production of fungi. However, different results have been observed in different studies as a result of the differences in fungal cultures used during the analysis of antimicrobiological activity, geographical origin, harvesting time, part of the plant from which EO was derived, and extraction and analysis methods, and it is of critical importance to consider these parameters while working with EOs, since they affect their composition, profile, and biological activities.</p>
