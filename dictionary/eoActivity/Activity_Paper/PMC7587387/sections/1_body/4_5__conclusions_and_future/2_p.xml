<p>The use of essential oil mixtures that are designed in accordance with the characteristics of the food can be considered as a new perspective in terms of the organoleptic properties of the food. Due to the instability of EOs under environmental stresses such as temperature and light, novel technologies might be helpful to protect and improve their characteristics and biological activities. On the other hand, further studies should focus on the synergistic effects between different essential oils and/or different components, along with their action of mechanisms. Another recommendation is that besides these investigations against monocultures, it is also necessary to investigate the antifungal actions against polycultures. Lastly, new strategies for improving the stability of essential oils and decreasing the required concentration for ensuring food safety with minimal sensorial changes can be an interesting research area for researchers.</p>
