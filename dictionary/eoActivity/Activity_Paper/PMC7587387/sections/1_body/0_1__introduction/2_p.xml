<p>Food products are often contaminated not only with pathogen microorganisms but also with molds and the toxins produced by these molds. This contamination can be encountered at different stages of the food chain such as post-harvest processing, transportation, and storage stages. Similar to bacterial contamination, fungal growth and mycotoxins lead to quality and quantity defects and loss of market value in addition to their health risks. Additionally, mold invasion leads to noticeable quality and organoleptic changes (e.g., off-flavors, defects in texture and color) [

In addition to their health risks, food losses due to microbiological contamination should also be considered, especially when the increasing world population and food requirements are taken into account. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), foodborne molds and their toxic metabolites cause about 25% loss in agricultural foodstuffs worldwide [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic>) may produce secondary metabolites, called mycotoxins. Some of these mycotoxins may be lethal and they may have carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and immunosuppressive effects on humans and animals. Nonetheless, inhibition of the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi is not sufficient to obtain the safety of food, but toxin reduction should also be considered and investigated [
