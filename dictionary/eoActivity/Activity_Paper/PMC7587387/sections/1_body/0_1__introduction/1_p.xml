<p>The consumer’s tendency to buy more natural and less processed food products encouraged the food industry to use natural alternatives [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The positive health effects of EOs extracted from aromatic and medicinal plants have been known since ancient times. Several EOs and metabolites in plant extracts are accepted as “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS) [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of EOs have been investigated in several studies, and these studies have shown antimicrobial and antioxidant activities as the most common biological activities in EOs, but some other activities of EOs, including antiviral, insecticidal, angiotensin-converting enzyme, amylase and glucosidase enzyme, and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities, etc., still need more investigation. In addition to their individual use, EO combinations can be used in binary or ternary mixtures to improve the mixtures’ biological activities [
