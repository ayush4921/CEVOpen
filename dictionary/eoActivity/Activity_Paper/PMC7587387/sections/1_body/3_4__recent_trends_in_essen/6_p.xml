<p>Cheese samples were coated with sodium alginate solutions containing 1%, 2%, and 3% 
 <italic>Pimpinella saxifraga</italic> EO by dipping into sodium alginate and EO solutions for 2 min at room temperature. In the study, an acute toxicity test was conducted to evalute the use of EOs for food safety purposes with a mice model. According to the results, there was no harmful effect at 250 and 500 mg/kg; however, 750 and 1000 mg/kg concentrations resulted in some abnormal behaviour. On the other hand, the consumer acceptance of this new active edible coating was evaluated by 21 panelists using a five-point hedonic scale. The coated samples were more appreciated in terms of odor, flavor, and color without any change in the texture of the product [

 <italic>Shahri Balangu</italic> seed mucilage (SBM) solution for 1 min. Coated beef possessed several benefits in terms of better texture, reduced lipid oxidation, and total viable count. Moreover, the sensory evaluation of beef samples was also conducted with well-trained panelists by using a nine-point hedonic scale. The colors of uncoated and SBM-coated beef samples were unacceptable at the end of 9 days of storage; however, beef coated with EO-loaded SBM was found to be acceptable. In addition, while the shelf-lives of uncoated and SBM coated beef were 6 days, EO-loaded SBM coated beef had a shelf-life of 9 days [
