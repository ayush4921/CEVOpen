<p>Acosta et al. [
 <xref rid="B236-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>] studied the antifungal activity and film properties of cinnamon bark, clove, and oregano EO incorporated on starch gelatin films. EOs had no significant impact on water vapor and oxygen permeability; however, they increased the transparency of the films. The three films containing EO inhibited the growth of

 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> due to their phenolic compounds: eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol. However, cinnamon bark EO films were recommended to protect the spoilage from
