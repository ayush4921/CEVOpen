<p>Nowadays, the food industry presents a demand for EOs due to their notable applications as food preservatives [
 <xref rid="B204-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. However, their applications in foods are limited because of some distinctive properties such as strong smell, high unpredictability, poor water dissolvability, and instability [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, while EOs are unstable in the presence of light, heat, oxygen, and humidity, their volatile nature and hydrophobicity restrict their direct use in foods [

 <xref rid="B206-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. These problems could be solved by enhancing the water solubility and bioavailability, protecting bioactive compounds from extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and removing unpleasant odor and taste in order to use EOs in the food system [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. For this purpose, novel techniques can be utilized such as encapsulation, edible coating, and active packaging [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Encapsulation is a technique that first entraps one component (active agent) into another substance (wall material) and then produces particles in the nanometer (nanoencapsulation) or micrometer (microencapsulation) scale by different techniques [
 <xref rid="B208-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. A wide range of strategies could be carried out for the formulation such as polymeric particles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, liquid crystalline systems, and nanostructured lipid carriers [

 <xref rid="B207-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Additionally, nanoemulsion, micro emulsion, nanogel, solid-nano nanoparticles, and liposome methods have been currently used to encapsulate plant bioactive compounds for food preservatives [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Different physical, physicochemical, and mechanical methods have been used to encapsulate bioactive compounds. Among them, spray drying, coacervation, emulsification, and ionic gelation are the most commonly used techniques to encapsulate EOs [
 <xref rid="B209-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. In line with this, in the last few years, EOs have been incorporated with polymeric matrices to enhance their antifungal activities such as
