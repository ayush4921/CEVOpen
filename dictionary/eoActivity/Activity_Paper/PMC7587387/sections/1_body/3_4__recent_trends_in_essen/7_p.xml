<p>Mahcene et al. [
 <xref rid="B234-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>] evaluated the incorporation of EOs in sodium alginate-based edible film on an active food packaging system. Edible films were prepared by the blending of 2.5% sodium alginate film-forming solution and dispersing the EOs in the presence of Tween 80. While 
 <italic>Artemisia herba alba</italic> EO incorporation improved the thermal properties, it showed the lowest peroxide value (2.58 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg) on the packaged sunflower oil in contrast to normal packaged sunflower oil (4.719 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg). Furthermore, while EO-incorporated film had antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the highest antioxidant capacity was observed for 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> EO film with 23% in comparison with 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> EO filmâ€™s 4%. It can be understood from that study that sodium alginate edible film incorporated with EOs is an alternative for protecting food quality with increasing shelf life. In another study carried out with carbohydrate-based films, enriched EOs revealed that films with cinnamon EO had lower antioxidant activity than pure cinnamon EO due to the loss of cinnamon EO during film preparation, drying, and storage [
