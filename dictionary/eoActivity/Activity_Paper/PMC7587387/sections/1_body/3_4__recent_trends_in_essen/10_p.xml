<p>Composite films containing ginger and black pepper EOs decreased the water solubility and were more resistant to breakage with improved heat stability than PVA/GA/CS composite films [

Moreover, carboxymethyl celluloseâ€“polyvinyl alcohol films enriched with cinnamon EO showed a lower transmittance value than pure films. This was a significant property because high UV absorbance on food packaging restricts the lipid oxidation on food [
