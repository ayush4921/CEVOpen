<p>Nanoscale materials for drug preservation and controlled release such as nanogels have gained attention. Nanogels are preferred because of the features including the effectiveness of bioactive substances at lower concentrations and stability from environmental factors such as ionic strength, pH, light, and temperature [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] encapsulated the 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> EO with an encapsulating agent of chitosan and cinnamic acid by nanogel methods. The encapsulated oil showed better antifungal activity under sealed condition, while the free oils were ineffective to completely inhibit 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus.</italic> Similar to this study, encapsulated 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> EO with nanogels consisting of chitosan and benzoic acid was found to be more effective against 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>. Based on the volatility and non-stability characteristics of EOs, encapsulation technology was found to be appropriate for increasing the shelf life and improving the antifungal properties according to the study [
