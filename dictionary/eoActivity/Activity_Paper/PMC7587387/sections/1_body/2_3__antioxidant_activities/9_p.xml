<p>Additionally, it has been reported that the combination of EOs showed a synergistic effect on the antioxidant activities of EOs [

 <xref rid="B198-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Misharina and Samusenko [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>] determined the antioxidant properties of several EOs either as single or in combination (
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> L. (lemon), 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> L. (pink grapefruit), 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> L. (coriander), and 
 <italic>Caryophyllus aromaticus</italic> L. (clove buds)). In this study, it has been reported that 
 <italic>Caryophyllus aromaticus</italic> L. (clove buds) had the highest antioxidant activity within the single EOs, and indeed, combinations of EOs generally showed synergistic effects. Different antioxidant activity values of different EO combinations may be correlated with the various major and minor components present in these EOs. There are also several studies in which an isobologram analysis based on the median effect principle (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) has been used to evaluate the synergistic antioxidant effect of the EOs including the mixture of 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> (coriander) and 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> (cumin) seed EOs [
 <xref rid="B200-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>] and a combination of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylancium</italic> (cinnamon) and 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (clove) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In both studies, a synergistic effect on antioxidant activity was observed, and the results were associated with the constituents of EOs.
