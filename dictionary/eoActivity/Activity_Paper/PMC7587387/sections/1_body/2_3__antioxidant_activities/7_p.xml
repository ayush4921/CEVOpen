<p>According to Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B188-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>], the two major constituents of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. (black cumin) are thmoquinone (37.6%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (31.4%). There are studies performed in the past, up until recent years, investigating the antioxidant characteristics of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. (black cumin) [

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. (black cumin) EO has been mentioned. 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (basil) is another plant EO that has been used in recent antioxidant studies [

 <xref rid="B193-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Ahmed et al. [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>] observed that although the EOs of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (basil) collected from several regions have the same three major components—linalool, estragole, and methyl cinnamate—the difference in their percentages were interpreted as a reason for the significant differences in their antioxidant activities.
