<p>Recently, many research studies have been carried out about the antioxidant activity of different EOs. The total phenol (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), total flavonol, phenolic acid, catechin, lignan, and tannin contents of EOs have been the main parameters measured while evaluating the antioxidant properties. There are several methods used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of EOs obtained from different plants; however, differences in these methods may lead to different results that make comparisons difficult, and thus, investigations on the modification and improvement of these methods still continue to provide the most reliable technique [
