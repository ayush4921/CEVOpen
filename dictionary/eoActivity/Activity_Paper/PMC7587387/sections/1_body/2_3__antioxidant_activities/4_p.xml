 <xref rid="B163-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] were reported to be related with the composition of EOs. Kallel et al. [
 <xref rid="B164-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume (cinnamon) EO was composed of different monoterpenes (such as Î±-pinene) and sesquiterpenes, which were responsible for the remarkable antioxidative activity of cinnamon as also observed in the study of Tepe and Ozaslan [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. In this study, it was shown that the antioxidant activity is the result of not only major components but also of the minors.
