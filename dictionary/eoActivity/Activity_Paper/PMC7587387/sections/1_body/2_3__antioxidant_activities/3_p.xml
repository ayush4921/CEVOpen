<p>In a study by Kulisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], the antioxidant properties of the oregano EO were determined by using the β-carotene bleaching (BCB), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assays. The tested oregano EO exhibited a different antioxidant power. While oregano EO showed low radical scavenging activity by DPPH assay, in another study conducted by Asensio et al. [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], the antioxidant capacities of EOs of four different oregano species from different regions of Argentina (
 <italic>Origanum x majoricum</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Vulgare</italic>, and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> clones) were investigated by using 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), β-carotene bleaching, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, and it was concluded that the geographical difference is a significant factor on the antioxidant activity of studied species. This phenomenon was also reported by several other researchers [

 <xref rid="B154-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>,
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. In addition to the geographical origin of the plant, harvesting time is another factor that may affect the antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. From this point of view, Ozkan et al. [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] revealed the free radical scavenging activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 116.74–132.93 µg/mL) and reducing antioxidant capacities (23.54–31.02 mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE)/g EO) of EOs from Turkish oregano (
 <italic>Origanum onites</italic> L.) seeds differed based on the harvesting time. In the same study, some selected Turkish oregano samples were also found to be rich in potential natural antioxidant components such as rosmarinic acid. Moreover, carvacrol and thymol have also been reported as the main components that are correlated with the antioxidant activity of origanum EO [

 <xref rid="B158-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. These components are the dominant phenolic compounds present not only in origanum EO but also in EO from 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species. Several 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species were found rich in both carvacrol and thymol and observed to have a high antioxidant activity including 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and 
 <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. On the other hand, although Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Zouari et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported that these components were either absent or at a low amount in the composition of 
 <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> L. Boiss. et Reut, its EO was indicated as an alternative source of natural antioxidants. The part of the plant where EOs are obtained is another important factor determining their chemical composition and antioxidant activity. For example, different parts of cinnamon such as the bark, leaf, flower, and root may be used in order to obtain its EO, which may result with different concentrations of bioactive components and thus antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. It should also be considered that there could be different methods applied while obtaining EOs from their sources. Deng et al. [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] worked on the impact of the molecular distillation method on the antioxidant characteristics of cold-pressed 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> Macf. (grapefruit) EO as measured by DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.06 mg/mL) and ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.72 mg/mL) methods. The results indicated that this technology could be a good alternative to obtain EOs, depending on the usage area, with proper compositions and without an adverse effect on the antioxidant activity.
