 <xref rid="B177-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] examined the antioxidant activities of several citrus EOs and compared their activities based on the results of DPPH and ABTS methods. 
 <italic>Citrus maxima</italic> (honey pomelo) showed the lowest antioxidant activity according to both methods. On the other hand, while 
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> var. 
 <italic>sarcodactylis Swing</italic> (bergamot) was the EO showing strong antioxidant activity by DPPH assay, 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> L. (lime) had the highest antioxidant activity results based on the ABTS method. As also mentioned above, it is clear that the antioxidant activity may also vary among EOs depending on the performed analysis method.
