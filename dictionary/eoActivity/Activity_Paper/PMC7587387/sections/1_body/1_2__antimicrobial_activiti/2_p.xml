<p>Regarding the mechanism of action, it has been suggested that EOs can affect the cell membrane of bacterial and fungal cultures. The antimicrobial activity of EOs occurs in the way that they can easily disrupt the cell membrane and make it more permeable [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, they interrupt ion transport processes and they have interaction with membrane proteins and other compounds within the cell [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. EOs also have adverse effects on enzymes by acting on their active sites [

 <sup>2+</sup>, and Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was also claimed that the antimicrobial effects of EOs may be related to the diffusion ability of EOs (diffusion coefficient, zeta potential, and droplet size of EOs) through the cell membrane of microorganisms [

Although the antimicrobial action mechanisms of EOs were well established in the literature, there is not sufficient information for the action of the antimycotoxigenic mechanism. However, several approaches have been reported in recent works. In one of these studies, the antimycotoxigenic action mechanism of EOs was directly correlated with their influence on the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway [
