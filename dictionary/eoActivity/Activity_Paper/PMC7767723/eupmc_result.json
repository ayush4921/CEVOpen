    "<h4>Introduction</h4>Pain and inflammatory disorders are the most prevalent syndromes. Different herbs were used for treatment of pain and inflammation including members of the genus <i>Otostegia</i>. As a result, this research investigated the <i>in vivo</i> analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of 80% methanol leaf extract of <i>Otostegia integrifolia</i> in mice.<h4>Methods</h4>The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the plant was evaluated using hot plate method, acetic-acid induced writhing test, and carrageenan and formalin induced paw edema. Three experimental groups (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) received the extract while morphine 10 mg/kg and aspirin 150 mg/kg were used as a positive control for analgesic and anti-inflammatory tests accordingly. Distilled water (10 mL/kg) was used as negative control.<h4>Results</h4>From the experimental groups, OI400 displayed significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities (<i>P</i><0.001). In acetic acid induced writhing tests, the number of writhes decreased significantly (<i>P</i><0.001) in all experimental groups. Similarly, OI400 reduced the mean paw edema significantly in carrageenan and formalin induced paw edema (<i>P</i><0.05 and <i>P</i><0.001, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In general, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the extract exhibited significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential in mice."
