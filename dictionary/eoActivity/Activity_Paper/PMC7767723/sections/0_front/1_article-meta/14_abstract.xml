  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Pain and inflammatory disorders are the most prevalent syndromes. Different herbs were used for treatment of pain and inflammation including members of the genus 
   <italic>Otostegia</italic>. As a result, this research investigated the 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of 80% methanol leaf extract of 
   <italic>Otostegia integrifolia</italic> in mice.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the plant was evaluated using hot plate method, acetic-acid induced writhing test, and carrageenan and formalin induced paw edema. Three experimental groups (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) received the extract while morphine 10 mg/kg and aspirin 150 mg/kg were used as a positive control for analgesic and anti-inflammatory tests accordingly. Distilled water (10 mL/kg) was used as negative control.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>From the experimental groups, OI400 displayed significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). In acetic acid induced writhing tests, the number of writhes decreased significantly (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in all experimental groups. Similarly, OI400 reduced the mean paw edema significantly in carrageenan and formalin induced paw edema (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively).

  <p>In general, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the extract exhibited significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential in mice.</p>
