<p>Inflammation follows a triphasic pattern where the first phase is acute inflammatory condition characterized by extravasation of exudates from blood to interstitial space. The second phase is the subacute stage distinguished by permeation of leukocytes to the tissue and the final phase is the chronic phase marked by granuloma formation.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Carrageenan-induced paw edema is considered as an important model to assess acute inflammatory conditions. Carrageenan being a typical phlogistic agent, this test was employed to assess the anti-inflammatory prospect of candidate substances.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Carrageenan works by releasing inflammatory mediators, in particular, histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins from mast cells as well as paracrine cells followed by release and permeation of cytokines, nitric oxide and neutrophils to the site of inflammation.
