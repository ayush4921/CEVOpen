<p>The increase in dose of the extract resulted in increased anti-inflammatory potential as shown by reduced paw edema volume and percentage inhibition. This could be attributed to the presence of sufficient concentration of active ingredient at the site of inflammation while the overall activity of the extract could be ascribed to inhibition of chemotactic factors and proinflammatory mediators through attenuating the lipoxygenase and the cyclooxygenases pathways.</p>
