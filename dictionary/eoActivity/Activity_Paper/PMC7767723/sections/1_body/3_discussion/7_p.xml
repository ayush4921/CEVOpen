<p>In carrageenan-induced paw edema, OI200 and OI400 revealed significant anti-inflammatory characteristics as it is corroborated with reduced paw edema and increased percent edema protection. As time increased the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts was exposed particularly for OI200 and OI400, this perhaps indicates that the minimum dose to elicit the anti-inflammatory effect is more than 200 mg/kg. In addition, the delay in effect until three hours could be attributed to the pharmacokinetic dynamics via which the extract needs to undergo. The intensity of the extracts effect is comparable with aspirin (ASA150) both in terms of reduction of paw edema as well as percent edema protection (
