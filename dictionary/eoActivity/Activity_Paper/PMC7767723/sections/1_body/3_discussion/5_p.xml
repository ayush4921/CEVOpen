<p>In the writhing method the OI100, OI200 and OI400 groups brings about significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) analgesia revealed by decrement of percentage writhing number 41.6%, 66%, and 67.3% respectively compared to the negative control. The latter two groups also recorded significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) peripheral analgesia as comparable as ASA150; this perhaps explicates the rise in the level of secondary metabolites responsible for the recorded activity. In addition, compared to the DW group all the experimental groups significantly reduced the writhing. The mechanism behind acetic acid induced abdominal writhing is mediated through increased production of prostaglandins. This may indicate that the extract may elicit its action on peripherally situated pain transduction pathways through suppression of prostaglandin synthesis.
