<p>One of the classic tools for the assessment of peripheral analgesia is acetic acid induced writhing method.

Consequently the reaction of the mice follows with abdominal contraction and hind paw stretching. The release of prostaglandins specifically PGE2 and PGF2 as well as leukotrienes yielded from lipoxygenases are responsible for stimulation of chemosensitive nociceptors.
