<p>As it is illustrated by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">2</xref>, in anti-inflammatory test conducted using carrageenan-caused edema revealed that the hydroalcoholic plant extract endowed promising anti-inflammatory attributes. After administration of carrageenan, until three hours both the test substance as well as ASA150 did not exhibit remarkable anti-inflammatory activity. Later on as depicted on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>, at three hours, OI400 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and ASA150 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) demonstrated significant reduction in paw edema. The percent protection of paw edema at three hours was 24.5%, 50.8%, and 53.8% for OI200, OI400, and ASA150, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). At four hours, OI200 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), OI400 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) and ASA150 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) produced significant paw edema reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). Percent protection of paw edema at four hours was 24.2%, 50.4%, 75.7%, and 80.6% for OI100, OI200, OI400 and ASA150, respectively (
