Then the solution was filtered with Whatman no. 1 filter paper and concentrated under reduced pressure using Rota evaporator (Buchilabortechnik AG, Switzerland) at a temperature not more than 40°C. The concentrated extract was freeze-dried using a lyophilizer (Heto Power Dry LL3000 freeze-dryer, USA) to yield a sticky and brown extract weighing 30.12 g (16.6%).
