<p>Subacute inï¬‚ammation was induced by subplantar administration of formalin (0.02 mL of 2% v/v, in distilled water) into the right hind paw of mice at the first and third days of observations. Then a mark was placed at the level of lateral malleolus on the right hind paw before formalin induction. Thus, during the observation period, the injected paw would be immersed to the same extent in the measurement chamber of the plethysmometer. After that, each test substance (extract, the standard drug and the vehicle) was administered one hour before formalin injection for seven consecutive days according to their grouping. After one hour of administration the paw volume was measured daily using the plethysmometer until the seventh day and the percentage of edema inhibition was calculated using the above formula.
