<p id="p0080">The findings demonstrated that methanolic extracts displayed effective antileishmanial activities with a dose-response effect against the promastigote stage of L. 
 <italic>tropica</italic> at all concentrations used; particularly 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> showed the lowest viability of promastogotes at concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg/mL (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The OD values at different concentrations (10, 100 and 1000 μg/mL) of the three medicinal extracts were significantly lower than the corresponding untreated control groups (
 <italic>P</italic> ˂ 0.001). All extracts exhibited similar pattern of action in reducing tetrazolium; although, Glucantime® exerted more profound activity compared with the control group. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> was 132.6 μg/mL, followed by 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> 248.1 μg/mL and 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> 571.2 μg/mL against promastigotes, whereas this value was 588.3 μg/mL for Glucantime® (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As shown, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> and 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> represented significant lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> compared to Glucantime® as control drug (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> did not. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for both extracts and Glucantime® was 10 μg/mL (the least dose inhibited the growth rates of L. 
 <italic>tropica</italic> stages, in the present investigation).
