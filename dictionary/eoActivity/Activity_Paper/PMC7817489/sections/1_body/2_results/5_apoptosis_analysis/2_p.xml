<p id="p0090">The results showed that the medicinal extracts displayed different PCD effect on promastigotes of L. 
 <italic>tropica</italic>. The percent of apoptosis at 1000 μg/mL for 
 <italic>Q. velutiona</italic>, 
 <italic>C.procera</italic>, 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and Glucantime® were 37.4%, 18.6%, 8.5% and 52.4%, respectively. Glucantime® induced more apoptotic effect than the plant extracts. Also, 
 <italic>Q. velutiona</italic> represented higher apoptotic effect compared to other extracts (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The apoptotic value of residual methanol used in the plant extracts was negligible (2.3%). Interestingly, the PCD was conversely incremented by increasing the concentration of Glucantime® (
