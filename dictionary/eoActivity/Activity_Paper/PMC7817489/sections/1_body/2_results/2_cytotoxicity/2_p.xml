 <italic>In vitro</italic> susceptibility assay displayed no significant cytotoxicity effect in our extracts, as the selectivity index (SI) was 16.2, 7.67, 7.12 and 1.01 for 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic>, 
 <italic>C. procera</italic>, 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and Glucantime®, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SI ≥10 was considered nontoxic. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> represented the highest viability of J774 cells in various concentrations compared to the other extracts and Glucantime®. Besides, Glucantime® caused significant lower viability of J774 cells in comparison to three plant extracts, especially in the last four concentrations (
