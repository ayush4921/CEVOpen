<p id="p0025">Apoptosis, as programmed cell death (PCD) is evolved for regulation of cell growth and development in kinetoplastids including 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species similar to other eukaryotes (

 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al., 2017</xref>). This process is an essential effector mechanism which can play a crucial role to trigger innate and adaptive cell responses against the parasite forms. Further elucidation of the PCD in 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> organisms could provide valuable information on biochemical pathways and pathological mechanisms. This could be used to target new drugs for growth limitation of the causative agents and in turn control of the diseases. A typical procedure for detecting phosphatidylserine (PS) is the use of the annexin V. It is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein which attaches with high affinity to PS of apoptotic promastigotes as demonstrated by flow cytometry (
