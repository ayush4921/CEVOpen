<p id="p0060">200 μl of murine macrophages (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were added to the 6-chamber plates containing sterile slides, following incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h. Then, 200 μl (25 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) stationary phase promastigotes were added to macrophages with the ratio of 5:1 for 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>/macrophage, and incubated in the same condition for 24 h. After this incubation period, free parasites were removed by pipetting fresh medium, and the infected macrophages were treated with 70 μl of methanolic extracts and MA in different concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/mL) at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 72 h. Ultimately, treated slides were fixed with methanol, dried, Giemsa stained and precisely examined by using a light microscope. Also, amastigote-infected macrophages with no extracts and macrophages with no parasite and extracts were considered as positive and negative groups, respectively. The anti-amastigote inhibitory effect of the extracts was evaluated by calculating the mean number of amastigotes within each cell of 100 macrophages compared to positive control, in triplicates (

 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated for all the extracts by the probit test in the SPSS software.
