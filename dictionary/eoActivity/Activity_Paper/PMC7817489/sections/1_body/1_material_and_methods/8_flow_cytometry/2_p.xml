<p id="p0065">For determination of apoptosis in promastigotes, we used Apoptosis Detection kit of PI Annexin V- fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Cytoplasmic membrane of the apoptotic cell can be structurally altered by exposing phosphatidylserine on their surface, which can be detected by annexin V (

 <sup>6</sup> promastigotes were seeded in 1.5 mL micro tubes with RPMI-1640 and 10% FBS, then each plant extract or Glucantime ®at 1000 μg/mL concentration were added. We incubated them at 24 °C for 72 h. After this time, promastigotes were centrifuged, washed three times with PBS and resuspended with 1 mL binding buffer. At last, we added annexin V (5 μl) to the reaction and incubated at room temperature (25 °C) in dark condition for 20 min. The results were read by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Cell Quest software. In parallel, settings of untreated and negative control were used.
