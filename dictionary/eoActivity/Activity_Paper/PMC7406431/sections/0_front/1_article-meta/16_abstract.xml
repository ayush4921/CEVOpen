 <p>Nature as an infinite treasure of chemotypes and pharmacophores will continue to play an imperative role in the drug discovery. Natural products (NPs) such as plant and fungal metabolites have emerged as leads in drug discovery during recent years due to their efficacy, safety and selectivity. The current review summarizes natural sources as well as pharmacological potential of hispolon which is a major constituent of traditional medicinal mushroom 
  <italic>Phellinus linteus</italic>. The study aims to update the scientific community about recent developments of hispolon in the arena of natural drugs by providing insights into its present status in therapeutic pursuits. Hispolon, a polyphenol has been reported to possess anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. It fights against cancer 
  <italic>via</italic> induction of apoptosis, halting cell cycle and inhibition of metastasis by targeting various cellular signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-ÎºB. The current review proposes that hispolon provides a novel opportunity for pharmacological applications and its styrylpyrone carbon skeleton might serve as an attractive scaffold for drug development. However, future researches are recommended to assess bioavailability, toxicological limits, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of hispolon, in order to establish its potential as a potent multi-targeted drug in the near future.
