<p id="p0140">Conclusively, hispolon is a smaller molecule with greater potential and more cell specificity. Since its first isolation in 1996 till now its cytotoxic potential against thirteen different types of cancers has been reported. As more than 200 types of cancers are known, thus, its efficacy against other cancers should also be investigated. Critical analysis of IC
 <sub>50</sub> of hispolon against cancers revealed that it possess very good efficacy against breast cancer, suggesting that further studies should be conducted to validate its potential against breast cancer. Hispolon targets multiple pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-ÎºB in cancer cells to induce apoptosis and reduce their metastatic capabilities. Regarding the disease complexity, cancer is more likely to be alleviated or healed though simultaneous modulation of multiple targets, in this context hispolon might emerge as an attractive scaffold for the development of a multitargeted anticancer drug. The reported data suggests that hispolon possess significant efficacy as well as safety for its pharmacological applications. Thus, it would be worthwhile to conduct further studies to determine the bioavailability, toxicological limits and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) profile of hispolon to fill the room of knowledge for its validation as a potential anticancer agent.
