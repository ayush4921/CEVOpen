 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hoesel and Schmid, 2013</xref>). An inhibitor protein known as IκB interacts with NF-κB in cytoplasm to control the translocation and subsequent activity of NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB and its translocation towards nucleus is controlled by IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Once in the nucleus, NF-κB binds to target DNA and induce transcriptional activation of various genes involved in cell growth and inflammation, thus, playing an imperative role in cancer and inflammatory disorders (
