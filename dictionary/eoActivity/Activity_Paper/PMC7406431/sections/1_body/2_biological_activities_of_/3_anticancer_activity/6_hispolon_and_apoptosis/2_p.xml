<p id="p0080">Apoptosis is a highly systemized mode of cell death that is characterized by energy-dependent biochemical events and distinct morphological characteristics (

 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Wong, 2011</xref>). The two majorly described apoptotic pathways are extrinsic/death receptor pathways and intrinsic/mitochondrial-mediated pathway (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Baig et al., 2016</xref>). Extrinsic cellular pathway is characterized by the activation of death signaling ligands such as Fas-L (Fas ligand) (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jan and Chaudhry, 2019</xref>). The intrinsic pathway is mediated by Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family members such as activation of mitochondrial membrane bounded Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) and inactivation of Bcl-2 stimulate the discharge of cytochrome c which in turn activates initiator and effector caspases to induce the apoptosis (
