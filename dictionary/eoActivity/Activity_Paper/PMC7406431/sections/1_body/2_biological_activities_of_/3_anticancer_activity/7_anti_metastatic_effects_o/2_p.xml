<p id="p0110">Metastasis is a primary cause of mortalities and most complicated obstacle in the development of effective cancer therapies (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Metastasis is characterized by four important steps: detachment, migration and adhesion of cancer cells to secondary sites. Cancer cell motility, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) serve as initiating factors for metastatic transformations (
