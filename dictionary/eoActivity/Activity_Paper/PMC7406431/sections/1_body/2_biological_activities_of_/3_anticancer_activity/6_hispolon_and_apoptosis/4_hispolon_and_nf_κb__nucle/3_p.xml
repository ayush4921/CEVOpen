<p id="p0095">Hispolon reduced the phosphorylation of IκBα which suppressed the translocation of NF-κB towards nucleus. Inhibition of NF-κB translocation down-regulated the expression of its down-stream encoded protein, MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) which reduced the invasive capabilities of MDA-MB231 cells (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Although inhibition of IκB has been reported as a possible mechanism of hispolon induced NF-κB inhibition, however the alteration in phosphorylation of p65 or p50 subunits by hispolon to deactivate NF-κB translocation needs to be investigated.
