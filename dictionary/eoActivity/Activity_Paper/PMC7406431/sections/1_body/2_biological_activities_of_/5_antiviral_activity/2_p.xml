<p id="p0125">The emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics arouses the urgent need to develop effective anti-viral therapeutics (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2004</xref>). In addition, viruses also contribute to 15% of the total human cancers (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Liao, 2006</xref>). In this context, nature-derived agents have potential to prevent and treat viral infections (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Sencanski et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that hispolon exhibits significant anti-viral activity (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Hispolon, isolated from ethanolic extracts of
