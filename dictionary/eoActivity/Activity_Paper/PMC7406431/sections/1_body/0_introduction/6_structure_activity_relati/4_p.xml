<p id="p0040">DFT (density-functional theory) and docking studies displayed that the different types of alkyl groups in alcoholic moiety of hispolon and its analogues has a great influence on the increment of activity as an electron-donating moieties including –
 <bold>OME</bold>, -
 <bold>OH</bold>, -
 <bold>OAc</bold> increased the activity as compared to electron-withdrawing group as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (

 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Weia et al., 2020</xref>). These groups have different influences on activity as calculated by DFT. Introduction of the ester group raise the activity initially but at a specific length of alkyl chain in ester group has decrease effect. With the increase of alkyl chain in place of –
 <bold>OMe, -OH</bold> or –
 <bold>OAc</bold> reduce the activity by enhancing non-polar and less polar effect as compared to methoxy, hydroxyl and acetate group (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, SAR studies displayed that the tertiary alkyl groups showed greater activity as compared to linear alkyl groups due to the stearic hindrance that leads to improve the activity. Similarly, phenyl substitution enhances the activity while cyclohexyl decreases the activity. Similarly, by comparison of benzyl group and simple alkyl group, it has been observed that the benzyl group increases the activity more than a simple alkyl group (
