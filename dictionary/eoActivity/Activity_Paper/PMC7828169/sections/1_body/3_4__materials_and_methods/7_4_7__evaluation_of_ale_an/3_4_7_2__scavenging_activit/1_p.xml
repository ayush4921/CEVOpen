<p>The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical scavenging activity assay was carried out using the method described by Li et al., with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical cation was generated by a reaction between 7 mmol/L ABTS and 2.45 mmol/L potassium persulfate. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand in the dark for 16 h at room temperature. The working solution was prepared by diluting the previous solution with ethanol to an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.020 at 734 nm before use. The diluted sample (50 µL) was mixed with 1.9 mL of the diluted ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution. The absorbance value was determined at 734 nm after 6 min of the reaction. BHT and ascorbic acid were used as positive controls.
