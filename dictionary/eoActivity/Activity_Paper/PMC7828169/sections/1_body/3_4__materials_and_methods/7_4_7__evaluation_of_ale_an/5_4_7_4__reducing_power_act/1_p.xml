<p>The reductive potential of ALE was determined following the method of Bounatirou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Different concentrations of ALE were mixed with phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, 0.2 M, and pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide (2.5 mL, 1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Trichloroacetic acid (10%, 2.5 mL) was added to the mixture and centrifuged for 10 min at 1200×

 <sub>3</sub> (0.5 mL, 0.1%), and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (700 nm). The extract concentration providing 0.5 of absorbance (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by plotting the absorbance at 700 nm against the corresponding ALE concentration. BHT and ascorbic acid were used as reference compounds.
