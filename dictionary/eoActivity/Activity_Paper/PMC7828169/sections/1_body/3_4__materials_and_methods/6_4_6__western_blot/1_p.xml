<p>B16 melanoma cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per 100-mm petri dish and cultivated overnight. The medium was then replaced by medium without (control) or with α-MSH (0.2 µM) or ALE (30 µg/mL). After incubation of B16 cells for 48 h or 72 h, RIPA buffer, containing a protease inhibitor cocktail, was used to harvest the total protein. Extracted protein samples (10 µg) were separated via SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF membranes. These membranes were incubated with anti-TYR, anti-TRP1, anti-DCT, or anti-GAPDH primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); then detected by adding anti-mouse or anti-goat secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Proteins were visualized using the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).
