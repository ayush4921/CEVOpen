<p>Phenols composition of ALE was determined using UPLC-ESI-HRMS. Samples were run on an UPLC Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lissieu, France) equipped with a column Acquity UPLC BEH C
 <sub>18</sub> (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm) (Waters, Guyancourt, France). The elution was performed using a binary gradient system consisting of acidified water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O/HCOOH, 99:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and acetonitrile at a constant flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The elution started with 5% acetonitrile and increased to 100% in 12 min. The injection volume of the sample was 10 µL. The detection wavelength was set at 280 and 320 nm with a diode-array UV detector. Mass spectrometry measurements were performed on a Waters Xevo G2Qtof (Waters, France). High resolution mass spectra were recorded in negative ion mode, under the following operating conditions: capillary voltage, 2.5 kV; cone voltage, 30 V; extraction cone, 2 V; ion source temperature, 130 °C. The spectra were acquired in the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> range of 100–1200. Analyses were monitored using the Chromeleon software 6.60 (Dionex, COUNTRY).
