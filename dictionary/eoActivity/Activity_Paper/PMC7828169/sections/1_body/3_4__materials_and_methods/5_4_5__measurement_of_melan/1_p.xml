<p>The melanin content of B16 cells was investigated using the method described in Villareal et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per 100-mm petri dish and incubated overnight for adhesion. The medium was replaced with medium containing α-MSH (0.2 µM) or ALE (0, 10, 20, 30 µg/mL) and incubated for 48 h or 72 h. After removing the medium, the cells were harvested by trypsinization. The harvested cells were then centrifuged and the growth medium discarded. The pelleted cells were lysed by sonication after addition of 0.1% Triton X-100. The melanin was then precipitated by addition of 10% trichloroacetate and dissolved in 8 N NaOH with incubation for 2 h at 80 °C. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 410 nm and the melanin content was determined using a standard curve for synthetic melanin. The results were expressed as a percentage of the control. The cell viability and total cell count were measured using the ViaCount Program of Guava PCA (GE Healthcare, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
