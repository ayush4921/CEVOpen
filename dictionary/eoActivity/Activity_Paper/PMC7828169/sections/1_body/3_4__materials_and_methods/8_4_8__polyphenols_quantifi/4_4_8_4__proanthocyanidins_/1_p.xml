<p>Proanthocyanidins concentration was determined according to the method described by Waterman and Mole [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Butanol reagent was prepared by mixing 70 mg ferrous sulphate (FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>) with 5 mL concentrated HCl and made to 100 mL with 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol. The extract (0.1 mL) was mixed with 1.4 mL of butanol reagent. The mixture was heated at 95 Â°C in a water bath for 45 min. The mixture was then cooled, 0.5 mL 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol was added and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Results were expressed as cyanidin equivalents (CYE) per g of DM.
