<p>Total flavonoids content of ALE was determined according to the method described by Kim et al., with some modification [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, 200 µL of extract was mixed with 800 µL of distilled water in a test tube, and 60 µL of a 5% sodium nitrite solution was added. After 5 min, 40 µL of a 10% aluminum chloride solution was added and the mixture was allowed to stand for a further 5 min before 0.4 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (1 M) was added. The mixture was brought to 0.5 mL with distilled water and mixed well. The absorbance was measured immediately at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer. Total flavonoid content was calculated from a calibration curve using catechin as a standard, and expressed as mg catechin equivalents (CTE) per g of DM.
