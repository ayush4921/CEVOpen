<p>To evaluate the antioxidant activity of an extract, one test is not sufficient since various mechanisms are involved in the antioxidant action such as scavenging of free radicals, sequestering transition metal ions, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, etc. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, four different tests representing different antioxidant mechanisms were used: DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assays in which the ability of ALE to reduce both radicals by transferring, respectively, a hydrogen or an electron was assessed; the Î²-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching assay, in which the potential of ALE to delay lipid peroxidation was evaluated; and the reducing power assay, in which the potential of ALE to reduce iron ion Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> was appraised.
