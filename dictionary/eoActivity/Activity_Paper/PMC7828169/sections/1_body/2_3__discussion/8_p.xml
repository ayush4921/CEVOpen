<p>Fourteen phenolic compounds were identified in ALE, of which six compounds have not yet been reported to be present in ALE: gallic acid, (+)-gallocatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside, and quercetin. Myricetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside, myricitrin, quercitrin, myricetin, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, and rutin (quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside) have already been reported to be present in argan leaves [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other phenolic compounds, such as hyperoside have not been detected in the ALE used in this study but their presence in ALE has been reported [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The detection of previously unreported compounds could be due to the differences in the phenotype, and/or geographical origin of the argan leaves [
