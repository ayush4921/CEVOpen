<p>The significant melanogenesis stimulation activity of ALE is correlated with its strong antioxidant capacity and may be related to its high content of polyphenols; a relationship that has been demonstrated by other studies for plants extracts. Hence, argan leaves may be a potential option for the treatment of hypopigmentation disorders and may be used as a bioactive component of self-tanning cosmetic products. Further studies would be needed to clearly define the molecular mechanism of ALE and to examine whether, topically applied, argan leaves can enhance human skin pigmentation under clinical or physiological conditions. We report in this study, for the first time, that in addition to previously reported phenolic compounds, gallic acid, (+)-gallocatechin, (âˆ’)-epigallocatechin, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside, and quercetin are also present in ALE.
