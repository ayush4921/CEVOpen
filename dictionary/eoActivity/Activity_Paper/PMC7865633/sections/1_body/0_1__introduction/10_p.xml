<p>In this regard, based on the recent analysis gathered on SARS-CoV-2 targets [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we focused on natural compounds under clinical trials in the first section. Meanwhile, in the second section, we provided in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico results of the natural derivatives against SARS-CoV-2. This analysis may help to figure out the most promising natural products which lead to the development of drugs for the treatment or prophylaxis of the emergent pandemic. Since the drug repurposing is a time-saving medicinal chemistry strategy, it could offer an excellent opportunity to obtain useful and non-toxic drugs to fight COVID-19.
