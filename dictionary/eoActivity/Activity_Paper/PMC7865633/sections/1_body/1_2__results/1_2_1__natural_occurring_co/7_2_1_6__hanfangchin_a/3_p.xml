<p>TET was excluded by in silico studies because it violated three drug-likeness properties reported in Lipinski’s Rule of 5. In detail, it showed a LogP value of 6.4, and the increase of lipophilicity property can result in a probable lack of selectivity and attrition in drug development [

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The promising pharmacological efficacy as anti-COVID-19 agent was demonstrated in Vero E6 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.2 µM), Huh-7 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.64 µM), and HEK293T (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.56 µM) cells transduced with ACE2. Furthermore, exceptional levels of synergy with remdesivir have been reported [
