<p>In particular, the capability of quercetin to inhibit the proteases of SARS-CoV-2 was discussed. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, docking studies highlighted quercetin as able to accommodate into this target binding site, establishing hydrogen bonds with Asn142, Ser144, and Met165. Also, hydrophobic contacts were established with Met49, Phe140, Leu141, and electrostatic interactions were engaged with His164 and Glu166 residues. The likelihood to interfere in the proteolytic activity of Mpro could be attributed to the destabilizing effect of quercetin into the catalytic pocket. It occurs due to its ability to adopt multiple binding poses, resulting in a favourable entropy gain. Strong experimental evidence validated this theoretical hypothesis [
