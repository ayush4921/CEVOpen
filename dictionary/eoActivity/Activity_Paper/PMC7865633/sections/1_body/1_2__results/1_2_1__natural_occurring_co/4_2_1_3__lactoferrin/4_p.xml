<p>LF is active against broad-spectrum viruses, including coronavirus [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, LF has received the attention of the scientific community in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploring the possible mechanisms of action involving LF, a computational investigation suggested its possible effect in the early stages of the infection. Indeed, by 2D-Zernike descriptors of molecular surfaces of sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane, ACE2, S, M, and E proteins, it was highlighted that LF could affect the viral attachment to the host cell due to its probable competition with the virus in the binding to sialic acid [

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Additionally, potential competition between ACE2 and LF in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike was suggested. This is probably due to two high complementarity regions in the

 <italic>C-</italic> terminal domains of the Spike protein to LF [
