Furthermore, upcoming studies demonstrated its anti-inflammatory properties, being able to inhibit pro-inflammatory mediators production, including IL-6, TNF-α, and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling responses [

Altogether, the biological effects shown by vitamin C may help to inhibit the “cytokine storm” observed in the SARS-CoV-2 patients and to improve the host’s immunity. A meta-analysis of 29 clinical trials reported that vitamin C decreased the duration of the common cold by 8% in adults and 14% in children [
