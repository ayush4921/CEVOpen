<p>Besides, the same authors reported in a meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials that vitamin C reduces the length of the intensive care unit stay by 7.8% and the duration of mechanical aided ventilation [

Emerging evidence, carried out on a small clinical trial with 54 critical COVID-19 patients, demonstrated that high dose vitamin C infusion decreased the IL-6 level, concluding that this therapeutical regimen may provide a protective clinical effect without any adverse events in critical COVID-19 patients [

According to the authors, a significant decrease in intensive care unit stay and hospital mortality was observed in the vitamin C treated patients [
