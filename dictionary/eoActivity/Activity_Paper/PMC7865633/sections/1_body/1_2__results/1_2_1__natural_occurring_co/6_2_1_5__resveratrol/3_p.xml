<p>Docking results highlighted its strong interactions with crucial residues involved in the binding between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor, establishing two hydrogen bonds with Lys353 of S protein and Gly496 of ACE2 receptor. The structural stability of resveratrol at its interface binding pose was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulations [
