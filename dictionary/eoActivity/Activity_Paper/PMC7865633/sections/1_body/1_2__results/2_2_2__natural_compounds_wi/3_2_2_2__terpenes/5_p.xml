<p>The experimental results found that the incubation of the Spike-ACE2 complex with these naturally occurring triterpenoids reduced the Spike-ACE2 binding in a concentration-dependent way. Among all the compounds mentioned, 
 <bold>betulinic and oleanolic acid</bold> showed significant inhibition at a concentration of 0.1 µM and 10 µM, respectively [
