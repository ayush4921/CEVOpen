<p>A few weeks later, after the outbreak of the pandemic, natural occurring compounds deriving from different chemical-diverse scaffolds showed promising data against SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. However, as most scientific efforts provided computational studies without any experimental validation, the hope is that further in-vitro and in-vivo experiments will be performed. In this perspective, this section aims to summarize the results extrapolated by scientific literature achieved so far on the natural chemical scaffolds with promising activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
