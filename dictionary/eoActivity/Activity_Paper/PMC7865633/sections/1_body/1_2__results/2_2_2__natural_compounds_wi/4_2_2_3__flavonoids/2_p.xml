<p>The presence of two phenyl groups could be responsible for inhibiting the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease. In particular, by analyzing docking and molecular dynamics results, the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of phenyl moiety of

Additionally, the complex was further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups and Ile188 and Asp142 [
