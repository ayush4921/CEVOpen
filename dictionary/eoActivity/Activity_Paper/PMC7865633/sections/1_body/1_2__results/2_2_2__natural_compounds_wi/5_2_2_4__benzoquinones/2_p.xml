<p>In this regard, 
 <bold>embelin</bold>, a naturally occurring para-benzoquinone extract from 
 <italic>Embelia ribes</italic> plant, aroused particular interest (

 <italic>rationale</italic> is addressable to the quinone reactivity with cysteine protease [

Moreover, a density functional theory (DFT) computational approach highlighted the mechanism of action of embelin into SARS-CoV-2 protease. The covalent bond between the quinone carbonyl and the thiolate of Cys145 was hypothesized. To help this reaction mechanism, His41 captured the hydrogen atom from Cys145 that became prone to release a proton to the carbonyl quinone engaged with the thiolate [
