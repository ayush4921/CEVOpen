<p>According to the idea that these triterpenoids are the natural substrates for two bile acid receptors such as Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR) and G-protein Bile Acid Receptor (GPBAR)-1, the behaviour of some natural 
 <bold>bile acids</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f016">Figure 16</xref>) were also investigated against SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. The analyzed steroidal compounds were able to fit into pocket 5 on the surface of the Î²-sheet core of Spike RBD. In detail, the steroidal scaffold of the 
 <bold>ursodeoxycholic acid</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f016">Figure 16</xref>b) is surrounded by Lys378, Thr376, Phe377, Tyr380, and Pro384 and formed a hydrogen bond with Cys379 [

 <bold>ursodeoxycholic acid</bold> and its taurine conjugate exerted a limited inhibitory activity towards Spike-ACE2 complex. In contrast,

 <bold>,</bold> and 
 <bold>glyco-chenodeoxycholic acid</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f016">Figure 16</xref>d) reduce the Spike binding to the ACE2 receptor by at least 20% in a concentration-dependent manner. Despite these promising in-vitro results, the studies have several limitations; e.g., the effects of these natural molecules were not tested on viral replication [
