 <sc>l</sc>-mannopyranosyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside moiety accommodated into the S1 and S2 sites and the chromen-4-one scaffold located within the S2 and S3’ SARS-CoV Mpro domains. The baicalin glucuronate moiety interacted through two hydrogen bonds with Gly143 and Asn142 residues. In addition, the 
 <italic>π-π</italic> stacking between His41 and its phenyl moiety was observed. In this case, Glu166 plays a pivotal role in the binding mode due to its interaction with the 6-hydroxyl group attached to the chromen-4-one moiety and the 5-hydroxyl group attached to the glucuronate moiety. Baicalin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin revealed the prominent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Indeed, the experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 34.71, 53.90, and 51.64 µM, respectively [
