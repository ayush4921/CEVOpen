<p>Carino et al. identified several triterpenoids and steroidal molecules (

 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. In details, these studies reported that 
 <bold>glycyrrhetinic acid</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f015">Figure 15</xref>a), 
 <bold>betulinic acid</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f015">Figure 15</xref>b), and 
 <bold>oleanolic acid</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f015">Figure 15</xref>d), were able to well recognize the RBDâ€™s pocket 1. Docking results underlined that the steroidal scaffold could interact with Trp436, Phe374, Arg509, and Leu441 residues of the hydrophobic pocket of RBD. In addition, glycyrrhetinic acid engaged hydrogen bonds with Asn440, Ser375 and ionic contacts with Arg509.
