<p>By computational methods was observed that 
 <bold>emodin</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f018">Figure 18</xref>b) binds Asp67, Ala71, and Lys74 residues of ACE2 receptor, and Asn448, Ala464, Val472, and Gly474 residues of Spike protein [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. An experimental study has been shown that emodin, extracted from 
 <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>Reynoutria multiflora</italic>, could act as an inhibitor of the viral Spike protein and human ACE2 receptor binding with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value approximately of 1–10µM in other SARS coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Thus, its promising theoretical mechanism and its known experimental activity against other coronaviruses can stimulate to investigate the potential inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2.
