<p>Computational analysis of alkaloids from 
 <italic>Cryptolepis sanguinolenta</italic> was performed against Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA–polymerase (RdRp), revealing that 
 <bold>cryptomisrine</bold>, 
 <bold>cryptospirolepine</bold>, 
 <bold>cryptoquindoline</bold>, and 
 <bold>biscryptolepine</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f012">Figure 12</xref>) exhibited robust binding affinity towards these two SARS-CoV-2 targets. Overall, all these alkaloids were able to recognize the active site of the two studied targets. Among these, for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, 
 <bold>cryptospirolepine</bold> well interacted with the catalytic dyad; for the polymerase, the best one was the 
 <bold>cryptomisrine</bold> which was involved in 
 <italic>π</italic>-cation interactions with Arg553 and Arg624 residues of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp [

 <bold>cryptospirolepine</bold> was able to form several interactions with Phe40, Ala348, Arg393, His401 in the subdomain I of ACE2. In addition to the block access to ACE2, 
 <bold>cryptospirolepine</bold> and 
 <bold>cryptoquindoline</bold> could inhibit the cleavage of Spike glycoprotein by interacting with TMPRSS2 [
