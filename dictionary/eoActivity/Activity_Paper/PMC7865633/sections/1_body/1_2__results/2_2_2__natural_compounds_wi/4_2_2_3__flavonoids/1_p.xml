<p>Among the naturally occurring compounds and beyond, flavonoids (

 <xref rid="B130-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Many in-silico screenings of medicinal plant databases against SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets have been carried out [

 <xref rid="B132-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Indeed, analyzing the potential role of the flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 main protease [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], it was noticed that their inhibitory activity was more extensive than that of the peptide-derived inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-26-00632" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Starting from this
