<p>Nutrient agar (NA) media were used for culturing the bacteria. Required amount of the media was prepared, autoclaved, then cooled to 40°C and poured to sterilized Petri dishes, and allowed to solidify. Required numbers of colonies of test organisms were cultured in the respective plates and kept inside an incubator for 18–24 hours at 35°C prior to inoculation. All these experiments were carried out aseptically in a biosafety cabinet.</p>
