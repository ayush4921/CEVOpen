<p>The fruits extract showed highest inhibition against the bacterial strains than seed and bark extracts. The ZOI of fruits against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was 16.24 mm (wild) and 17.04 (cultivated); 
 <italic>Escherichia faecalis</italic> 14.28 mm (wild) and 14.62 mm (cultivated); MRSA 15.02 mm (wild) and 16.28 mm (cultivated); and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> 16.38 mm (wild) and 16.19 mm (cultivated). The seed extracts showed moderate activities against the tested organisms. The ZOI of seeds for 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was 15.72 mm (wild) and 16.28 mm (cultivated); MRSA 17.79 mm (wild) and 16.44 mm (cultivated); and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> 15.58 mm (wild) and 13.25 mm (cultivated). The ZOI of bark extract against MRSA was 14.30 mm (wild) and 13.28 mm (cultivated), and that for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was 17.02 mm (wild) and 16.44 (cultivated) (
