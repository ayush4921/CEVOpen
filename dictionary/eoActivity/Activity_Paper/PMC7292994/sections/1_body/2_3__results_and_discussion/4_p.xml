<p>The antibacterial activities of different extracts showed variable results for wild and cultivated populations and were found to be independent of the habitat factors. Some of the extracts from wild populations showed good antibacterial properties, and some of the cultivated samples showed better results. All the extracts of fruits, seeds, and bark were found to be less effective than the standard antibiotic used in the present study (
