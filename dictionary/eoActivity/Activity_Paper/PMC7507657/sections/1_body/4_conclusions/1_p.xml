<p id="Par44">This study isolated pentagalloyl glucose, a functionally valuable gallotannin from the leaf extract of 
 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic> for the first time. Our results show that pentagalloylglucose is more toxic to cancer cells than to normal cells, produces rapid decreases in tumour cell populations, and at higher concentrations generates ROS, leading to oxidative stress in cancer cells. The presence of the compound pentagalloylglucose in the plant species is of chemotaxonomic significance and partly validates the use of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic> in ethno-medicine for treating cancers and related pathologies.
