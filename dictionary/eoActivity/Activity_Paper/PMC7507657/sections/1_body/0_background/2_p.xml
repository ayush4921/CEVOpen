 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic> L.
 <italic>,</italic> commonly referred to as Cashew, is a prominent member of the Anacardiaceae family. In Nigeria, it is one of the plants with multi-purpose medicinal uses. Almost all parts of the cashew tree have medicinal uses. The leaf is especially a common component of the recipes for many ailments. Reported ethno-medicinal uses of the leaf formulation include treatment of inflammation, infection, sore throat, asthma and oxidative conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is also used in the treatment of fevers [

 <italic>A.</italic> o
 <italic>ccidentale</italic> was shown to possess anti-inflammatory effects in some models of inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A leaf extract of the plant showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema and acetic acid-induced writhing assays, respectively [

Towards explaining the rationale for the application of the leaf of this plant for the treatment of cancerous diseases in ethno-medicine, this study isolated, from the plant part for the first time, pentagalloylglucose, a polyphenol with multiple medicinal applications. The cancer cell-selective cytotoxicity of pentagalloylglucose was demonstrated at its high concentrations to be partly as a result of, or causal to, the induction of oxidative stress.
