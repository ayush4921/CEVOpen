<p id="Par39">As we established 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> as rapidly and selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, we assessed whether the generation of ROS was a mechanism by which it induced its toxicity in cancer cells, at least, in part. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> reveals that, at 3 h post-treatment in HeLa cells, 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> up to 25 μg/ml did not induce significant ROS but at 100 μg/ml caused a significant increase in ROS levels. This almost 3-fold increase in ROS could be correlated with an almost 50% decrease in viability at the 3 h time point (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, top panel, left hand side - for 3 h).
