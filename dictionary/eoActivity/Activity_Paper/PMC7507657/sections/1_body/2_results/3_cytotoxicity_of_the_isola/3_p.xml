<p id="Par37">While the MRC5-SV2 cell was more sensitive to 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> than the HeLa cell, it was nearly seven times less sensitive to doxorubicin than the HeLa cell. 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> also showed better selectivity for cancer cells (as against normal cells) than doxorubicin. We thus decided to explore in a cancer cell aspects of the time course of its induction of cytotoxicity by comparing its effects with those of doxorubicin, following treatment with each compound at the same range of concentrations as was tested before but for much shorter durations of 3 h and 6 h. This was assessed using the HeLa cell that was less sensitive to 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> than doxorubicin.
