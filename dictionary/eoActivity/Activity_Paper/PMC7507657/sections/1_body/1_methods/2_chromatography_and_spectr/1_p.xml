 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (for both 1D and 2D experiments) were obtained on the Bruker AV400 (IconNMR) Spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, while the Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (LCMS) analyses were carried out on an Agilent LCMS comprising a 1100 series LC/MSD Trap SL at the School of Chemistry and Physics of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Adsorption chromatography (open column) was carried out with Silica gel (ASTM 230â€“400 mesh, Merck). Size exclusion column chromatography was achieved on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) pre-swollen in a specified solvent before loading onto the column. The column eluate was analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) performed at room temperature using analytical silica gel 60 GF
 <sub>254</sub> pre-coated aluminum backed plates (Merck, 0.25 mm thick). The resulting spots on TLC plates were visualized under Ultraviolet (UV) light (254 nm) and detected by the use of 1% vanillin/H
