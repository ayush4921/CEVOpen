 <bold>Compound 1</bold> at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 100 μg/ml was evaluated for the potential to alter the viability of HeLa, MRC-5 SV2 and MRC-5 cells. Cells were seeded into opaque, flat bottom, microclear 96-well plates at 7.5 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml (7.5x10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well at 100 μl/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to allow the cells to attach. After 24 h, the medium was discarded and the wells treated with 100 μl of the different concentrations of extracts prepared in growth medium. A set of untreated (negative) control wells was included in each plate as well as cells treated with doxorubicin (positive control) at concentrations between 0.1 and 20 μM.
