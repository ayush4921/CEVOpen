<p>Here, we collected fresh stem of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> germplasm resources from different regions (Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan and Jiangxi), the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions were determined by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic approach. The medicinal components and toxic substances of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from the four producing regions were analyzed to provide a certain reference value for the selection of a specific medicinal component in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> breeding. The results should provide theoretical basis for the collection, protection and utilization of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> germplasm resources in different regions.
