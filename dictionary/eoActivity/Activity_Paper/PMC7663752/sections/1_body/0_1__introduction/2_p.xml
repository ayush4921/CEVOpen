<p>In the long-term evolution process, the self-incompatibility mechanism of reproductive isolation was formed, which showed that the pistils and stamens develop normally and mature at the same time and the seeds canâ€™t be produced after self-pollination or cross pollination with the same genotype [

 <italic>D. officinale</italic> can only be preserved by intraspecific hybridization or asexual propagation. At present, most of the 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> in the market are generated through intraspecific hybridization of different categories, results in different quality and medicinal value of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> in different regions [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, different distribution regions and growth environment may lead to a large gap in the yield and quality of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> [

 <italic>D. officinale</italic> germplasm resources with different qualities for its industrialization.
