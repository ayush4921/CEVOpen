<p>At present, most of the 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> on the market is artificially cultivated, and thus may contain pesticide residues or other toxic ingredients. A total of four toxic components were detected, including phthalic acid butyl tetradecyl ester, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, metconazole and diisooctyl phthalate. There were three categories of toxic components in FB1 from Fujian, followed by ZB1 from Zhejiang and YA1 from Yunnan (

Diisooctyl phthalate, identified as the fourth category of toxic chemicals, is a kind of plasticizer and widely used in plastic products, building materials, food packaging, cosmetics and household materials [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed that the origin of market-collected individuals was derived from Zhejiang and the germplasm resources from Jiangxi were well preserved, so the germplasm resources from Jiangxi should be exploited efficiently for breeding superior 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> individuals.
