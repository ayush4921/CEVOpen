<p>The volatile components of plants mainly contain terpenoids, which have strong bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anticancer effects and are an important component of medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A total of 17 medicinal components were detected in the volatile substances from the four different regions, and the content of stigmast-5-en-3-ol was the highest except in sample YA1 from Yunnan, where it was not detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05046-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Stigmast-5-en-3-ol belongs to the phytosterols. Phytosterols, triterpene compounds with a cyclopentane polyhydrophenanthrene as the main structure, are an important part of plant cell biofilm and widely exist in all kinds of plants [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The molecular structure of phytosterols is similar to that of cholesterol, which can inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thereby reducing the level of cholesterol in the blood and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05046-f002">Figure 2</xref>.). Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid for human body and has obvious anticancer effects under the joint action of other compounds. It can also reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, reduce blood viscosity, enhance the bodyâ€™s defense system functions, etc. [

Therefore, it has been suggested that replacing dietary lauric acid and myristic acid with palmitic acid and oleic acid may be beneficial for the treatment of thrombosis [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Heptadecanoic acid is an effective drug against NSCLC cells in vitro [
