<p>The samples with uniform thickness and no insect eye and mildew were selected, defoliated and cut off. The samples of fresh stem of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> were dried in an oven at 50 Â°C for 15 days. The dried stems were ground to powder. One hundred g of powder from each group was placed in a round bottom flask with 500 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (analytical purity) and stirred evenly. After extracting twice by the condensation reflux method, the liquid supernatant was obtained by decompression filtration. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was removed by rotary evaporation and the paste can be used as a backup. Each extraction was repeated three times.
