<p>The obtained GC-MS data was processed by the Xcalibur 2.2 SP1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The compounds in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> stems were identified by matching the MS mass spectrogram with the mass spectrogram in the NIST library and referring to the retention time and molecular formula in the relevant literature. Then, using the Xcalibur chromatography workstation data processing system, the relative content of each compound was calculated according to the peak regions normalization method. SPSS23.0 (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for one-way ANOVA, and Tukey B and the least significant difference method (LSD) were used for significance testing to analyze the significant differences (
