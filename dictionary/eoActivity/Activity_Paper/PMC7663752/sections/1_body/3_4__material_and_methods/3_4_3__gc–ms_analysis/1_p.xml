 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], then transferred into a glass bottle for GC-MS analysis (Trace1300/ISQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Each group (ZB1, FB1, YA1, and JA1) contains three biological replicate times. On microliter of each sample was injected into the GC-MS at 250 °C in a shunt mode (20:1) with carrier gas (&gt;99.999% helium) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and separated by a HP-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) capillary column. The temperature was held isothermally for 3 min at 80 °C, then raised to 260 °C at a rate of 3 °C per minute, and held for 10 min. The transmission line temperature was set to 280 °C, and the ion source temperature was set to 280 °C. The mass range analyzed was from
