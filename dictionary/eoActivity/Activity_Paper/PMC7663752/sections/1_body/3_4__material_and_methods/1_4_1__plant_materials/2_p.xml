<p>Zhu [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that the stems of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> can have two colors (purple and green) and different morphology. In addition, the morphological characteristics of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> are correlated with the contents of polysaccharides and total alkaloids. In order to explore whether the color of the stem is related to the content of volatile substances, 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> samples from the same area were divided into two categories according to the color of the stem. 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> with purple stem from Zhejiang was named ZB1. Correspondingly, 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> with green stem from Zhejiang was named ZB2. Similarly, 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> with purple stem from Fujian was named FB1, while 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> with green stem from Fujian was named FB2. Since no 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> with green stem was found in Yunnan and Jiangxi, the two groups were named YA1 and JA1, respectively.
