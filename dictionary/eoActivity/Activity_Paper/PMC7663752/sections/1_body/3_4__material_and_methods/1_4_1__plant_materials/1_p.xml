<p>Our previous results showed that genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> varies between different regions, most of the 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> in the market were derived from Zhejiang and the germplasm resources from Jiangxi were well preserved [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], so 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> germplasm resources from Zhejiang, Yunnan, Jiangxi and Fujian were collected as experimental materials. All the experimental materials were cultivated in the greenhouse. The seedlings were transplanted into pots and cultivated in the growth chamber with a light: dark cycle of 12 h each at 15 to 28 Â°C and a relative humidity of 70 to 80%. Pine bark was used as the substrate. Biennial materials were collected in February 2018.
