 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> contains many medicinal components, such as vitamin E, phytol, hexadecanoic acid and other bioactive components. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05046-f002">Figure 2</xref>, a total of 17 medicinal components were detected in the volatile substances, including α-linalool, camphor, pentadecanoic acid, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, palmitic acid, heptadecanoic acid, phytol, linoleic acid, stearic acid, desethylchloroquine, vitamin E, stigmasterol, stigmast-5-en-3-ol, palmitic acid glycerol ester, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-13-docosenamide, squalene and α-tocopherol. The relative content of stigmast-5-en-3-ol was the highest among these 17 medicinal components. Moreover, the highest content of stigmast-5-en-3-ol in FB1 was 10.05%, which was significantly higher than that in ZB1, FB1 and JA1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Unexpectedly, stigmast-5-en-3-ol was not detected in YA1 from Yunnan. The contents of palmitic acid in YA1 were significantly higher than that in the other three regions, but the content of phytol and linoleic acid in YA1 was the lowest. The content of vitamin E in the Jiangxi sample was higher than that in ZB1 and FB1, and it was not detected in YA1. (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-13-Docosenamide was found in the ZB1 and YA1 samples, and α-linalool, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone and desethylchloroquine were detected only in YA1.
