<p>To investigate whether the chemical composition of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> is associated with its origin, we analyzed six samples of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different territory, ZB1 (purple stems, Zhejiang), ZB2 (green stems, Zhejiang), FB1 (purple stems, Fujian), FB2 (green stems, Fujian), YA1 (purple stems, Yunnan) and JA1 (purple stems, Jiangxi). We analyzed these stems using a GC-MS-based metabolomics approach, and the total ion chromatographic (TIC) diagram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05046-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The TIC for ZB1 and ZB2 are basically the same, and FB1 was similar to FB2. There was a significant difference in the intensity of compound peaks in the TIC for the samples from different regions, especially the peaks with retention time between 45â€“70 min (
