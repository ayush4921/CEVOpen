<p>In this study, the categories and contents of volatile compounds in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions are variety, and the categories from Zhejiang Province (ZB1 and ZB2) are the most, and those from Fujian Province (FB1 and FB2) are the least. There are unique substances in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions, showing that we can selectively cultivate 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> according to the different unique substances desired A total of 17 medicinal components were detected. The highest content of stigmast-5-en-3-ol (10.05%) was observed in FB1 from Fujian, which was significantly higher than that in ZB1, FB1 and JA1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), revealing that FB1 can provide high quality raw materials for applications using stigmast-5-en-3-ol. Interestingly, no toxic components were detected in JA1 from Jiangxi, suggested that the germplasm resources from Jiangxi should be exploited efficiently for breeding superior 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> individuals.
