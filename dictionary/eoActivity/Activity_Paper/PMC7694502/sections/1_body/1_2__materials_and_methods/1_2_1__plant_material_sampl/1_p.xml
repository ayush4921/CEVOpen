<p>The plant material was collected in October 2019 from a plant nursery in the Hail region (Saudi Arabia). The fresh aerial flowering parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01089-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were dried at room temperature for ten days and then ground to a fine powder. Extracts were prepared according to Snoussi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, 40 g of the plant powder material were macerated in 400 mL of absolute methanol at room temperature for 48 h and re-extracted three times using the same procedure. Methanolic extracts were pooled, filtered, and the solvent was removed at 60 °C in the incubator chamber. The dried extracts were stored until further use. The yield was calculated using the following Formula (1):
 <disp-formula>Yield (%) = (W1 × 100)/W2,
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where W1 was the weight of extract after the evaporation of solvent, and W2 was the dry weight of the sample.
