<p>MTT (3-[4จC-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed by the quantitative colorimetric method. Malignant Walker 256/B and MatLyLu (5 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> cells/well) were seeded on 96-well plates with or without 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract. The effect on the viability of the used cells was realized by using the following growing concentrations: 0–200 μg/mL. Pure ethanol was used as positive control. After 24 or 48 h, cells were incubated with MTT solution for 2 h. Then, the percentage of viability and inhibition was recorded by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm.
