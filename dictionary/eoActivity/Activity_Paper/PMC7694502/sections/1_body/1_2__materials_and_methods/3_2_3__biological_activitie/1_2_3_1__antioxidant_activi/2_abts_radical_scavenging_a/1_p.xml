<p>The radical scavenging activity against ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical cations was measured using the method of Chakraborty and Paulraj [
 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The antiradical activity was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (mg/mL), which represented the extract concentrations scavenging 50% of ABTS radicals [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The inhibition percentage of ABTS radical was calculated using the following Formula (3):
 <disp-formula>ABTS scavenging activity (%) = (A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub> × 100,
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A1 is the absorbance of the sample.
