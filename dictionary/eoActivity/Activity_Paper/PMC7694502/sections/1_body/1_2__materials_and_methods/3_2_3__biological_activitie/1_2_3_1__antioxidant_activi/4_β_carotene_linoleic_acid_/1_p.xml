<p>The β-carotene method was carried out according to Ikram et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Antioxidant activity (inhibition percentage, PI%) was evaluated using the following Formula (4):
 <disp-formula>PI% = (A β-carotene T
  <sub>120</sub>/A β-carotene t
  <sub>0</sub>) × 100,
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A β-carotene t
 <sub>0</sub> and A β-carotene T
 <sub>120</sub> refer to the corresponding absorbance values of the test sample standard and control measured before and after incubation for 2 h, respectively. All tests were performed in triplicate, and ascorbic acid (standard) was used for comparison.
