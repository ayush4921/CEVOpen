<p>The ability to scavenge the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was calculated using the following Formula (2) as described by Chakraborty and Paulraj [
 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>DPPH scavenging activity (%) = (A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub> × 100,
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A1 is the absorbance of the sample. The antioxidant activity was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (mg/mL), which represented the extract concentrations scavenging 50% of DPPH radicals [
