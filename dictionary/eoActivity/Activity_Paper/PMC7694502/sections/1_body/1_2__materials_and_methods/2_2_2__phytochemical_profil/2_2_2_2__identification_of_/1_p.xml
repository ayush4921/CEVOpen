<p>The phytochemical profile of the obtained crude methanolic extract from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> L. aerial parts was analyzed using a UHPLC-PDA-Detector 323 Mass Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Compounds were identified via their mass spectra and their unique mass fragmentation patterns. Compound Discoverer 2.1, ChemSpider, and PubChem were used as the main tools for the identification of the phytochemical constituents [
