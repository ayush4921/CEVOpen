<p>The overall hydrophobic nature of peptides identified in 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extracts coupled with the small size of peptides and high concentration of aromatic amino acids ascertain its antioxidant and anticancer characteristics. Further in vivo studies are necessary to confirm the pharmacological properties of the identified molecules in vivo as promising antioxidant and antitumor agents.
