<p>Previous studies with 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract reported potential anticancer effects by the inhibition of cell invasion and motility of human prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B96-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The mechanism includes E-caderin/catenin complex restoration. In this study, an anticancer effect has been revealed on the prostate MatLyLu cell line. Similarly, an in vivo study of prostate cancer and its lymph node, lung, and bone metastases complication due to MatLyLu cells could inhibit the invasion and metastatic potential via E-caderin/catenin complex restoration.
