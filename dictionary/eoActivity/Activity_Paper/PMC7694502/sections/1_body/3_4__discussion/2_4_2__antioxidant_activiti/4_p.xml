<p>The relationship between the structure and activity of natural peptides with antioxidant properties has been vividly elucidated in a report by Zou et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] where certain aspects of the chemical structure, namely the small size, presence of certain amino acids in large amounts, and hydrophobicity, are described as important factors that influence the antioxidant nature of peptides. Similar findings have been reported in several plant peptides such as those from 
 <italic>Sphenostylis stenocarpa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B92-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], hemp seed [
 <xref rid="B93-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], phaseolin, bean [
 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], and 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] using several in vitro antioxidant evaluation systems such as diphenyl-1-picryhydradzyl (DPPH) and linoleic acid oxidation. In our study, many of the above-mentioned characteristics (small size, hydrophobicity, and high occurrence of aromatic amino acids) were seen in the peptides from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>, which further confirms the potential of the plant extract as a therapeutic agent.
