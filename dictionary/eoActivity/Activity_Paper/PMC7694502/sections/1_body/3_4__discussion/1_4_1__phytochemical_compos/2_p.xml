<p>Additionally, during our investigation, we identified 20 small peptide fragments with varying amino acid sequences via HR-LCMS analysis. Therefore, it was of interest to analyze the role of these peptides in the antioxidant and anticancer properties of the plant extracts. Peptides and peptide-like proteins have been found to be integral components of various plant species and have therapeutic applications due to their broad spectrum of biological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidation, antihypertensive, immunomodulatory, and anticancer properties [

Although peptides from different plant species vary greatly with respect to amino acid composition and sequence, bioactive peptides possess certain common features such as small size, hydrophobicity, large percentage of aromatic amino acids, and amphiphatic nature [
