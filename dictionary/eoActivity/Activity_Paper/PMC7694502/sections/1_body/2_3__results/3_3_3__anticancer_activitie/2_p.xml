<p>Our findings, validated by the antiproliferative effects on malignant Walker 256/B and MatLyLu cells, suggested that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> possess an anticancer effect. Its phytochemical profile might act as chemopreventive agents against both Walker 256/B and MatLyLu. In fact, the extract suppressed the growth of the two malignant lines once compared with the controls (0 µg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01089-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The lowest viability was noticed with 200 µg/mL of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract for both cell lines. Overall, the effect was accentuated with the dose increase (dose-dependent), and it was more prominent after 48 h of treatment; the effect was dose and time-dependent.
