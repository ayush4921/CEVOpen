<p>The quantitative determination of phytochemical compounds specifies that the 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract was rich in flavonoids (725 ± 0.001 mg QE/g extract), tannins (239 ± 0.006 mg QE/g extract), and phenols (72 ± 0.011 mg QE/g extract). The obtained 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract was evaluated for its antioxidant potentiality using four methods. The IC50 of each test was calculated and determined (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As it is shown, this extract had the strong radical inhibition of ABTS (IC50 = 0.042 mg/mL) followed by DPPH (IC50 = 0.087 mg/mL), β-carotene/linoleic acid (IC50 = 0.101 mg/mL), and FRAP (IC50 = 0.292 mg/mL).
