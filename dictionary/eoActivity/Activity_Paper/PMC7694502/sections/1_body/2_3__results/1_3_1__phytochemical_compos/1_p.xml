<p>High Resolution-Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (HR-LCMS) was carried out the chemical composition of the active extract. This technique was performed in the separation and identification of the phytoconstituents based on their retention time, database difference (library), experimental 
 <italic>m/z</italic>, MS/MS fragments, metabolite class, and proposed compounds. MS data were provided in negative and positive ionization mode. The majority of the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values in our extract were in the range from 133 to 742. In fact, HR-LCMS analysis identified peptide-like proteins in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>.
