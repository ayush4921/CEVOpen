<p>Peptides of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract were composed of a majority of essential and non-essential amino acids distributed unevenly. Aromatic amino acids were predominant in 85% of the peptides with tryptophan (Trp) being the most commonly occurring amino acid (18.3%). Tryptophan along with phenylalanine and tyrosine accounted for 43.3% of the total amino acids, followed by glutamine, asparagine, and histidine (25%). Leucine, lysine, serine, glutamic acid, and cysteine together accounted for 16.7%; and proline and threonine made up 10% of the total amino acids. Arginine, isoleucine, and methionine were amongst the least abundant amino acids, which accounted for 5% of the amino acids in the identified peptides. Aromatic rings were the most abundant side chains followed by amide side chains. Sulfur-containing side chains were rare in the identified peptides.
