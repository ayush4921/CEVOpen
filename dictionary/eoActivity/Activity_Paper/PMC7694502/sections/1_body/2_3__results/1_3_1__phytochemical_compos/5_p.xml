<p>The repertoire of peptides of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract appeared to be more hydrophobic than hydrophilic from the amino acid composition, with hydrophobic amino acids accounting for 51.7% of the total amino acids. In addition, the majority of the peptides were composed solely of hydrophobic amino acids. Neutral amino acids made up of 88% of the amino acids followed by basic amino acids (8%). Consequently, 14 of the 20 peptides were neutral in nature. Glutamic acid was the only acidic amino acid detected and was present in two of the 20 peptides identified. As seen in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (
 <italic>m/z</italic> values), most of the peptides had a net positive charge as determined by spectrophotometric data.
