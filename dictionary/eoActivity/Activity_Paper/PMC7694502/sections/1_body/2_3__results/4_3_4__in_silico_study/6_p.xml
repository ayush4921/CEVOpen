 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> summarizes the calculated binding energies of the stable ligand–progesterone complexes, the number of conventional intermolecular hydrogen bonds established between the docked compounds, and the active site residues of the human androgen receptor. The complexes formed between the composition of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) and the active residues of androgen showed negative and positive binding energies. On one hand, the complexes that show negative binding energies may explain the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract. On the other hand, the positive binding energies may indicate that the corresponding metabolites are not active; i.e., they have no anticancer activity. The bond energies of the stable complexes range −11.01 to −3.49 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. According to the binding energies, compound 18 showed the higher anticancer activity with the lowest binding energy of 11.01 kcal mol
