<p>Overall, the in silico approach showed that for antioxidant and antitumor tests, the activity differs from one compound to another. These differences can be explained by the structural geometry of its basic skeleton, and to the presence of different specific substituted groups and heteroatoms in the studied bioactive compounds. In an attempt to rationalize the observed antioxidant activity of the identified molecules in 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract, a molecular docking study has been carried out to determine their binding modes from one side and from another site of the active residues of human peroxiredoxin 5. The results of the number of conventional intermolecular hydrogen bonding established between the docked compounds and active site residues of human peroxiredoxin 5 are summarized in
