 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) and the active residues of progesterone showed negative binding energies, which may explain the observed anticancer activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract. The bond energies of the stable complexes range from −10.83 to −3.61 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. According to molecular docking results, limonoids 28 and 14 showed the higher anticancer activity with lowest binding energies of −10.83 and −10.45 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. The higher activity of 28 compared with 14 may be due to the extra intermolecular types of hydrogen bonding, and π-sulfur types appear in the former compared with the latter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01089-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, in the stable complex 28-progesterone, two strong hydrogen bonds were formed between 28 and the progesterone receptor. The first one is formed between the lone pair of oxygen atoms of the furan ring and the amino acid GLN A725 at a distance of 3.15 Å, and the second one at a distance of 3.06 Å is established between the lone pair of an oxygen atom of cyclopentanone and VAL A760. π-Sulfor intermolecular interactions are formed between the π bonds of furan ring and the amino acids MET A759 and MET A801 (
