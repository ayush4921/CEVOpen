<p>It appears from the docking outputs in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> that the antioxidant activity varies with subclass family. For instance, lemonoids 14 (−7.09 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 28 (−6.14 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) showed higher binding affinity compared with other subclasses (
