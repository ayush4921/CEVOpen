<p>To identify the phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic>, we downloaded the complete chloroplast genome sequences of 16 species from the NCBI GenBank database. MAFFT v7 (Katoh etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) was used for sequence alignment, and then a maximum likelihood tree was constructed by using RAxML v8.2.10 (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with 
 <italic>Clematis terniflora</italic> as the outgroup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic> closely clustered with 
 <italic>E. elachyphyllum</italic>. Our study will provide essential data for future research on the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship in 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic> genus.
