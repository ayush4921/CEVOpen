<p>Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the gastroprotective effects of Inulae Flos extract (IFE) and explored its potential mechanisms, using an HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. Because Inulae Flos and components of Inulae Flos have been reported to regulate the activities or levels of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) in other tissues and cells [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we hypothesized that Inulae Flos could protect the gastric mucosa through antioxidant mechanisms, including the modulation of SOD, CAT, GSH, and MDA levels. In addition, the effects of Inulae Flos on mucus secretion and the levels of prostaglandin E
