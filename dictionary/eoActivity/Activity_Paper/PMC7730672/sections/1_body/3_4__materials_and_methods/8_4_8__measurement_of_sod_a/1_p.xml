<p>Frozen gastric tissues were ground and homogenized in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min, at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for analyses. SOD and CAT activities and GSH levels were determined by using commercial kits (cat. nos. 706002, 707002, and 703002, respectively; Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzyme activities and GSH levels were normalized to the wet weight of the stomach. MDA levels were measured by a lipid peroxidation (MDA) assay kit (cat. no. MAK085; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), following the manufacturer’s instruction, and normalized to the wet weight of the stomach.
