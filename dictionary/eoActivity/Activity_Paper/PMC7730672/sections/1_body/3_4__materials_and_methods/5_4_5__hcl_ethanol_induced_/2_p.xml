<p>This experiment was conducted twice. First, 24 rats (six per group) were used to measure the gastric lesion index, histopathology, antioxidant enzyme levels, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> levels. Next, 32 rats (eight per group) were used to determine gastric wall mucus contents. In the first experiment, the stomach was washed with sterile saline and divided into right and left halves, which were stretched on a plate and photographed, to measure the lesion area. Then, the glandular region of the half was immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, at 4 °C, for histopathological examination, and the glandular region of the remaining half was stored at −80 °C, for the measurement of antioxidant enzymes and PGE
 <sub>2</sub>.
