<p>Gastric wall mucus is secreted by mucous neck cells and forms a thick layer covering the gastric mucosa [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Pretreatment with 100 and 300 mg/kg IFE significantly inhibited the reduction in gastric wall mucus contents in the gastric mucosa by HCl/ethanol administration. These results suggest that IFE inhibits gastric mucosal damage by preventing the depletion of gastric wall mucus in gastric ulcers.
