<p>The gastric mucosa, the superficial layer of gastric tissue, prevents the diffusion of digestive enzymes into the stomach wall by the secretion of gastric mucus [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulceration rodent model is commonly used for the evaluation of gastric protective agents as a reproducible and stable method of inducing gastric lesions [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Pretreatment with 100 or 300 mg/kg IFE significantly attenuated the gastric lesions by 90.7% and 98.7%, respectively, compared with the HCl/ethanol-treated control group. The gastroprotective effects of 300 mg/kg IFE were similar to those of Stillen administered at the same dose. In histological observations of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, an improvement to the histopathological changes, such as disruption and exfoliation of the gastric mucosal epithelium, was observed by pretreatment with IFE, which supported the gastroprotective effects of IFE. These results suggest that IFE may have gastroprotective effects against acute gastric mucosal injury.
