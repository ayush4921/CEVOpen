<p>IFE pretreatment significantly increased PGE
 <sub>2</sub> levels in the gastric tissues of rats following the induction of gastric lesions by HCl/ethanol. Prostaglandins are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and are involved in maintaining and protecting the gastric mucosa by modulating gastric blood flow, gastric acid and bicarbonate secretion, and gastric mucus production [

 <sub>2</sub> levels by one-fifth to one-third in rat gastric tissue [

 <sub>2</sub> or inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> reduction inhibits gastric mucosal damage caused by ethanol [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similar to previous results, these findings indicate that increased PGE
 <sub>2</sub> levels might be involved in mediating the gastric mucus secretion of IFE.
