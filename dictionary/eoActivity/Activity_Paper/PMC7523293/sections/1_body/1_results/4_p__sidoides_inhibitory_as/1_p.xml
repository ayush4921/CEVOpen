<p id="Par22">The inhibitory activities of various dilutions of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extracts were concentration-dependent in all the kinases except HSK, RBKS and AsK (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). No inhibition was observed at 1 × 10
 <sup>− 6</sup> mg/ml of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> on ThiL and RBKS kinases. The most susceptible enzymes to 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extract were SK and GK with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.17 mg/ml and 1.4 mg/ml, respectively, when compared to other kinases (Table
