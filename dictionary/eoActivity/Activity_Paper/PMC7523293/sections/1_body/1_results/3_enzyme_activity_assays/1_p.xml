<p id="Par21">The effect of the ATP concentration on the steady state specific activity of the 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> kinases was expressed over a concentration gradient of ATP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As the enzymes were recombinantly expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the specific activity of the individual enzymes referred to throughout the document is the recombinant specific activity as the enzymes were not obtained from their native host. The best-fit to the data was obtained for the specified kinetic model using the non-linear regression algorithms as outlined using the GraphPad Prism® 5 software. The variation in the maximum specific enzyme activity for each enzyme was vast, ranging from approximately 0.14 nM/minute/nM protein for AsK to in excess of 3000 nM/minute/nM protein for SK, indicative of the great variation in binding affinity for ATP of the selected enzymes.
