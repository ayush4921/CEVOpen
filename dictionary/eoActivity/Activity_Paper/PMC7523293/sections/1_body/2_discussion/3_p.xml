<p id="Par26">The data exhibited only moderate direct antibacterial capabilities against a spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, although convincing data was provided in support for the improvement of immune functions at various levels, hence, validating the medicinal uses of EPÂ® 7630. The concentrations and nature of the active compounds in the extract are unknown. This data however, provided support to validate the medicinal use of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic>. However, the remedial effects are not yet associated with mechanistic structure and function analyses and therefore further investigations are required in order to study the functional relationships between the 
 <italic>O</italic>-gallolylated compounds and SK and GK. Phytochemical studies show the presence of a large number of other secondary metabolites in the plant, such as tannins, coumarins, phenolic acids, phenylpropanoid derivatives and other chemical constituents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This identified platform of Mtb kinases could serve as a screen to allow for mechanistic studies to be carried out on ethnobotanical plant extracts. The traditional use of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> and the present enzyme results indicate the potential use of this kinase platform to directly relate traditional use to target mechanistic investigations thereby identifying the potential drug target. These data should eventually contribute to evidence-based traditional medicines.
