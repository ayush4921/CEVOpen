<p id="Par27">In conclusion, selected Mtb kinases were successfully expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified and validated by SDS-PAGE, enzyme activity and/or MS spectroscopy. The enzyme functionality was validated through the enzyme activity of the purified proteins, and the effect of a 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> plant extract on their activities was determined. The most susceptible enzymes tested were SK and GK, with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. This suggests that both SK and GK could be used as targets through which 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extracts could be characterized in terms of the specific chemistry of the inhibitors. As these two enzymes have different phosphoryl transfer mechanisms is it probable that different classes of compounds will be selected. The biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids occurs via chorismate, the precursor to which is shikimate. As mammals do not have the biochemistry for the synthesis of chorismate or any of its intermediates, SK is a good validated target for Mtb. The human essential amino acids, tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine are all synthesized using chorismate as the precursor. 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> contains a broad range of O-galloylated compounds all of which are potential inhibitors of SK and in the case of glycerol-1-gallate, GK. Having identified the potential targets for 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> inhibition SK and GK will therefore serve as a good screen for compound identification and validation from 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extracts.
