 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> fresh plant material was supplied by the Natural Plants and Agroprocessing (NPA) division of CSIR Biosciences through the CSIR Enterprise Creation for Development (ECD) division, Pretoria, South Africa. In an endeavor to limit the environmental destruction due to the uncontrolled wild harvesting of plants the ECD of the CSIR has facilitated the cultivation of a number of important ethnobotanical plants of known high usage, 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> being one of them. The plants used were cultivated by Rodene Nursery, (ECD Sample number, ECD-MP-0252; Extract number, PEL-223-48448A). All plant taxonomy at the ECD was done in conjunction with South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) which forms part of the The Plant List protocol.
