<p id="Par37">The kinase samples were thawed on ice prior to setting up the enzyme assays. The HPLC assay reactions were carried out in 100 μl volumes and incubated at 37 °C. The assay was carried out as described by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the assay reactions consisted of 90 μl of the prepared reaction mixture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) with either 10 μl of enzyme, prepared in triplicate or 10 μl distilled water, prepared in duplicate, which served as a control blank. A range of ATP concentrations was assayed, with ATP and MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations always kept at a 1:1 ratio [

 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), the reactions were stopped with 5% [v/v] 200 mM EDTA.2Na.2H
 <sub>2</sub>O and subsequently loaded onto an Agilent 1100 HPLC to measure the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) product formation and the reduction of the ATP substrate. The HPLC automatically injected 0.2 μl of each sample reaction mix onto a Phenomenex 5 μ LUNA C18 column with the mobile phase containing PIC A® (Waters Corporation. USA), 250 ml acetonitrile and 7 g KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> per litre of water. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1 ml/min and the separated reactants were detected using a UV detector to measure absorbance at a wavelength of 259 nm. AMP, ADP and ATP standards were used to calibrate the HPLC and the levels of ADP in each sample were determined by using Agilent ChemStation (Revision B.02.01) software (Agilent Technologies. USA). Absorbance values obtained for the control containing distilled water were subtracted from the enzyme reactions. Favorable enzyme activity, in this study, was defined by achieving linearity to demonstrate a constant rate, as well as attaining percentage conversions (of ATP to ADP) within the range of 5–15%.
