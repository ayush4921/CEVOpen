 <italic>ackA</italic> (acetate kinase AK; Rv0409), glpK (glycerol kinase GK; Rv3696c),

 <italic>ask</italic> (aspartokinase AsK; Rv3709c). The 
 <italic>aroK</italic> gene (encoding Shikimate Kinase) was obtained from the laboratory of Chris Abell, University of Cambridge. The genes were amplified from H37Rv genomic DNA using the oligonucleotide primers shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, and the PCR products subcloned into the selected pET vector (Novagen, Germany) using the applicable restriction enzymes.
