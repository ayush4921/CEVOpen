<p id="Par38">The Mtb kinases were thawed on ice. A 100 mg/ml stock solution of the 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> crude extract was prepared in distilled water. A 10-fold serial dilution of the aqueous plant extracts, ranging from 1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> mg/ml to 1 × 10
 <sup>− 5</sup> mg/ml, was then prepared before being stored at − 20 °C. The inhibitory activity determination was carried out using HPLC enzyme assays as described earlier, at a single ATP and MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (1 mM each), and with the addition of varying concentrations of the 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> plant extract. A water-only control was run in parallel, to serve as a negative control for activity comparison analysis. The reaction mixtures of each kinase (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) were incubated at 37 °C for a specific time and thereafter stopped with 5% [v/v] 200 mM EDTA.2Na.2H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The reactions were subsequently analysed as above. All assays were carried out in triplicate and the standard deviation determined and plotted as part of the data. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated, with the aid of GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc. USA) as specified by the software when plotting log [Inhibitor] concentration versus the enzyme activity.
