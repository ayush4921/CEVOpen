<p id="Par42">Mass spectrometry was performed using a Thermo Scientific Fusion mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray Flex ionization source. The sample was introduced through a stainless steel emitter. Data was collected in positive mode with spray voltage set to 1.8 kV and ion transfer capillary set to 280 °C. Spectra were internally calibrated using polysiloxane ions at m/z = 445.12003 and 371.10024. MS1 scans were performed using the orbitrap detector set at 120000 resolution over the scan range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> = 350–1650 with Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) target at 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and maximum injection time of 40 ms. Data was acquired in profile mode.
