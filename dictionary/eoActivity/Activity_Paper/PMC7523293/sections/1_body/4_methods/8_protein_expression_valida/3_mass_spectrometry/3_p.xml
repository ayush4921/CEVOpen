<p id="Par44">The raw files generated by the mass spectrometer were imported into Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (Thermo Scientific) and processed using the Sequest algorithm. Database interrogation was performed against a concatenated database created using the Uniprot 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> database with the cRAP contaminant database. Semi-tryptic cleavage with 2 missed cleavages was allowed for. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance set to 0.05 Da. Demamidation (arginine and glutamine), oxidation (methionine) and acetylation of protein N-terminal was allowed as dynamic modifications and thiomethyl of cysteine as static modification. Peptide validation was performed using the Target-Decoy PSM validator node. The output files from Proteome Discoverer were imported in to Scaffold Q+ and the assignments validated using X1Tandem and the PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms.
