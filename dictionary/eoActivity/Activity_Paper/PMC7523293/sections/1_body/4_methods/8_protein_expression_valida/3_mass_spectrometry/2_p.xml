<p id="Par43">MS2 acquisitions were performed using monoisotopic precursor selection for ion with charges + 2 − + 7 with error tolerance set to +/− 10 ppm. Precursor ions were excluded from fragmentation once for a period of 60 s. Precursor ions were selected for fragmentation in High Energy Dissociation (HCD) mode using the quadrupole mass analyser with HCD energy set to 30%. Fragment ions were detected in the orbitrap mass analyzer set to 15,000 resolution. The AGC target was set to 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and the maximum injection time to 30 ms. These data was acquired in centroid mode.
