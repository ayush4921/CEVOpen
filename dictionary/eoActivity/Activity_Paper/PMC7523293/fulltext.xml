TB is often a fatal disease, and one that poses a global threat to human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Globally, infection associated with TB is second only to HIV/AIDS as the greatest killer due to a single initiating infectious agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Out of the 9 million people infected with TB in a year, 3 million are left untreated, acting as a reservoir for further infection. Many of these 3 million untreated cases live in poverty with minimal access to healthcare. Over 95% of TB cases and deaths are in developing countries such as South Africa, often where the percentage of HIV/AIDS co-infection is high, and therefore occurs in individuals with compromised immune systems (WHO, 2020) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">TB is caused by various strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, commonly affects the lungs, and is transferrable from person to person through the air. Mtb is an intra-cellular parasite normally residing in the human macrophages, where its survival and growth depends on complex networks of the attenuation of macrophage activity by the Mtb bacilli. Mtb has not only developed a number of mechanisms to evade onslaught from such host macrophage immune responses as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, but it has also evolved a metabolism that has allowed it to survive in this very specialized niche environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has become evident that one of the mechanisms to arrest the progression of Mtb into full-blown infection is a multi-targeted approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The key question which arises is, &#x0201c;Can a single plant extract be used to screen multiple targets as a means of identifying novel synergistic anti-infective properties?&#x0201d; Medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of several diseases and the plant extract identified for analysis was that from <italic>Pelargonium sidoides,</italic> as this plant has a 200&#x02009;year documented history of ethnobotanical use in the treatment of tuberculosis and other infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This includes well documented reports in literatures that suggest the medicinal properties and efficacy of <italic>P. sidoides</italic> against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and other bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The mechanisms and targets of this anti-tubercular activity are, however, not defined. The aqueous-ethanolic extract of <italic>P. sidoides</italic> (EP&#x000ae; 7630) roots have been used to treat bacterial infections, as well as to induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in human blood human immune cells, alleviating symptoms associated with acute bronchitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This extract is licensed in Germany as herbal medicine for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">This investigation was therefore set up to target a functionally diverse range of Mtb kinase enzymes as a mechanism of identifying potential Mtb drug targets using the complexity found in medicinal plant extracts as the source of chemical diversity. It was also decided to select a range of Mtb kinases which, where possible, do not occur within mammalian biochemistry. Kinases have been classified into 25 families of homologous proteins, with the families assembled into 12 fold-groups based on the similarity of their structural folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has further been demonstrated that each of the 12 fold-groups has a distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and it was therefore decided to select the kinase enzyme targets from 6 of the 12 fold-groups, thereby representing 6 distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanisms. The six identified phosphoryl transfer mechanisms all have distinct ATP binding motifs. The selection of these kinases should therefore identify different classes&#x02019; compounds capable of binding ATP. The enzymes selected are crucial for the metabolism and survival of Mtb. As relatively large number of enzymes was to be comparatively simultaneously assessed it was envisaged to keep the enzyme purification and assays as simple as possible.</p><p id="Par17">The eight specific Mtb kinases targeted are Nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDK, EC 2.7.4.6), Homoserine kinase (HSK, EC 2.7.1.39), Acetate kinase (AK, EC 2.7.2.1), Glycerol kinase (GK, EC 2.7.1.30), Thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL, EC 2.7.4.1), Ribokinase (RBKS, EC 2.7.1.15), Aspartokinase (AsK, EC 2.7.2.4), and Shikimate kinase (SK, EC 2.7.1.71) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Acetate kinase (AK) and glycerol kinase (GK) were both well expressed however the final eluate yielded lower levels of protein. They were both however still used in the screening as sufficiently high levels of enzyme activity were obtained. It was decided to keep these enzymes in the screen panel as one of the primary aims of setting up the screen panel was to assess if the panel may be used to identify compound target selectivity from mixtures such as plant extracts. It is envisaged that a higher fidelity secondary screen will be set up, using purer enzyme, once the target has been identified. The secondary screen will be used for compound identification.

The purification of the proteins was challenging, but a variety of different techniques were investigated in order to acquire sufficient amounts of relatively pure protein (as estimated by PAGE) to run all assays simultaneously as part of a preliminary medicinal plant extract screen. The presence of each kinase was demonstrated by enzyme activity, SDS-PAGE and/or MS analysis. The competitive inhibition of the kinase reaction may manifest either as inhibiting the binding of ATP or by the inhibition of the binding of the enzyme substrate that is to be phosphorylated. As these enzymes were selected based on the fact that they all have distinct phosphoryl transfer reactions as well as distinct substrates, it was envisaged that the plant extract may demonstrate a significant variation on the IC<sub>50</sub>s obtained. This was found to be the case, with SK and GK having IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.17&#x02009;mg/ml and 1.4&#x02009;mg/ml, respectively, with all the other enzymes having IC<sub>50</sub>s of at least one order of magnitude higher. Clearly, the kinases selected could be used in a primary selection to identify targets for a plant extract. The selected enzymes could then be used in a more stringent secondary screen to identify the active compounds. What is significant is one of the major active ingredients of <italic>P. sidoides</italic> is gallic acid, which is a shikimic acid mimic (the substrate of SK) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Gallic acid and a range of <italic>O</italic>-galloylated compounds have been demonstrated to be present in the extracts of <italic>P. sidoides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SK has been identified as being a potential target to develop antimicrobial agents for Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An associated species of <italic>Pelargonium</italic> used in South Africa for medicinal purposes is <italic>Pelargonium reniforme</italic>. <italic>P. reniforme</italic> produces <italic>O</italic>-galloylated glycerol (glycerol-1-gallate) which could be a potential bi-functional inhibitor of both SK and GK. If only low levels of glycerol-1-gallate are synthesized in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sidoides</italic>, however if the binding constants of glycerol-1-gallate for SK and GK is high enough inhibition will still occur and probably synergistically. As the enzymes selected are all kinase enzymes it is realistic to believe that one of the binding mechanisms is in the kinase ATP binding site. These results clearly demonstrate that this platform of Mtb kinase enzymes can be used as a primary selection strategy for the identification of active ingredients in plant extracts that allows for the stratification of the inhibition of Mtb kinase enzymes and the validation of the extracts potential medicinal properties.

The enzyme functionality was validated through the enzyme activity of the purified proteins, and the effect of a <italic>P. sidoides</italic> plant extract on their activities was determined. The most susceptible enzymes tested were SK and GK, with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values. This suggests that both SK and GK could be used as targets through which <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extracts could be characterized in terms of the specific chemistry of the inhibitors. As these two enzymes have different phosphoryl transfer mechanisms is it probable that different classes of compounds will be selected. The biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids occurs via chorismate, the precursor to which is shikimate. As mammals do not have the biochemistry for the synthesis of chorismate or any of its intermediates, SK is a good validated target for Mtb. The human essential amino acids, tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine are all synthesized using chorismate as the precursor. <italic>P. sidoides</italic> contains a broad range of O-galloylated compounds all of which are potential inhibitors of SK and in the case of glycerol-1-gallate, GK. Having identified the potential targets for <italic>P. sidoides</italic> inhibition SK and GK will therefore serve as a good screen for compound identification and validation from <italic>P. sidoides</italic> extracts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par28">H37Rv genomic DNA was received from Professor Ian Wiid, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa.

Semi-tryptic cleavage with 2 missed cleavages was allowed for. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10&#x02009;ppm and fragment mass tolerance set to 0.05&#x02009;Da. Demamidation (arginine and glutamine), oxidation (methionine) and acetylation of protein N-terminal was allowed as dynamic modifications and thiomethyl of cysteine as static modification.
