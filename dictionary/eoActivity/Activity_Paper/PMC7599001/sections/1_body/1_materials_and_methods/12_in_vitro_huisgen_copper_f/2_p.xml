<p>For the copper-free click reaction, aliquots of 5 µM of each 
 <italic>clickable</italic>-protein were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the dark with 5 µM of fluorescent DBCO-derivative substrates (
 <bold>BDP FL DBCO</bold>, 
 <bold>Cy5 DBCO</bold>, and 
 <bold>DBCO-PEG
  <sub>4</sub>-Fluor 545
 </bold>) in a total volume of 10 µl of PBS 1× buffer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2020.1841182" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S6</ext-link>). The reactions were finally stopped in Leammli Buffer 3×, loaded on SDS-PAGE, and analysed as described in Section 4, by applying a blue LED/530 bandpass filter, red LED/695 bandpass filter and green LED/605 bandpass filter as excitation/emission parameters for each DBCO-fluorophores, respectively. The click reaction was also performed on 5 µM of both the enzymes, but in the presence of an 
 <italic>Ec</italic>CFE diluted in PBS 1× buffer.
