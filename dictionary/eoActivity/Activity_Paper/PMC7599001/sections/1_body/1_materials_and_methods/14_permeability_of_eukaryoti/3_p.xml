 <sup>®</sup> plasmid by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were treated with 25 µM 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> for 1 h, and the excess of the substrate was washed out by 2 × 15 min, followed by 1 × 30 min washes. Cells where then treated with 2.5 µM 
 <bold>BDP FL DBCO</bold> for 30 min and unbound fluorophore was removed by following the same procedure performed for the 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>. All treatments and washes were performed at 37 °C in a complete culture medium. Lastly, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and fluorescence was measured using FACS CANTO II instrument. The analysis was performed on live singlet cells using FlowJo software (
