<p>Following the irreversible reaction shown in

 </italic>-guanine-derivatives (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because most of them are non-fluorescent compounds, we performed an AGTs’ competitive inhibition assay by using the fluorescein-derivative SNAP-Vista
 <sup>®</sup> Green as substrate (
 <bold>SVG</bold>), as previously described

 </xref>. Briefly, the reaction of an AGT with 
 <bold>SVG</bold> led to a fluoresceinated protein, which can be visualised as a fluorescent band in 
 <italic>gel-imaging</italic> analysis after SDS-PAGE. The presence of increasing amounts of a non-fluorescent competitor in the reaction causes a decrease of the fluorescent signals, which can be measured and plotted for the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values determination

 <sup>®</sup> 430 (

 <bold>SVG</bold>, both the enzymes are extremely active on the SNAP Cell
 <sup>®</sup> Block (
 <bold>SCB</bold>), displaying the lowest IC

 <bold>SCB</bold> has a structure very similar to the Lomeguatrib, one of the most efficient inhibitors of the hMGMT protein, employed in the cancer treatment in combination with alkylating agents-based chemotherapeutics
