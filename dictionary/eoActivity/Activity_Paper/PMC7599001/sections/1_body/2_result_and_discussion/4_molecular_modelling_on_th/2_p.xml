 <bold>BGN3</bold> and 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> differ in length since the chemical spacer between the benzyl ring and the active azide makes the latter potentially more prone to the labelling reaction. It could be assumed that this aspect alone influences the availability of the azide moiety to react. However, proteins are not a static system, the amino acids side-chain movements could mask the azide and prevent the “click” chemistry reaction. The covalent complexes of these compounds with

 <bold>BGN3</bold> and 
 <bold>BSGN3</bold>, respectively. The former is less exposed to the solvent with a SASA value of 32.967 ± 18.573 Å
 <sup>2</sup> compared to 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>, which shows a higher SASA value 68.302 ± 32.455 Å
 <sup>2</sup>. This simulation confirmed our biochemical data, proposing the BG-derivative with the spacer as a better substrate for our
