 <italic>chemo-enzymatic approach</italic>, we first investigated the permeability of 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>. Lysates of HEK293T cells pre-treated with 
 <bold>BGNS3</bold> were then incubated with the 
 <bold>SVG</bold> substrate: the absence of any fluorescent signal by 
 <italic>gel-imaging</italic> only in BG-azide treated lysates demonstrated that the internalisation of 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> was fast (ca. 30 min;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, lane 8). Preliminary experiments by FACS analysis confirmed that the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> cycloaddition between 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> and the 
 <bold>BDP-FL DBCO</bold> occurred (
