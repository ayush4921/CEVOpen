<p>Given the lack of any available BLI alkyne-derived sensors, we first activated the AR2G type by a bi-functional linker (
 <bold>propargyl-PEG 3-amine</bold>) in order to expose an alkyne group on the surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). This modified protocol provides first the coating of the sensor tips with alkyne groups (approx. 80 min), during that the reaction between the 
 <italic>protein-tag</italic> and 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> inside the 96-wells rack takes place (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>). Only the contemporary presence of the 
 <italic>clickable</italic>-SNAP and the alkyne-coated sensor led to a measurable response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>). After washing procedures, the signal did not significantly drop-down, given the covalent reaction between the protein and the sensor. We successfully achieved results with both the enzymes, although temperature and times of the enzymatic reaction on BLI (30 °C) favoured the SNAP-

 </xref>. Furthermore, in 
 <italic>Ec</italic>CFEs where both the enzymes were expressed, a specific and efficient immobilisation on BLI sensor tips occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(D)</xref>), although the SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> displayed a lower labelling efficiency in the 
 <italic>Ec</italic>CFE, as expected (compare lane 8 in

 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> gives the opportunity to perform a directly 
 <italic>on-chip purification</italic> of a tagged-POI from a crude lysate. without any purification step, in an indirect manner, which favours a better orientation of the POI for its biological activities.
