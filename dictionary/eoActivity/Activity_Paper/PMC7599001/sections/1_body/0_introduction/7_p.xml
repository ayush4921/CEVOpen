 <sup>®</sup> technology is essentially based on BG-substrates: although many of them are commercially available, the possibility of conjugation of infinite desired molecules to the 4-position on BG leads to the synthesis of 
 <italic>ad hoc</italic> substrates. This is generally possible through the crosslinking reaction of the so-called “BG-building block” (such as the amine-reactive BG-NH
 <sub>2</sub>) with NHS-ester derivative compounds. The main disadvantage is the need to purify the final compounds before the reaction with the enzyme, increasing the times and costs of the experiments (
