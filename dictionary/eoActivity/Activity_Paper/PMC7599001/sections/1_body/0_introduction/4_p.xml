<p>In 2003, the group of Kai Johnsson developed a new strategy to exploit the hMGMT suicidal reaction in biotechnology, adopting a directed-evolution approach to engineer a variant to be used as an innovative 
 <italic>protein-tag</italic>, that is, the SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup>. The rationale behind the SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic> technology is the low substrate specificity of some AGT proteins, being able to efficiently recognise also the 
 <italic>O
  <sup>6</sup>
 </italic>-benzyl-guanine (BG) nucleobase

 </xref>. Likely, the reaction of these enzymes with BG-derivatives could happen: upon the irreversible transfer to the catalytic cysteine, they indeed demonstrated the specific labelling of the hMGMT with molecules, as fluorophores, previously conjugated to the 4-position of the BG benzyl ring. Because of the small dimension of this protein, it was mutagenized to abolish any DNA binding activity and utilised as 
 <italic>protein-tag</italic> for the indirect labelling of proteins of interest genetically fused to it (

 <sup>®</sup> to obtain the CLIP-
