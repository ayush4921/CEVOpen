<p>In this work, we analysed and confirmed the catalytic dependence of SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> and 
 <italic>H
  <sup>5</sup>
 </italic> by several substrates having different chemical groups conjugated to the 
 <italic>O
  <sup>6</sup>
 </italic>-position of the guanine. To overcome these limitations, in the current study we suggest a further improvement of this technology with the application of a 
 <italic>chemo-enzymatic approach</italic>, by using a unique and universal azide decorated BG-derivative, to obtain the specific labelling of the 
 <italic>tag</italic> (
 <italic>clickable</italic>-SNAP), that can be easily coupled with a potentially infinite number of commercially available di-benzo-cyclo-octyl (DBCO)-based molecules, through the copper-free azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(B)</xref>). This approach could mainly offer the advantage to take into account of a unique reaction rate for the enzyme (with the azide-based BG), saving costs and times for the linking to the 
 <italic>tag</italic> of an infinite number of commercially available DBCO-molecules. Here, we successfully proved the labelling of the SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> with several DBCO-based fluorophores and the covalent immobilisation of this protein on alkyne-coated surface sensors.
