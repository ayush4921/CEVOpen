<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> has an excellent collagenase inhibition with a percentage of 90.63 ± 0.00. 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> also showed anti-collagenase activity with the percentage of 85.94 ± 2.21 and 78.13 ± 4.42, respectively. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The EGCG was used as standard, and it showed lower activity than all plants at 71.88 ± 0.00. Nevertheless, the effect of collagenase inhibition of ethanolic extracts might involve to different mechanisms. It has been reported that phytochemical compositions are mainly responsible for collagenase inhibition. Besides, collagen is an ample structural protein and extracellular matrix components, which are degraded by collagenase that is a zinc-containing multi-domain enzyme.[
