<p>The chromatographic ion spectrum of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> contained 10 peaks indicating the presence of 7 chemical constituents. Nevertheless, Ethanol, 2-(9-octadecenyloxy)-, (Z)-giving the highest peak. 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> were classified 30 peaks signify of 25 components by means of the results exhibited that the capacity of γ-Sitosterol in 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> was the maximum while the substance Ethanol 2-(9 Octadecenyloxy)-(Z)-is found similarly in 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, the spectrum was described 18 peaks and 15 bioactive constituents, in the present investigation, a variety of compounds have been detected in 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> that Hexadecanoic acid shows the maximum peak. Three different extracts show that Ethanol, 2-(-Octadecenyloxy), γ-Sitosterol and Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ether are representative of the main interest. Especially, Ethanol, 2-(-Octadecenyloxy) is biochemical compounds because it has a good application for pharmacological actions as anti-cancer.[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The γ-Sitosterol has been reported from soya which have the benefit of anti-diabetic activity.[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] And finally, the extracts of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> showed the presence of Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester which has the antioxidant and hemolytic 5-alpha reductase inhibitor feature.[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Consequently, these compositions may be use as ingredients for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industrials.
