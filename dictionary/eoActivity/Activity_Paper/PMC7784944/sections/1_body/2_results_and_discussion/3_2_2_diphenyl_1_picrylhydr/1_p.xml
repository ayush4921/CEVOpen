<p>The scavenging activity of

 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> extracts against DPPH [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The results exhibited that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are 0.32 ± 0.01, 0.34 ± 0.00 and 0.35 ± 0.01 mg/mL, respectively, and standard ascorbic acid in this assay was 0.005 ± 0.00 when comparing the antioxidant activity of all plants, the result shown that the extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is high significantly effect (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Corresponding to this result, reported the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> contains the highest phenolic content, which presented the great value of antioxidant more than hexane and chloroform extracts.[
