<p>Our results indicate the various bioactive contents of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> ethanolic extracts have an interest function for pharmacological actions such as antioxidant capability due to its good ability to resist DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&lt; 0.93) and total extract are great capable of inhibiting collagenase (inhibiting collagenase more than 78.13%), but elastase is poorly inhibited especially from 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic>. Consequently, these edible plants can use as an anti-aging active ingredient for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industrials.
