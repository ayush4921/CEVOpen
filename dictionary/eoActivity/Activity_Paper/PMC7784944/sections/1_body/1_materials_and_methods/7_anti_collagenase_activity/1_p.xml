 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The reaction mixture contained 20 μL samples and 20 μL enzyme solution (0.8 units/mL dissolved in 50 mM Tricine buffer solution, pH 7.5 which was incubated at 37°C for 10 min before use) was incubated for 10 min after adding 200 μL FALGPA substrate (0.5 mM dissolved in buffer) the absorbance was immediately determined at 340 nm at the time interval of 0 and 1 min. Finally, enzymatic activity was assessed by decreased kinetic absorbance which the percentage of collagenase inhibition was calculated as follows:
