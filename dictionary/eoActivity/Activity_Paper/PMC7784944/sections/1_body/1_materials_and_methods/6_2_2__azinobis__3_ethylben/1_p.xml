<p>The ABTS scavenging assay was measured following the modified method by Kim 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The ABTS reagent was mixed with 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate (8:12 v/v ratio) and incubated in the darkroom temperature for 16 h. The working solution was diluted to 0.70 ± 0.085 OD at 750 nm with water. In addition of 180 μL of the working ABTS solution was mixed with 20 μL of the test sample, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then absorbance was measurement at 750 nm. The percentageof ABTS radical scavenging was calculated as: (1). Moreover, the result was expressed as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
