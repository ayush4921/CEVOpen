<p>The DPPH assay of the extract was modified method as previously described.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The 0.2 mM DPPH solution was prepared in absolute ethanol. The solution was added with 100 Î¼L of the tested samples and DPPH solutions. The reaction was determined at wavelength 520 nm after incubated in the darkroom for 30 min; the percent inhibition of radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows Eq. (1):
