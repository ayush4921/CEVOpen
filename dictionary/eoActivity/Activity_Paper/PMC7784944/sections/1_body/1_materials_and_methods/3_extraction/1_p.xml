<p>All samples were washed with water, ground into powder, and then dehydrated by hot air oven at 50°C. The solvent extracts were prepared by adding 100 g of each sample powder to 1 L of 95% ethanol (1:10 w/v), applying ultrasound-assisted extraction as frequency 40 kHz at 40°C for 30 min then maceration until 7 days, therefore, using a rotary evaporator to remove the solvent and collected crude extract in −20°C consequently the percentage yield calculate.[
