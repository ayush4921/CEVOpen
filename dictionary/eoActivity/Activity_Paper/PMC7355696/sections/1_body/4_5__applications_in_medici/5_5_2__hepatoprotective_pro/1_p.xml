<p>Investigation of the hepatoprotective and therapeutic effect of ethanol–water extract (70:30, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and petroleum ether extracts on CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver cell toxicity in mice showed that liver and kidney function parameters remained in the normal levels in groups treated with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts. The administration of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> ethanolic extracts significantly enhanced SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) activity, as well as total antioxidant capacity, with significant reduction in lipid peroxide concentration when extracts were used as protective or therapeutic agents [

 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> in different concentrations (100, 200, 300, and 400 mg/kg) was assessed by measuring lipid profile parameters such as AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), GSH (reduced gluthation), SOD, and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as by histopathological examination of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver damage in rats. Different concentrations of extracts showed a significant antihepatotoxic effect by reducing the levels of AST and ALT significantly, whereas the ALP level was insignificantly decreased. Regarding the antioxidant activity, these extracts exhibited a significant decrease in SOD and contents of GSH and MDA (a biomarker of membrane lipids peroxidation). These findings showed that different concentrations of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract protect liver against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity, and the effect may be attributed to its antioxidant activity [
