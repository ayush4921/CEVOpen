<p>The immunomodulatory effect of different concentrations of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> aqueous extracts (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight) was evaluated as a cure agent in mice previously infected with 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and as a protective agent in mice infested with 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. According to these results, the lowest concentration of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> (100 mg/kg body weight) showed high immunomodulatory effect in the level of double positive T cells, interleukin (17AIL-17) and interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³).
