 <italic>Marrubium vulgare</italic> has an ethnomedical record as an antidiabetic agent [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Certain efforts have been made in order to obtain scientific evidence supporting its traditional use in diabetes mellitus control [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Hellal et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] performed in vitro screening for the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of six Algerian traditional medicinal plant extracts where 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> 80% ethanol extracts exerted a moderate effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.66 μg/mL). Moreover, a series of in vivo experiments were carried out on alloxan-induced diabetes during which the experimental animals were treated twice a day with aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> for 15 days [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Oral administration of 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> aqueous extract induced significant dose-dependent antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effects. A dose of 100 mg/kg reduced blood glucose by 50%, whereas doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg showed more than 60% reduction of the same parameter. A decrease of total lipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were observed in animals treated with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> when compared to the diabetic control group. Glibenclamide was used as a reference and showed similar effects, and the authors hypothesized that flavonoids and verbascoside derivatives present in examine extract caused the observed effects [
