<p>Another study [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] showed the effect of different 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts (methanol, water, and buthanol) on autoimmune diabetes mellitus induced by cyclosporine and streptozotocin. When compared to diabetic mice, the animals from the group treated with extracts of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> showed a decrease in blood glucose levels, pancreatic levels of interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), and NO. 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts also caused a significant decrease in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Additionally, the serum insulin levels were significantly increased after treatment with
