<p>Chakir et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] showed that the oral administration of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> methanolic extracts resulted in a significant lowering of blood glucose level, serum urea, uric acid, and creatinine, as well as a correction of lipid profiles when compared to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. These methanolic extracts significantly increased the glucose uptake of liver and skeletal muscles. Contrary to this, they reduced the glucose absorption in the everted rat jejunum. These results suggest that the effect of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract may be due to extrapancreatic mechanisms. This antidiabetic effect is an outcome of the modulation of glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption.
