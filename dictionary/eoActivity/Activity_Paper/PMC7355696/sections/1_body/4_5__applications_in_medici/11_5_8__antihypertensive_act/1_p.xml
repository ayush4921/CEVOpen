<p>The water extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> is widely used as an antihypertensive treatment in folk medicine. Crude extracts of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> show a potent in vitro inhibition of KCl-induced contraction of rat aorta. Bioguided fractionations, spectroscopic analysis, and chemical derivatization revealed furanic labdane diterpenes, marrubenol, and marrubiin as the most active compounds [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> water extract had on the systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular remodeling, and vascular relaxation in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it was observed that treatment with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> produced a decrease in systolic blood pressure. In addition, it had significant antihypertrophic effect in aorta and it improved acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation of mesenteric artery. These results demonstrated that in addition to its antihypertensive effect, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> water extract improved the impaired endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats [
