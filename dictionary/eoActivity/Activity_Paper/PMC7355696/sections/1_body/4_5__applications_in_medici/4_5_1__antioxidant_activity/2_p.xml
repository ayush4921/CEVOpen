<p>The in vitro antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> methanol extracts were determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay and the results revealed a strong activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 8.24–12.42 μg/mL [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The antioxidant activity investigated by the same method shows that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> essential oil exhibits IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 153.84 μg/mL, which is about two times higher than a synthetic antioxidant (butylated hydroxytoluene or BHT) [

Photochemiluminescence (PLC) assay, evaluating the antioxidant activity of the compound in the presence of superoxide anion radical, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also generated in the human body, determined the strong antioxidant effect of methanol and acetone 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts (261.41 and 272.90 μmol TE/g respectively), while the lower activity was observed when essential oil and isolated marrubin were investigated [

 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] determined that there is a good correlation of antioxidant potential and the content of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, acetone extracts, deodorized acetone extracts, and deodorized water extracts from 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> leaves were tested for their antioxidant activity in rapeseed oil at 80 °C. The effect of the extracts on the edible oil stability was assessed by measuring weight gain, peroxide value, and UV absorption [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Acetone extracts showed better antioxidant properties than deodorized acetone extracts. According to Yousefi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the high antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> was associated with the presence of marrubiin, along with phenolics and flavonoids exerting a synergistic effect.
