<p>Kozyra et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] investigated the potential anticancer activity of methanolic extracts phenolic acid (PhA) fractions of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> against a human melanoma cancer cell line (A375) and normal human skin fibroblasts (BJ) using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide test, cell cycle analysis, and real-time monitoring of cell viability. Surprisingly, examined fractions demonstrated a low total phenolic content and did not show significant antioxidative properties, but the nonhydrolyzed PhA fraction exhibited cytotoxic activity against a human melanoma cancer cell line, without affecting normal fibroblasts. Both acidic and alkaline hydrolysis abolished this activity, indicating that the esterified forms of phenolic compounds exhibit the observed cytotoxic effects. Since 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> is abundant in phenylpropanoid (cinnamic) esters and phenylethanoid glycosides, further investigation of these compounds may provide an insight into the exact anticancer mechanism of action and use as a model for cancer treatment drug development.
