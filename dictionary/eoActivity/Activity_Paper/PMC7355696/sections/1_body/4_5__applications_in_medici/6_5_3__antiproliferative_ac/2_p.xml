<p>Zarai et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported the ability of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> essential oil to inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.258 μg/mL. 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> ethanol–water extracts (70:30, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) reduced the viability of melanoma (B16) and glioma (U251) in a dose-dependent manner. By demonstrating the ability of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, and cytoprotective autophagy, the results suggested that this plant could be a good candidate for anti-melanoma and anti-glioma therapy [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> was evaluated for its in vitro cytotoxic activity by measuring the percentage of viable cells’ glioblastoma multiforme cell lines (U87, LN229 and T98G) using a luminescence system. After evaluating the cytotoxicity impact that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> has on U87 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 270.3 μM), LN229 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 343 μM), and T98G (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 336.6 μM) from glioblastoma multiforme cell lines, it was concluded that it is the most efficient in two cell lines, U87 (69.9%) and LN229 (71%) [
