<p>The anthelmintic activities of ethanolic and aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> were evaluated using the egg hatch assay and larval mortality assay. After a 24 h exposure period at a concentration of 50 mg/mL, the mortality rate was 45.8% for the aqueous extract and 51% for the ethanolic extract. These findings showed that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts have potential anthelmintic effect on eggs and larvae of bovine strongyles parasites in vitro [
