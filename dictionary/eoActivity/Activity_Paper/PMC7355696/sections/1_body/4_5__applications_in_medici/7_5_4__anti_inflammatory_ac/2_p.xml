<p>The assessment of anti-inflammatory activity showed that the oral administration of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> at a dose of 200 mg/kg in rats treated with carrageenin causes a significant decrease (87.30%) of inflammation compared to standard positive control (diclofenac), which showed 85.52% protection in this test [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a model of microvascular leakage in mice ears, the analysis shows that marrubiin from 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> exhibits significant and dose-related antioedematogenic effects. The treatment of mice with marrubiin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of carregeenan, bradykinin, and histamine-induced extravasation of Evans blue in mice ears, with maximal inhibitions of 63.0%, 70.0%, and 73.7%, respectively. The other phlogistic agonists, such as prostaglandin E2, caused an inhibition of less than 50%. In addition, marrubiin significantly inhibited the ovalbumin-induced allergic edema in actively sensitized animals. These results demonstrate that the systemic administration of marrubiin exerts a non-specific inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory agent-induced microvascular extravasation of Evans blue in mice ears [

 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone-induced abdominal constriction test showed that methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> have a similar effect as reference drugs indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid [
