<p>Acute and recurrent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections remain an important problem due to the emergence of acyclovir resistant virus. As a result of that, the search for novel antiviral bioactive compounds from plants has intensified in recent years. The antiviral activity of methanol, hexane, and chloroform extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> showed antiviral activity with selectivity indices of 3.11, 2.8, and 1.28, respectively. This study revealed that the hexane fraction disrupts the early steps of cyclic replication, including HSV-1 attachment, in a dose-dependent manner [
