<p>The antiplasmodial activity of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> was evaluated in mice infected with chlorquine-sensitive 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei-berghei</italic> using curative, suppressive, and prophylactic experimental animal models. Preliminary phytochemical screening and intraperitoneal LD
 <sub>50</sub> (50% lethal dose) estimation of the extract were carried out. In all doses tested, the extract produced significant curative and suppressive effects with minimal prophylactic effect. The extract also significantly prolonged the survival time of treated mice (up to 22 d), compared to the negative control group (11 d). The results of this study suggest that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> possesses curative and suppressive antiplasmodial activity in mice at all tested doses [
