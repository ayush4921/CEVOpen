 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Amri et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that different concentrations of copper reduce the uptake and translocation of cationic elements Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in a Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration-dependent manner in the aboveground part of the plant. Treatment with copper stimulates antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes) and increases the total phenolics (flavonoid) content. These findings lead the authors to conclude that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> possesses an intrinsic capability to cope with the Cu stress by the activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems.
