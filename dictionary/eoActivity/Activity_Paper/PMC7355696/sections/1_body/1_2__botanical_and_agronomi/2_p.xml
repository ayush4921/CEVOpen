<p>The surface of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> vegetative and generative organs is densely covered with glandular and non-glandular trichomes. There are two types of glandular trichomes: peltate and capitate. Peltate trichomes consist of a short stalk cell and a large head with secretory cells arranged in a circle. The substance produced by secretory cells passes through apical walls and accumulates within a space between the cuticle and the cell wall layer. The plant has a capitate, long trichomes, with basal cells, a long stalk neck cell, and a unicellular head. There are two types of short capitate trichomes: those with a bicellular head and those with a unicellular stalk. As for non-glandular trichomes, they can be multicellular uniserate or multicellular branched [
