<p>The biofertilization of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> plants with nitrogen biofertilizer (Biofert), potassium biofertilizer (Available K), or with a combination of the two showed that when applied abundantly, the fertilizers enable the 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> plant to reach its maximum height, and also enhance fresh and dry herb weights and essential oil production [
