<p>Boron plays a very important role in sugar synthesis in cell walls, nucleic acid, phenolics, hormone, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, cell elongation and pollen tube formation in plants. However, the deficiency and toxicity levels of boron are quite close when it comes to plants, which need only trace amounts of boron for vital activities. Ardic et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used a curcumin method for the identification of boron content in 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> plant specimens (root, stem leaf, and flower). In addition, soil samples were analyzed for boron content via the atomic absorption spectrophotometer technique. Their report confirmed that compared to the boron concentration in soil, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> samples accumulated boron levels that were 4 times higher in flowers, more than 4 times higher in leaves, 3 times higher in stem, and about 3 times higher in root, which showed that the members of the natural populations of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> can tolerate high boron stress.
