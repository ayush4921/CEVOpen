<p>Subcritical 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extraction can be used as a method of choice to obtain high-quality powders that preserves the constant amorphous structure after 6 months storage time. Furthermore, recoveries of both phenolic acids and flavonoids were distinctly higher when 10% maltodextrin was added as a carrier, which suggested that maltodextrin addition protects bioactive compounds from thermal degradation. This is particularly emphasized in the case of rutin content, which was 4-fold higher when a carrier was included [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic>, can be successfully separated from complex mixtures by chitin, which is an abundant natural polymer [
