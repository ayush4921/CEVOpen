<p>The marrubiin and related diterpenoid metabolites predominantly accumulate in leaves and leaf trichomes. The central diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) turns into peregrinol diphosphate, which is a bicyclic prenyl diphosphate intermediate that features a hydroxyl group at C-9, which is characteristically present in marrubiin and related metabolites [
