<p>Furthermore, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> is an abundant source of various phenolic compounds, major classes being phenolic acids, phenylpropanoid (cinnamic) acids, and esters and flavonoids. The amount of total cinnamic acid derivatives is estimated to 14.09 mg/100 mg of dry material [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> contain tannins (up to 7%) where the estimated amount of condensed tannins is 16.55 mg catechin/100 g of dry material [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Detailed chemical analysis identified gallic, gentisic, p-hydroxybenyoic, protocatechuic, and syringic acids. In the cinnamic acids subgroup of phenolic compounds, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic, ferulic, o-coumarinic, p-coumarinic and sinapic acids are determined. Chologenic acid and other cinnamic acid esters were quantified. It was considered that as a part of the Lamioideae subfamily, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> is characterised by bitter components, a low amount of essential oil, and an absence of rosmarinic acid [

Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, phenylethanoid glycosides, such are acteoside (used as qualitative marker), alyssonoside, arenanoside, ballotetroside, marruboside, and others represent another subgroup of phenolic compounds present in 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts. The list of individual bioactive phenolic acids and esters is given in
