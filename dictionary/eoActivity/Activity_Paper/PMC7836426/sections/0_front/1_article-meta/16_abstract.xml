  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>The present study is the first contribution to the ethnopharmacological profile of this Prefecture. It is recommended that the constituents of indigenous species be studied to determine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action. However, attention must be paid to the conservation of medicinal species, comprehensively documenting traditional medicinal knowledge as well as conducting phytochemical validation of reported plants.</p>
