<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of Green Tea and Haritaki was found to be 8.9 ± 0.5 and 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The aqueous extracts of plants Mulethi (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>), Tulsi (
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>), Giloy (
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>), and Neem (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>) have less efficiency in inhibiting the protease activity of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These plants could not inhibit the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease activity to 50% even with 450 μg/ml of the plant extracts.
