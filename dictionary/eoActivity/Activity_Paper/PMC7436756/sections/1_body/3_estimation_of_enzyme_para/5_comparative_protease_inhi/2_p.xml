<p>The comparison in the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease inhibition efficacies of Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki were studied. Both Tea (Green Tea and Black tea) and Haritaki displayed comparable inhibition to protease activity; 50% inhibition at 10 μg/ml and more than 90% inhibition beyond 40 μg/ml. The results suggest that either form of Tea and Haritaki can be a potential anti‐viral agent against the SARS‐CoV‐2 (Figure
