<p>The virus comprises 26 different proteins, which include 10 major structural proteins, namely the envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and the trimeric spike (S) proteins that are vital to the completion of its replication cycle. Further, the viral genome encodes two proteases‐ the papain‐like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>); and the 3‐chymotrypsin‐like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) also known as the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) of the virus (Anand, Ziebuhr, Wadhwani, Mesters, &amp; Hilgenfeld, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Both of the proteases are essential for the processing of polyproteins PP1A and PP1B, translated from the RNA of the virus (Hilgenfeld, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme has emerged as an interesting premise for the development of drugs targeting the virus. The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is very important for virus to replicate and propagate and its inhibitors may halt the disease at an early stage of replication. It recognises and cleaves the virus non‐structural polyprotein at 12 sites. One of the site on the polyprotein includes Leu‐Gln*(Ser, Ala, Gly) (* denotes the cleavage site). To impede virus replication, multiple strategies are being employed. Medicinal plants could be harnessed as one of the safest means of medication and have been used traditionally for various manifestations. The anti‐viral activities of several plants have been elucidated so far (Newman &amp; Cragg, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The role of plant lectins as anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 has been proposed (Capell et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). We have shortlisted the medicinal plants which are reported to possess the anti‐viral, anti‐oxidant, and anti‐inflammatory properties. Further, the aqueous extracts were screened for 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition, in‐vitro. We found that tea (

 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic>) as potential inhibitors of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity of SARS‐CoV‐2. Additonally, we compared the activity inhibition by different types of Teas and found that Green Tea and Black Tea displayed comparable potencies to inhibit the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity of SARS‐CoV‐2.
