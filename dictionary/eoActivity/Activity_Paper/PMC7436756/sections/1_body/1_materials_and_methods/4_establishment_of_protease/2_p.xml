<p>The protease activity of the purified 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was tested using a modified protocol from previously reported protocol using casein as a substrate (Banik, Biswas, &amp; Karmakar, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Cupp‐Enyard, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme is non‐specific as it cleaves at 12 different locations in SARS‐CoV‐2. Casein substrate contains peptide sequences that can be cleaved by 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS‐CoV‐2. Hence, we have used the casein substrate for activity measurements. The substrate stock of 0.65% (274 μM) was prepared in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the enzyme (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) was taken in varying concentrations. The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme (10 μM) and varying casein substrate (0–257 μM) were mixed to a final volume of 400 μl and incubated at 37°C for an hour. After the incubation period reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 110 mM trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 10 min. The final reaction mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000
 <italic>g</italic> and absorbance at OD
 <sub>280</sub> was measured using a spectrometer (Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer) and values of reactions were subtracted with that of the buffer. The absorbance at 280 nm is the measurement of 
 <sc>l</sc>‐tyrosine produced by the protease activity. The standard plot of 
 <sc>l</sc>‐tyrosine was plotted for the velocity calculations. The maximum velocity of the enzymatic reaction was calculated using substrate concentration versus velocity plot and fitted with Michaelis–Menten equations.
