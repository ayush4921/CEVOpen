<p>The plants aqueous extracts were evaluated for their potential to inhibit the enzyme activity. The 10 μM of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme and 137 μM of casein substrate were used to study the inhibition effects of extracts. Different concentrations (0–450 μg/ml) of extracts were screened to assess their inhibitory potential. Two sets of reactions were prepared, one for reaction with extracts having 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and another without 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, as control. The rate of inhibition and potential efficacy was calculated by standard kinetics curve.
