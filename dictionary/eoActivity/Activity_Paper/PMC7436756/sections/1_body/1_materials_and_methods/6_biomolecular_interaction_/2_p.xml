<p>Fluorescence quenching was performed to analyze the effect of plants extracts on the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> structural dynamics. The tertiary structure perturbations post‐interaction to ligands present in the extracts were assessed using intrinsic fluorescence of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Ten μM of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein was incubated with or without extracts at different concentrations (0–80 μg/ml), fluorescence intensity was monitored on Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies). The parameters used for excitation wavelength is 295 nm and emission scan between 310 and 400 nm with the slit width for excitation (5 nm) and emission (10 nm). The experiments were performed at controlled temperature 25°C. The change in intensity or wavelength was used for the protein ligand interaction analysis.
