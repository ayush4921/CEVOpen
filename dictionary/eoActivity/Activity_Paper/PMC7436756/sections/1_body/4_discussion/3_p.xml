<p>We found that components present in the aqueous extract of Tea and Haritaki inhibited the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the anti‐viral effect of these extracts and bioactive constituents needs to be validated in the in‐vivo studies. The activity data (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) suggests that both Tea and Haritaki might be good source for the design of potential inhibitors for the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS‐CoV‐2. We have tried to investigate the potential and probable molecules that are abundantly present in Tea. Among the virtually screened molecules, thearubigin, quercetin‐3‐O‐rutinoside, and hesperidin displayed interaction with the active site of the protease (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). To our best, this is the first in‐vitro reporting and validation of the protease inhibition by Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki extracts against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS‐CoV‐2. These findings lays the foundation for further analysis of active molecules and their validation in higher validation systems.
