  <p>Determination of inhibitory concentration of plant extracts. The inhibition of percentage enzyme activity in the presence of varying concentrations (0–450 μg/ml) of plant extracts are shown. The value at which the 50% enzyme activity‐reduction observed is taken as IC
   <sub>50</sub> of individual extracts. All the experiments were performed in triplicates. Error bars represent SEM [Colour figure can be viewed at
