<p>Primary HUVECs were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2–3 days in 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks containing CM-200 medium supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum, 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor, 3 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor and 10 μg/mL heparin. Confluent cells were detached using a trypsin–EDTA solution, and the cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 100 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was removed, the cell pellets were resuspended in fresh medium, counted with a haemocytometer, and seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 96-well plate. Using a trypan blue exclusion method, cell viability was determined to be consistently greater than 90% prior seeding of the endothelial cells. The monolayers were used within 2 h after reaching confluence.
