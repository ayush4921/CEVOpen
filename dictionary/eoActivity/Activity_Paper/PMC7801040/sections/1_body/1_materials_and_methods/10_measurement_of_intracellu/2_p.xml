<p>Intracellular SOD activity was measured with a Total Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit based on the autooxidation of hydroxylamine. Targeted cells were lysed in PBS by ultrasonic pyrolysis (5 s of sonication plus 5 s of rest; 10 times). Total SOD activity in the homogenates was measured using the hydroxylamine method. The optical density (OD) values of the samples were determined at 550 nm, and each test was repeated at least three times.</p>
