<p>MDA and SOD levels were assessed to study antioxidation in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs (Zhu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). MDA levels were analysed by a commercially available colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, pre-treated cells were harvested by scraping and homogenized in RIPA buffer on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatant. MDA levels were detected at 532 nm using a microplate reader. We used the bicinchoninic acid disodium (BCA) protein assay kit to quantify the protein concentration. MDA content is expressed as nanomoles per milligram of protein.
