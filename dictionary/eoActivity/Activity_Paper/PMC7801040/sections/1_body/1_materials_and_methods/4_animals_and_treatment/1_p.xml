<p>In order to exclude the influence of menstruation on blood lipid index (Svanborg and Vikrot 1967), only male Sprague-Dawley rats (190 ± 10 g) were obtained from the Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Foshan, China). The animals were housed in a standard laboratory within the Experimental Animal Management Center of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University under controlled temperature (22–25 °C) and humidity (50–60%) and maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle. All rats were kept in propylene cages and provided
