<p>Cell growth and the sensitivity of HUVECs to the two HJ extracts were assessed. The HUVECs were preincubated with varying concentrations of NHJ (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL) and SHJ (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL) for 24 h and then treated with ox-LDL (20 μg/mL) for another 2 h. The cells were collected to test for intracellular ROS, MDA and SOD production as well as cell apoptosis (Yu et al.
