<p>The necrotic and apoptotic fractions were assessed by annexin V-FITC staining after the induction of cell death using an FCM apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVECs (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were harvested, washed with binding buffer, and resuspended in 100 μL of binding buffer containing annexin-V-FITC (10 μL). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed with binding buffer. Just before the samples were analysed by FCM, propidium iodide (PI; final concentration of 5 μg/mL) was added. The cell populations were counted based on the following criteria: annexin V–/PI– cells indicated live cells, annexin V–/PI + cells were necrotic cells, annexin V+/PI– cells represented early apoptotic cells, and annexin V+/PI + cells were late apoptotic cells. The samples were analysed with a FACSCalibur instrument running CellQuest software (Liu et al.
