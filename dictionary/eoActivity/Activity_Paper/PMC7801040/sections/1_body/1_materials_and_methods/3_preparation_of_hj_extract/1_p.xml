<p>Dried NHJ and SHJ were collected by the authors from Bozhou, PR China, in April 2016 and identified by the corresponding author (Jingjing Zhu). Voucher specimens (no. BZHJ201608) were deposited in the Quality Standards Research Center, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. Dried NHJ and SHJ were extracted with boiling water (2 × 10 L; 3 h each). The aqueous solutions were filtered and vacuum evaporated to dryness. The yield of each sample, i.e., 36.7% and 31.3% for NHJ and SHJ, respectively, was measured by calculating the weight of the dried extract/the weight of primary dried material (w/w %).</p>
