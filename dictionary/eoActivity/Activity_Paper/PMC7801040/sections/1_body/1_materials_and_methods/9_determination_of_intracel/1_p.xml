<p>Approximately, 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/well cells were seeded in a six-well plate overnight. After ox-LDL (20 μg/mL) treatment for 2 h following pre-treatment with varying concentrations of NHJ and SHJ for 24 h, the cells were incubated with CM-DCFH2-DA (10 μM) in the dark at 37 °C for 40 min, washed with PBS and detached with trypsin/EDTA. Cellular fluorescence was analysed by flow cytometry (FCM, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The experiment was performed in triplicate.
