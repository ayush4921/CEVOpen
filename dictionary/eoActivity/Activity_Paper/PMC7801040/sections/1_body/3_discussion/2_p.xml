<p>Hyperlipidaemia plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of many cardiocerebrovascular diseases by increasing the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C and decreasing the level of HDL-C in the blood. Thus, the lipid regulatory and antioxidative effects HJ extracts on hyperlipidemic rats were first tested. Before the study, a preliminary experiment was carried out in 60 mice, and the data revealed that none of the mice experienced adverse reactions at a dose of 15 (NHJ) or 10 g/kg (SHJ) (data were not shown). While the maximum tolerated doses of NHJ and SHJ are unknown, a dose below 10 g/kg for both NHJ and SHJ is considered safe. Thus, three different doses under 10 g/kg were used in this study. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the effective dose of HJ is 2 g/kg, as determined by converting the human equivalent dose to the animal dose. NHJ and SHJ were used at concentrations of 1, 2 and 4 g/kg in the animal experiments. Consistent with previous findings (Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), the results showed that both NHJ and SHJ significantly decreased serum TG, TC, LDL-C, LDL/HDL and MDA levels and increased serum HDL-C and SOD, with the effect increasing as the NHJ or SHJ dose increased. The results also demonstrated that the lipid regulatory and antioxidant effects of NHJ were significantly more robust than those of SHJ, as expected. There is emerging evidence that sulphur compounds stimulate immune cells and induce the inflammatory (Jacobi-Gresser et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and immune cells have reported to be able to affect lipid metabolism (Schaftenaar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It is speculated that residual sulphur compounds in SHJ may be one of the potential reasons in LDL in NHJ and SHJ treatment groups.
