<p>After the lipid regulatory and antioxidative effects HJ extracts on hyperlipidemic rats were identified, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> examination further confirmed these findings in HUVECs. Ox-LDL is associated with atherosclerosis development and is widely used to establish the cellular model of atherosclerosis by exposing to HUVECs (Hu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The different effects of two HJ extracts on the prevention of oxidative damage and dysfunction of HUVECs caused by ox-LDL were explored 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Before these tests were carried out, the equilibrium solubility of HJ extracts in the HUVEC culture medium was detected, and the results showed that NHJ was more soluble than SHJ. The sensitivity of HUVECs to HJ extracts was also tested, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of NHJ and SHJ were 186.7 and 19.9 mg/mL, respectively. As such, compared to SHJ, NHJ had very little inhibitory effect on HUVEC growth. Therefore, the test doses of 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL were used to further study the antioxidant activity of HJ extracts. The effects of HJ extracts on intracellular ROS, MDA and SOD levels in HUVECs were tested, and the results indicated that the decrease in ROS and MDA levels and elevation of SOD activity was more robust in HUVECs treated with NHJ than those treated with SHJ. Another 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study of antioxidation showed that extracts from the stems and leaves of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> have very good scavenging effects against DPPH radicals (Kim 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, other cell experiments have also indicated that aqueous 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> extracts can relieve damage to pheochromocytoma (PC) 12 cells caused by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (Zheng et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Some studies have shown that 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum boreale</italic> might be a source of antioxidant flavonoids, especially rutin and isoquercitrin (Kim 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
