 <italic>Chrysanthemi Flos</italic> (Ju Hua in Chinese) is a medicinal and edible cognate that is botanically derived from the dry capitulum of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> Ramat. (Xie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In recent years, the importance of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> as a source of potentially novel bioactive compounds has been gradually recognized due to its potential antioxidative effect and its ability to lower blood pressure and blood lipid levels (Sudha et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our previous studies indicated that some chemical transformations, such as hydrolysis of flavonoid glycoside and a significant loss of caffeoylquinic acids, occurred in various cultivars of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> during SF processing (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, the destruction of hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids in SHJ has a tremendous impact on its antioxidant capacity (Wang S et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the hazardous effects of SHJ have not been adequately studied, and thus, the role of SF in the bioactivities of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> has is not fully understood. In this study, the effects of NHJ and SHJ on oxidative stress-induced antioxidation were compared both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.
