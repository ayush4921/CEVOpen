<p>Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of various ROS and antioxidant defence, and ROS have been identified as signalling molecules in various pathways, regulating both cell survival and cell death (Wang J et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In this study, the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in the ox-LDL treatment group compared to the control group. Compared to ox-LDL treatment, NHJ significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, with the effect increasing as the NHJ dose increased. Several studies have shown that a hot water extract of the flowers of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> effectively inhibits the ox-LDL-induced expression of ICAM-1 and E-selection in HUVECs (Lii et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, in the SHJ-pre-treated groups, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased at doses of 50 and 100 μg/mL but increased at a dose of 200 μg/mL. It is well known that SHJ can generate sulphur dioxide, which can remain in the treated herbs and alter their original components (Duan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This might explain why the apoptotic cell population increased in the group pre-treated with 200 μg/mL SHJ.
