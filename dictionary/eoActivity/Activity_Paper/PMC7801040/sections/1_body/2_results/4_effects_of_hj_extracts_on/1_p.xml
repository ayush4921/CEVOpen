<p>The average fluorescence intensity of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein acetate-stained samples was detected by FCM. Compared with that of the BC group (58.56 ± 5.17), the average fluorescence intensity of the ox-LDL group (188.34 ± 9.06) was significantly enhanced, indicating that ox-LDL treatment increased ROS production in HUVECs. However, compared to ox-LDL treatment alone, pre-treatment with either NHJ or SHJ significantly prevented ox-LDL-induced ROS staining, with the effect increasing as the NHJ or SHJ dose increased (vs. NC group, all 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The results also showed that NHJ was more effective than SHJ in decreased ROS production, which was induced by ox-LDL in HUVECs (NHJ vs. SHJ, all
