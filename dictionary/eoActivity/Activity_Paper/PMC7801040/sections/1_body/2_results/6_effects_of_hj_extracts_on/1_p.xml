<p>Induction of ox-LDL-induced HUVEC apoptosis was evaluated using annexin V-FITC/PI staining. FCM analysis demonstrated that the NC group that was treated only with ox-LDL exhibited more apoptotic cells than the BC group. The results also showed that compared to control treatment, incubation with NHJ significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, with the effect increasing as the NHJ increased. However, the number of apoptotic cells only decreased after pre-treatment with 50 or 100 μg/mL SHJ. The number of apoptotic cells was increased in the 200 μg/mL SHJ-treated group compared to 100 μg/mL SHJ-treated group (
