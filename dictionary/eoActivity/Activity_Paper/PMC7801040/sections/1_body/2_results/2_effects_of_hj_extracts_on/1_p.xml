<p>Serum TG, TC, LDL-C, LDL/HDL levels, MDA content and SOD activity were tested. The levels in the NC group were significantly increased compared to those in the BC group, except the HDL-C level and SOD activity, which were significantly decreased (all

Compared with the NC group, both the NHJ and SHJ groups exhibited significant decreases in serum TG, TC, LDL-C, LDL/HDL and MDA levels and increases in the serum HDL-C level and SOD activity that were augmented as the NHJ or SJH dose increased (all
