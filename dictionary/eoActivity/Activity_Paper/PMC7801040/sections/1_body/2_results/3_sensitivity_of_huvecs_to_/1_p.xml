<p>The effects of NHJ and SHJ on the proliferation of HUVECs in liquid culture were studied using the MTT assay. HUVECs were treated with varying concentrations of NHJ and SHJ for 24 h. Based on the growth inhibition assay, SHJ suppressed the growth of HUVECs more significantly than NHJ (all

 <sub>50</sub> values of NHJ and SHJ were calculated to be 186.7 and 19.9 mg/mL, respectively.
