<p>Drying is considered the crucial step in postharvest processes due to its importance in limiting enzymatic degradation and microbial growth while preserving the plant’s beneficial properties (Yuan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Traditionally, shade drying, sun drying and hot air drying are the standard preparation methods of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic>. However, sulphur fumigation (SF), a fast and cheap method well known for its various benefits, including its ability to shorten drying time; preserve colour; and prevent pests, mould and bacterial contamination, has been commonly employed to replace the natural drying processes of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> in recent years (Kan et al.
