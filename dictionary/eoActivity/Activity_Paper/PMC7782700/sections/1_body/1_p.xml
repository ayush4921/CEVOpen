<p>Fresh leaf tissues of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> were collected from Dali county, Shaanxi province, China (N33.700844, E100.005013). The voucher specimens (DL191102002) are preserved in herbarium of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine. The total genomic DNA of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> was isolated from leaf materials by the modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Then Illumina pair-read sequences were indexed by the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. High quality reads were assembled through the MIRA 4.0.2 program (Chevreux et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and MITObim version 1.7 (Hahn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The plastid genome was annotated by GENEIOUS R8 (Fan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and manually adjusted by comparing with the plastid genome homologous gene of MK817503. Finally, the annotated plastid genome of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> was submitted to GenBank (accession number: MT483984) and the ring genome was mapped using OGDRAW program (Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Gao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
