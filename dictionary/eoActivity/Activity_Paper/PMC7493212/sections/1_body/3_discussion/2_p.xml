<p>The evaluation of protective activity in liver damage induced by paracetamol has been widely used for hepatoprotective drug screening. Hepatotoxicity with paracetamol is due to its highly reactive metabolite, NAPQI.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Increase in NAPQI quantity leads to glutathione depletion, which finally causes an alteration in homeostasis, an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane with a consequent cellular swelling, karyolysis, vacuolization of hepatocytes and an elevation of liver enzymes.
