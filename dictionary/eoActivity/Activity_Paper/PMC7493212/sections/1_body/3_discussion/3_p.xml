<p>The main enzyme levels elevated during liver injuries are ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and bilirubin. The reason is that these enzymes are mainly found in the liver and are released into the blood as a result of liver injury. There is also a reduction in the total protein and albumin levels due to disruption and dissociation of polyribosomes on endoplasmic reticulum resulting in decreasing the biosynthesis of protein.
