<p>The mechanism of these phytochemicals for their hepatoprotective activity is mainly due to their free radical scavenging activity since the plant extracts contain different phytoconstituents which possess free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, the phytochemical flavonoid could maintain cell membrane stability or could protect cell membrane leakage up on damage by paracetamol as evidenced by a reduction in the liver biomarkers. This is in line with the findings of Tarahovsky et al (2014).

This finding concurs with other studies that have shown the anti-inflammatory activity of these phytochemicals.
