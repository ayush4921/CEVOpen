<p>In the present study, the plant extracts showed a dose-dependent free radical scavenging activity; by which the crude extract showed antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 128.6 µg/mL compared to the aqueous and chloroform fractions. Generally, the antioxidant activity of the plant extracts is in the order of crude extract, aqueous fraction, and chloroform fraction. The antioxidant activity may be attributed due to the presence of secondary metabolites including flavonoids, polyphenols, and coumarins. This is in agreement with the previous findings reported by Alghazeer et al (2018); Sharma et al (2016); Teshome et al (2015); Torres et al (2006).

Thus, the highest free radical scavenging activity of the crude extract could be due to the ability of 70% ethanol to extract non-polar, medium polar and polar phytochemicals that can act synergistically.
