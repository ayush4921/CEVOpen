<p>Pretreatment of the mice with different doses of the crude extract and solvent fractions combined with paracetamol demonstrated hepatoprotective activities against paracetamol-induced liver injury; reducing the elevated levels of ALT, AST and ALP (P&lt;0.001). Total bilirubin was reduced significantly in a dose dependent manner. The crude extract and the aqueous fraction showed a significant elevation in the total protein at a dose of 400 mg/kg compared to toxic group (P&lt;0.05).</p>
