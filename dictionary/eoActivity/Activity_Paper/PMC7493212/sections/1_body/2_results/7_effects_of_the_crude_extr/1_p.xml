<p>The liver tissues in the normal control group showed normal parenchymal architecture with no cellular necrosis (A), but the liver tissues of mice administered with paracetamol only, showed necrotic hepatocytes, hyperaemic/congested blood vessels and infiltration of inflammatory cells (B).

Regeneration of the liver cells was evidenced by observing mitosis indicators in the liver tissues (
