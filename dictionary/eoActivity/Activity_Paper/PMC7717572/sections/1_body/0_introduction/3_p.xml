<p>Treatment in T2DM is mostly by consuming the oral antidiabetic drugs that act through the different mechanisms in controlling the increased blood glucose level along with changes in diet and healthy lifestyles. Clinically, there is various type of oral hyperglycaemic drugs, which has been used in controlling this disease and are classified into different classes such as biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZD), meglitinides, Dipeptidyl peptidase (IV) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2), and Î±-glucosidase inhibitors

 </xref>. To date, molecular docking studies have been used recently in predicting the potential inhibitor that has been compared with marketed anti-diabetic drugs as which by seeking these natural compounds as new anti-diabetic agents with little or no adverse effects for the long term effect. Molecular docking is an important computational method for predicting possible drug-protein interactions with the selected ligand that represent bioactive compound containing in the medicinal plants
