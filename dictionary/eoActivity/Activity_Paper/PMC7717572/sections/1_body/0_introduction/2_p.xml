<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus or shortly known as T2DM is a type of diabetes disease that has features of insulin resistance from the decrease in the peripheral glucose uptake in most of the targeted tissue. This is happen due to the insensitivity of insulin from the insulin resistance that may reduce the production of insulin and finally leading to excessive blood glucose level or known as hyperglycaemia

 </xref>. Recently, the pathogenies of T2DM is intertwined with various type of mechanism such as increasing insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, increased response towards incretin hormones, decrease reabsorption of glucose through carbohydrate digestion and increased in peripheral glucose uptake

 </xref>. One of the most potent approaches in the management of T2DM is by Dipeptidyl peptidase (IV) inhibition, where the inhibitor of these enzymes will prevent the degradation of the incretin hormone, which in turn increase the insulin secretion and lowering blood glucose level

 </xref>. Apart from this, the excessive amount of carbohydrates present in the diet can be considered as one of the major causes of diabetes. The delaying absorption of sugar in the bloodstream that may exert in low blood sugar level which through an inhibitory potential of α-glucosidase, known as the main enzyme in the carbohydrate mechanism. The inhibition of these enzymes is able to delay the absorption of monosaccharides from dietary complex carbohydrates, preventing any sudden rise in meal-induced blood glucose level, and therefore are involved in controlling the glucose level in the blood

 </xref>. This is well correlated with the interesting finding that reveals that the α-glucosidase enzyme inhibitor is capable of slowing carbohydrate digestion, resulting in less efficient glucose absorption and thus decreasing postprandial hyperglycaemia
