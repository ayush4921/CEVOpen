<p>Molecular docking studies were carried out using AutoDock program to study the binding within the active site of each of the enzymes. The binding conformation was visualised using PyMOL. The grid size was set to 28 × 28 × 30 xyz points andgrid centre was designated at dimensions (x= −14.748, 16.602, 48.062, y= −27.504, 49.805, 51.582, z= −1.293, 21.889, 34.659, for 4J5T, 1HNY and 2P8S respectively. The grid centre was placed in the active site pocket centre. The grid boxes included the entire binding site of the enzyme and provided enough space for the ligand translational and rotational walk. A scoring grid is calculated from the ligand structure to minimise the computation time. After the complete execution of AutoDock, various conformations of the ligand in a complex with the receptor were obtained, which were finally ranked based on binding energy. The results of the interaction were analysed using a Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) server (

Results thus obtained were expressed in terms of free energy (kcal/mol) of protein-ligand binding.
