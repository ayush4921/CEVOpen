<p>Cell viability was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay as reported with minor modifications

 </xref>. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate and allowed to attach for 24. The attached cells were then exposed to the test samples with varying concentrations for a 24 h challenge. Subsequently, 20 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and further incubated for another 4 h period. Following removal of excess MTT and PBS rinse, 200 μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals formed. The purple formazan coloured product was quantified at 570 nm, using a plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1 Multi-Mode Reader, Winooski, VT, USA). In this assay, 1% of DMSO was employed as vehicle control and Triton X-100 (1.0%; 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) in DMEM were being employed as a positive control. The cell viability was expressed as a fraction of viable cells relative to vehicle control cultures. The IC
 <sub>20</sub> values and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, indicating the respective concentration of test sample producing 20 and 50% inhibition in growth, were calculated using Graphpad Prism 7.0 (San Diego, California, USA).
