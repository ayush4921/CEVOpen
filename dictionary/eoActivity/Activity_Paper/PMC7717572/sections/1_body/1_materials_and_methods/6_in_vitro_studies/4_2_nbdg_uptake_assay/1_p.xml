 </xref>. The protocol was followed based on the 2-NBDG uptake cell-based assay kit (Item No: 600470) Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA). Glucose uptake activity of test drugs is determined in L6 and 3T3-L1 cells on 96-well clear bottom black fluorescence plates (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). In brief, the 24 h cell cultures with 70–80% confluency are allowed to differentiate by maintaining in DMEM with 2% FBS for 4–6 days. The extent of differentiation is established by observing the multinucleation of cells. The differentiated cells are serum-starved overnight and at the time of the experiment, cells are washed with HEPES buffered Krebs Ringer Phosphate solution (KRP buffer) once and incubated with KRP buffer with 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells are treated with different non-toxic concentrations of test sample (1.5–0.0468 mg/mL) and (1.0–0.062 mg/mL) for 3T3-L1 and L6 cell respectively for 60 min along with negative controls in glucose-free culture medium at 37 °C. At 10 min before the end of the treatment, 2-NBDG was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/mL in a glucose-free medium. At the end of treatment, the plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated and 200 μL of cell-based assay buffer was added to each well. The plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated and 100 μL of cell-based assay buffer was added to each well. The 2-NBDG taken up by cells can be detected with a fluorescent reading by (excitation/emission = 485/535 nm) by using Biotek Synergy H1 Multi-Mode Reader (Winooski, VT, USA). Three independent experimental values in duplicates are taken to determine the percentage of 2-NBDG uptake over controls.
