<p>Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was performed following the guideline provided by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Technical Bulletin No. 9 (ATCC, 2011). The cells were first seeded into 24-well culture plate at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and further incubated until 100% confluence. The differentiation process (Day 1) was initiated by incubating the cells in differentiation medium comprising of DMEM with 10% FBS, 50 μg/mL gentamicin, 1.0 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX and 1.0 µg/mL insulin. Fresh differentiation medium was supplied after every 48 h of incubation. On day 5, the differentiation medium was replaced with an adipocyte maintenance medium consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS and 1.0 µg/mL insulin. The replacement of fresh medium after every 48 h incubation period proceeded until day 12. Control cultures were treated with either 0.1% DMSO (20 µL) or rosiglitazone (5–20 µM).
