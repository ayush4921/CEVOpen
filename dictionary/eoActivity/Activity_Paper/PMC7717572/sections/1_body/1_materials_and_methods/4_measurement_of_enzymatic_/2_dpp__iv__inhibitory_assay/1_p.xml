<p>The inhibition of DPP (IV) was conducted by following DPP (IV) screening assay kit by Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA), (Item no: 700210). The positive control inhibitor, 30 µl of sitagliptin and sample was made in varying concentrations (500–8000 µg/ml) in an assay buffer was added into10 µl of DPP (IV) enzyme solution. Then, the solutions were incubated for about 15 min at 37 °C. A 50 µl of the substrate was added into the mixture and was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence reading was measured by setting excitation wavelength at 355 nm, emission wavelength at 455 nm and gain setting at 80. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows:
