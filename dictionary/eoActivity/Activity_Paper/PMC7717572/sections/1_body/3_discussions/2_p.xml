<p>Besides, the presence of several phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenolic with a greater number of hydroxyl groups that present in the compounds would have a significant inhibitory effect that boasts a greater inhibitory effect towards the α-glucosidase enzyme

 </xref>. Besides, the results given by using subcritical water extraction has a remarkable activity in inhibition of α-glucosidase. By applying hot extraction technique, the inhibition of α-glucosidase on 
 <italic>Meriandra bengalensis</italic> has revealed that the inhibitory activity from water extracts achieved high inhibitory activity as compared with other organic solvents

 </xref>. This can be related with the principal of water under subcritical state, where the polarity of water decrease as increasing the water temperature. This will causes the decrease of dielectric constant of water originally at ambient temperature is ε = 80 significantly reduced to (ε = 27 at 250 °C), which was pretty closed to the permittivity of ethanol (ε = 25) or methanol (ε = 33)

 </xref>. Hence, these factors reducing the results of the gap produced between the solvent and SWE extraction methods. Therefore, the findings revealed that the extracts of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> from SWE extraction have potential in inhibiting α-glucosidase activity, which works as one of the natural inhibitors for α-glucosidase that associated with T2DM.
