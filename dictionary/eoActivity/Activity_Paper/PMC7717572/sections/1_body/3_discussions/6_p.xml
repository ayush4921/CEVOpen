<p>Apparently, the active compounds regulated in the extracts also contribute to promoting the effects by improving the secretion of insulin. Relatively, the observation made on the

The presence of phytochemicals in the extracts that facilitate the insulin release on pancreatic cell substantiates our observed effectiveness.
