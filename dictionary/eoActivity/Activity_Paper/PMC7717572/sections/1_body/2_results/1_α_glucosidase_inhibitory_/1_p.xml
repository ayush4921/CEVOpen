<p>The percent of α-glucosidase inhibition activity of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root and fruit extracts was plotted with the function of concentration in comparison with acarbose that acts as a positive control as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, where the concentration of the sample is ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 mg/ml. The result indicates that root extracts have significantly more potential for inhibiting these enzymes which inhibit above 50% on the enzyme compared to the fruit extracts. The highest concentration of roots extract (2.5 mg/ml) inhibited the maximum percentage inhibition of α-glucosidase was nearly 56%. Meanwhile, fruit extracts have recorded the maximum inhibition activity with 22% at the maximum extract concentration (2.5 mg/ml) and for fruits extracts, it notified there was no significant difference as the concentration increased from 0.3125–0.625 mg/ml and after that, as increasing the concentration, there was significant difference reported. Even though fruit extracts give a much lower inhibition value as compared with root, it also showing good inhibition with the α-glucosidase enzyme. Acarbose appeared to be about 2-fold more active than root extract and 5 times more active that fruit extract. We also determined the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each fraction to quantify the inhibitory potential of the extracts, resulting in a 50% suppression of the original enzyme activity., where root extract was shown as a good inhibitor for a 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzyme with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.72 mg/ml while the fruit extract recorded with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.87 mg/ml.
