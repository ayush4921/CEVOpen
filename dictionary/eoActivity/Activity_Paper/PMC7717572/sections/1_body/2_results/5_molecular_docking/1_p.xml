<p>Molecular docking studies were used in order to investigate the binding confirmation to the selected compound. At the beginning of the process for docking, water molecules have been omitted in order to explore additional docking posses between compounds without the possible in the direct hydrogen bond formed. The molecular structure of selected ligands and active pocket sites for each of the receptors, 4J5T (α-glucosidase), 2P8S (DPP IV), and 1IR3 (insulin receptor, IR) were displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figures 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">7</xref>, respectively. In order to explore binding energies (kcal/mol) and basis molecular interaction, all the ligands were docked with each of the proteins. The binding energy was indicative of the ligand's contribution and flexibility for the targeted protein. In terms of binding energy, the more negative the value of the standard free energy charge, the better the binding affinity of the ligand with the receptor, hence, the more stable the complex

 </xref>. Therefore, the lowest binding energy scores represent the best protein-ligand binding stability compared to the highest energy score. The docking analysis with each of the receptor generate the binding energies on each ligands as follows: phlorizin (-8.2, −10.9, −7.0 kcal/mol), scandenin (-8.0, −9.3, −6.2 kcal/mol), pomiferin (-8.0, −9.6, −6.6 kcal/mol), berberine (-7.9, −8.9, -6.3 kcal/mol), monobenzone (-7.2, −7.4, −5.4 kcal/mol), mundulone (-6.1, −9.3, −6.9 kcal/mol), dimethycaffeic acid (-6.0, −7.1, −5.6 kcal/mol) for 4J5T, 2P8S and 1IR3, respectively. Meanwhile, the binding energies that were analysed for reference drugs acarbose (-7.4 kcal/mol), sitagtiptin (-8.8 kcal/mol), and insulin (-7.9 kcal/mol). The binding energies on each of the ligands were shown in
