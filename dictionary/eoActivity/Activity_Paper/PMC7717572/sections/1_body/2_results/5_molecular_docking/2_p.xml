<p>From the docking results with receptor 4J5T, among all the tested compounds, phlorizin was analysedH-bond interactions with Trp391, Asp392, Asp569 and Trp710, a hydrophobic interaction with Phe385, π-staking with Tyr709 and also salt bridges with Arg428. The amino acid residue of H-bond (Asp392 and Arg428), along with hydrophobic bonds, Leu563 were observed forming interaction with compound pomiferin. Scandenin and mundulone had a similar no of H-bond with Tyr709 and Arg428 respectively. Meanwhile, dimethylcaffeic acid, berberine and monobenzone have reported not forming any H-bond but dimethylcaffeic acid was supported with hydrophobic bonds (Asp568, Tyr709), a π-staking (Trp710) and a salt bridges (His561), berberine was supported with a π-staking (Tyr709) and a salt bridges (Asp568), and monobenzone was notified forming with π-staking interaction (Phe385, Phe389, Trp710). In the docking results with receptor 2P8S, phlorizin displayed H-bond interaction with Arg125, Asp545, Asp454, Gln553, Lys554, Trp629 amino acid residues and was stabilised with a hydrophobic bond (Tyr547) and π-staking (Tyr547). Pomiferin was notified forming H-bond (Asp556, Asp560), hydrophobic bond (Trp629) and mundulone were forming H-bond (Ser630, His740) along with hydrophobic bond (Trp629). Meanwhile, berberine and dimethylcaffeic acid formed H-bond with Gln553, Ser630 residues with a hydrophobic bond (Tyr547). Furthermore, monobenzone was forming a H-bond (Ser630) and a π-staking (Tyr547) while scandenin was reported with no H-bond formed but was supported with a hydrophobic bond (Trp629) along with Tyr547 residues for π-staking interaction. For docking analysis with 1IR3, phlorizin showed that formation of six H-bond (Glu1001, Gln1004, Lys1085, Ser1086, Asn1097), scandenin and mundulone with four H-bond (Arg1000, Arg1026, Ala1080) and (Ser1086, Asp1156, Thr1160) respectively. Besides, other compounds such as pomiferin and dimethylcaffeic acid formed three H-bond (Glu1047, Gly1152, Met1153) and (His1081, Asp1083, Ser1086) residues respectively. Berberine showed interaction with one H-bond (Gln1004) while monobenzone was analysed with none of H-bond formed but having a π-staking interaction (Tyr10). To sum up, we observe phlorizin forms the most stable binding in most of the receptor especially with DPP (IV) and was selected as a best-docked molecule as shown in
