<p>The effect of root and fruit extracts on a mechanism in the antidiabetic pathway through glucose uptake assay and insulin secretion were investigate by MTT assay. The ability of the cells to survive a toxic insult has been the basis of the cell viability assessment. Cell viability assessment was undergone throughout varied extracts concentrations (0.25 mg/ml-2 mg/ml) that depends on the toxicity of the extracts in each of the cells. The comparison of IC
 <sub>20</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. From the results, the toxicity for roots had recorded IC
 <sub>20</sub> (153.21 ± 9.65 μg/ml) and IC
 <sub>50</sub> (561.42 ± 6.22 μg/ml), a little bit higher than fruits extract with IC
 <sub>20</sub> (295.67 ± 7.43 μg/ml) and IC
 <sub>50</sub> (495.67 ± 11.31 μg/ml) in 3T3–L1 cell. With the treatment on L6 cells, roots had recorded IC
 <sub>20</sub> (605.53 ± 12.33 μg/ml), IC
 <sub>50</sub> (982.11 ± 5.53 μg/ml), while fruits extract with IC
 <sub>20</sub> (625.54 ± 21.43 μg/ml), IC
 <sub>50</sub> (893.41 ± 6.67 μg/ml). The results for in the cell viability in BRIN-BD11 cell was achieved with root extracts recorded IC
 <sub>20</sub> (681.87 ± 15.42 μg/ml), IC
 <sub>50</sub> (927.42 ± 5.81 μg/ml), while fruits extract with IC
 <sub>20</sub> (649.82 ± 7.41 μg/ml), IC
 <sub>50</sub> (1249.82 ± 15.34 μg/ml). Generally, the dose of each treatment in the extracts is partially based on the MTT assay where the safe concentration for the cell to be induced with tested extract and fractions. Thus, concentration up to 1000 μg/ml was employed in a further assay for
