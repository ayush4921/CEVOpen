<p>The result given by the uptake of glucose showed from the activity in 3T3–L1 and L6 cell line were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. The result was compared with insulin (injectable antidiabetic) at a fixed concentration of 250 μg/ml. The given results show that the root extract achieved a higher percentage in both cell lines with 85 and 67% for L6 and 3T3-L1 cells respectively as compared with fruit extracts. In 3T3–L1 adipocyte cells, we found that the root extract of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> showed an increase of glucose uptake 750 and 1000 μg/mL while fruit extract recorded an increment of glucose uptake at concentration 1000 μg/ml when compared to the control insulin. However, based on results, we can observe that in order to get higher glucose uptake as same as insulin, the concentration of the extract was 4 fold higher than the concentration of insulin. The results revealed that there was a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increases in the uptake reaction were observed with the incubation with respective 47, 94, and 1000 µg/ml of root and 47, 94, 188, 375, and 1000 µg/ml. On the other hand, in L6 myoblast cells, we found that the root extract of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> showed an increase of glucose uptake 1000 μg/ml while fruit extract recorded a slight lower in glucose uptake at concentration 1000 μg/ml when compared to the control insulin. However, based on results, we can observe that in order to get higher glucose uptake as same as insulin, the concentration of the extract was 4-fold higher than the concentration of insulin that contributes to the above 80% uptake of glucose by L6 cell. The results revealed that there was a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increases in the uptake reaction were observed with the incubation with respective 62.5 and 125 µg/mL for both of the extracts.
