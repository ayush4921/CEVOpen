<p id="p0115">Furthermore, there are different methods of herbal preparation observed by the informants. In this study, decoction (74.6%) is the most frequently used mode of preparation by the informants followed by powder (49.3%) and subsequently maceration (46.3%). The least among the methods include soup (4.5%) and smoking (3%) mode of herbal preparation (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). To obtain an herbal extract, it was observed that the TMP constantly boils water containing herbal material for at least two hours. Alternatively, the herbal material is allowed to macerate in water for a period of time, typically two to three days. Either way, the resultant herbal preparation is administered to patients at the dose recommended by the informant. In contrast, an herbal powdered drug is prepared from the dried herbs and pulverised into a fine powder. The powdered drug is then mixed with either water, milk, or any locally made drink (e.g., ‘
 <italic>fura’</italic> or ‘
 <italic>kunu</italic>’) at the dose recommended by the informants. Interestingly, it was further observed that a few of the TMP used the method of smoking to treat patients. In this method, herbal material is placed on the burning charcoal and allowed smoke from the burning herbs to spread directly on the patient. Their argument was that by allowing smoke to spread through the patient's skin is quite effective in treating outside tumours.
