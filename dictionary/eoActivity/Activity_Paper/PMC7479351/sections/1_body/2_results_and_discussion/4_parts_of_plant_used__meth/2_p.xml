<p id="p0110">The most frequently used plant parts are barks, roots, and leaves, which account for 55.2, 53.2, and 41.8%, respectively. Furthermore, seeds have accounted for 16.4% of the plant parts used, while the whole plant (3%) and pods (3%) are equally the least used by the TMP (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). For the period of documentation, we noticed that the TMP injudiciously collects medicinal herbs by uprooting or cutting down the whole plant in the forest. This method of collection is operational in most parts of the region, and it is based on the belief that the plant species are accessible at all times. Some respondents are aware of the importance of medicinal plant conservation that may protect plant biodiversity, while some pretend ignorant for economic gains. In the present study, the higher percentage accounted for the bark and root parts can be attributed to unregulated access to the forest and disregarding the safety of plant biodiversity. The frequent use of plant bark and root by the TMP has been described unsustainably for traditional medicine development (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich and Jäger, 2015</xref>). On the contrary, certain TMP argued that the collection of leaves from the plant is justified and, this will limit the exploitation, thereby preserving the extinction of the plant species from the area.
