<p id="p0060">In relation to this, the traditional healers in the region classified tumours into two different classes according to their origin. The internal tumours are those found inside the body of a patient such as a lung, liver, colon, and gynaecological tumours. The outside tumours on the other hand, are those visibly found outside the body of a patient such as a breast and skin. A significant number of the informants argued that internal tumours often developed from the outside tumours, e.g., the tumour from the breast can be transferred to the lung. Others believe that communicable diseases such as malaria and typhoid can lead to cancer development when they become intense. The implication of their techniques is that patients with different conditions are susceptible to misdiagnosis. For instance, we noted that almost all TMP mistakenly refers to inflammatory disorder for cancer. Generally, they defined cancer (commonly known as “
 <italic>iska</italic>” in Hausa) as any inflammatory disorder developed outside or inside the body. In some instances, some of the informants identified swelling and stiffness of the skin or inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) as a tumour. However, only a few of the respondents that have gone through years of experience argued to differentiate between the two inflamed characters. From our observation, these TMP diagnosed patients based on physical symptoms to commonly known disorders.
