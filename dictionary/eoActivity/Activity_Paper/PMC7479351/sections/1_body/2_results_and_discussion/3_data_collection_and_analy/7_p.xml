<p id="p0095">Collectively, the most frequently used plant species cited by the informants are 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> and 
 <italic>G. senegalensis</italic>. 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> is a thorny tree native to the African region and grows wild in Nigeria particularly, in the Northern region (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Alli et al., 2016</xref>). In Sokoto state, the tree is found virtually in every community around the area. The plant parts are used traditionally for different treatment of disease to include cancer. It was observed that seeds obtained from the plant are used to treat patients with breast, colon and head and neck tumours. The seeds are crushed into a fine powder, mixed with a small portion of water, and applied around the breast. In some cases, seeds are mixed with other herbal materials to improve effectiveness. Furthermore, the whole herbal materials can be used for treatment, but seeds are most often used by the TMP. Pharmacologically, there have been several reports validating the anticancer properties of the 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic>. Its potentials have been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against colorectal (

 <xref rid="bib173" ref-type="bibr">Salem et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological properties have been further validated against oral (

 <xref rid="bib170" ref-type="bibr">Sakthive et al., 2012</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (

 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the reported studies have backed up the traditional use of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> in the region.
