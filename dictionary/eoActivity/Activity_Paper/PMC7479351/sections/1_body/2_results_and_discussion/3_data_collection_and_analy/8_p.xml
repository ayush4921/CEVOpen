 <italic>G. senegalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sigmoidea</italic> is commonly found widely distributed in the Northern region of Nigeria. Both the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups in the region used powdered preparation of the plant materials to treat patients, whereas in some cases, a decocted crude drug is also used for patients with suspected internal tumours. Pharmacologically, the traditional use of 
 <italic>G. senegalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. sigmoidea</italic> for cancer treatment has also been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against prostate, breast, and liver (

 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. On the contrary, over 60% of the species identified in this study have not been verified, pharmacologically. Despite the fact that some of the genus such as 
 <italic>Combretum</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Cyperus</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Ficus</italic> spp. 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp., among others, are widely known for their anticancer properties, yet none among the species identified in this study have been validated for similar properties.
