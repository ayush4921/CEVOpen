Informants involved during the interview include TMP, herbalist, and herb sellers. Informed consent was obtained from each of the informants prior to the administration of the questionnaire. An oral interview was granted to the informants that are unable to read or write, and the questionnaire was completed on their behalf. Each medicinal plant revealed by the respondent is recorded in the local names commonly recognised in the region. During specimen collection, informants were contacted for specimen collection and processed for identification. Subsequently, local names of medicinal plants were used to identify and collect specimens for proper identification. Each specimen was identified and assigned voucher number at the Herbarium of the Department of Pharmacognosy and Ethnopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical sciences, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto.
