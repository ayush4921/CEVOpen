    "The present study was aimed to reveal the phytochemical composition and bio potentials of <i>Tectaria paradoxa</i> (Fee.) Sledge. The total phenolic, tannin, flavonoid, terpenoids, sterols content were determined. RBC membrane stabilization against heat induced haemolysis, <i>In-vitro</i> Alpha-amylase inhibitory assay and Brine Shrimp lethality bioassay was performed to determine the anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and cytotoxic activity. Among the tested extracts, methanolic extracts of <i>T. paradoxa</i> showed high amount of phenolics 351.43 ± 14.5 mg GAE/g, tannin 34.38 ± 1.02 mg GAE/g, flavonoids 1384.44 ± 50.92 mg QE/g, triterpenoids 130.5 ± 2.77 mg/g and acetone extracts of <i>T. paradoxa</i> displayed maximum amount of sterols 3.2 ± 0.2 mg/g. The extracts of <i>T. paradoxa</i> demonstrated dose dependent anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and cytotoxic activities. The anti-inflammatory activity of the <i>T. paradoxa</i> were as follows methanol > chloroform > acetone > petroleum ether. The anti-diabetic properties of the <i>T. paradoxa</i> were as follows methanol > acetone > chloroform > petroleum ether. The cytotoxicity of the <i>T. paradoxa</i> were as follows chloroform (LC<sub>50</sub> = 25.52 μg/mL) > petroleum ether (LC<sub>50</sub> = 36.99 μg/mL) > methanol (LC<sub>50</sub> = 44.26 μg/mL) > acetone (LC<sub>50</sub> = 55.9 μg/mL). The existence of phenolics, tannin, flavonoids, sterols and triterpenoids may be responsible for the observed biological activities. The results of the present study identified the pool of medicinal properties existence in <i>T. paradoxa</i>. Further studies on the isolation of active principles may bring out an alternative source for anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs from <i>T. paradoxa</i>."
