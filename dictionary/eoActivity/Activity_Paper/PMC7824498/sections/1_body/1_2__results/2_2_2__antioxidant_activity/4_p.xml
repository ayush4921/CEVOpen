<p>In the case of Î²-carotene bleaching model, all samples display strong inhibition on lipid peroxidation, which is close to the standard, BHT (LPI = 94.22%), except for W-Anvi (LPI = 81.65%). The strongest sample is B-Anvi (LPI = 92.05%), followed by E-Anvi (LPI = 90.85%), T-Anvi (LPI = 90.81%), and H-Anvi (LPI = 90.17%) (
