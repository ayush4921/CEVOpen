<p>Impurities were removed from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> aerial plant parts by water and 0.5% NaClO before being dried by an oven at 40 °C for 1 week. Fine powder was made by grinding the dried samples. Subsequently, the obtained powder (10 g) was subjected to a Soxhlet extractor consisting of extraction chamber and condenser (Climbing Co., Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan) connecting to a mantle heater (Daika Denki Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). An aliquot (400 mL) of methanol and ethyl acetate (2:8, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) mixture was the extraction solvent. After 5 h, the obtained extract was filtrated and concentrated by removing solvent with a rotary evaporator (Nihon Buchi K.K., Tokyo, Japan) to yield the crude extract (T-Anvi). After that, the dried T-Anvi was mixed with distilled water (50 mL) and subjected to liquid-liquid phase (1:1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) extraction with hexane, followed by ethyl acetate, and butanol, respectively. With each extraction solvent, the aqueous phase was returned to the separatory funnel, and the entire process was repeated to collect the maximum amount of target compounds. Finally, the collected extracts were filtered and evaporated at 50 °C under vacuum to acquire the dried hexane (H-Anvi), ethyl acetate (E-Anvi), and butanol (B-Anvi) extracts, respectively. The remaining water residue was also concentrated to attain the water extract (W-Anvi).
