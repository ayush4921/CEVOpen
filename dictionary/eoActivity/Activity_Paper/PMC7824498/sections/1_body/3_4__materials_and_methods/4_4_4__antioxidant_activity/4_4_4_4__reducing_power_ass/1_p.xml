<p>We followed the same method applied in the study of Quan et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For preparation, the solutions including phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH = 6.6); potassium ferricyanide (1 g/100 mL); trichloro acetic acid (10 g/100 mL); ferric chloride (0.01 g/10 mL) were prepared in distilled water. The first step was to incubate the mixture of methanolic sample/or control (0.1 mL), phosphate buffer (0.25 mL), and potassium ferricyanide solution (0.25 mL) for 30 min at 50 °C. After that, trichloro acetic acid solution (0.25 mL) was added and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. Subsequently, the supernatant (100 μL) was mixed with 100 µL of distilled water, followed by 20 µL of ferric chloride solution. The absorbance of final solution was read at 700 nm. Methanol and BHT were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Five concentrations (10, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 µg/mL) of sample/or control were examined to build the dose-responding curves. From the curve, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated to compare between samples. In which, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was the required concentration to reach the absorbance of 0.5.
