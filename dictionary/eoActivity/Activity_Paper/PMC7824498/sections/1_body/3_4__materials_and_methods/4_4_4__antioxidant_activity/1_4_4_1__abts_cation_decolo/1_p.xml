<p>The method was presented by Pellegrini et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In advance of colorimetric reaction, the ABTS working solution was prepared in the course of incubation for the mixture consisting of 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (1:1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 16 h without light at 25 °C. Methanol was then added to achieve the targeted absorbance (0.65–0.75) at 734 nm. The decolorization ability was evaluated by pipetting sample/or control (in methanol) into ABTS working solution (1:9, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) with a total volume of 200 µL of combination. The reaction was incubated in darkness for 20 min. The inhibition percentage was measured as decreased absorbance over the control at 734 nm.
