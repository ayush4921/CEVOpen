<p>Different concentrations of sample/or control were tested to establish a dose-dependent curve (linear equation). Based on the equation, the required concentration of samples/or control for inhibiting 50% of radicals (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) was obtained. Lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value means stronger inhibition.
