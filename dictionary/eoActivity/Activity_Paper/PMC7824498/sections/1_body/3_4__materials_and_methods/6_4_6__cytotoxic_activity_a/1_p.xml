<p>The cell growth rate was determined through the cell metabolic activity applying MTT assay. The cell culture media was IMDM containing fetal bovine serum (10%), L-glutamine (5 mM), Penicillin (100 IU/mL), and Streptomycin (100 µg/mL). Samples were prepared in 0.1% DMSO (in culture media). In each plate’s well, the cells (5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>) were seeded in culture media (90 µL) and placed in an incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United States) for 24 h at 37 °C with CO
 <sub>2</sub> 5%. After that, ten microliters of sample were pipetted to each well. After 40 h, ten microliters of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were supplied. The cells were continuously incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, one hundred microliters of cell lysis buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl) were added to each well. The cell expansion was observed using an inverted microscope (LabX, Midland, Canada). The absorbance at 595 nm was applied to determine the cell viability in value. The negative control was conducted by adding 10 microliters of culture media instead of sample.
