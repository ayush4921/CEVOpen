 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Briefly, the mixture including 20 µL of sample (in methanol), 100 µL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu solution and 80 µL of 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The result was recorded at 765 nm and expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per one gram of sample dry weight (mg GAE/g DW).
