 <p>2- or 4-Substituted 3-
  <italic>N</italic>-benzyltriazolylmethyl-13α-oestrone derivatives were synthesised via bromination of ring A and subsequent microwave-assisted, Pd-catalysed C(sp
  <sup>2</sup>)–P couplings. The antiproliferative activities of the newly synthesised brominated and phosphonated compounds against a panel of human cancer cell lines (A2780, MCF-7, MDA-MB 231) were investigated by means of MTT assays. The most potent compound, the 3-
  <italic>N</italic>-benzyltriazolylmethyl-4-bromo-13α-oestrone derivative exerted substantial selective cell growth-inhibitory activity against A2780 cell line with a submicromolar IC
  <sub>50</sub> value. Computational calculations reveal strong interactions of the 4-bromo derivative with both colchicine and taxoid binding sites of tubulin. Disturbance of tubulin function has been confirmed by photometric polymerisation assay.
