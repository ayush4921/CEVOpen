<p>First, docking studies have been performed for the newly synthesised most potent antiproliferative compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> and for secosteroid 
 <bold>3</bold> selected as a reference compound. Two potential binding sites, CBS and TBS, have been chosen on the tubulin polymer. MD investigations have been performed starting from the best docking poses of the compounds investigated. We found that the binding positions were stable for both compounds in both binding sites as they are presented by RMSD calculations for the ligands [see

 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> clearly show that both compounds can bind to the regarded binding sites.
