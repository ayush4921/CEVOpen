<p>The synthesis of 3-

 </xref> using propargyl bromide as the reagent. The resulting 3-(prop-2-inyloxy) compound (
 <bold>10</bold>) was subjected to CuAAC reaction with benzyl azides differing in their 
 <italic>para</italic> substituent (R = H or 
 <italic>t</italic>-Bu). The click reactions afforded the desired triazolyl derivatives (
 <bold>4a</bold> and 
 <bold>4b</bold>) in high yields. The next transformation was the bromination of compounds 
 <bold>4a</bold> and 
 <bold>4b</bold>. Electrophilic substitutions were carried out with 1 equiv. of 
 <italic>N</italic>-bromosuccinimide as a brominating agent. Halogenations occurred in 
 <italic>ortho</italic> positions relative to the C-3-
 <italic>O</italic> function, yielding the two regioisomers in a ratio of 
 <bold>11:12 </bold>=
 <bold> </bold>2:1. Bromo derivatives (
 <bold>11a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> or 
 <bold>12a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) were subjected to Pd-catalysed reactions with diethyl phosphite or diphenylphosphine oxide as coupling partners. Microwave-assisted Hirao couplings afforded new 2- or 4-phosphonated 3-
 <italic>N</italic>-benzyltriazolylmethyl-13α-oestrone derivatives (
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) in excellent yields. The structures of the newly synthesised bromides and phosphonates (
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) were deduced from 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra.
