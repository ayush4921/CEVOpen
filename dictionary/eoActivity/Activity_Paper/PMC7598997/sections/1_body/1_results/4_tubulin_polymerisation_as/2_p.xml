<p>Previously, D-secoestrone triazole (

 <bold>3</bold> and the newly synthesised 
 <bold>12a</bold> owing the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against ovarian cancer cell line A2780, 
 <bold>12a</bold> was supposed to influence microtubule formation. To demonstrate our hypothesis, 
 <bold>12a</bold> was subjected to a cell-free, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tubulin polymerisation assay in two different concentrations (125 and 250 µM). The calculated maximum rate of tubulin polymerisation was increased by our test compound which was significant when 
 <bold>12a</bold> was added in 250 µM concentration to the reaction mixture (
