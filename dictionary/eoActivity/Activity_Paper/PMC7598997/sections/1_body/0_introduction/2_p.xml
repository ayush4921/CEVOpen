<p>The development of anticancer agents is often based on synthetic modifications of endogenous compounds

 </xref>. However, this approach might be limited by the retained original biological activity of the biomolecule. This happens in the case of antiproliferative drug candidates based on sex hormones. Certain oestrone derivatives efficiently suppress the growth of different tumour cells, but their retained oestrogenic behaviour limits their application. Nevertheless, directed chemical modifications of the estrane core may lead to the reduction of oestrogenic action. The inversion of configuration at C-13 or opening of ring D results in core-modified oestrone derivatives with complete loss of oestrogenic activity

 </xref>. Accordingly, 13α-oestrone and D-secoestrone are promising scaffolds for the development of antitumoral oestrone derivatives lacking hormonal side effects. Literature reveals certain potent anticancer oestrone derivatives, but their mechanism of action is often unclarified

 </xref>. There exist candidates acting via inhibition of oestrogen biosynthesis; however, the majority of this compound group target other objects, including transporter proteins or tubulin. Microtubules (MTs) consist of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers that play key role in cell division

 </xref>. Drugs that interfere with tubulin polymerisation/depolymerisation dynamics might lead to suppression of the cell growth

 </xref>. Drugs that target the MT might be divided into two groups. MT destabilising agents (MDAs) prevent polymerisation of tubulin and promote depolymerisation, whereas MT stabilising agents (MSAs) promote polymerisation of tubulin and stabilise the polymer, preventing depolymerisation. There exist six binding sites on tubulin polymer

 </xref>. MSAs, in general, bind reversibly to the taxoid binding site. Several antitubulin agents targeting vinca alkaloid or taxane sites (TBS) have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but their application is limited due to their inefficiency against multidrug resistant (MDR) cells. On the other hand, colchicine site-binding candidates (CBS) are often still active against MDR cells, too. Combrestatin A-4 (CA-4) is a colchicine site-binding nanomolar antitubulin agent, arresting the cells in metaphase. Moreover, it is assigned as a potent vascular disrupting agent. It is of note that certain CA-4 derivatives are in clinical trials as chemotherapeutic agents. X-ray crystal structures of tubulin show that there are three zones and a bridge in this binding site. The typical colchicine site-binding agent consists of two aryl rings and a bridge, which determine the relative orientation of the rings

 </xref>. According to literature reports, replacement of methoxy groups with halogens and introduction of a triazole or tetrazole ring instead of an ethylene bridge might be a powerful strategy in the development of more effective antitubulin CA-4 derivatives (

 </xref>. The triazole heterocycle is widely used in drug development according to its favourable characteristics. It might enhance the stability against metabolic degradation and the H-bonding ability. Additionally, this heterocyclic ring is an excellent mimetic of a peptide bond
