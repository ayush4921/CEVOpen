<p>In conclusion, new ring A modified 13Î±-oestrone derivatives have been synthesised via directed combination of different structural elements. Certain new compounds displayed potent antiproliferative action against human reproductive cancer cell lines. 4-Bromo derivative 
 <bold>12a</bold> exerted submicromolar cell growth-inhibitory action against A2780 cell line. Computational simulations reveal strong interactions of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> with colchicine and taxoid binding sites of tubulin. Direct effect of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> on microtubule formation was demonstrated via tubulin polymerisation assay.
