<p>The cancer selectivity of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> was tested by means of the MTT assay using the non-cancerous mouse embryo fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3. The growth inhibitory effect was found to be substantially lower than those against cancer cell lines. Since the inhibition of proliferation was less than 40% even at the highest concentration (30 µM), the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was not calculated but it is definitely above 30 µM. This kind of viability assay cannot be considered to be sufficient to declare a cancer-selective action. The huge difference in the determined antiproliferative properties may reflect a cell type-dependent action instead of a general toxic character indicating the relevance of the presented structure in lead-finding projects.
