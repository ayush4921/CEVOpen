<p>We have demonstrated earlier that core-modified oestrone derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> might be considered as an MSA. However, the majority of antitubulin oestrone derivatives described in literature belong to the MDA group, acting at the CBS of tubulin. From the comparison of the structures of the brominated combrestatine triazole 
 <bold>2</bold> as an MDA and oestrone derivative 
 <bold>3</bold>, it can be stated that they possess similar structural elements, such as the two aryl systems connected with a tetrazole or triazole bridge. It was shown by Beale etÂ al. that the presence of bromines in compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is advantageous concerning the antitubulin action. Interestingly, the two compounds belong to different MT targeting groups. Here we synthesised a new compound (
 <bold>12a</bold>) with structural similarity to both MT targeting agents 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>. Based on these structural similarities and the substantial antiproliferative action of new derivative 
 <bold>12a</bold>, here we performed computational studies to investigate the possible interaction of this compound with tubulin. Our selection, concerning the potential binding region of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> out of the known 6 possibilities

 </xref>. Because we did not have experimental evidence for the exact binding position of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold>, both potential binding sites (CBS and TBS) were considered. Secosteroid 
 <bold>3</bold> was selected as a reference compound and, altogether, four different complexes were investigated in the simulations. Molecular docking studies were performed first in order to get the best poses for the following MD calculations. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figures 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">6</xref>, we represented the binding poses of ligands 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>12a</bold> in CBS and TBS, respectively. The purple structure always represents compound 
 <bold>12a</bold>, while secoestrone 
 <bold>3</bold> is represented in dark blue. It is clear, that in the TBS both compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>12a</bold> adopted almost the same binding position, while in the CBS the estrane cores occupied a common region, but in a reverse manner. Consequently, the 3-
