<p>Melting points (Mp) were determined with a Kofler hot-stage apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed with a Perkin-Elmer CHN analyser model 2400 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Thin-layer chromatography: silica gel 60 F254; layer thickness 0.2 mm (Merck); eluents (ss): A: 50% ethyl acetate/50% hexane, B: ethyl acetate, C: 2% methanol/98% ethyl acetate, detection with I
 <sub>2</sub> or UV (365 nm) after spraying with 5% phosphomolybdic acid in 50% aqueous phosphoric acid and heating at 100–120 °C for 10 min. Flash chromatography: silica gel 60, 40–63 µm (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ). Reactions under microwave irradiation were carried out with a CEM Corporation focussed microwave system, Model Discover SP. The maximum power of irradiation was 200 W.

Analyses were performed in positive ion mode using flow injection mass spectrometry with a mobile phase of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1 v/v% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Five µl aliquot of the samples were loaded into the flow. The ESI capillary was adjusted to 4.5 kV and N
