<p>In the previous study, six endophytic isolates (
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT33; 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34; 
 <italic>Brevibacterium</italic> sp. strain DBT35; 
 <italic>Streptomyces thermocarboxydus</italic> strain DBT36; 
 <italic>Actinomycete</italic> strain DBT37 and 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT39) obtained from 
 <italic>M. jalapa</italic> were tested for antimicrobial activities against three bacterial pathogens (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>). Isolate DBT35 showed significant antimicrobial activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (13.7 mm) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (10.1 mm), whereas BPSAC39 (10.6 mm) and BPSAC37 (9.6 mm) exhibited acute activities against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, respectively. Although isolate DBT34 showed lower antimicrobial activities against all bacterial pathogens, isolate DBT34 showed strong antifungal activities against plant fungal pathogens 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. In addition, isolate DBT34 showed maximum PGP activity in comparison to other isolates. The potent isolate DBT34 was used for an in-vivo plant growth promotion study under greenhouse conditions in an effort to enhance the growth of 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Notably, however, no systematic study has been conducted to understand the cytotoxicity, antioxidant, and antidiabetic potential of the endophytic actinobacteria associated with 
 <italic>M. jalapa</italic>. Hence, we have selected the strain DBT34 to be evaluated for its antioxidant potential to alleviate the oxidative stress in their host plants by scavenging the ROS. Additionally, DBT34 was also selected to experimentally assess its anticancer ability against liver hepatocellular cancer cells (HepG2) lines and also antidiabetic capabilities. Also, a methanolic extract of isolate DBT34 was used to identify the volatile compounds (VOCs) that are potentially related to functional mitigation of stress in plants. The majority of researchers have reported antioxidant and antidiabetic potential from diverse bacteria, but there have been few reports from actinobacteria. Hence, we have added to evaluate an endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. isolate which has the potential for antioxidant, cytotoxicity, and antidiabetic capabilities. The results of this study provide in-depth information about the role of endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. in alleviated oxidative stress in their plant hosts through the production of antioxidant enzymes and compounds.
