<p>Plants have close interactions with a wide array of microorganisms that colonize the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere of plants. Endophytes are microorganisms that reside within plant tissue without causing disease and establish a synergistic affiliation with their host plants. Plants have developed an information transfer system with endophytic microorganisms that contributes to enhanced tolerance to stresses that induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the synthesis of plant growth-promoting substances [
