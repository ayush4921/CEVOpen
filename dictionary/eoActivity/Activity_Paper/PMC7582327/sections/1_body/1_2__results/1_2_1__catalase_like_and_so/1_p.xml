<p>All of the methanolic extracts obtained from the different strains of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. were evaluated for catalase-like activity based on their ability to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>). Results indicated that extracts of six strains exhibited catalase-like activity, ranging from 19.40 U to 158.21 U at a concentration of 50 Âµg/mL. Among the tested strains, 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 had the highest catalase-like activities at 158.21 U. Extracts of the six isolates were also evaluated for SOD-like activity. Results again revealed that the extracts of all six strains exhibited SOD-like activity ranging from 53.505% to 61.899% (

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 showed a free radical scavenging ability of 55.15%.
