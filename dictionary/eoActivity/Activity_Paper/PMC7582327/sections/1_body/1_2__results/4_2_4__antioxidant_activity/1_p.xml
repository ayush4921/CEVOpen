<p>Analysis of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 indicated that it had strong antioxidant activity as demonstrated by its DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity, producing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 41.5 µg/mL and 47.8 µg/mL, respectively. These results indicate that low concentrations of the methanolic extract of strain DBT34 are capable of reducing DPPH and ABTS radicals, further demonstrating that strain DBT34 represents a potent source of antioxidant compounds that will degrade ROS (
