<p>The application of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 on chickpea plants and subsequent production of a methanolic extract from the treated and untreated plants resulted in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 117.5 µg/mL (DPPH) and 114.0 µg/mL (ABTS) and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 266.2 µg/mL (DPPH) and 169.3 µg/mL (ABTS) in untreated plants (

 <sub>50</sub> values obtained for the methanolic extracts (µg/mL) of treated plants, relative to untreated plants, indicates that free radical scavenging in the treated plants was enhanced due to the presence of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 as an endophytic in the treated chickpea plants.
