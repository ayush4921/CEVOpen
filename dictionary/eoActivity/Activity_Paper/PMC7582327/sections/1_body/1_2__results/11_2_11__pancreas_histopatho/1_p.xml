<p>The histology of the pancreas of vehicle control rats was characterized by a compact volume of isolates of Langerhans surrounded by acini with proper vaculation. The islet of Langerhans exhibited a polymorphic cellular status (

In contrast, degenerative changes were observed in the islet of Langerhans in the pancreas of diabetic rats with areas of peripheral patches of cells in which Î²-cells were dominant and were characterized by pyknosis, necrosis, and a high level of apoptosis. The pancreas of diabetic rats also exhibited damage to blood vessels and diminished vascularization (
