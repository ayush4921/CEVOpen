<p>The cytotoxicity of a methanolic extract of strain DBT34 was screened against three cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF7, AGS) at a concentration of 500 µg/mL. The preliminary screening indicated that the extract had a significant effect on the viability of HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma) cells. Based on this result, the extract of strain DBT34 was tested for cytotoxicity at different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 µg/mL) against HepG2 cells using the MTT assay. Results indicated that the methanolic extract obtained from strain DBT34 exhibited the highest level of cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells at a low concentration, having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 49.2 μg/mL.

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. DBT34. These results demonstrate that the crude methanolic extract of strain DBT34 may contain some bioactive compounds that are cytotoxic to HepG2 cancer cells.
