<p>The administration of a corticosteroid and high sucrose diet to the test rats caused a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) elevation in glucose and insulin levels. The treatment of the test rats with either the methanolic extract of DBT34 or the standard drug sitagliptin had a significant impact on the elevation of glucose and insulin levels. Additionally, the HOMA-IR also significantly increased in the induced diabetic rats; however, treatment of the diabetic rats with either the DBT34 extract or sitagliptin caused a reduction in the HOMA-IR. More specifically, the HOMA-β and insulin sensitivity (IS) were lowered in the diabetic rats treated with either the DBT34 extract of sitagliptin and HOMA-β and IS were significantly (
