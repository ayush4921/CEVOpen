<p>The 16S rRNA sequence of strain DBT34 was compared with reference strains obtained from the GenBank database. Strain DBT34 was identified as 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. A phylogenetic tree was built using the neighbor-joining method. The estimated transition/transversion bias (R) was 1.38, and the overall pairwise mean distance was 0.081. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DBT34 was highly similar to 
 <italic>Streptomyces glauciniger</italic> type strain CGMCC 41858 (99.51%), followed by 
 <italic>Streptomyces erringtonii</italic> type strain I36 (98.92%), and 
 <italic>Streptomyces avellaneus</italic> type strain NBRC13451 (97.35%). Notably, strain DBT34 formed a distinct clade with 
 <italic>Streptomyces rubrus</italic> type strain Sp080513KE34 (96.96%), 
 <italic>Streptomyces baliensis</italic> type strain ID030915 (96.96%),
