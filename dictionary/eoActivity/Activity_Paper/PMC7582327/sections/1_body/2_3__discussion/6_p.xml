<p>Numerous techniques are available to assess the antioxidant capacity of organisms, among which the DPPH radical scavenging and ABTS radical cation decolorization assays represent rapid assays that are easy to perform. The free radical scavenging of the hydrogen atom donating antioxidant compound that allows for the conversion of hydrogen atoms or electrons to DPPH radicals results in the formation of a yellow-colored product, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the present study, strain DBT34 was found to exhibit significant antioxidant activity against DPPH free radicals with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 41.5 µg/mL. Kaur et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also reported that three 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strains (TEAE, OCE, and TCE) isolated from soil exhibited the ability to scavenge DPPH radicals with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 46.61 µg/mL, 51.88 µg/mL, and 89.03 µg/mL for the three strains, respectively. Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain MUM256 had a potent antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.69 ± 0.83% and 12.08 ± 1.05%. The ABTS radical cation decolorization assay can also be used to assess the antioxidant potential of a test compound [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study, we found that strain DBT34 had a significant ability to scavenge ABTS radicals, having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 47.8 µg/mL. These data are in contrast to the results of Kaur et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], who reported that the ABTS IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of three 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strains (TEAE, OCE, and TCE) were 121.51 µg/mL, 352.48 µg/mL, and 354.24 µg/mL, respectively.
