<p>Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that endophytic bacteria induce ROS directly by increasing the concentration of oxygen sesquiterpenoids content in the Chinese medicinal plant, 
 <italic>Atractylodes lancea</italic>. No reports could be found, however, on endophytic Actinobacteria with ROS-scavenging potential. Recently, an association of endophytic Actinobacteria with medicinal plants from Northeastern India has been reported and suggested to represent a potential source for bioactive products, as well as antimicrobial and plant growth-promoting applications [

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34, isolated from 
 <italic>M. jalapa</italic> L. growing in Mizoram, India was demonstrated to possess significant antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines.
