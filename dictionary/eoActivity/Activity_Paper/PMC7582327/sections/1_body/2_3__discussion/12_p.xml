<p>Diabetic rats treated with the microbial extract or sitagliptin showed a reduction in the level of compounds in the lipid profile of diabetic rats that interfere with proper carbohydrate utilization, namely, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol that reduces free radical scavenging activity [

In support of the biochemical analyses, the histopathology of untreated diabetic rats indicated degenerative changes in the cellular morphology, all the way up to pyknosis, in the islet of the Langerhans in pancreatic tissues. It is likely that this may have resulted from reduced apoptosis as evidenced by the vacuolation and rearrangement of vascular tissues; which may result from reduced glucose uptake in pancreatic cells [

In contrast, diabetic rats treated with the microbial extract or sitagliptin exhibited reduced areas of vacuolation and improved vascularization in the islet of Langerhans in pancreatic tissues. The inhibition of DPP-4 accumulation and free radical scavenging activity has been reported to promote glucose availability and induce regenerative activity in damaged cells of insulin resistant tissues [
