<p>Phenolic compounds are a significant group of antioxidants that also scavenge ROS. Cruz De Carvalho, [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] suggested that microorganisms produce ROS oxygen species as byproducts during the metabolism process. High levels of free radicals can induce oxidative stress and many other side effects, including the promotion of cancer [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has been well established that free oxygen radicals can contribute to the development of a variety of diseases, including cancer, as well as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, which can be treated with the use of novel antioxidant compounds. In the present study, the total phenolic content in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 was estimated at 94.21 µg of GAE/mg of DW. These data represent a higher level than what was previously reported by Kaur et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], who stated that an ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain OEAE (isolated from the soil) possessed a level of TPC of 84.3 mg of GAE/g DW. Lertcanawanichakul et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] stated that the maximum amount of total phenolics (0.24 GAE ± 0.02 mg/g DW) was found in an ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain KB1-ET. Additionally, the maximum TFC in KB1-ET was 112.6 µg quercetin/mg DW. Our results represent the first report of the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) in a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. with the highest TPC and TFC exhibit the highest antioxidant activity [
