Using in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico approaches, the present study evaluated the antidiabetic and antioxidant, properties of a microbial extract. In the present study, type 2 diabetes was induced in test rats by feeding them corticosteroids and a high sucrose diet, which has been reported to promote gluconeogenesis without adversely impacting carbohydrate metabolism [
