<p>We initially screened the crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 at a high concentration (500 µg/mL) for cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines (MCF7, AGS and HepG2). The maximum anti-proliferative effect (cytotoxicity) was found against the HepG2 cell line with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of 49.2 µg/mL. Khieu et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also reported that 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain HUST012 exhibited substantial cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of 41.63 µg/mL. Additionally, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain MJM 10778 exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell lines at an IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of 264.7 µg/mL.
