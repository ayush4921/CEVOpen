<p>The antioxidant potential (ABTS and DPPH) present in 18 varieties of chickpea plants cultivated in different parts of the world, including four types from India, were characterized by Quintero-Soto et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They reported antioxidant IC
 <sub>50</sub> readings for DPPH scavenging ranging from 52 to 1640 μmol Trolox equivalents/100 g DW, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> readings for ABTS ranged from 278 to 2417 μmol Trolox equivalents/100 g DW. These findings are accordance with the results obtained in the current study, where DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity in chickpea plants were assessed. Even though numerous in-vivo pot experiments studies have already been reported on the ability of endophytic Actinobacteria [

 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] to promote growth in a variety of plants, only a few of these studies also assessed antioxidant potential. Recently, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], studied the effect of endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces chartreusis</italic> WZS021 on two sugarcane varieties under stress conditions and found that this Actinobacterium improved the stress tolerance of the host plant by regulating antioxidant levels. They postulated that the ROS production induced in host plants by the drought conditions was mitigated by the antioxidant activity of SOD, catalase, and peroxidase, which were enhanced by the endophytic strain, WZS021. Based on our data, we conclude that the endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp., strain DBT34 has a significant level of antioxidant potential, along with substantial levels of TPC and TFC which may play a protective role in the host against abiotic and biotic stresses. Further in-depth studies are needed, however, to fully understand the mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of endophytic Actinobacteria on their hosts, as well as the specific compounds and mechanisms responsible for the bioactive properties present in methanolic extracts of DBT34.
