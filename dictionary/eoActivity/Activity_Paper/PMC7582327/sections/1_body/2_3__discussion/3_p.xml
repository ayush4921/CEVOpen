<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method to evaluate the similarity of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 with other species of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Results indicated that sequence of strain DBT34 was highly analogous to 
 <italic>Streptomyces glauciniger</italic> type strain CGMCC 41858 (99.51%) followed by 
 <italic>Streptomyces erringtonii</italic> type strain I36 (98.92%) and 
 <italic>Streptomyces avellaneus</italic> type strain NBRC13451 (97.35%). In a similar analysis, Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain MUM256 exhibited a maximum 16S-rRNA gene sequence identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces albidoflavus</italic>DSM40455
 <sup>T</sup> (99.7%) and 
 <italic>Streptomyces hydrogenans</italic>NBRC13475
 <sup>T</sup> (99.7%).
