 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 extract was evaluated for its ability to scavenge superoxide anion (O

 <sup>•−</sup>)radicals, which can impact the synthesis of other ROS intermediates. SOD-like activity mitigates the accumulation of ROS intermediates by converting superoxide anion radicals to the lesser toxic entity, hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can then be neutralized by catalase, which turns into a neutral form [

Therefore, the present study evaluated catalase and SOD-like activity present in the methanolic extracts of DBT34 at a concentration of 50 µg extract/mL. These results are comparable to the level of inhibition reported for a microbial extract by Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In that study, the level of SOD-like activity was evaluated in methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. (MUM212). Their results indicated that SOD-like activity in methanolic extracts at a concentration range of 0.25 to 4 mg/mL exhibited a percentage of inhibition of superoxide radical formation ranging from 17 to 37%. Similarly, catalase-like activity was observed in methanolic extracts of
