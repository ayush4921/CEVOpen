<p>TPC in the methanolic extract of strain DBT34 was determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin–Ciocalteu (FC) reagent. Gallic acid was used to generate a standard curve in the range of 10–1000 mg/mL. A 200 µL volume of assay sample was prepared by combining 10 µL of sample extract with 90 µL FC reagent. This solution plus 100 µL of 15% of sodium carbonate were added to individual wells of 96-well plates. TPC was quantified as mg of Gallic acid equivalents (GAE) [

The standard curve of Quercetin solution in methanol was prepared with concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 µg/mL and absorbance was recorded at 420 nm with a UV-vis microplate spectrophotometer (MultiscanTM GO, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). A total of 100 µL of sample extract (10–100 ug/mL) was mixed with 200 µL of 2% aluminum trichloride and used in the TFC assay. TFC was quantified as µg of Quercetin equivalents (QE) per mg of DW [
