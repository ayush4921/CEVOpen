<p>The six crude extracts were dried using a rotary evaporator and diluted to 50 Âµg/mL in phosphate buffer (pH-8.0) and evaluated for catalase activity using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was added to the test to the solution, and catalase activity was measured as the decrease in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Absorbance was recorded at 240 nm at time intervals of 0 s; 30 s and 1 min. [

The superoxide anion scavenging activity or SOD like activity of DBT34 strain was evaluated using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific, Multiskan GO, MA, USA) to measure the formation of water-soluble formazan dye resulting from the enzymatic conversion of [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] anion [

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 were added into a 96-well plate along with [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] anion. Then, the mixture was kept in the dark for 15 min to allow the formazan to form. Absorbance was subsequently recorded at 560 nm using a Multiscan UV/Vis spectrophotometer and used to calculate the level of SOD activity present in the extract.
