 <italic>Typhonium giganteum,</italic> also called giant voodoo lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Araceae family which consists of ∼70 species native to eastern and southern Asia, New Guinea, and Australia (Cusimano et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The root tubers of 
 <italic>Typhonium giganteum</italic> have been known for ethnopharmacological uses in Asia including China and Korea to treat stroke (Chi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and cancer (Khalivulla et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Because chloroplast genome-based DNA barcode marker system has not been well established for many medicinal plants, including 
 <italic>T. giganteum,</italic> we generated and the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>T. giganteum</italic> using next generation sequencing. Our result will serve as a source of future barcode marker development, as well as assist further phylogenetic study of Araceae.species.
