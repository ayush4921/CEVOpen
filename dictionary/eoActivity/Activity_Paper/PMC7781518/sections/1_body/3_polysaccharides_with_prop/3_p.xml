<p id="p0210">After infection of the cells by SARS-CoV-2 and therefore the destruction of lung cells, the body initiates a local immune response, recruiting defense cells such as macrophages and monocytes that immediately respond to infection, releasing cytokines, substances that modulate the immune response. The released cytokines stimulate the defense cells, adaptive T and B cells, which respond to infection, attacking contaminated cells and viruses (

In most cases, this process is capable of reducing infection, however, it depends on how the organism will behave in the face of the underlying biochemical phenomena. However, in some cases, the body reacts differently, initiating a dysfunctional immune response, which leads to a chain reaction, and causes serious complications to the lungs and even systemic pathologies, which can lead to death (
