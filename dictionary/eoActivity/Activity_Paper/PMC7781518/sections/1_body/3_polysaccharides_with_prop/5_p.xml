<p id="p0220">Over 50% of children under the age of 18 have mild symptoms and some are asymptomatic, although the viral load is high. Around 6% develop severe symptoms, however, in most cases; these children have some associated morbidity. The balance between defense cells and the mechanisms of the production of pro-inflammatory substances are crucial for compression about the mechanisms involved in immune response in children. Although, a complete picture of the factors critical to the development of inflammatory responses remains somewhat undefined. But, it is known that stimulation of the immune system with substances that modulate the immune response helps to adapt the body before serious infections, helping in a more controlled response (

Therefore, although polysaccharides are not a therapy proposed during infection, mainly due to the few targeted studies, they can modulate an adequate immune response beforehand, preparing the body to face infection in a balanced way.
