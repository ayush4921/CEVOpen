<p id="p0270">Anti-inflammatory activity has been reported by several researches, as shown below. Especially the polysaccharides that have in their structure monomers of Gal, Glc, GalA and Rha, revealed potent anti-inflammatory activity in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. As highlighted earlier, the endotoxin-mediated pathway (LPS) is best elucidated in studies on the onset of inflammatory processes. Therefore, polysaccharides that block pro-inflammatory signaling pathways are essential as possible treatments for cases of COVID-19. For example, mixing three fractions of mannan-like polysaccharides isolated from wines inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and the mediator (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (

 <italic>Phellinus linteus</italic> inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory substances in a cell and animal model. It was demonstrated based on the study directed by the LPS pathway that the polysaccharide fraction significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissues, and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the MAPK pathway, as well as the translocations of NF-κB and AP-1 (

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sousa et al. (2018)</xref>, with 
 <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic> Linn (Noni) identified a polysaccharide composed of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan. Studies have shown that the fraction has anti-inflammatory activity, and even helps to reverse inflammatory parameters such as edema, leukocyte migration and nociception. Finally, in a study conducted by 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al. (2018)</xref> isolated a polysaccharide from 
 <italic>Bupleurum chinense</italic> capable of reducing lung injury in a model of acute pneumonia through inhibition of neutrophil recruitment pathways mediated by P-selectin. Another polysaccharide, now obtained from 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> is one of the many polysaccharides that have the potential to be used as a drug in the treatment of hyperinflammatory conditions by suppressing the signaling of the NF-κB pathway and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). Although the topic is not exhausted, these are the main polysaccharide-mediated immune system modulation activities.
