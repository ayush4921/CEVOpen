<p id="p0225">Polysaccharides stimulate immune cells by means of specific receptors, for example in necrophagous and macrophage cells by means of bonds between functional groups of polysaccharides and molecular groups on the cell surface. From the moment the polysaccharides bind to membrane receptors in the defense cells, the signaling pathways are activated, and a cycle of biochemical processes begins that leads to the positive regulation of gene expression in the ribosomes, initiating the protein production. In cells such as macrophages, polysaccharides activate the protein pathways, which in turn are activated by mitogens (MAPKs) and others such as the nuclear factor (NF-kB), stimulating the immune response control processes. Macrophages can initiate an immune response in several ways, but it is common for polysaccharides to stimulate the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (

Another relevant aspect about the modulating activity of polysaccharides can be found in studies on gene expression. Some polysaccharides stimulate the production and expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) during the synthesis of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, at the genetic level, some signaling proteins such as p38, p65, p50, signal regulated kinase and JNK are activated by polysaccharides. Polysaccharides obtained from these functional foods significantly increase the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA), and cytokines, both by active regulation of receptors such as TLR2 and TLR4 (

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. (2017)</xref>, with polysaccharides from wheat, show that they can possibly induce cytokine expression through the MAP38 p38 signaling pathway mediated by the toll-like receptor 4. Another study conducted by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Deng, Fu, Shang, Chen, and Xu (2018)</xref> with 
 <italic>Dictyophora indusiata</italic> demonstrated that the Dectin-1 receptor on the surface of macrophages is activated by β-D-glucan, composed of a main chain of (1 → 3) -β-glucan with side chains of residues (1 → 6) -β-glucan and molecular weight of 650 kDa. It was confirmed that the polysaccharide activates macrophages and increases their phagocytic activity; in addition, the MAPK pathway is activated and promotes nuclear translocation of NF-kB. In short, these results shed light on the molecular pathways involved in macrophage immunomodulation activity. In addition to macrophages, other cells are activated and stimulated by polysaccharides, and assist in modulating the immune system, among these cells, they can highlight T cells and dendritic cells. 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Hwang, et al. (2020)</xref> isolated a polysaccharide from the algae 
 <italic>Pyropia yezoensis</italic> and demonstrated that the lipopolysaccharide has protective effects on immunity through the activation of tooth cells. It has been identified that tooth cells are modulated by expressing expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC-II. Likewise, polysaccharides can also modulate the secretion of IL-12 by dendritic cells and increase the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the levels of CD4 + and CD8-T cells.
