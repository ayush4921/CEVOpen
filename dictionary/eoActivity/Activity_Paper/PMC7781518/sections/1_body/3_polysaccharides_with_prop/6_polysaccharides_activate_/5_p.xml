<p id="p0240">To conclude the subject, although the theme is not exhausted, it is important to emphasize that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have also revealed the potential of polysaccharides in modulating the immune system. The 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> mushroom has several polysaccharides, including β-glucans, which have different biological properties. Recently 
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Zou, Duan, and Xu (2019)</xref> demonstrated using tumor models 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> that 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> β-glucan positively regulated the level of CD4 + T cells in lymphoid organs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration has been demonstrated at sites where tumor cells were concentrated. The study is conclusive in stating that the modulation of the defense system was activated by the polysaccharide, mainly by the interaction with T cells, and finally the elimination of neutrophils was found.
