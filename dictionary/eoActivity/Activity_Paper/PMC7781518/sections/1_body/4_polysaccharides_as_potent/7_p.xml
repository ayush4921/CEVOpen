<p id="p0300">Polysaccharides like chitosan and glucans are being used in several technologies to transport antigens. For example, nanosheet of chitosan/calcium phosphates has been used successfully to transport internalized exogenous antigens by dendritic cells. The use of the chitosan/calcium system has increased antigen cross-presentation, indicating that it can be used as an efficient vaccine carrier (

Several complexes of chitosan and functionalized nanoparticles have been used as adjuvants in an inactivated vaccine for Newcastle disease. The study shows that cellular immunity levels increased and there was a significant reduction in viral load, as observed by the expression of cytokines, lymphocyte proliferation, percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes (

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> conjugated chitosan oligosaccharide vaccines increase the immune response to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccines. Conjugates have been shown to promote the proliferation of T lymphocytes, initiating a mixed immune response, including increased antibody production and regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.
