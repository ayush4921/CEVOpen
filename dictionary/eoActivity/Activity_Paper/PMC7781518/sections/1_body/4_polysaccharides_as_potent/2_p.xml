<p id="p0275">When a virus infects the human body, the first step in the evolution of the biological cycle is the attachment of the virus to a host cell, through target receptors. The work done with SARS-CoV serves as a reference for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 reacts when infecting a cell. It has been shown that the virus has a preference for airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung (

When the virus attacks these cells, the cells immediately express the target receptor of the host of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS-CoV-2 uses the same input receptor, there is a reduction in the expression of ACE2 in lung cells. ECA2 reduction after a viral infection can result in dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system, influencing blood pressure, and electrolyte balance in the cell. Understanding the relationship between target cell interactions is important for the development of therapies. Therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2 passes through the target host ACE2 receptor (
