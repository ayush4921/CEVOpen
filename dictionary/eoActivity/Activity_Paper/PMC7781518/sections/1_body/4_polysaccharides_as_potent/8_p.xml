 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Yang, Yang, Yang, and Wang (2015)</xref>, isolated an alkali polysaccharide from the stems of 
 <italic>Physalis alkekengi</italic> L, an exotic edible fruit. The structural analysis of the purified fraction indicates that the structure is formed by (1 → 3) -linked Glc, (1 → 3) -linked Gal, (1 → 2) -linked Xyl, (1 → 2) -linked Ara, and (1 → 2) -linked Rha residues, with a molecular weight of 31 kDa. The polysaccharide was used as an immune booster in a DNA vaccine, and the results show significantly increased IgG antibody response, but specifically higher IgG1 titers, as well as IgG2b. Although polysaccharides have relevant properties to be used as platforms for vaccine development, in-depth studies on membrane receptors, types of interactions, and mechanisms of modulating activity are still needed. In addition, there are still problems for large-scale polysaccharide production, especially those from natural sources. However, we believe that soon, more in-depth studies should elucidate profound aspects of the use of polysaccharides in vaccines and their potential in clinical studies. Perhaps, in the future, polysaccharides could be used to develop platforms for vaccines against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.
