<p id="p0290">Although all vaccine projects are concentrated on biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, attenuated virus, and solid particles, we believe that natural polysaccharides could play a crucial role in the development of oral vaccines. In fact, polysaccharides are viable platforms for vaccine development. As reported in the bibliographic review article written by (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &amp; de Carvalho Junior, 2020</xref>), polysaccharides can bind to cell receptors more easily than other biomolecules, initiating a series of biochemical reactions that lead to the production of antibodies. Thus, polysaccharides could be used as adjuvants in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
