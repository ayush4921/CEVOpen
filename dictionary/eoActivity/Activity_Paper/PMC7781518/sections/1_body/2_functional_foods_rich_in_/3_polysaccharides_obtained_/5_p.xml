 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Ruthes et al. (2016)</xref>, in a literature review article showed that mushrooms are rich in heteropolysaccharides. Several edible and medicinal mushrooms were explored in the review article, with an emphasis on structural characteristics and biological effects. The authors show that mushrooms have several different types of heteropolysaccharides, that is, polysaccharides with more than one type of monomer in the monosaccharide chain. The study shows that hybrid mushrooms also produce heteropolysaccharides. Also, heteropolysaccharides have important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activity.
