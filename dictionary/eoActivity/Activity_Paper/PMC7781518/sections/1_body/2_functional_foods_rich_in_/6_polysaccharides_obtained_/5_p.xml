<p id="p0190">In a study published in the journal Trends in Food Science and Technology, 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al. (2020)</xref>, reports the current advances in research on the structural, functional and chemical characteristics of 
 <italic>Enteromorpha</italic> polysaccharides. The algae of the genus 
 <italic>Enteromorpha</italic> produce several types of polysaccharides with relevant biological activities. However, the relationship between structure and function of polysaccharides is not yet fully elucidated. A peculiar characteristic of sulfated polysaccharides is that they have lower molecular weights and exhibited excellent immuno-relevant and antioxidant activities.
