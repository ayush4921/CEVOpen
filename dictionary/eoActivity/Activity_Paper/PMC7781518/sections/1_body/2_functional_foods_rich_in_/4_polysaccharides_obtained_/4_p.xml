 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kakar et al. (2020)</xref>, reports in a review article the structural characteristics, extraction techniques and biological activities of polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>Cyclocarya paliurus</italic> (Batalin) Iljinskaja. The leaves of this plant have important chemical compounds, especially polysaccharides, and have been used in the production of teas and food for millennia. Several studies evaluated by the authors, explore various polysaccharide extraction techniques, and a set of modern spectroscopy techniques associated with others such as chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance have been applied to structural polysaccharide elucidation. Finally, the author shows the main biological activities associated with the purified and modified polysaccharides of 
 <italic>Cyclocarya paliurus</italic> (Batalin) Iljinskaja, and includes anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-diabetic activities.
