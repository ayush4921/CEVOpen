 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al. (2019)</xref>, isolated and characterized two new water-soluble polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> L. var. sarcodactyl. The new polysaccharides have groups of sulfates in their structure, which explains much of their characteristics as solubility. The low molecular weight fraction has a triple helix conformation, while the high molecular weight fraction is more complex. The authors demonstrate that the composition of polysaccharides rich in arabinose, mannose, glucose and sulfate groups may be closely related to immunomodulatory activity. It has been shown that the fraction with the highest percentage of sulfate groups forces stereochemical exposure of hydroxyl groups present in the polysaccharide molecule, favoring coupling to cellular receptors, and therefore increasing immunomodulatory activity. 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Nagarajan et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrated that lycopene-pectin complexes can be obtained from the water-induced pink guava decanter. The complex has high antioxidant activity, mainly associated with lycopene molecules in the Trans configuration. These studies show that fruits are rich in polysaccharides, in particular polysaccharide complexes such as pectin linked to various secondary compounds.
