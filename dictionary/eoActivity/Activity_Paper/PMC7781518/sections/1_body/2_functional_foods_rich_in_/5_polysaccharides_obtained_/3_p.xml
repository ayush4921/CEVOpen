 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2019)</xref>, identified a new polysaccharide from Chinese wild fruits (
 <italic>Passiflora foetida</italic>) and demonstrated that it was a heteropolysaccharide with structure of → 1) -α-D-Manp → 1,2) -β-D-Manp- linked 1,2,6) -β-D-Manp residues and side chains consisted of → 1) -β-D-Galp, → 1,4) -α-D-Manp, → 1, 4) -β-D -Glcp, → 1,3) -α-D-Galp, → 1,6) -β-D-Manp, → 1,6) -β-D-Galp, → 1,2,3) -β-D -Manp and → 1,3,6) -β-D-Galp residues. This new polysaccharide has Mannose as its main monosaccharide, and has the potential to increase the immune system.
