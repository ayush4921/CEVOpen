 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lamothe, Srichuwong, Reuhs, and Hamaker (2015)</xref> isolated a fraction of insoluble fiber from 
 <italic>A. caudatus</italic>, and demonstrated that the fraction was composed of homogalacturonans divided into interspersed chains, with units of ramnogalacturonane and side chains of xyloglucans, disaccharides, trisaccharides and cellulose. 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Wang, Tan, and Zhang (2020)</xref>, identified several types of polysaccharides in Quinoa seeds, especially pectins and insoluble fibers. It was identified in the fraction of insoluble fiber homogalacturonans interspersed with ramnogalacturonan units and side chains of xyloglucans, trisaccharides and cellulose, a structure equivalent to that described by 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lamothe et al. (2015)</xref> from 
 <italic>A. caudatus</italic>. But for a comprehensive understanding of polysaccharides obtained from pseudo-cereals, it is worthwhile for the reader to consult the review article written by 
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Zhu (2020)</xref>. In this article the author summarizes the relevant aspects about the chemical structure, physical properties, biological functions and food uses of polysaccharides obtained from pseudocereals. In addition, comparative observations between grain polysaccharides and fiber fractions from common sources, such as fruits and vegetables, reveal many similarities, mainly in their composition and potential immunomodulatory activities.
