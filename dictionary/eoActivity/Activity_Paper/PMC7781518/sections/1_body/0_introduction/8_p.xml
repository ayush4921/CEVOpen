<p id="p0065">Given the current scenario, the use of foods rich in immunomodulator polysaccharides is a viable option to increase immunity and reduce risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 contamination. Also, understanding the biology resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 host-pathogen will provide relevant information on the treatment and management of the disease. Although the use of polysaccharides as a therapy strategy is not yet a reality, the application as supplements is a rational possibility, based on all scientific evidence on the immunomodulatory potential of these biopolymers (
