Therefore, promising new therapeutic interventions should somehow improve the hosts' immune response. The immune system is the focus of some of the therapeutic interventions being developed. In particular, the adaptive immune system, which needs to be, stimulated with immunoregulatory agents or immune system activators. The polysaccharides that are present in some foods have biologically active properties, such as the ability to activate immune functions, inducing the production of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune function regulating substances (
