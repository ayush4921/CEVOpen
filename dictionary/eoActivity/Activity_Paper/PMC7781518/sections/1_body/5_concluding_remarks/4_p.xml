<p id="p0320">Although several studies, some well advanced, and research groups distributed around the world are committed to the development of vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the disease continues to progress exponentially worldwide. Thus, new ways of preventing and stimulating efficient immune responses must be tested. In this context, polysaccharides can play a crucial role. Based on several studies carried out in the last 5 years, we concluded that natural polysaccharides can be used as platforms for the production of vaccines, acting as coadjuvants, since they can easily bind to various cell receptors. Finally, we conclude that although the use of isolated polysaccharides is ideal due to bioavailability, we emphasize that the consumption of foods rich in biologically active polysaccharides is also useful. Even though the biological effects are not equivalent to those of the isolated polysaccharides, it can still help people to increase immunity, reducing the risk of a complicated clinical condition if infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
