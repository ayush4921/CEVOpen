<p id="p0315">Polysaccharides obtained from functional foods have interesting structural properties that contribute to a diversity of biological potentialities. The review showed that polysaccharides can modulate an immune response by various biochemical pathways. Also, these biopolymers can be found in natural and edible sources such as mushrooms, plants, algae, fruits, and other matrices. The potential of natural polysaccharides for disease prevention is clear, as demonstrated by several updated research reports. Foods rich in these biopolymers can be used safely since they have no toxic effects are biocompatible and biodegradable. In addition, polysaccharides obtained and purified from these food sources may be the key in the development of new drugs and immunity-boosting therapies.</p>
