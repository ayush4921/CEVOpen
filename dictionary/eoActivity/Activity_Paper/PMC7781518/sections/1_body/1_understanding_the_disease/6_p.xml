Therefore, in addition to viral contamination, the organism must deal with a strong immune response from the host, accompanied by what experts call the ‘‘storm’’ of pro-inflammatory compounds. The organisms' strong response to infection is accompanied by serious complications to multiple organs. Also, associated with risk factors such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, old age, spinal cord injuries and other morbidities, the clinical condition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may worsen (
