<p>Sanger sequencing was carried out with the BrilliantDye™ Terminator v3.1 Kit (Nimagen B.V., Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Reactions were set with a fourfold dilution of the reaction premix and the addition BrilliantDye
 <sup>®</sup> Terminator 5X Sequencing Buffer (Nimagen B.V., Nijmegen, The Netherlands) according to the producer’s instructions. Sequencing products were precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in TSR (Hi-Di Formamide) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then separated by capillary electrophoresis on an Applied Biosystems™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Two reads were collected for each sample. Eight sequences were generated for molecular and phylogenetic analyses performed along with additional sequences obtained from NCBI (
