<p>Sequence quality was checked with the Sanger Quality Check App (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Forward and reverse sequencing reads for each marker region were assembled into a contig using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [
 <xref rid="B58-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The identity of all obtained sequences was confirmed as ITS or 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic> through similarity to published sequences using the BLAST algorithm. The ITS2 fragment was extracted with ITSx [
 <xref rid="B59-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].
