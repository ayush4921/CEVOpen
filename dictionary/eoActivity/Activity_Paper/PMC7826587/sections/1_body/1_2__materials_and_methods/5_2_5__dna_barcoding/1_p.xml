<p>ITS rDNA regions were amplified using primers ITS1F [
 <xref rid="B54-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and ITS4 [
 <xref rid="B55-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] while the 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic> chloroplast intergenic spacer was amplified with 
 <italic>trnH</italic>f_05 [
 <xref rid="B56-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and 
 <italic>psbA</italic>3_f [
 <xref rid="B57-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] primers (
 <xref rid="cells-10-00112-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). PCR was performed in a T-100 thermal cycler (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in 20 μL volumes containing template DNA and was set up according to the Q5™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase manufacturer’s protocol (Q5™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, New England BioLabs Ltd., Hitchin, UK). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s; 60 °C (for ITS1F&amp;ITS4) or 62 °C (for 
 <italic>trnH</italic>f_05&amp;
 <italic>psbA</italic>3_f) for 30 s; 72 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 2 min for final extension. PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel in TEA buffer with 50 bp DNA Ladder (New England Biolabs Ltd., Hitchin, UK) and stained with SimplySafe (EURx, Gdansk, Poland). Amplified DNA products were purified with the Syngen Gel/PCR Mini Kit (Syngen Biotech, Wroclaw, Poland).
