<p>In a previous study of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> roots (air-dried crude material, extraction with n-hexane), eight diterpenoids were detected [
 <xref rid="B44-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Extraction with 80% methanol performed in this study allowed for the detection of 18 diterpenoids in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> roots and 15 in roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. 1Î²OH-cryptotanshinone, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone IIat, and arucadiol (a synonym of miltiodiol) found by Slusarczyk at al. [
 <xref rid="B44-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were also detected in our methanolic root extracts in both 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S.abrotanoides</italic>. Miltirone, however, was present only in the methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and not in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>, which corroborates previous results [

 <xref rid="B44-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Two dehydrogenation products, didehydrotanshinone and didehydromiltirone, which were previously detected in n-hexane root extract of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>, were not present in our methanolic root extract, neither in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> nor in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. Interestingly, isograndifoliol, reported recently in n-hexane root extract of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] was also detected in the methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and was proved to contribute most to chemical differentiation between 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>.
