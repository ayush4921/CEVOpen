<p>Qualitative chemical differences between closely related plant species might be of a different etiology. They might result directly from genetic (and/or epigenetic) differences between species or be an outcome of various processes occurring at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Comparative analysis of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> transcriptomes might help discover particular transcripts responsible for detected chemical differences. Performing genetic crosses between 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> would create a segregating population which, through parallel phenotyping and genotyping, might serve for tracing genetic loci potentially responsible for the observed chemical profiles. A similar approach in 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic> allowed for discovering that ten genes from the noscapine biosynthesis pathway are clustered in the poppy genome [
 <xref rid="B85-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In fact, there are numerous reports published to date proving that many secondary metabolites are a product of gene-clusters [
 <xref rid="B86-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Once a certain target genetic locus is found, it could be subject to different biotechnological approaches, such as gene cloning, gene silencing or heterologous expression of proteins, in order to perform a functional analysis of target genes. In the long run, this may lead to developing applied research aiming at optimization of the chemical profile of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, which may in turn become an alternative source of bioactive chemicals such as tanshinones.
