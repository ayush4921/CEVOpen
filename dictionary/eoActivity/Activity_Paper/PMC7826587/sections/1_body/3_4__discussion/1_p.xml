<p>In this work, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of the phytochemical profile of non-volatile compounds separately for roots and leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> cultivated in Europe (Wroclaw, Poland). A reliable comparison was possible due to ensuring the same cultivation conditions such as: latitude, weather conditions etc., the same sampling method (immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen), and time (middle of the growing season) as well as the same extraction procedure (MeOH: H2O; 8:2 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and method for chemical analysis (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). Despite ensuring identical cultivation conditions and methodology, a detailed comparison of the phytochemical non-volatile profile in roots and leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> resulted in detecting several metabolites present in one species and absent in the other. The PC loadings analyses showed that sugiol in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaves and carnosic acid quinone in leaves of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> were mostly responsible for their chemical differentiation. In roots, isograndifoliol, acetyloxycryptotanshinone, ketoisograndofoliol, oxocryptotanshinone, and grandifoliol in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> as well as chrysoeriol 7-rutinoside, hesperidin, and one unidentified cryptotanshinone derivative in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> allowed for chemical distinguishing of root samples from analyzed species.
