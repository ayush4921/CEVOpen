<p>Amongst diterpenoids found in n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], carnosol, miltirone, rosmanol, and epi-rosmanol were found in methanol leaf extracts of both 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> analyzed here. Miltiodiol, however, has been previously isolated from roots [

 <xref rid="B44-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which was confirmed by our study. Tabefam et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] also detected ferruginol and dehydroferruginol, both belonging to abietane diterpenoids, which were absent in our isolates. Instead, we detected oxoferruginol (sugiol), present in leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>, while leaves of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> contained hydroxyferruginol (trilobinol).
