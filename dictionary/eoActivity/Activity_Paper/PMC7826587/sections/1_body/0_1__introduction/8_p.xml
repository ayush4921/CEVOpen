<p>Both species are closely related and may share very similar morphology, except the leaf shape, which is the main determinative feature, according to many identification keys [
 <xref rid="B1-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Numerous publications also inform that the characters of the inflorescence, flower, and seeds are similar in both species and they only differ in leaf shape [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The leaf shape is not a reliable determination feature though, as it is very variable within the species, especially in
