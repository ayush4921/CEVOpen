<p>The research performed to date on plants of subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> concentrated on either roots [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or aerial parts [

 <xref rid="B51-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. There are also reports on phytochemical analysis of the air-dried whole plants [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B52-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Plants were collected from their natural habitat or were cultivated. Various methods and solvents were used by researchers to extract natural products of interest which often makes the results hardly comparable. Therefore, we aimed at comprehensive analysis of phytochemical profiles of non-volatile compounds in both roots and leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> cultivated in Europe under identical climatic and edaphic conditions (Wroclaw, Poland). The ethnopharmacological importance of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> has prompted us to reanalyse their chemical constituents with potential or proven bioactivity. Here, for the first time, we offer a detailed comparison of phytochemical non-volatile profile in roots and leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> together with the analysis of a mutual genetic relationship between the two species. The proposed approach of a comparative analysis of closely related plants of a similar but not identical chemical profile may bring tangible results which might potentially pinpoint the outlook for follow-up work through genetic approaches, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other applications. Choosing non-model but potentially important medicinal plants allowed us to test this methodology and prove that the slight differences in morphological and metabolic phenotypes can be verified by molecular analyses, thus facilitating the proper material identification and accelerating the selection of desired traits, breeding, and herb quality control and improvement.
