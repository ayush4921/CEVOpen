<p>There are a lot of discrepancies regarding the taxonomy of the subgenus

 <italic>Perovskia</italic> together with four other genera, 
 <italic>Dorystaechas</italic>, 
 <italic>Meriandra</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zhumeria,</italic> have previously been considered closely related to 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> and were treated together as part of the subtribe Salviinae in the most recent and comprehensive conspectus of Lamiaceae [
