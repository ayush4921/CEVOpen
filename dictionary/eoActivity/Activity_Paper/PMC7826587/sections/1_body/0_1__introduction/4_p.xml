<p>In 2017, a broad phylogenetic study was undertaken using nuclear markers such as the internal transcribed spacer from nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS) and plastid marker 
 <italic>rpl32-trnL</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This study confirmed the polyphyletic character of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> but also showed the existence of four distinct, well supported evolutionary lineages (Clades I-–IV) within 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> and the inclusion of five additional non-
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genera, namely, 
 <italic>Dorystaechas</italic>, 
 <italic>Meriandra</italic>, 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zhumeria</italic>. Based on the plastid data, 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> were found in a trichotomy with Clade I (
 <italic>Salvia</italic> s.s.). The authors reconstructed the evolution and biogeography of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> and found that the most recent common ancestor of 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>, which are sister to 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> Clade I, diverged most likely during the early to middle Miocene. Based on current knowledge, Will and Claßen-Bockhoff propose to split the former large genus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> into six genera, each supported by geographical distribution, morphology, and karyology, and suggest that they could be elevated to generic rank after revision.
