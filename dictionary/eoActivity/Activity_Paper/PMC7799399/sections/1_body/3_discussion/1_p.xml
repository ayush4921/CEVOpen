<p id="Par16">Bioactive compounds from natural products are attractive candidates for drug development. Numerous medicinal plants have been reported to possess various therapeutic properties including anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. The chemical profiling of three selected medicines showed the presence of various biologically active compounds belonging to different classes of phytochemicals such as alkaloids, phenolics, and coumarins. Coumarins such as umbelliferone and scopoletin were found to be common for all the selected samples. Naturally occurring coumarins have been reported to possess diverse biological and pharmacological properties such as anti-viral, anti-coagulant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-protozoal, insecticidal, fungicide, anti-mycobacterial, anti-mutagenic, anti-amnesic, and anti-inflammatory activities [

There are numerous evidences for the inhibitory role of coumarins against infection of various viruses such as HIV, influenza, enterovirus 71, and coxsackievirus A16. The mechanisms involve either inhibition of proteins essential for viral entry, replication, and infection or regulation of cellular pathways such as Akt-Mtor, NF-ÎºB, and anti-oxidative pathways including NrF-2 [
