<p id="Par17">Alkaloids such as piperine, curcumin, berberine, and palmatine were identified from the selected medicines. Piperine is detected from both IK and MMG and that might have come from the ingredient plant 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic>. The immunomodulatory potential of piperine has been reported earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Piperine was reported to inhibit proliferative response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immunoglobulin α-IgM antibody and resulted in inhibition of IgM antibody secretion and reduced expression of cluster of differentiation CD86 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another study by Lee et al. 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated that piperine in combination with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated p38 and JNK MAPK activation, which increased EPO and EPO-R expression, resulting in upregulation of IL-10 and NF-κB. Alkaloids like curcumin, berberine, and palmatine were identified from VG. The anti-viral effect of curcumin on Zika and chikungunya viruses has been well established [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The literature showed that curcumin mediates its anti-viral activity through various mechanisms. Curcumin has been reported to inhibit the Japanese encephalitis virus by dysregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Curcumin was also reported to inhibit various virus replications like Rift Valley fever virus and hepatitis C virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, curcumin was shown to impact HCV replication through binding and fusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and similar results were reported in the case of ZIKV and CHIKV. HIV-1 integrase activity of curcumin was also reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Various pharmacological activities of berberine such as anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective have been reported earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Anti-viral activity of berberine against human cytomegalovirus has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The immunomodulatory effect of berberine was validated in many previous literatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
