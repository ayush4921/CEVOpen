<p id="Par14">Rapid chromatographic method has been developed for the chemical fingerprinting of selected medicines by modern high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The optimized mobile phase provided good resolution under various documentation systems such as UV-254, 366, and visible light. Chromatogram and 3D-illustrated display are presented in Fig.
