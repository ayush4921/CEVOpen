<p>Besides that, the peak of C=O stretching was more significant in the 100% methanol extract than in the other extracts, which indicates the presence of ester, carboxylic acid, and carbonyl compounds in the 100% methanol extract. Furthermore, the peak indicating the presence of an amino compound was sharp in the 100% methanol extract, while in other extracts it appeared as a tiny shoulder, confirming the presence of aromatic amines [

Apart from this, peaks of C=C and C-H out-of-plane bending were found to be more significant in the 100% methanol extract in comparison with all other extracts. Some alpha-glucosidase inhibitors identified by gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics were bearing the aforementioned functional groups related to the active compounds, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), palmitic acid, beta-tocopherol, 1-monopalmitin, and stigmast-5-ene [
