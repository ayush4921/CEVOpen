 <xref rid="molecules-25-04161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the interrelation between the wave number from the FTIR spectra, considered as the x-variable, and the AGI activity (per IC
 <sub>50</sub>), considered as the y-variable. The plot exhibits the spectral data that influence the AGI activity. The peaks present at the negative axis of pq [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] of the plot correlate with the AGI activity and vice versa. The peaks found at 3010–3670 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2795–3010 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, relating to the signals from the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, showed bond stretch frequencies for O-H and C-H, respectively. These peaks indicate the presence of alcohol, alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, or aldehydes. Besides this, the peaks at 2000–1650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1700–1730 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 1600–1650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicate C-H (bending), bond stretch frequencies for C=O, and bond stretch frequencies for C=C, respectively, which show the presence of aromatic compounds, carboxylic acid, and alkenes. Furthermore, the peaks found at 1450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 900–1300 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> showed the presence of C-H bending and C-O (stretch) of secondary aromatic amines, an alkane, and alcohol, and ethers, esters, a carboxylic acid, and anhydrides, respectively. The presence of N-H bending was due to the appearance of a peak in the 1550 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region. Additionally, the peaks found at 650–1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 430–800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> show C=C (bending) and a long chain of C-H (out-of-plane bending), respectively.
