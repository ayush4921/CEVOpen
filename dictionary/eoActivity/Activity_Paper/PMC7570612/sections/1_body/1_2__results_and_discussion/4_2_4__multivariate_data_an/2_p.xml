<p>The discrimination of the samples employing the OPLS model is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04161-f002">Figure 2</xref>. In this OPLS model, the first matrix, considered as the x-variable, indicates the data acquired from the FTIR spectra. In contrast, the second matrix, considered as the y-variable, represents the per IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AGI activity. This model shows two components (1 + 1 + 0) with a R
 <sup>2</sup>Y and a Q
 <sup>2</sup>Y (cumulative) of 65.9 and 50.5%, respectively. The samples having high AGI activity (100% and 25% methanol-water extracts) are on the positive side of the OPLS component 1 and differentiated from the extracts having less activity (75%, 50%, and 0% methanol-water extracts) that were clustered at the negative semicircle (
