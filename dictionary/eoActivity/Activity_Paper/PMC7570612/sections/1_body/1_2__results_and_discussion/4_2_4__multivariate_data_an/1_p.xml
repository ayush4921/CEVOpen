<p>While most statistical techniques focus on just one or two variables, Multivariate data analysis allows more than two variables to be analysed at once. In MVDA, OPLS is one of the most familiar models. An impressive separation can be obtained by orthogonal partial least square–discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) [
