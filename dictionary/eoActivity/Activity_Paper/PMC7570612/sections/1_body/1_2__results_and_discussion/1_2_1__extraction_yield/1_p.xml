<p>The extraction yield of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extracts is displayed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04161-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The yield % of the solvent dilutions differed considerably from each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The 75% solvent ratio of methanol-water extracts of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> resulted in the highest yield (35.19 ± 1.11%). In comparison, the 0% methanol-water extract was found to have the lowest percentage of yield (20.40 ± 1.47). The trend of this result was found as 75% &gt; 50% &gt; 100% &gt; 25% &gt; 0%. From this result, it is observed that to get a higher yield of extraction, a solvent of medium polarity is preferable to that of higher polarity. This result further indicated that a high proportion of methanol could be the perfect solvent for increasing extraction yields. This is in agreement with Khatib et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where a higher yield of extraction was related to the water–alcohol combinations rather than the monocomponent solvent. Sultana et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported that aqueous methanol is the most suitable solvent for extracting the leaves of a medicinal plant with a higher yield of extraction.
