<p>From the obtained data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04161-f004">Figure 4</xref>, it can be concluded that the validity of the model developed is appropriate, because the total sum of the squares intercepting the Y-value and the predictive ability of the model intercepting the Y-value were less than 0.4 and 0.05, respectively [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present study, both of the model’s intercepting Y-values met the specifications. Its residuals were linear with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.9255, which represents the match between the experimental data and the model’s predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04161-f005">Figure 5</xref>).
