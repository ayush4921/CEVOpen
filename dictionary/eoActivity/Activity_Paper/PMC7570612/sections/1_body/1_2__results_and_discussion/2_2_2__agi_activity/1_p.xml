 <xref rid="molecules-25-04161-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the AGI activity of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extracts in various ratios of methanol-water. It is shown as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value in µg/mL, the minimum value representing the maximum inhibitory activity. There were no significant differences found in the inhibition potential of the 0% and 50% methanol-water extracts. In contrast, the 25%, 75%, and 100% methanol-water extracts exhibited notable differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The result shows that all extracts exhibited high AGI activity. The 100% methanol extract has the highest AGI activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.83 µg/mL, and taken together it was found that 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extract has notable AGI activity. In contrast, Jemain et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf showed only α-amylase inhibition (15.7 ± 0.8 µg/mL) and no α-glucosidase inhibition. This contrast could be due to the fact that they used dichloromethane as an extraction solvent following maceration, which is a technique for extraction. Due to the various absorbance conditions, methods of extraction and solvents used could alter the extraction yield and the plant bioactivity, as shown in a previous study [
