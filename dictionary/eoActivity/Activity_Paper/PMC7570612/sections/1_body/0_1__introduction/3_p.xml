<p>Medicinal plants have traditionally been consumed in different cultures to cure diabetes. The genus 
 <italic>Psychotria</italic> has many applications in conventional medicine and provides tremendous potential for pharmacological properties. The genus 
 <italic>Psychotria</italic> is traditionally known among the Karo people of North Sumatra as a treatment for diabetes, named “loning”; it is also called “meroyan sakat/salung” in Malaysia [

 <italic>Psychotria malayana</italic> Jack is a plant of the Rubiaceae family and has several synonyms: 
 <italic>Grumilea aurantiaca</italic>, 
 <italic>Pilosella aurantiaca</italic>, 
 <italic>Chassalia expansa</italic>, 
 <italic>Psychotria stipulacea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Uragoga malayana</italic>. Hadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported the derivation of major alkaloids, hodgkinsine, and other compounds, including calycanthine, (+/−)-chimonanthine, meso-chimonanthine, 3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-γ-carboline, and 2-methyl-6-methyl pyrazine, from 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves. Further, Hadi [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] studied the anti-bacterial activities of LPM-574, which is a derivative of hodgkinsine. Matsuura et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] investigated the analgesic activities of hodgkinsine, (+)-chimonanthine, and meso-chimonanthine, whereas Chebib et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated the anti-convulsant effect of calycanthine. Despite scientific reports of the plant’s activities, data on its anti-diabetic impact are scarce.
