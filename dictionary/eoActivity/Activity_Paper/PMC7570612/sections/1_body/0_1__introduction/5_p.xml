<p>No report of the correlation of the alpha-glucosidase inhibition (AGI) activity of the 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extract to its infrared spectrum has been made yet. In this study, therefore, an attempt is made to examine the bioactive compound functional groups that are present in the leaf extracts (in various solvents ratios of methanol-water) by using the FTIR technique. The present study attempted to develop a multivariate calibration model to predict the AGI activity of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> Jack leaf extracts in correlation to their FTIR spectra.
