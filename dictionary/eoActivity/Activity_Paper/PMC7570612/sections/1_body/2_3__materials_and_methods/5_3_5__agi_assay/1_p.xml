<p>The in vitro AGI activity was determined following the assay of Javadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Quercetin (positive control) is a well-known AGE inhibitor, prepared by dissolving 2 milligrams in 1 milliliter of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). On the other hand, the substrate ρ-nitrophenyl-ρ-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) is prepared by weighing 6 milligrams of the substrate and dissolving it in 20 milliliters of 50 millimolar phosphate buffer prior to the adjustment of the pH value to 6.5 using sodium hydroxide solution. The dried plant extracts were prepared in the same way as the quercetin. Ten microliters (10 µL) of quercetin (positive control), the samples, and DMSO (negative control) were added into a 96-well plate. One hundred microliters of 30 millimolar phosphate buffer and 15 microliters of the enzyme were added into the reaction mixture. The blank was the one without enzyme. After five minutes of incubation at ambient temperature, 75 microliters of PNPG was added to the samples and the blank mixture. After another 15 min of incubation, the catalytic reaction was halted by the addition of 50 microliters of glycin. The absorbance was taken at 405 nm utilizing a microplate reader (Tecan Nanoquant Infinite M200, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the linear regression analysis. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is an important tool for measuring the efficacy and potency of an inhibitor; it represents the amount of inhibitor needed to halve the response [

 <disp-formula>Inhibitory activity (%) = [(A
  <sub>control</sub> − A
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A
  <sub>control</sub>] × 100%
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>control</sub> indicates the negative control’s absorbance, and A
 <sub>sample</sub> represents the sample’s or positive control’s absorbance [
