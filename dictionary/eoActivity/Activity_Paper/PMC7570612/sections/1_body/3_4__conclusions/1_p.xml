<p>This research explored the potential anti-diabetic activity of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extracts at different methanol-water ratios (0 %, 25 %, 50%, 75 %, and 100% methanol-water). The 100% methanol-water extract showed the maximum inhibitory activity. The correlation of FTIR spectra and AGI activity identified the functional groups that are able to induce AGI activity, namely hydroxyl (O-H), alkenyl (C=C), methylene (C-H), carbonyl (C=O), and secondary amine (N-H) groups. This analysis has developed a validated statistical model, with an R
 <sup>2</sup>Y value of 0.9255 indicating the fitness of the model. The AGI activity of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> was predicted using this validated statistical model. This finding shows that the developed model is statistically valid to predict AGI activity, which is very useful as a tool in the quality control of this plant.
