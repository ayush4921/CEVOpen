  <p>Evaluation of the effects of cashew nuts on carrageenan (CAR)-induced inflammation and pain. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of CAR. Paw volume was measured before the subplantar injection and hourly to 6 h. The edema volume is the difference in the paw volume at each time-point and the basal paw volume. Hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were assessed at the time points indicated with plantar and Von Frey tests. Cashew nuts administration shows significant improvement in the treatment of inflammation and pain. See materials and methods for further details. Paw volume (
