  <p>Effects of cashew nuts on nitrate/nitrite, MPO, and MDA activity after CAR-injection. As a consequence of neutrophils infiltration and lipid peroxidation MPO and MDA were assessed. Additionally, considering the key role played by NO during inflammatory events, we analyzed also levels in nitrite/nitrate in paw exudate. Carrageenan induces a significant increase in all parameter taken in consideration. On the other hands, oral treatment with cashew nuts at the dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced MPO, MDA, and nitrate/nitrite CAR-induction. MPO (
   <bold>A</bold>); MDA (
   <bold>B</bold>); nitrate/nitrite (
   <bold>C</bold>). See materials and methods for further details. #
