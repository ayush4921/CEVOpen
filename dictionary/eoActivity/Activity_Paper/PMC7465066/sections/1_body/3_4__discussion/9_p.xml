<p>Carrageenan-induced paw edema is a very sensitive and reproducible test used in the screening of new molecules with anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B88-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Carrageenan-induced inflammation causes an acute and local inflammatory response that is advantageous for detecting orally active anti-inflammatory agents; therefore, it has significant prognostic value for anti-inflammatory agents acting through mediators of acute inflammation [
