<p>Conversion of arachidonic acid to biologically active leukotrienes, a potent mediators of inflammatory reactions is a key point when looking for new molecules that can inhibit inflammatory events. Plant domain is a valuable source for new 5-LOX and dual 5-LOX/COX-inhibitors, because they are fundamentally rich in flavonoids compound [

 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic> L. strongly inhibited prostaglandin synthase, but nobody evaluated these activities in vivo [
