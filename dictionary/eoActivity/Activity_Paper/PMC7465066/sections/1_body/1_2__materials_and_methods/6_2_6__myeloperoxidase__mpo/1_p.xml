<p>As previously described for MPO evaluation, paw tissues were homogenized in 0.5 percent hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide dissolved in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 20,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 30 min. A supernatant aliquot had been allowed to react with a 1.6 mM tetramethylbenzidine/0.1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution. The rate of absorbance shift was measured at 650 nm, using a spectrophotometer. MPO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme degrading 1 mM of peroxide at 37 °C within 1 min, and expressed in units per gram of wet tissue weight [

An aliquot of the homogenate was added to a reaction mixture containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), acetic acid (pH 3.5), thiobarbituric acid, and distilled water. Samples were then boiled and centrifuged. The supernatant’s absorbance was measured at 650 nm using spectrophotometry [
