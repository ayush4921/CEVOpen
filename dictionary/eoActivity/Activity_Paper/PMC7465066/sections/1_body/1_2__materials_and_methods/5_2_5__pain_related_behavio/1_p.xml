<p>To evaluate the analgesic effects of cashew nuts we made a plantar and Von Frey tests. Briefly, during the plantar test we analyzed the hyperalgesic response to heat at different time point using a Basile Plantar Test (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) with a cut-off latency of twenty seconds to prevent tissue injury. A mobile unit containing a high-intensity projector bulb was located to carry on a thermal stimulus directly to a single hind paw from beneath the chamber. The withdrawal latency period of injected paws was determined with an electronic clock circuit and thermocouple. Results are expressed as paw withdrawal latencies [

The device encloses a force transducer furnished with a plastic tip. The force applied was measured when pressure is applied to the tip. The tip was applied to the hind legâ€™s plantar region, and an increasing force was exerted upwards before the paw was extracted. The withdrawal threshold was defined as the force, expressed in grams, at which the rats removed the paw [
