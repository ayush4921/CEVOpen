<p>The instability of free radicals is fundamentally the result of the loss of an electron that leads to an heightened reactivity and to a constantly “steal” electrons from other molecules starting a dangerous chain reaction called “free radical damage” [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Principal targets of these “steal” are proteins, lipids, and DNA/RNA, and all these modifications in different and several molecules may increase the chances of mutagenesis. In fact, ROS/RNS overproduction over a prolonged period of time can cause serious injury of the cellular structure and functions. For this reason, it is mandatory to remove it quickly [

Free radicals are important mediators that initiate inflammatory processes and, consequently, their neutralization by antioxidants and radical scavengers can attenuate inflammation. In order to minimize the damage caused by free radicals, the organism utilizes several enzyme such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and cofactor such as glutathione (GSH) [
