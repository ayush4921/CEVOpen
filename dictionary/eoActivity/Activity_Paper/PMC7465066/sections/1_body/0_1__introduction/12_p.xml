<p>Carrageenan-induced paw edema is a common murine experimental model used for the study of new compounds during the acute phase of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As well-known, following injury induced by carrageenan, there is cell infiltration, mainly neutrophils, that contributes to the inflammatory response by producing myeloperoxidase and pro-inflammatory cytokines [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, a critical role during the development of the inflammatory state is the lipid peroxidation and the imbalance between ROS production and anti-oxidant enzyme activities [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. With this background in mind, we used this consolidated experimental model to evaluate for the first time the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects of cashew nuts.
