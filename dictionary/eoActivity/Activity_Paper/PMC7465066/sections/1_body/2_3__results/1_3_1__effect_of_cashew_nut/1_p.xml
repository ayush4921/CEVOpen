<p>One of the first sign of intraplantar injection of CAR, was the increase in paw volume in a time-dependent way (

In our study, we found that oral treatment with Cashew nuts at the dose of 100 mg/kg given 30 min before CAR, showed a reduction of the volume of rat paw significantly at 6 h post-CAR as well as a decrease in pain showing an inflammatory activity and algesic response.
