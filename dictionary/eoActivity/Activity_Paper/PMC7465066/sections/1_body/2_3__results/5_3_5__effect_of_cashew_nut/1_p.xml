<p>Considering a variety of oxidants and free radicals that are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory process and considering that dietary components also may contribute to the antioxidant defense either by providing redox active compounds that can directly scavenge or neutralize free radicals, we investigated the oxidative stress through H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA probes and ELISA kits. As supposed, after CAR-injection, we observed a very important increase of ROS production (
