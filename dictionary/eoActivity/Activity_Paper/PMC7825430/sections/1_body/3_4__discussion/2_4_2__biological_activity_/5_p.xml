<p>The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human body leads to oxidative stress, causing numerous pathological conditions, including development of colon cancer. It occurs through high susceptibility to the influence of pro-oxidative and toxic factors and the following increase in the proliferation of cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to introduce antioxidants to everyday diet as chemopreventive agents. Mushroom polysaccharides from edible species are interesting candidates for this purpose. The present study has revealed that the crude polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> possess moderate antiradical activity and strong reducing properties and chelating activity as well as high potential in inhibition of lipid peroxidation. It has already been found that the mechanism of the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from mushrooms depends on their chemical structure. Molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, chain conformation, and structural configuration may affect the antioxidant capacity of this group of compounds [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the case of free radical scavenging, polysaccharides are believed to have greater potential than monosaccharides. This activity may be determined by the size of molecules and the type of binding in the side branches of the main chain of the polysaccharides; nevertheless, their antioxidative activity is still rather moderate [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A previous study reported the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> revealed in the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> assay. The authors found that the scavenging effect of two polysaccharides at the concentration of 5.0 mg/mL reached 84.02 and 80.70%, while the activity of the standard compound (vitamin C) was 97.48% [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Researchers demonstrated the antioxidant activity of crude polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Cordyceps miltaris</italic>, i.e., one of the most famous functional and medicinal mushrooms, using methods similar to those employed in our study. The reducing power (expressed as the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value) of various polysaccharides from 
 <italic>C. militaris</italic> ranged from 1.06 to 6.07 mg/mL, and the chelating activity ranged from 3.09 to 7.74 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In comparison with our study, this implies that the polysaccharide fraction from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> has significantly higher antioxidant properties (
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) than the polysaccharides from 
 <italic>C. militaris</italic>. CPS was found to be able to inhibit lipid peroxidation on the hemoglobin-catalyzed the peroxidation of linoleic acid. Moreover, the ORAC assay, which relies on the utilization of the AAPH-derived peroxyl radical imitating lipid peroxyl radicals, was involved in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction in vivo [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], confirmed the antioxidant properties of polysaccharides from the cauliflower mushroom. The antioxidant activity of crude natural polysaccharides may be attributed to the presence of various compounds in mushroom extracts, e.g., phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, our current research shows that crude polysaccharides also exhibit moderate or even high antioxidant potential, which is not related to the total phenolic content. Antioxidant properties may be related especially to the presence of β-glucans in the polysaccharide fraction from mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Certainly, further studies of the function–structure relationship are necessary.
