<p>The antitumor activity of

 <italic>S. crispa</italic> exhibited anticancer activity to the solid form of Sarcoma 180 in mice and showed a hematopoietic response to cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia in mice. Moreover, β-glucan from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> suppressed the number and growth of lung metastatic colonies in B16-BL6-bearing mice [
