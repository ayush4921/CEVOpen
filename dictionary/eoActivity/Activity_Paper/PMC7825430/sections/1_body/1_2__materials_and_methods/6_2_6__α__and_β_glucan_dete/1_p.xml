<p>The content of glucans in 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> was determined using the Megazyme Mushroom and Yeast Beta-Glucan Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To determine the total glucan content, milled 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> was hydrolyzed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and neutralized with 2 M potassium hydroxide. Then, the digestion with exo-1,3-β-glucanase (20 U/mL) plus β-glucosidase (4 U/mL) in 200 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was performed. To measure the glucan content, glucose oxidase/peroxidase and 4-aminoantipyrine in p-hydroxybenzoic acid and sodium azide (GOPOD) reagent was added. The absorbance was measured at λ = 510 nm against the GOPOD reagent blank. For measuring the content of α-glucans, a milled mushroom sample was hydrolyzed in 2 M KOH and neutralized with 1.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8). Then, amyloglucosidase (1630 U/mL) and invertase (500 U/mL) were added into the hydrolysate and incubated at 40 °C for 30 min. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the GOPOD reagent was added and incubated at 40 °C for 20 min. The absorbance was measured at λ = 510 nm against the reagent blank including the sodium acetate buffer instead the sample tested. The total glucan and α-glucan contents were calculated by comparison to the D-glucose standard. The β-glucan content was determined by subtracting the α-glucan from the total glucan content. All measurements were taken a minimum of three times. The results were expressed as g/100 g of dry weight and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
