 <italic>S. crispa</italic> (10 g) were macerated with 99.8% ethanol (100 mL) for 24 h at room temperature and then extracted two times with 99.8% ethanol using ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) to remove low molecular weight compounds. Then, the supernatant was removed, and the residue was extracted two times for 30 min with distilled water (200 mL) by UAE at 80 °C. The combined aqueous extracts were concentrated under vacuum to 20 mL. The concentrated extracts were further purified by deproteinization using the Sevage reagent (chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 4:1,
