<p>The human colon epithelial cell line CCD 841 CoN and the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HT-29 and LS180 were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Salisbury, UK). The CCD 841 CoN cells were grown in DMEM. The Caco-2 cells were grown in EMEM. The HT-29, and LS180 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 Ham. All media were supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and FBS in the amount 10% (CCD841 CoN, LS180, HT-29) or 20% FBS (Caco-2). The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO
