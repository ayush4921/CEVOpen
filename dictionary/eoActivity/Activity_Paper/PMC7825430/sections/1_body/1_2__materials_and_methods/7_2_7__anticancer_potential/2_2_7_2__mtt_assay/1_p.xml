<p>The cells were seeded on 96-well microplates at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL (cancer cells) and 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL (normal cells). On the following day, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were exposed to serial dilutions (10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of the crude polysaccharide extract from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> prepared in the fresh medium with the standard content of FBS. The cell metabolic activity was assessed after 96 h of incubation in standard conditions (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C) by means of the MTT assay, in which the yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT) was metabolized by viable cells to purple formazan crystals. After the incubation period, MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added into the cells for 3 h. The resultant crystals were solubilized overnight in SDS buffer at pH 7.4 (10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl), and the product was quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of λ = 570 nm using the microplate reader (BioTek ELx800, Highland Park, Winooski, VT, USA). The results were presented as a percentage of metabolic activity of cells treated with the investigated compound versus cells grown in the control medium (indicated as 100%).
