<p>Antiradical activity against ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> was determined with the method described by [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Twenty microliters of the sample was mixed with 180 µL of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution (0.096 mg/mL). The mixture was shaken and incubated for 6 min. The absorbance was measured at λ = 734 nm. The scavenging activity of the extracts was determined using the following formula:
 <disp-formula>% Reduction = [(AB − AA)/AB] × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where AB is the absorption of the control sample (ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution and solvent instead of the sample), and AA is the absorption of the sample with ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> reagent. Six dilutions of CPS were examined to plot a dose–response curve and determine the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (concentration of CPS providing 50% of activity).
