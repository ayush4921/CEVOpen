<p>The influence of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> crude polysaccharides on catalase (CAT) activity was assayed with the method developed by [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with some modification. The assay mixture consisted of phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0), the CPS sample (1 mg/mL, in water), the enzyme solution (60 U/mL), and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.019 M). The decomposition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was determined directly by the extinction at Î» = 240 nm per unit time (3 min) was used as a measure of catalase activity.
