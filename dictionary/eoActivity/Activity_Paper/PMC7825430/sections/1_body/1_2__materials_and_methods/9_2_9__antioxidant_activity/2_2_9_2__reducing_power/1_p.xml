<p>Reducing power (RP) was determined using the method described by [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], in which 2.5 mL of the sample was mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (200 mM, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% aqueous solution of K
 <sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN
 <sub>6</sub>)]. After 20 min of incubation at 50 °C, 0.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 25× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. 2.5 mL pf the upper layer of solution was mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>. The absorbance was measured at λ = 700 nm. Six dilutions of CPS were examined to plot a dose–response curve. The result was expressed as the concentration of polysaccharides providing 50% of activity based on a dose-dependent mode of action (EC
 <sub>50</sub>).
