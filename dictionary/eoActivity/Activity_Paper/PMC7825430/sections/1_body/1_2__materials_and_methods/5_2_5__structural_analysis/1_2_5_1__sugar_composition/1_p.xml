<p>The sugar composition of CPS was determined using sugar analysis. The polysaccharide fraction (~0.5 mg) was hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid (2 M TFA, 2 h at 120 °C), reduced with sodium borohydride, and acetylated with acetic anhydride in the presence of sodium acetate (120 °C for 2 h). The alditol acetate derivatives obtained were analyzed by GC–MS using a Shimadzu GC–MS QP2010SE system equipped with a Rtx-5 (30 m) capillary column [
