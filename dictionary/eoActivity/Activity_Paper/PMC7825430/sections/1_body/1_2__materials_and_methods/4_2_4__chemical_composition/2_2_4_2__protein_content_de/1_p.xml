<p>The protein concentration in CPS was determined with the Bradford method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The reaction mixture consisted of 1 mL of Bradford Reagent and 0.1 mL of the sample. Absorbance at Î» = 595 nm was measured. The results were expressed as % of CPS.
