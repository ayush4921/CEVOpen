<p>Polysaccharides constitute an abundant group of macromolecules present in fungal cell walls. Due to their wide structural variability, they have been shown to have great potential to be biological response modifiers (BRMs). The composition of monosaccharide residues, including their sequence and placement as well as their connections and position of glycosidic linkages, affect polysaccharide activities [
