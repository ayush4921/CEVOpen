<p>The results of the LDH assay have shown that the crude polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> were not cytotoxic to the human colon epithelial CCD841 CoN cells. On the contrary, CPS damaged the cell membranes of all investigated colon cancer cell lines. The most significant changes were observed in the HT-29 cells, wherein the LDH level in response to CPS increased from 124.7% (10 µg/mL) to 146.1% (100 µg/mL). A slightly weaker cytotoxic effect was induced by the tested polysaccharides in the LS180 cells; 10 µg/mL CPS increased LDH release by 14.3%, while 100 µg/mL CPS accelerated the cell membrane damage by 33.8%. In the case of the Caco-2 cells, only the highest concentration of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> polysaccharides elevated the LDH level by 7.2%.
