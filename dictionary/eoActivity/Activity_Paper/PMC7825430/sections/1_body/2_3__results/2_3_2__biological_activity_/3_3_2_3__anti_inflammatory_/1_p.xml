<p>In our study, the crude polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> were tested for their ability to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00161-f004">Figure 4</xref>. CPS was found to inhibit COX-1 activity at a level similar to that of acetylsalicylic acid, i.e., a commonly known nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. In the case of COX-2, the CPS activity, estimated at 32.95%, was lower than that of acetylsalicylic acid. The LOX enzyme, which is involved in the development of inflammation in the human organism, was inhibited by 23.8%. This result was higher than that obtained for acetylsalicylic acid (18.73%).
