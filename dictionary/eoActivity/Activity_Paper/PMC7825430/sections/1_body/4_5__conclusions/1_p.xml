 <italic>S. crispa</italic> is a popular edible and medicinal mushroom and a rich source of polysaccharides, including Î²-glucans. Our in vitro study revealed the promising chemopreventive potential of its crude polysaccharide (CPS) based on several different mechanisms of action. CPS was found to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells significantly without a concurrent harmful effect on normal cells. Moreover, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities fitting into the strategy of colon cancer prevention were proved. Since colon cancer was found to be related to food and lifestyle, searching for natural chemopreventive agents administered as part of the daily diet seems crucial. Polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> can be a valuable addition to human diet as nutraceuticals or functional food ingredients. The fruiting bodies of cauliflower mushroom may be consumed as a part of habitual regular diet. Moreover, CPS might be used as bioactive additives incorporated in various food products accessible for consumers. The potential use of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> in supporting colon cancer prevention and treatment in relation to their chemical structure will be addressed in further research.
