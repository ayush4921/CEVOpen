  <p>Antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of crude polysaccharides isolated from 
   <italic>S. crispa</italic> on human colon epithelial cell line CCD841 CoN and human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines: Caco-2, LS180, and HT-29. The cells were exposed to the culture medium alone (control) or the crude polysaccharides from 
   <italic>S. crispa</italic> (CPS) at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL for 24 h (LDH assay), for 48 h (BrdU assay) and for 96 h (MTT assay). CSP cytotoxicity was measured photometrically by means of the LDH assay (
   <bold>A</bold>), while the antiproliferative impact of CSP was examined photometrically by means of the MTT assay (
   <bold>B</bold>) and BrdU assay (
   <bold>C</bold>). Results are presented as mean ± SEM of at least 4 measurements. *
