Simultaneously, they destroyed membrane integrity as well as inhibited the proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, LS180 and HT-29. Antioxidant activity was determined by various methods and revealed the moderate potential of CPS.

Introduction</title><p>Polysaccharides constitute an abundant group of macromolecules present in fungal cell walls. Due to their wide structural variability, they have been shown to have great potential to be biological response modifiers (BRMs). The composition of monosaccharide residues, including their sequence and placement as well as their connections and position of glycosidic linkages, affect polysaccharide activities [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of the mushroom polysaccharides&#x02014;chitin&#x02014;is a water-insoluble and indigestible compound in the human gastrointestinal tract acting as dietary fiber [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In turn, most polysaccharides present in mushrooms are water-soluble glucans with different types of glycosidic linkages, e.g., (1&#x02192;3)-&#x003b1;-glucans and (1&#x02192;3), (1&#x02192;6)-&#x003b2;-glucans [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Mushrooms constitute an inexpensive and abundant source of glucans with health-promoting potential. Nowadays, when the number of health-conscious consumers is growing, there is a need for developing new strategies for the acquisition of beneficial glucans. According to the latest data, the global market of &#x003b2;-glucans is expected to grow significantly and reach over 1 billion dollars in 2020 [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mushroom polysaccharides, especially glucans, are known to exert anticancer activity through immunostimulatory potential, which involves the activation of the innate immune system as well as the acceleration of the host&#x02019;s defense mechanisms [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to the anticancer potential, mushroom polysaccharides possess a vast spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or prebiotic properties [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The major glucans isolated from the fungal species used in the treatment of cancer in Asian countries are &#x003b2;-glucans, e.g., lentinan from <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic>, schizophyllan from <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic>, krestin from <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic>, and grifolan from <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Colon cancer is believed to be preventable with the use of natural chemopreventive agents. The strategy of chemoprevention assumes reversing, suppressing, or preventing carcinogenic progression [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. With their multidirectional activity, mushroom polysaccharides are able to act at different steps in the carcinogenic process, with the overall goal of reducing cancer incidence. Moreover, there are some already known strategies based on the use of mushroom &#x003b2;-glucans not only to inhibit tumor growth but also induce synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents or other immune stimulators. An innovative approach assumes that &#x003b2;-glucans may be used to deliver nanoparticles containing chemotherapeutic agents to the colon cancer site to improve their therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, there are many applications of &#x003b2;-glucans in food products related to their ability to form a gel and enhance the viscosity of aqueous solutions. The use of &#x003b2;-glucans allows the replacement of fat to develop calorie-reduced food products or enhance their appearance and texture [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, they can be considered functional food ingredients providing consumers with health benefits and bringing significant technological advantages.</p><p><italic>Sparassis crispa</italic>, also known as cauliflower mushroom in English or Hanabiratake in Japanese and Ggoksongee (meaning a blossom) in Korean, is an edible and medicinal mushroom growing in the temperate regions of Europe and North America [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Moreover, several phthalides from cauliflower mushroom exerted an inhibitory effect on LPS-stimulated NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> production by RAW264 cells [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It was demonstrated that a branched &#x003b2;-glucan from <italic>S. crispa</italic> induced macrophages to produce several mediators, including the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and nitric oxide (NO) [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory potential of CPS in the direct inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and LOX. Further studies are necessary to establish whether there are any additional mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory activity of <italic>S. crispa</italic> polysaccharides.</p><p>The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human body leads to oxidative stress, causing numerous pathological conditions, including development of colon cancer. It occurs through high susceptibility to the influence of pro-oxidative and toxic factors and the following increase in the proliferation of cancer cells [<xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to introduce antioxidants to everyday diet as chemopreventive agents. Mushroom polysaccharides from edible species are interesting candidates for this purpose. The present study has revealed that the crude polysaccharides from <italic>S. crispa</italic> possess moderate antiradical activity and strong reducing properties and chelating activity as well as high potential in inhibition of lipid peroxidation. It has already been found that the mechanism of the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from mushrooms depends on their chemical structure. Molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, chain conformation, and structural configuration may affect the antioxidant capacity of this group of compounds [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the case of free radical scavenging, polysaccharides are believed to have greater potential than monosaccharides. This activity may be determined by the size of molecules and the type of binding in the side branches of the main chain of the polysaccharides; nevertheless, their antioxidative activity is still rather moderate [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A previous study reported the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from <italic>S. crispa</italic> revealed in the ABTS<sup>&#x02022;+</sup> assay. The authors found that the scavenging effect of two polysaccharides at the concentration of 5.0 mg/mL reached 84.02 and 80.70%, while the activity of the standard compound (vitamin C) was 97.48% [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Researchers demonstrated the antioxidant activity of crude polysaccharides from <italic>Cordyceps miltaris</italic>, i.e., one of the most famous functional and medicinal mushrooms, using methods similar to those employed in our study. The reducing power (expressed as the EC<sub>50</sub> value) of various polysaccharides from <italic>C. militaris</italic> ranged from 1.06 to 6.07 mg/mL, and the chelating activity ranged from 3.09 to 7.74 mg/mL [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In comparison with our study, this implies that the polysaccharide fraction from <italic>S. crispa</italic> has significantly higher antioxidant properties (<xref rid="nutrients-13-00161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) than the polysaccharides from <italic>C. militaris</italic>. CPS was found to be able to inhibit lipid peroxidation on the hemoglobin-catalyzed the peroxidation of linoleic acid. Moreover, the ORAC assay, which relies on the utilization of the AAPH-derived peroxyl radical imitating lipid peroxyl radicals, was involved in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction in vivo [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], confirmed the antioxidant properties of polysaccharides from the cauliflower mushroom. The antioxidant activity of crude natural polysaccharides may be attributed to the presence of various compounds in mushroom extracts, e.g., phenolic compounds [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, our current research shows that crude polysaccharides also exhibit moderate or even high antioxidant potential, which is not related to the total phenolic content. Antioxidant properties may be related especially to the presence of &#x003b2;-glucans in the polysaccharide fraction from mushrooms [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Certainly, further studies of the function&#x02013;structure relationship are necessary.</p><p>Overproduction of ROS in vivo can also occur through some enzyme-mediated reactions. Xanthine oxidase constitutes one of the main enzymatic sources of ROS in vivo due to its participation in the oxidative damage resulting from the reperfusion of ischemic tissues, brain edema and injury, or vascular permeability changes [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The inhibition of XO by CPS was studied in our study. However, the results indicate no influence of CPS on the XO activity.</p><p>We also used another enzymatic method for testing antioxidant activity, i.e., the catalase assay. Catalase protects cells from oxidative stress through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the promotion of catalase activity is one of the indirect mechanisms of antioxidant activity that is beneficial from the point of view of normal cell physiology. On the other hand, it was shown that catalase contributed to the increased resistance of cancer cells to pro-oxidant drugs (especially in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated processes). The inhibition of catalase expression and activity results in increased oxidative stress in cancerous cells. This provides new insight into understanding the possible anticancer properties of some compounds [<xref rid="B58-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, searching for catalase inhibitors seems reasonable in order to design synergistic agents for anti-cancer drugs, which may help to sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells [<xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our study revealed that the <italic>S. crispa</italic> polysaccharides inhibited catalase activity. Therefore, their ability seems to be suitable to be applied for the enhancement of anti-cancer chemotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-13-00161"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p><italic>S. crispa</italic> is a popular edible and medicinal mushroom and a rich source of polysaccharides, including &#x003b2;-glucans. Our in vitro study revealed the promising chemopreventive potential of its crude polysaccharide (CPS) based on several different mechanisms of action. CPS was found to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells significantly without a concurrent harmful effect on normal cells. Moreover, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities fitting into the strategy of colon cancer prevention were proved. Since colon cancer was found to be related to food and lifestyle, searching for natural chemopreventive agents administered as part of the daily diet seems crucial. Polysaccharides from <italic>S. crispa</italic> can be a valuable addition to human diet as nutraceuticals or functional food ingredients. The fruiting bodies of cauliflower mushroom may be consumed as a part of habitual regular diet. Moreover, CPS might be used as bioactive additives incorporated in various food products accessible for consumers. The potential use of polysaccharides from <italic>S. crispa</italic> in supporting colon cancer prevention and treatment in relation to their chemical structure will be addressed in further research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, N.N.-J. and R.N.; data curation, N.N.-J.; funding acquisition, R.N.; investigation, N.N.-J., M.K.L., U.G.-D., N.S. and Z.K.; methodology, N.N.-J., R.N., M.K.L., W.R., U.G.-D. and Z.K.; project administration, N.N.-J. and R.N.; resources, N.N.-J.; writing&#x02014;original draft, N.N.-J.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, R.N., M.K.L. and U.G.-D.
