For example, one of the issues identified as likely to influence benefit-risk evaluation is “inadequate reporting of adverse events and other safety endpoints.” If we look at the definition of respect for persons, patient safety is an aspect of its definition and inadequate reporting of (severe) adverse events a concrete example. Because this finding is likely to affect benefit-risk evaluation, i.e., it is clearly both a scientific and an ethical issue, it was excluded from our analysis.</p>
