<p>The reducing power of the samples were evaluated by the reduction of potassium ferricyanide into potassium ferrocyanide [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The plant extract at 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was added to a solution containing 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) in a final volume of 4 mL. The reaction was incubated at 50°C for 20 min; after this period, it was stopped by adding the TCA solution (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The solution was then mixed with distilled water and ferric chloride (0.1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The absorbance was measured at 700 nm. Phosphate buffer was used as blank control. The result was expressed as a percentage of the activity presented by 0.1 mg/mL ascorbic acid (standard—Sigma-Aldrich).
