<p>Through TLC analyses, the presence of two glycoside flavonoids vitexin and isovitexin in 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> leaf extracts was observed. These compounds were used to search at the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology (TCMSP) database for gene targets [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The data obtained at TCMSP were used at the Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Gnome (KEGG) database [
