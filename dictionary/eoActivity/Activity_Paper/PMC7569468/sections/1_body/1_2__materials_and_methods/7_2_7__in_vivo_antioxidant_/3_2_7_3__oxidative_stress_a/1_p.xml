<p>The oxidative stress assay was performed using tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (t-BOOH) as a ROS producer [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Forty worms at L4 stage were treated with EE and WEE at concentrations 0, 1, and 10 mg/mL for 48 h at 20°C. After that, worms were transferred to 12-well plate having M9 buffer with 8 mM t-BOOH and evaluated every half hour. Those worms that did not react to the stimulus were considered dead (no movement). Some worms were censored, which means when the worm was not found or it died for reasons other than the oxidative stress. These analyses were done in five independent assays.
