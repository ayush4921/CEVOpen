 <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 (wild-type line) were obtained from the 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, USA) and was maintained in nematode growth medium (NGM) seeded with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 at 20°C according to Brenner [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Worms were synchronized using bleaching solution in gravid hermaphrodites (NaOCl 1%, NaOH 0.25 M) to have animals at L1 stage (Sulston and Hodgkin, 1988). For treatment, EE and WEE extracts were filtered using a 0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter (Merck) and added to the NGM at final concentrations of either 1 or 10 mg/mL. Synchronized L1 were cultivated on NGM plates containing extracts and seeded with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 for 48 h at 20°C until they reached L4 stage.
