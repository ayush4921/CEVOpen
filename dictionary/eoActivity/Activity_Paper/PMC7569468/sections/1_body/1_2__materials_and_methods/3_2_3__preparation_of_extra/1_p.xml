<p>After harvest, fresh leaves were divided into small pieces and transferred into a flask at a proportion of 1 : 10 (

 <italic>v</italic>) (100 g fresh leaves to 1000 mL of solvent) to be macerated during 24 h for each solvent used. A serial extraction approach was made using different solvents following the order from apolar to polar solvents like hexane (HE), chloroform (CE), ethanol (EE), methanol (ME), and water end extract (WEE). The approach used to prepare the extracts was a serial extraction using different solvents where the leaves were macerated, and it was added each solvent (apolar to polar solvents), for 24 h. Then, leaves were filtered and moved back to the flask, and the next solvent was added. In this way, water end extract (WEE) corresponds to the last solvent used for this serial extraction. The idea of a serial extraction separated the compound based on the solvent. Furthermore, the extract made using only water—WE—was based on the folk used.
