 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> has been used in folk medicine in northeastern Brazil, but there is no scientific information regarding its chemical composition or antioxidant activities. In this study, the chemical composition and biological activities of six leaf extracts were characterised using a series of solvents (apolar to polar serial approach) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Chemical analyses showed the presence of sugars, proteins, and phenolic compounds. The proportion of these constituents varied among the extracts; EE, ME, WEE, and WE extracts contained high amounts of sugar and a moderate presence of phenolic compounds, whereas protein was very low in all the extracts.
