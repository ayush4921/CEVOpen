<p>Alam et al. [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that polar solvents were good for extracting phenolic compounds, and the data presented here showed higher concentrations of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in these extracts (EE, WE, ME, WEE, and WE). TLC also showed the presence of terpenes (CE, EE, ME, and WE) and saponins (CE, EE, ME, and WEE). In co-TLC, the presence of vitexin and isovitexin was observed, while HPLC-DAD showed the presence of gallic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and vitexin for WE. Although these compounds have been identified previously in other 
 <italic>Coccoloba</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], our findings are the first to report their presence in 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic>. Based on this, it is important to evaluate the antioxidant activity and other biological activities of 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts that contain a mixture of bioactive molecules besides vitexin and isovitexin, which were identified by co-TLC [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and HPLC-DAD for WE.
