  <p>Supplementary Table 1 shows the Pearson coefficient analyses for sugar, protein, and phenolic compounds presented in each of the 
   <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> extracts. The values obtained was shown in red, and it was considered a very strong correlation values higher than 0.9, strong correlation values from 0.7 to 0.9. The Pearson coefficient analyses showed a positive correlation between the phenolic compound content of the 
   <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> extract and the antioxidant assay. There was a strong correlation between TAC and reducing power assay and a moderate correlation to superoxide radical scavenging. Furthermore, the sugar content presented a very strong correlation for reducing power assay and TAC and a moderate correlation with superoxide radical scavenging.
