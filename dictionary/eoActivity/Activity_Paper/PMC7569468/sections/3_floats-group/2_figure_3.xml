   <italic>In vivo</italic> antioxidant activity of 
   <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts using the 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> model. (a) Survival assay of 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms treated with EE under oxidative stress treatment (t-BOOH). The EE treatment was with 0 mg/mL (control), 1 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL (b) Survival assay of 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms treated with WE under oxidative stress treatment (t-BOOH). The WE treatment was with 0 mg/mL (control), 1 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. Survival for both treatments was observed every 3 h (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 h). Worms were maintained at 20°C. The extract treatment was compared to the control by the Log-rank test (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Data were collected in quintuplicate and were analysed by an ANOVA and the Tukey's test (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).
