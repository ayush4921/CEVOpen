 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and d). The most frequently used content area was the herbal plant atlas (12,623 hits). The herbal photo sharing (2667 hits) and self-test exercises (1169 hits) were also frequently visited by the students. The 5-year cohort had about twice as many total hits for the herbal plant atlas, compared with the 6-year cohort. The total hits for herbal photo sharing and self-test exercises were nearly the same in the two cohorts.
