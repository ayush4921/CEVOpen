This study evaluated the effectiveness of a specially designed Moodle module blended with a field trip programme in CM education.

The mixed effect of repeated interactive exercise with multimedia elements may play a role in refreshing students’ memory. Therefore, e-learning should be considered in similar field trip programmes, especially for post-trip review.
