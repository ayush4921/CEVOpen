<p id="Par36">There are a few limitations that must be addressed in this quasi-experimental research. Firstly, convenience sampling may introduce selection bias, the study population may not represent all undergraduate students studying CM, due to factors such as subculture. Despite its lack of randomness, it allowed the study to be more feasible since contamination in the field trip and Moodle self-study would be remarkable if classmates in the same cohort were assigned to different interventions. Moreover, because of educational purposes, neither students nor investigators were blinded, observer effect might exist.</p>
