<p id="Par13">In this study, a prospective quasi-experimental design was adopted. To identify any influences of differences between the students, students’ gender and prior knowledge of the course content were collected as baseline characteristics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two measures were used to assess prior knowledge of related content: 1) scores obtained from the students’ recent “China Materia Medica” examination (out of 100 marks); and 2) scores on a 15-min baseline test completed 1 week before the field trip, in the form of fill-in-the-blank questions including 15 randomly selected images of herbal plants (out of 15 marks). A brief introduction to using Moodle was given to students 1 week before the field trip to ensure that technical capacity in working with Moodle would not impact the test scores.
