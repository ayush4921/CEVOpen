<p id="Par12">A total of 49 s-year BChinMed students, including 26 students in a 5-year programme and 23 in a 6-year programme, participated in a 6-day field trip programme in Yunnan in June 2014. Because the students had completed the “Chinese Materia Medica” course in the previous semester, they possessed some prior knowledge about recognizing wild herbal plants. Convenience sampling was used, students were divided into two groups according to their study programme, namely a 5-year cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26) and a 6-year cohort (
