<p id="Par24">The Moodle-assisted learning outcome was assessed using a quiz administered right after the last day of self-study, in the form of a recognition test. The two-hour quiz consisted of 64 fill-in-the-blank questions (each carrying two marks) on tutor-collected photos of herbs. These questions assessed three cognitive levels of learning, including the ability to recall the particular appearance of medicinal plants, the ability to comprehend the basic characters of different plants, and the ability to apply the skill of plant recognition on the test. Students in the 5-year cohort had access to a Moodle database containing information on 32 herbs that were not included in the Moodle database of the 6-year cohort students, and vice versa. This allowed us to conduct an analysis of the learning outcome by statistically comparing the test scores of students who had access to information on particular herbs through Moodle with the scores of those did not have access to the Moodle information on these herbs.</p>
