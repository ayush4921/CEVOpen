<p>A crystal was selected for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis at 173 K. The diffraction data were collected on a Bruker APEX II diffractometer [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were scaled and reduced with SAINT-Plus [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. SADABS [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used for the absorption correction. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined using full-matrix least-squares methods in SHELXL [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. X-SEED [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was used as a graphical interface. The hydrogen atoms were geometrically constrained except for those involved in hydrogen bonding, which were found in the electron density map and refined isotropically.
