<p>The TEAC assay was done according to the method developed by Pellegrini et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which consists of determining the activities of the isolated compounds in terms of μM Trolox equivalents per gram dry weight (μM TE/g) of the test samples. Trolox was used as the standard with concentrations ranging from 0–500 μM. The absorbance was recorded by a Multiskan spectrometer plate reader at wavelength 734 nm. The antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as a positive control.
