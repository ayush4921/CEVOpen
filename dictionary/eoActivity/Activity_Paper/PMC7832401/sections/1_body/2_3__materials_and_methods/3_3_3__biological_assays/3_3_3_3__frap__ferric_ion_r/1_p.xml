<p>The FRAP assay was conducted according to Benzie and Strain’s [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] method, which consists of finding the compounds’ antioxidant potential in terms of μM ascorbic acid equivalents per gram dry weight (μM AAE/g). 
 <sc>l</sc>-Ascorbic acid was used as a standard in the FRAP assay with concentrations varying between 0 and 1000 μM. The antioxidant potential of the tested samples was read at a wavelength of 593 nm in a Multiskan (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) spectrum plate reader.
