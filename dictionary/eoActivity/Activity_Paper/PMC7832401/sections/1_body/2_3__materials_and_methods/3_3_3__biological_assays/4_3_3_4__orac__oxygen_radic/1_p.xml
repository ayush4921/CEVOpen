<p>The ORAC assay was conducted according to Prior et al.’s [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] method, which is a modified version of the original ORAC assay developed by Cao and Prior [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this assay, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) underwent thermal decomposition to generate peroxyl radicals, resulting in a reduction in fluorescence from fluorescein. The antioxidant potential of the isolated compounds was measured by their ability to prevent any loss in fluorescence from fluorescein by neutralizing peroxyl radicals and assessing the sample’s fluorescence area under the curve (AUC). The fluoroskan spectrum plate reader was programmed to record fluorescein’s fluorescence every 2 min after the addition of AAPH with the excitation wavelength at 485 nm and the emission wavelength at 530 nm. The Trolox (TE) stock solution was used as standard with concentration varying between 0 and 417 μM. The ORAC values were calculated using a regression equation (
 <italic>y</italic> = m
 <italic>x</italic> + c) between Trolox concentration (
 <italic>y</italic> in μM) and the net area under the fluorescence decay curve (
 <italic>x</italic>). ORAC values were expressed as μM Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of test samples (μM TE/g). The antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as a positive control.
