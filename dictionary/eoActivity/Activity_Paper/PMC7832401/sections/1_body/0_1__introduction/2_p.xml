<p>The 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> genus, comprising more than 300 species, belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes well-established medicinal plants. The ethnopharmacological applications of these plants include their use to treat infections, as well as gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders. Their medicinal properties have been attributed to the presence of bioactive diterpenes. 
 <italic>Plectranthus madagascariensis</italic> (Pers.) Benth is a perennial aromatic herb native to South Africa with its traditional use in the treatment of respiratory conditions, scabies, and cutaneous wounds. Earlier chemical studies on 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> showed that the plant is rich in royleanone-type abietane diterpenoids that exhibited antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> [

 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> plant was done via extraction followed by the isolation and characterization of five known abietane diterpenoids (
