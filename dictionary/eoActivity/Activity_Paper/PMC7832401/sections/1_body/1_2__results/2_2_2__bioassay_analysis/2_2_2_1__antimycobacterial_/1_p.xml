<p>The antimycobacterial evaluation of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold> against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> H
 <sub>37</sub>Rv showed that the media in which the cells were cultured impinged on the potency of the tested substances. As observed, the isolated compounds showed activities only in the presence of 7H9/CAS/Glu/Tx medium, except for compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, which displayed moderate activities in both media (7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw and 7H9/CAS/Glu/Tx) from 7–14 days. It is to be noted that both media share the standard mycobacterial broth base, Middlebrook 7H9, and glucose (Glu) supplement. The difference lies in the use of casitone (CAS) and tyloxapol (Tx) in one medium, versus albumin–dextrose–catalase (ADC) and Tween-80 (Tw) in the other. Tx and Tw are surfactants which inhibit mycobacterial clumping. ADC, since it contains albumin (bovine albumin fraction V), is considered a useful proxy for the potential tendency of the tested compound to bind serum protein. On the other hand, CAS is a source of amino acids. The poorer activity in 7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw medium can be a result of protein binding; however, there may be other contributing factors. Moderate activity of 
 <bold>2</bold> in 7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw medium may imply that the acetate group at the position 7α in ring B of its structure is liable to the inhibitory activity. It was observed that the antimycobacterial potency of the isolated compounds increased from 7–14 days, especially for compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>, with (Minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% inhibition) MIC
 <sub>90</sub> values varying from 43.19–11.93 µM and 45.41–5.61 µM, respectively.
