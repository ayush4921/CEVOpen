<p>Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> is the most potent antioxidant agent, as it displayed a remarkable antioxidant inhibitory effect in all assays. The ability of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> to suppress free-radical chain reactions via hydrogen-atom transfer and single-electron transfer mechanisms is attributed to the catechol groups in the benzene ring. The presence of the 12-OH group and the carbonyl group at position C-7 (
 <italic>p</italic>-position) serve as hydrogen- and/or electron-donating moieties, resulting in the formation of stable quinone derivatives. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed very little activity in the FRAP assay. However, in TEAC and ORAC assays, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> displayed good antioxidant activities, suggesting that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> neutralizes the radical cation generated by ABTS, as well as the peroxyl radicals generated from the thermal decomposition of 2,2â€²-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) via the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) mechanism [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> showed good activity in the ORAC assay and weak antioxidant activities in the TEAC and FRAP assays. None of the isolated compounds showed significant activity in the FRAP assays classified as single-electron transfer (SET) methods, except for compound 
 <bold>5</bold>.
