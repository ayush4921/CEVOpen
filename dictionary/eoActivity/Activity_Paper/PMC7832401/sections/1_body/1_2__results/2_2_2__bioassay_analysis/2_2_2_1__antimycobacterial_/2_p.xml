<p>Considering that the structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> differs from that of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> only by the presence of the β-hydroxy group at C-6, and that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (174.20 μM) had a poorer antimycobacterial activity than compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (11.93 μM), it was inferred that the 6β-hydroxy group reduces the compound’s antimycobacterial potency. This observation can imply that 
 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone ring C may have a role in the antimycobacterial activities of several quinone compounds, and that the substituents at C-6 and C-7 in ring B considerably influence the activity [

 <bold>5</bold> did not show activity against Mtb H
 <sub>37</sub>Rv in both media, with MIC
