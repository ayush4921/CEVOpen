<p>The stereochemistry of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> at positions 6 and 7 was reported by Kubínová et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as 6β,7β, whereas Matias et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] identified them as a 6β,7α stereochemical configuration. To the best of our knowledge, no 6β,7β stereochemical configurations have been previously identified from Lamiaceae and especially 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic>; instead, 6β,7α orientations have more commonly been documented and identified. Additionally, Matias et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] did not mention the isolation and/or identification of 6β,7β-related structures, but stated that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> have 6β,7α configurations without further detail. The situation becomes unclear, as Kubínová et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] did not report the spectroscopic data of the two compounds in their study. The results of the X-ray analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00175-f002">Figure 2</xref>) showed that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> consists of three fused cyclohexane rings with two of them as 
 <italic>trans</italic>-fused cyclohexane rings which is endemic to royleanone-type abietane diterpenoids. Although the temperature for the analysis (173 K) of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was slightly higher than that used by Bernardes et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (167 K,

 <bold>2</bold> is indeed a typical 6β,7α configuration, as reported by Matias et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and is common in Lamiaceae.
