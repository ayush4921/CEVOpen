<p>The free-radical scavenging assays (ORAC, TEAC, and FRAP) done on 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> phytochemicals showed that the isolated compounds suppress free-radical formation or chain reactions via HAT mechanisms of action, except for compound 
 <bold>5</bold>, which operates via the SET and HAT mechanisms of action. Compounds with the ability to inhibit free radicals via both mechanisms of action showed strong antioxidant activity compared to those that operate via HAT or SET only. It was also noticed that compounds with good cytotoxicity such as compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, and 
 <bold>5</bold> are good antioxidant agents, which indicates that the cytotoxic activity of the tested compounds may be mediated via an antioxidant mechanism. Moreover, compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> were the only isolated abietane diterpenoids that displayed good to moderate activities in all the assays.
