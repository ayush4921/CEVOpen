<p>Since DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) is an interesting bioactive compound with a wide range of pharmacological effects, the efforts of DMC mass production are necessary for further research and clinical application. Although DMC was determined as the major constituent of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower buds, its content was not high enough for industry-scaled extraction and isolation. Mass production of bioactive compounds by microbial fermentation has recently become a new approach to deal with this question of research. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] published a study on optimizing conditions for biosynthesizing DMC from 
 <italic>Ceriporia lacerate</italic> DMC11-6, a new endophytic fungus. From an optimal fermentation medium, DMC can be produced in a high amount (100.24 ± 1.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/L). The authors also suggested that further investigation using genetic tools to overexpress DMC-biosynthesizing genes is required [
