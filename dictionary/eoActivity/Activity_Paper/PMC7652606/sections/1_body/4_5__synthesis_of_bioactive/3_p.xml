<p>Although there has been a modest number of synthetic publications on bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>, the natural-product-inspired synthetic approach should be taken into consideration for the future development of novel chemical entities for targeted diseases. However, the past studies only focused on C-methylated flavonoids and their analogues but neglected other bioactive compound groups, which are also found from the plant in considerable amounts, for example, triterpenoids and phloroglucinols. Future studies should pay more attention to that area of research.
