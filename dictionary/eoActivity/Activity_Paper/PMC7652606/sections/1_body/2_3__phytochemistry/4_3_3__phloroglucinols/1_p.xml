<p>“Phloroglucinol” refers to a group of compounds that are biosynthesized via the condensation of three malonyl-CoAs, followed by the cyclization of 3,5-diketoheptanedioate. Naturally occurring phloroglucinols usually possess an acyl functionality along with three hydroxyl groups. The phloroglucinols isolated from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> possess characteristic structural features, such as C-linked methyl groups in the aromatic ring (
 <bold>66</bold>, 
 <bold>68,</bold> and 
 <bold>69</bold>), the hybridization of terpene and acylphloroglucinol moieties (
 <bold>80</bold>, 
 <bold>81</bold>, 
 <bold>84</bold>, and 
 <bold>85</bold>), and polycyclic phloroglucinol dimers (
 <bold>82</bold> and 
 <bold>83</bold>) (
