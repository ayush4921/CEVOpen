<p>Phytochemical studies on 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower buds and leaves resulted in the isolation and identification of a total of 86 compounds, which can be categorized into three main groups, including terpenoids, flavonoids, and phloroglucinols. The structures were elucidated by standard spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D NMR, MS). The absolute configuration of complex structures was determined by signs of cotton effect in circular dichroism spectrum [
