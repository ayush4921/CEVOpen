<p>C-methylated flavonoid is the characteristic group of the compound in 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> with the dominant occurrence of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>). Unlike common flavonoids, C-methylated derivatives possess one or two methyl groups directly linked with the aromatic ring (
 <bold>34</bold>–
 <bold>41</bold>, 
 <bold>51</bold>–
 <bold>65</bold>). Besides that, ubiquitous flavonoids and their glycosides were also identified, such as kaempferol (
 <bold>42</bold>), quercetin (
 <bold>43</bold>), tamarixetin (
 <bold>44</bold>), myricetin derivatives, and their glycosides (
 <bold>45</bold>–
 <bold>47</bold>) (
