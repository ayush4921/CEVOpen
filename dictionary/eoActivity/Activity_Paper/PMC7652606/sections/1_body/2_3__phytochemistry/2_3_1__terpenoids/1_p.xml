<p>Isolated terpenoids from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> are mostly oleanane- (
 <bold>6</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>26</bold>–
 <bold>33</bold>) and ursane-type (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>–
 <bold>20</bold>) triterpenoids. Oleanane-type triterpenoid is also known as 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin triterpenoid, which consists of five six-membered rings (A-E) with 
 <italic>trans</italic>-conformation of A/B, B/C, and C/
 <italic>D</italic> rings and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-conformation of D/E rings. Ursane-type triterpenoid (
 <italic>α</italic>-amyrin type) is nearly identical to oleanane-type from a chemical perspective, except for two methyls at C-19 and C-20 (in oleanane-type, both methyls connect to C-20).
