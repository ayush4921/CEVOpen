<p>There have been several published analytical studies for the quantification of major compounds from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was chosen for its relatively short analytical time, baseline peak separation, and applicability for many compound groups. Phytochemical investigations on 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower buds revealed that flavonoids and triterpenoids are major bioactive compounds. Ye et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] developed an HPLC method to quantify DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) and ursolic acid (
 <bold>16</bold>). The analytical procedure was conducted on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C
 <sub>18</sub> (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 4.6 mm × 250 mm), a C
 <sub>18</sub> reverse-phase column, eluting with an isocratic program (methanol (A); 0.2% aqueous H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> (B); A : B = 93 : 7, v/v), UV wavelength at 220 nm, and analytical time of approximately 10 min. The validated method was then applied to quantify the content of two compounds in three samples collected from different locations. As a result, the contents of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) and ursolic acid (
 <bold>16</bold>) were determined in the range of 0.973–1.201 mg/g and 2.857–3.549 mg/g of dried plant materials, respectively [
