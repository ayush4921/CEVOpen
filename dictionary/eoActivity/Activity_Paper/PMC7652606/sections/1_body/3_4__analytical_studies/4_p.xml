<p>Besides that, the total phenolic content of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> was also quantified to link with pharmacological effects. The common method is using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. In this method, the extract is diluted and shaken with Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (a mixture of phosphomolybdate and phosphotungstate). After that, the absorbance of the mixture was measured by a spectrophotometer at specific UV wavelengths (commonly at ∼500 and ∼750 nm). Gallic acid and catechin were usually chosen as reference standards, and the total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid (GAE) or catechin equivalents (CE). The total phenolic content of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> was determined in different plant parts as follows: flower bud (58.5–157.7 mg GAE/g [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; 122.5 mg CE/g [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), leaves (1.03 mg–511.4 mg GAE/g) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and berry (5.35–61.1 mg GAE/g) [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
