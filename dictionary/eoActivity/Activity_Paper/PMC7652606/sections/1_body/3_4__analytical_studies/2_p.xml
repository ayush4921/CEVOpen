<p>DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) was chosen as the analytical marker of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> for its high content and potential bioactivity. The quantification method was developed and validated on C18 reverse-phase HPLC column, mobile phase consisting of organic solvent (acetonitrile or methanol) and aqueous solvent (containing phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid), and UV detection set at ∼330 nm, which is a maxima UV wavelength of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>). These quantification studies revealed the content of DMC in flower buds ranging from 0.75% to 1.85% in different extracts [
