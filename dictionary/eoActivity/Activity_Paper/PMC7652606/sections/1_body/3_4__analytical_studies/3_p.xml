<p>Tran et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] quantified the content of maslinic acid (
 <bold>27</bold>) and its coumaronyl derivatives (
 <bold>28</bold> and 
 <bold>29</bold>), which were potent RANKL-induced osteoclast formation inhibitors, by HPLC. The optimal condition was performed on a Sunfire C
 <sub>18</sub> column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m), eluting with gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in the water, and UV lamp set at 205 nm. The content of compounds 
 <bold>27</bold>–
 <bold>29</bold> was determined as 7.20, 0.16, and 0.52%, respectively [
