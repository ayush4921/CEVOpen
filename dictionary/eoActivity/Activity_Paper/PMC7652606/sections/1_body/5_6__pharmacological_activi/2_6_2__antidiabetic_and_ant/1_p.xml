<p>There have been a number of studies on antidiabetic and antiobesity effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extracts and the major compound (DMC, 
 <bold>38</bold>). The extracts of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> were shown to inhibit the activities of various digestive enzymes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, including 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, maltase, sucrase [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], lipase, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was also found out that the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> were relevant to total polyphenol content, particularly DMC [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> aqueous extract (2 g/kg) also reduced postprandial glucose level of STZ-induced diabetic rats after oral loading of 2 g/kg of maltose, which was comparable to that of acarbose (25 mg/kg). The extract (500 mg/kg) was also shown to reduce blood sugar levels in fasting rats with maximal reduction after 6 hours. The authors also studied the long-term hypoglycemic effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> by giving the extract (500 mg/kg) orally to diabetic rats in 8 weeks. As a result, the 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract remarkably reduced the blood glucose level and urine volume, and no sign of toxicity was observed during the study [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another study performed by the same group also indicated that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> (500 mg/kg) showed protective activities on 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells of pancreatic islets in the STZ-induced diabetic rat model after 9 weeks of treatment. Histopathological results showed that there were less severe degenerative and necrotic changes in the pancreatic islets and immunohistochemical staining displayed the large area of strong insulin antigen reactivity in 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells in the islets of Langerhans in the 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>-treated group [
