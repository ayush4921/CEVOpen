<p>In summary, there have been a large number of pieces of evidence about the antidiabetic and antiobesity properties of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract and its major constituent (DMC) in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental setups. 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extracts were shown to inhibit polysaccharide hydrolytic enzymes, reduce blood sugar level, and protect pancreatic islets in rat models. On the other hand, the major chalcone DMC was capable of stimulating insulin secretion, increasing glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes, and protecting pancreatic islet cells from oxidative stress, cellular damage, and glucotoxicity. Furthermore, DMC was also found to reduce lipid accumulation and promote fatty acid oxidation in the mouse. Although antidiabetic and antiobesity activities are not therapeutic indications of the plant in traditional medicine, these study results strongly suggested the potential clinical application of this plant in the fight against chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. Clinical studies are required to confirm the pharmacological properties in humans.
