<p>The major compound, DMC (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced injuries in endothelial cells and hepatocytes. DMC showed potent ABTS radical scavenging activity (176.5 ± 5.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol Trolox equivalents/500 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol DMC), ferric reducing activity (213.3 ± 5.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol Trolox equivalents/500 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol DMC), and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 243.7 ± 6.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) in respective experiments. In the cellular assay, DMC was shown to protect human umbilical vein endothelial ECV-304 cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity through mechanisms of reducing intra- and extracellular ROS levels [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity. In specific, DMC reduced the levels of NO and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), inhibited the accumulation of MDA, and restored the reduced glutathione (GSH) level inside the liver cells [
