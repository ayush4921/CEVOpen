<p>One of the most common uses of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> in traditional Vietnamese and Chinese medicine is treating influenza. Current studies revealed that the C-methylated flavonoids were responsible compounds for anti-influenza activity of the extract. These findings may support the traditional claim of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> as an anti-influenza herb. However, published studies only reported the pharmacological results in enzymatic and cellular bioassays. Therefore, further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies should be conducted to confirm the anti-influenza effects of the plant in animal models, thereby laying the foundation for clinical trials.
