<p>The berry extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> was studied for its neuroprotective activities in the 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model. As a result, the fruit extract was shown to prolong the average and maximum lifespan (test group: 27â€“30 days; control group: up to 22 days), as well as healthspan of the nematode by reducing the level of lipofuscin, which is an indicator of aging, and modulating the expression of healthspan-related genes. The detailed mechanism was determined to be DAF-16-interdependent by the upregulation of the family of transcription factors and the ability to extend the lifespan of DAF-16 mutant species. Furthermore, the extract was also capable of reducing the ROS level inside the nematode, which includes the involvement of skn-1 and sir-2.1 gene expression [

The fruit extract was also shown to inhibit glutamate-induced apoptosis by suppressing the endoplasmic reticulum stress, reduce the intracellular ROS level, and increase the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which was tested on mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It can be seen that despite the limited number of publications on the neuroprotective effects of S. nervosum fruit extract, the initial data on the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> model were shown very promising. Hence, the research area of the neuroprotective potential of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> should receive more attention from the scientific community. Extensive bioguided phytochemical studies should be carried out to discover the correlation of bioactive compounds and their respective mode of action.
