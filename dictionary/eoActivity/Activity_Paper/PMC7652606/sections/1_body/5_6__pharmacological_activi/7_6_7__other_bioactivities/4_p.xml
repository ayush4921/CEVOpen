<p>The major chalcone-type compound from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>, DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>), was also studied for its cellular protective effects against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-mediated cellular damage in pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). DMC increased the levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase, leading to the reduction of endogenous ROS, which eventually protected cells from oxidative damage. Furthermore, DMC was also found to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential, which is an important indicator of cellular apoptotic activation, and decrease the caspase-3 activity in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated PC12 cells [
