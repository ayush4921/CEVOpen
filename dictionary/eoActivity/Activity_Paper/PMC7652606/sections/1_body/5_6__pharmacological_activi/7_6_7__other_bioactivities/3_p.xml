<p>Tran et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] published a study on antiosteoclastogenic activities of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower bud and its constituents. The extract was shown to suppress RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-Î’ ligand)-induced osteoclast formation via inhibiting the activation of c-Fos (a proto-oncogene) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic 1). The authors also conducted bioactivity-directed isolation to identify the active compounds for antiosteoclastogenic effects from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract. As a result, maslinic acid (
 <bold>27</bold>) and its two coumaroyl derivatives (
 <bold>28</bold> and 
 <bold>29</bold>) were the responsible compounds [
