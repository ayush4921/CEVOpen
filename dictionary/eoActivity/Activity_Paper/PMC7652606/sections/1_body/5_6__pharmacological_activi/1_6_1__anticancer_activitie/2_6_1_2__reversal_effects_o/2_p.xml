<p>Cotreatment of DMC (4 and 8 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) enhanced the chemosensitivity of BEL-7402/5-FU cells to 5-FU by 3.68 and 4.92 times, respectively, while the figures for doxorubicin were 1.71- and 2.35-fold. Flow cytometry also showed the increased apoptotic cell population when using low-dose DMC with 5-FU, compared to DMC or 5-FU sole treatment [

A follow-up study from the same group reported the reversal effects of DMC in drug-resistant cancer cells in the human hepatocellular tumor xenograft model. A combination of low-dose DMC and 5-FU significantly inhibited the growth of BEL-7402/5-FU cell xenografts (55.6% reduction of tumor weight), compared to the inhibition rate of 22.2% and 16.7% when using 5-FU and DMC alone, respectively. In addition, the cotreatment of DMC (20 and 40 mg/kg) also increased the accumulation of 5-FU inside tumor tissue and significantly elevated the activity of caspase-3, which plays a central role in the execution phase of cell apoptosis [

The underlying mechanism of DMC against the multidrug-resistant BEL-7402/5-FU hepatocellular carcinoma cells was determined to be through the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and increasing the generation of ROS inside the cells. Moreover, DMC was found to block cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by downregulating the levels of related proteins, including p-GSK3
 <italic>β</italic>, cyclin D1, and CDK4 [
