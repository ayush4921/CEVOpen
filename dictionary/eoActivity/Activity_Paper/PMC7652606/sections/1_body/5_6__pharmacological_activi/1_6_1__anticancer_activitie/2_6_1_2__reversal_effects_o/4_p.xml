<p>To summarize, the cotreatment of DMC with other well-known anticancer drugs, such as 5-FU, doxorubicin, or Taxol, was shown to enhance the activities of the drugs, increase the accumulation of drugs in tumor tissues, and also even have synergistic effects with drugs when treated in resistant cancer cells. Further studies, especially in animal models, should be done to clarify the application of DMC in cancer treatment.</p>
