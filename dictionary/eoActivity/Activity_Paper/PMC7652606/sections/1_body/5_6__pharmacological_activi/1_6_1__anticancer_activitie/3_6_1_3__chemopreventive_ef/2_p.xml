<p>In another study, Inboot et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] set up a 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> mutation assay to evaluate the antigenotoxic effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> seed extract. The results showed that the seed methanol extract was capable of inhibiting aflatoxin B1, MeIQ (2-amino-3,4 dimethylimidazo [4,5-
 <italic>f</italic>]quinolone)-induced mutagenesis dose-dependently, which indicated that the mode of action of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> seed extract might be through inhibitory effects on carcinogen-bioactivated enzymes rather than direct action on mutagens [
