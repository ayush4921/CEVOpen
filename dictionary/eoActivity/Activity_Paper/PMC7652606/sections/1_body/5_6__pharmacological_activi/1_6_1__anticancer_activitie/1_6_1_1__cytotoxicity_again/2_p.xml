<p>In general, DMC was found to be active against many cancer cell lines with different magnitude of cytotoxicity. The chalcone exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity against A549 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.3 ± 0.44 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. DMC was also very active against a variety of cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 8 to 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, such as HepG2, ASK, P-388, and PANC-1. For other cancer cell lines, DMC only showed moderate activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 30–85 
 <italic>μ</italic>M).
