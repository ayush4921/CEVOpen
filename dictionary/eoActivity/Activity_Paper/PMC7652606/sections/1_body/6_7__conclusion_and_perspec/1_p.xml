<p>In a nearly 20-year period, there have been a large number of studies conducted on 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>, mainly in leaves and flower buds part. Phytochemical investigations have revealed that triterpenoids, flavonoids, and phloroglucinols are the main components of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>. Among them, C-methylated flavonoids stand out as bioactive compounds which are responsible for pharmacological activities of the plant, especially for the case of 2′,4′-dihydroxy-6′-methoxy-3′,5′-dimethylchalcone (DMC), while other major compound groups like triterpenoid and phloroglucinol were not paid enough attention in terms of pharmacological properties. Analytical studies reported the inconsistent content of DMC in 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower buds, which suggested that DMC content might depend on plant varieties, location, and most importantly harvest time because the flavonoid content in flower buds can be changed in different flowering stages. Therefore, it is necessary to propose the standardization of varieties, geographical regions, and time of harvest. Such efforts will lay a practical basis for the development, modernization, and utilization of this plant in clinical practice.
