<p>As for the antidiabetic effect, 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> and DMC were found to exhibit very promising activities in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Although antidiabetes is not a curative indication of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> in traditional medicine, the pharmacological activity deserves more attention to identify the optimal dose and long-term effects in both animal and clinical studies. Further research should be performed to shed light on the clinical application of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> in the treatment of diabetes.
