<p>In this paper, the investigation of carbonic anhydrase and paraoxonase enzyme inhibition properties of water-soluble sulfonated zinc and gallium phthalocyanines are reported for the first time. The results showed that complex 1 and 2 inhibited the cytosolic isoforms hCA I and hCA II (off-target cytosolic isoforms) in the micromolar range (Ki values of 26.09 µM and 43.11 µM for hCA I and 30.95 µM and 33.19 µM for hCA II, respectively). Moreover, they inhibited PON1 (associated with HDL) with Ki of 0.37 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively. The inhibition kinetics was analyzed by Lineweaver–Burk double reciprocal plots. The analysis revealed that complex 1 and 2 were noncompetitive inhibitors against PON1, hCA I, and hCA II. Whereas complex 1 and 2 showed moderate hCA I and hCA II inhibitory activity, they exhibited strong PON1 inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the changing metals (Zn and Ga) and their atomic diameters affected the CA inhibitory activity, while they did not show a significant effect on PON1. These complexes can be more preferable than other synthetic CA and PON inhibitors due to their high water solubility. Finally, the inhibition efficacy between zinc and gallium complexes and hCA I and hCA II enzymes has been studied in detail with molecular simulation, and experimental data and docking results are highly compatible.</p>
