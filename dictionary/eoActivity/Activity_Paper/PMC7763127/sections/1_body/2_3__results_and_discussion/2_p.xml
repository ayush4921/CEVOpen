<p>The solution spectra show a spectral characteristic indicating D4h symmetry, which is typical for Pc complexes [24]. The absorption peak in the near-UV region is the B-band or Soret band that is attributed to the a2u→e*g transition; a further band in the visible region is related to the Q-band caused by the p–p* transition a1u→e*g. It can be stated that there are some vibrational bands at relatively shorter wavelengths that are a standard property of metallophthalocyanines [25]. The UV-vis absorption spectra of nonperipherally substituted phthalocyanine complexes in DMSO shows two main peaks, the characteristic ligand centered π–π* transitions of a monomeric zinc and gallium phthalocyanine derivatives (1 and 2) with Q-band maxima at 695 and 711 nm, respectively (Figure 2) [14,23,26].</p>
