<p>The increase in the number of secondary chemical interactions between this complex and target proteins may have increased the estimated binding energy. It is clear from the results that in the gallium phthalocyanine complex there are two H-bonds between the His94 and Thr199 amino acid residues of the 4WR7 target protein. This is seen as an H-bond in the zinc complex. The H-bond appears between the zinc phthalocyanine complex and the His199 amino acid residue of the 4WR7 target protein. Both metallophthalocyanine complexes show a similar trend with the 5AML target protein and the 4WR7 target protein. However, in contrast to the interaction of complexes with 5AML target protein, polar interaction is unlike any other.</p>
