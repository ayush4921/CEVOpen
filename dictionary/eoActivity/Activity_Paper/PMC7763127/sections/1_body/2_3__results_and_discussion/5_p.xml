<p>The sulphonamides (known as strong CAIs) bind in the deprotonated form to the catalytically critical Zn (II) ion in the enzyme active site [34,35], also contributing an extensive hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions with amino acid residues of the enzyme active site, as reported in X-ray crystallographic studies of enzyme-inhibitor complexes [36]. We consider that the â€“SO3H moieties of the synthesized complexes can interact with Zn (II) ion and form the hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in the enzyme active sites.</p>
