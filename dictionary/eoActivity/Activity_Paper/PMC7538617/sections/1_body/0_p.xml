<p>Aging is a progressive and multi-step degeneration in the physiological functions and metabolic processes of living organisms until death. It represents the main risk factors for a number of debilitating diseases and contributes to increase in mortality (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahadi et al., 2020</xref>). With increasing life expectancy, the number of patients with aging related diseases will continue to rise, leading to an increased healthcare burden. There is a need for new therapies to treat this growing number of patients in a manner that is effective and sustainable (
