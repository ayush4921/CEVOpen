<p>Heart failure (HF) is the terminal state of all cardiovascular diseases, and there is limited effective drug up to now (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">McMurray et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Triposkiadis et al., 2019</xref>). The discovery of potential drugs for the treatment of heart failure from medicinal plants is of great clinical value.

 <italic>Qishen Granule</italic> (an effective Chinese medicine for treating heart failure) on the release of splenic monocytes, the recruitment of monocytes into heart tissues and the differentiation of macrophages under ischemic conditions. The authors reported that compounds of Chinese medicine have synergistic effects on cardiac and splenic organs through regulating differentiation of monocytes/macrophages in inhibiting myocardial remodeling.

 <italic>Shenfu injection</italic> (SFI) has been widely used for the treatment of shock and HF in China. The study by

 <italic>Yixinshu Capsules</italic> (YXSC) are widely used in China for the treatment of heart failure (HF) with better clinical efficacy, but the therapeutic mechanisms are not well understood. In the study by
