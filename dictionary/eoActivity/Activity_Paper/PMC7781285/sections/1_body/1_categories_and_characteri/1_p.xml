<p>The ATMPs consist of three basic categories of products: 1) gene therapy (gene therapy medicinal products (GTMPs)); 2) somatic cell therapies (as defined in part IV of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC) [
 <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; and 3) tissue engineering products, as well as any combination of the above. These are products that use human cells and tissues which have undergone gene or other treatment or modification in the laboratory and are not fully covered by the Directive 2004/23/EC [
 <xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The donor and the recipient of the cells/tissues may be the same individual (autologous use) or different (allogeneic use) (
