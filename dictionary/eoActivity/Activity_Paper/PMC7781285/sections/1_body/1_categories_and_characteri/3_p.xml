<p>Tissue engineered products belong to the CBMPs category and have been developed to structurally repair various tissue damages (e.g., cornea, cardiac or hepatic tissue, blood vessels, cartilage or bone). These types of cellular therapies are sometimes associated with structural components that promote the formation of a three-dimensional tissue structure which leads to favorable cellular interactions. The active substance of these products may be an immature cell population (e.g., stem cell progenitor cells) or a differentiated stem cell population, which will form the final tissue (e.g., skin) [
