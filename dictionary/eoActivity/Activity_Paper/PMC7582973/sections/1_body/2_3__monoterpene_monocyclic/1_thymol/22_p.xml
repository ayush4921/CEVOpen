<p>Various thymol derivatives were isolated from the aerial part of 
 <italic>Inula wissmanniana</italic> Hand.-Mazz. All compounds were tested for their anti-inflammatory activities against LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. 8-Hydroxy-7,9-di-isobutyryloxythymol 
 <bold>60</bold> and 7-hydroxy-8,9-bis(isobutyryloxy)thymol 
 <bold>61</bold> show moderate activities, with IC
