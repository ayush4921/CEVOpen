<p>Henry and co-workers synthesized seven new alkyl 4-oxobutanoate derivatives of thymol 
 <bold>67</bold> and screened them for tyrosinase inhibitory activity using mushroom tyrosinase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f014">Figure 14</xref>). Generally, the alkyl 4-oxobutanoate derivatives exhibit better inhibitory effects than the ethyl thymol 4-oxobutanoic acids. The data demonstrated the correlations between the structure of the alkyl side chain and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. The best results were obtained for esters containing three or four carbon atoms in the alkyl chain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values range from 102.3 to 191.4 Î¼M [
