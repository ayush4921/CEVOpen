<p>Swain et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] synthesized 12 substituted aryl-azo-thymol derivatives. Antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar-well diffusion against isolated MRSA, ESBL-producing pathogenic bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>), and antifungal resistant fungi (
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>), in vitro. Among all derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>33–35</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f009">Figure 9</xref>) have significant antibacterial and antifungal activities with MICs ranging from 40 to 80 μM. The docking scores of derivatives were −8.27 to −11.44 kcal/mol, against four bacterial targets and −9.45 to −12.49 kcal/mol against two fungal targets. Thus, as demonstrated by in vitro and silico studies, thymol derivatives are efficient in control over MRSA, ESBL-producing bacteria. A study conducted by Kaur et al. suggested that the compound 4,4′-((sulfonylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(diazene-2,1-diyl))bis(2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) 
 <bold>36</bold> shows moderate antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and
