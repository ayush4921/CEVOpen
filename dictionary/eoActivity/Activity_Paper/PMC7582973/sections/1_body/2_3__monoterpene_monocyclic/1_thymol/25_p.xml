<p>Another group of researchers synthesized novel oxypropanolamines containing thymol structure 
 <bold>65</bold> and 
 <bold>66</bold> and evaluated their inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glycosidase, cytosolic carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms (hCA I and II), and acetylcholinesterase enzymes (AChE) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f014">Figure 14</xref>). The results demonstrated that all compounds effectively inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-glycosidase, hCA I and II, and AChE enzymes (with Ki values in the range of 63.85–851.05 μM for 
 <italic>α</italic>-glycosidase, 1.11–17.34 μM and 2.97–17.83 μM for hCA I and hCA II, respectively, and 13.58–31.45 μM for AChE). Furthermore, the authors concluded that derivatives 
 <bold>66a</bold>-
 <bold>c</bold> exhibited the most significant antibacterial activity on 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains among all the tested compounds [
