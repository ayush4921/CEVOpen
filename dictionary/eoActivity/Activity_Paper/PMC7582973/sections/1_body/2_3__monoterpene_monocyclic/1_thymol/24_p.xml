Among the thymol derivatives, 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl (4-nitrophenyl)carbamate

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f014">Figure 14</xref>) shows the strongest inhibition against AChE with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.50 μM. Moreover, insignificant cell death and nontoxicity at 0.07–10 μM in H4IIE hepatoma cell toxicity assay was found.
