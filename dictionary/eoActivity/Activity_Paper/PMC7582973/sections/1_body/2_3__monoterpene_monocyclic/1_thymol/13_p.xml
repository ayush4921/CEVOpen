<p>The antioxidant activity of thymol is attributed to its phenolic structure and its redox properties, which play an essential role in the adsorbing and neutralizing of free radicals or decomposing peroxides. A wide range of thymol derivatives was explored for structure-radical scavenging activity. By comparing the structural properties of thymol derivatives, their antioxidant activity was explained by the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Three thymol derivatives, 8,10-dihydroxy-9-isobutyryloxythymol 
 <bold>42</bold>, 8-methoxy-9-hydroxythymol 
 <bold>43</bold>, and 8,9-dehydro-10-hydroxythymol 
 <bold>44</bold>, were isolated from Zataria multiflora extract. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was evaluated with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Compound 
 <bold>44</bold> has higher antioxidant potential with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 62.5 Î¼M and BDE = 79.2 kcal/mol. These results show that the presence of an unsaturated double bond is the main factor that determines the antioxidant activity of the investigated compounds (
