<p>The aromatic esters of thymol 
 <bold>63</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f014">Figure 14</xref>) were obtained, and their inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, and larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was evaluated. The presence of a benzoate group containing electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring resulted in the inactivation of the compound against the mosquito larvae, while thymol 4-methoxybenzoate 
 <bold>63e</bold> with electron-donating group exhibits much better activity [
