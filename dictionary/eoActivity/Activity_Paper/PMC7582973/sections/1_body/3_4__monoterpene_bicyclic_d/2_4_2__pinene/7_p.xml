The obtained compounds were evaluated for their antitumor in vitro activities, and the results demonstrated that most target compounds showed potent antiproliferative activities against three human cancer cell lines. Especially, compound 4-(2-(2-(6,6-dimethyl-3-(4-nitrobenzylidene)bicyclo[3.1.1] heptan-2-ylidene)hydrazinyl)thiazol-4-yl)phenol (R
