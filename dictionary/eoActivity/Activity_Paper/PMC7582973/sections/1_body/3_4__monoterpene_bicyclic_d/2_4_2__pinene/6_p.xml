<p>Thiosemicarbazones, containing thiourea moiety, show significant biological—particularly anticancer—activities. Wang and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] designed and synthesized a collection of nopinone-based thiosemicarbazone derivatives 
 <bold>87</bold> as potent antineoplastic agents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f020">Figure 20</xref>). Most of those thiosemicarbazones demonstrate considerable cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SMMC-7721, and Hela). Among thiosemicarbazone derivatives, the compound with phenyl group substituted at the amino position (R
 <sub>2</sub> = Ph) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-electron-donating group (R
 <sub>1</sub> = OMe) exhibits the most potent antiproliferative activity against the tested cancer cell lines with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.79 ± 0.38, 2.64 ± 0.17 and 3.64 ± 0.13 μM, respectively, and low cytotoxicity on human normal embryo lung fibroblasts (Hlf-1).
