<p>Szakonyi and co-workers reported on the synthesis of (–)-myrtenal-based 1,2,4- and 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives. All prepared compounds along with their amidoxime type intermediates were screened in vitro for their antiproliferative activities against four human malignant cell lines using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. 
 <italic>O</italic>-Acylated amidoxime

 <sub>50</sub> values comparable to those of reference agent cisplatin. However, this molecule exhibited lower antiproliferative activities against the triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) than other cell lines used in gynecology. Unfortunately, the other compounds
