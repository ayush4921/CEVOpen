<p>Adamantane derivatives containing N atoms at the bridging positions manifested analgesic activity in vivo tests. Suslov’s group prepared a series of new compounds linking diazaadamantane and monoterpene moieties such as substituted 5,7-dimethyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-ones, which were vastly potent analogs of analgesic. The results showed that analgesic activity was completely lost if the 5- and 7-alkyl substituents were lengthened by one or two CH
 <sub>2</sub> groups in 5,7-dialkyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-ones substituted with monoterpenoids in the aminal position

 <bold>76a</bold> with a 6-OH instead of the carbonyl group was found to be active in the visceral pain test and it does not show analgesic activity for tactile pain, while the reduction in the ketone to methylene group in diazaadamantane 
 <bold>76b</bold> with (–)-myrtenal in the aminal position of the heteroadamantane structure affected the loss of analgesic properties in both tests (
