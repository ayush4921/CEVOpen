<p>Suslov and co-workers synthesized a few new nitrogen-containing compounds with adamantane and myrtenal framework and studied the anxiolytic activity of the obtained products in male Balb/C mice in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. The results of this investigation showed that

 <bold>72</bold> was tested in vitro for antiviral activity against the influenza virus A/California/07/09 (H1N1)pdm09. The results indicated that the introduction of a myrtenal fragment led to an increase in the antiviral activity of adamantylamine derivatives against the adamantylamine resistant virus: The selectivity index of the majority of the synthesized amines was higher than that of rimantadine and amantadine [

 <bold>73</bold> was synthesized from 1-aminoadamantane and (–)-myrtenal and its cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells CEM-13, MT-4, and U-937 was studied. Adamantylamine 
 <bold>73</bold> revealed a high activity against all tumor lines used (CTD
 <sub>50</sub> = 12–21 µM) along with low toxicity for MDCK cells (CTD
 <sub>50</sub> = 1500 µM). Furthermore, no genotoxic effect on normal cells was observed [
