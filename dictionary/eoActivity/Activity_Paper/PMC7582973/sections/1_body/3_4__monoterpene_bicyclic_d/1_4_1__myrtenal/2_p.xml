<p>1,2,4-Triazole derivatives are antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antituberculosis, and herbicidal properties [

 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A series of novel myrtenal-based 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-thioethers were synthesized by Duan and co-workers and tested as antifungal agents [

 <italic>cucumerinum</italic>), apple root spot (
 <italic>Physalospora piricola</italic>), tomato early blight (
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>), speckle on peanut (
 <italic>Cercospora arachidicola</italic>), and wheat scab (
 <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>) at 50 Î¼g/mL. It was found that myrtenal-based compounds

 <bold>70b</bold>, 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-

 <bold>70a</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f016">Figure 16</xref>) exhibit excellent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>P. piricola</italic> with inhibition rates of 98.2%, 96.4%, and 90.7%, respectively, showing better or comparable antifungal activity than that of the commercial fungicide azoxystrobin with an inhibition rate of 96.0%, which served as a positive control. Most of the target compounds have more enhanced activities than myrtenal, indicating that the incorporation of 1,2,4-triazole-thioether moiety into the myrtenal molecule was favorable to the increase of antifungal activity.
