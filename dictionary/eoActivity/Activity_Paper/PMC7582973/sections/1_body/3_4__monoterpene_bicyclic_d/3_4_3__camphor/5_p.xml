<p>Other (+)-camphor derivatives, having two bicyclic monoterpene elements, two imine groups, and additionally two quaternary atoms in their structures connected with various lengths of the alkyl chain (

 <bold>97</bold> and nonyl 
 <bold>98</bold> aliphatic chains are very efficient in inhibiting the influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 reproduction. Bis-quaternary ammonium bromide with a dodecyl alkyl chain 
 <bold>99</bold> has the highest activity for the CEM-13 cells. The results suggest that tested dimeric bis-quaternary ammonium salts 
 <bold>97</bold>â€“
 <bold>99</bold> might be used as components of drugs for suppressing malignant tumor development.
