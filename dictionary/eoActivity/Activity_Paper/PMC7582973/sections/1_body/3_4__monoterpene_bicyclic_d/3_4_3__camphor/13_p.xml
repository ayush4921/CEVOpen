 <bold>129a</bold> and triazole 
 <bold>129g</bold> moieties exhibit the highest inhibitory activity towards the Ebola virus glycoprotein, with the effectiveness level comparable to that of the reference drug. The excellent results presented in this paper allow us to predict that subsequent monoterpene bicyclic derivatives might be efficient inhibitors of especially dangerous viral infections.
