<p>An interesting series of works on the topic of (+)-camphor-based imine derivatives is presented by Sokolova et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The authors pointed up a very efficient antiviral activity of synthesized monoterpene derivatives. In their 2017 work [
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], designed compounds were prepared from commercially available natural (+)-camphor and various amines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f024">Figure 24</xref>), whereas the procedures for the monoterpene derivatives were simple and reproducible. The prepared compounds were tested in vitro for antiviral activity. Most of those (+)-camphor-based imine derivatives—especially 
 <bold>94</bold> and 
 <bold>95</bold>—were capable of inhibiting the drug-resistant strains of influenza A virus subtypes A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and A/California/07/09 of H1N1pdm09. Analysis of the structure–activity relationship showed that the virus-inhibiting properties are strongly dependent on the length of an imine-conjugated moiety: Compounds with a shorter chain display higher activity, whereas the suppressing action of those aliphatic (+)-camphor imines with long aliphatic chains is lower.
