<p>Another example of the camphor amide derivatives is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f029">Figure 29</xref>. Those heterocyclics were tested as potential vaccinia virus (VV) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Bioassay results revealed that synthesized amides with 4-methylpiperidine 
 <bold>113a</bold> and morpholine 
 <bold>114b</bold> fragments show the best inhibitory activity against VV with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.5 and 7.5 ÂµM, respectively, with low cytotoxicity.
