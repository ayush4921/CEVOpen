<p>A series of hybrid molecules based on (+)-camphor derivatives and quinolizidine alkaloid (–)-cytisine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f030">Figure 30</xref>) were presented by Artyushin et. al. [
 <xref rid="B99-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and tested for their cytotoxicity and virus-inhibiting activity. It was proven that the antiviral activity is affected by the length and nature of linkers between cytisine and (+)-camphor moieties. Compound 
 <bold>117d</bold>, which contains the cytisine fragment separated from triazole ring by –C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>– aliphatic linker shows the highest activity with relatively low toxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 168 μmol, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8 μmol, SI = 20). Its selectivity index appears higher than that of the commonly known reference compound: Rimantadine.
