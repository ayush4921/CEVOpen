<p>Another example presents various (–)-borneol and (–)-isoborneol (with different stereochemistries of the hydroxyl group) derivatives bearing a morpholine fragment as potential inhibitors of the influenza A virus (

The structure–activity analysis of those heterocyclic (–)-borneol derivatives revealed that a bulky lipophilic unit in the form of 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan scaffold is required to obtain high results of antiviral activity.
