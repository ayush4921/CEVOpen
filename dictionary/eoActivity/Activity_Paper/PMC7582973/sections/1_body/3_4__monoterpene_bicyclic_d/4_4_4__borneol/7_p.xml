<p>Another work showing a new (–)-borneol ester derivative [

 <italic>R</italic>)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl) 2,4-diphenylcyclobutane-1,3-dicarboxylate 
 <bold>131</bold> using 
 <italic>α</italic>-truxillic acid and monoterpenoid bicyclic (–)-borneol as the substrates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f035">Figure 35</xref>). The new terpene compound obtained by Sokolova et al. exhibits a considerable analgesic activity. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Truxillic acid (tested for the same dose) does not show analgesic activity, thus the monoterpenoid fragment is a structurally important element of the molecule, influencing its activity.
