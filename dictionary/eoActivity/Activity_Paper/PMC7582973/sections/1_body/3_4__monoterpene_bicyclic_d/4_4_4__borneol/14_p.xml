<p>Over 170 natural derivatives were screened in search of currently no approved antiviral therapy of Marburg virus disease (MVD) [
 <xref rid="B117-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The (–)-bornyl ester derivatives containing saturated 
 <italic>N</italic>-heterocycles exhibited the highest antiviral activity and can specifically inhibit MarV entry with the efficiency being comparable to that of the previously described verapamil. (–)-Borneol itself is not active against both tested pseudotypes. Among low-toxic (–)-borneol derivatives, some of the compounds inter alia 
 <bold>138</bold>–
 <bold>141</bold> turned out to be relatively specific inhibitors of MarV-GP mediated infection (SC &gt; 10). Compound 
 <bold>139</bold> containing a methylpiperidine moiety exhibits the highest virus-specific activity, which is twice as high as that of the reference.
