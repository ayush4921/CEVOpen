 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f036">Figure 36</xref>), was studied as an inhibitor of the main human isoenzymes involved in the biotransformation of ester-containing drugs: hCES1 and hCES2 [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The tested ester derivative of natural occurring (–)-borneol with the hydrazinylidene group is more active and selective against hCES1 than against hCES2. This compound inhibits hCES1 with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.098 ± 0.008 μM and has inhibitory activities against hCES2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.10 ± 0.18 μM.
