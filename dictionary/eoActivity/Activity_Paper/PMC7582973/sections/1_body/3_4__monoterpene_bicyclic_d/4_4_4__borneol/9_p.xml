<p>It is commonly known that heterocyclic compounds and their various derivatives due to their beneficial biological, pharmacological, and medical properties have attracted great attention from medicinal chemistry. Commonly mentioned examples are derivatives of benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole, which possess a wide range of biological effects, mainly antiulcer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral activity, antihypertensive, and analgesic [

On the other hand, the presence of 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane scaffold of designed molecules induces many biological activities of prepared compounds, for instance high inhibitory activity of molecules on the replication of influenza A virus [

Hence, works where the compounds containing those two structural elements are broadly tested and significant biological activity are demonstrated. Importantly, most of such structural features of terpene-heterocyclic molecules also possess ester linker (
