<p>The presented set of aliphatic and aromatic esters of (–)-borneol derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f034">Figure 34</xref>) was also tested by the same research group for their antiproliferative and antioedematogenic properties [
 <xref rid="B108-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>130c</bold> and 
 <bold>130d</bold> show a pronounced cytostatic activity against various tumor cell lines, which makes them useful models for the development of alternative drugs that might be effective and highly promising in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, compound 
 <bold>130d</bold> [(1
 <italic>S</italic>,2
 <italic>R</italic>,4
 <italic>S</italic>)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl benzoate] shows potential antioedematogenic activity being effective in the reduction of oedematogenic response in all evaluated periods. This aromatic ester of (–)-borneol derivative might be useful in the development of new antiinflammatory drugs.
