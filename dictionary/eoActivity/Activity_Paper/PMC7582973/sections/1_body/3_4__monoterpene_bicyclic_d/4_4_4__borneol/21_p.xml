<p>Another concept for creating an interesting biomaterial based on the (–)-borneol component is graphene oxide-borneol (GOB) composite [
 <xref rid="B125-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>], which can be synthesized by esterification of (–)-borneol with thiomalic-acid-modified graphene oxide (GO) sheets, of which thiomalic acid is used as the linker molecule to increase the number of surface carboxyl groups. GOB exhibits antifungal adhesion and growth inhibition. It was proven that the carbon stereochemistry of the GOB was essential for the powerful antifungal performance while the covalent banding between GO and borneol molecules ensured its safe and long-term antifungal characteristics.
