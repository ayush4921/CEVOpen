<p>A large set of monoterpene derivatives that belong to the group of (–)-borneol esters were designed, synthesized, and examined with a view to their antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Desired compounds were prepared by the conventional and microwave-assisted methodology and the obtained (–)-borneol derivatives contained various aliphatic and aromatic moieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f034">Figure 34</xref>); all of them (
 <bold>130</bold>) were tested for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. Interestingly, among all examined monoterpene esters only those with methoxylated aromatic substituents (
 <bold>130a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>) show noteworthy microbiological results. The antimicrobial assays confirmed that compounds 
 <bold>130a</bold>, 
 <bold>130b</bold>, and 
 <bold>130c</bold> exhibit promising antibacterial activity for some microorganisms, which is comparable to commonly used standard—ampicillin (MIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.5 µM). Bornyl 3′,4′-dimethoxybenzoate 
 <bold>130b</bold> shows high antimicrobial activity against all tested bacteria and fungus.
