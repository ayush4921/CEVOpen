<p>The increased strength of activity is observed by supplement functionalized moiety (e.g., heterocyclic unit introduced into thymol, camphor, or borneol derivatives) or special group, like an ester group in borneol derivatives, or an imino group in camphor derivatives. Nowadays, this is a promising route as this is of utmost importance to utilize natural substances for discovering new compounds and to search for practical uses for the newly obtained materials. As presented in this paper, monoterpenes exhibit a large variety of biological activities that can be exploited in various branches of medicine and pharmacy. This review highlights the use of the selected beneficial monoterpenes and their derivatives for the treatment of various diseases. It should be mentioned that alongside the biological activities presented in this paper, the substances play important roles in preventing and remediating other diseases such as those of the heart and diabetes. Obtaining new structures based on monoterpene compounds is a dynamically developing area, and one should expect new interesting biological applications, as well as modifications to structures that will improve current results in biological research.</p>
