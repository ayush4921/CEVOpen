<p>A crucial benefit from using described compounds is that their resource is almost inexhaustible, which has also ensured their wide application in industry. Moreover, the use of monoterpenoids to design drugs often reduces the toxicity of the resulting compound, which is an important factor when considering the possible utilization and manufacture of new compounds. It is widely known that chemical modification of natural substances with various components is an important method for obtaining new biologically active compounds. This feature is particularly visible in the monoterpene derivatives presented in this review. Their biological activities are often much superior to the parent substances (monoterpenes); furthermore, they often exceed the commonly used standards in specialized areas of research.</p>
