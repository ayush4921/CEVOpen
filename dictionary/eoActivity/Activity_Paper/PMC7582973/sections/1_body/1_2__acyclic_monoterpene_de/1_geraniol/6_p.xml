<p>Biofouling that occurs on the surface of submerged objects, which causes technical and economic problems mainly in the marine industry, but also in many biotechnological processes, is a stimulus to the design and synthesis of effective, safe, and at the same time environmentally benign antifouling compounds. Motivated by these challenges Takamura’s research group designed and synthesized a hybrid of molecules containing geraniol and butanolide moieties [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A set of prepared geraniol derivatives consists of eight various molecules 
 <bold>13</bold>, some representatives of this series (
 <bold>14–17</bold>) are included in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Biological evaluation of presented geraniol-butanolide hybrid compounds 
 <bold>13</bold> proved that those molecules exhibit antifouling activity against the cypris larvae of the barnacle 
 <italic>Balanus amphitrite</italic> (Darwin, 1854), having the values of EC
 <sub>50</sub> within the range of 0.30–1.31 μM. Since most of those compounds, 
 <bold>13</bold> show low or no toxicity geraniol derivatives might be successfully applied as antifouling agents.
