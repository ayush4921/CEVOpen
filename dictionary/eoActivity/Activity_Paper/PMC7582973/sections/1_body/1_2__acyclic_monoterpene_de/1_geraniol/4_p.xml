<p>Chavez et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed interesting results regarding biologically active geraniol derivatives. A large series of geranylated phenol/methoxyphenol compounds were synthesized to test them in vitro as inhibitor agents of mycelial growth of 
 <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic>. It turned out that geranylated derivatives containing two hydroxyl groups attached to the aromatic ring, or one of them exchanged by a methoxy group, are the most efficient inhibitors. Some selected structures from the set studied by Chavez et al. are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f004">Figure 4</xref> (compounds 
 <bold>3–8</bold>). Importantly, the activity of those derivatives is as effective as that of Metalaxil
 <sup>®</sup>, a commonly known commercial fungicide, used as an inhibitor of mycelial growth of 
 <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic>. Some of the discussed compounds are also active against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, which makes them possibly useful for biotechnological purposes since they may control the infection with more than one pathogen.
