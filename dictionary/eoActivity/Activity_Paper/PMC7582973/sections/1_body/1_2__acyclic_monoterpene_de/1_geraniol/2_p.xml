<p>A series of 3-oxo-2-tolylhydrazinylidene-4,4,4-trifluorobutanoates containing higher or natural alcohol moieties in their structures were designed and synthesized in response to the need for effective and selective inhibitors of carboxylesterase (CES) [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ester derivative of naturally occurring geraniol is one of them and it proved to be a highly active and selective inhibitor of hCES2, blocking the enzyme within the nanomolar range (IC
 <sub>50</sub> to ca. 5 nM). Geranyl (2

 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f003">Figure 3</xref>) show radical-scavenging properties and low acute toxicity, which is why the tested ester derivative of geraniol 
 <bold>1</bold> has a great potential as a biomedicinal inhibitor.
