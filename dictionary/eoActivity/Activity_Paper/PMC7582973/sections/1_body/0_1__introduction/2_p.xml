<p>Functionalization of natural compounds exhibiting native biological activity is one of the most efficient approaches for the synthesis of biologically active substances in medicinal chemistry. This explains, inter alia, why the studies of terpenes and their derivatives are interesting and relevant. Consequently, there is growing body of literature regarding new modifications to these fascinating natural compounds and the corresponding biological and medical applications. Despite the importance of this class of compounds, there are limited reviews on the biological and pharmacological properties of monoterpene derivatives [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, we considered it appropriate to provide a review of selected monoterpene derivatives and their diverse therapeutic activities. We pay particular attention to the structural changes in monoterpenes and the introduction of special groups that increase the biological activity of the studied derivatives. We focus on structural modifications of geraniol (representative of acyclic monoterpenes), thymol (representative of monoterpene monocycles), myrtenal, pinene, camphor, and borneol (representatives of monoterpene bicycles); see
