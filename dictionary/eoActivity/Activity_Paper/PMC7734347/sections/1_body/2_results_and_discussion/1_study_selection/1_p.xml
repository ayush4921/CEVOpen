<p>A total of 183 studies were found from the database search, and 11 additional articles were identified from other sources. After removing the duplicates, 125 articles were shortlisted, and after titleâ€“abstract screening, 57 articles were excluded because of the following reasons: The articles were published in languages other than English (n = 4), the articles are non-experimental journal articles (n = 10), and the articles reported on the effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> other than antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (n = 43). By full-text screening of the remaining 68 articles, a total of 41 articles were eliminated based on the following exclusion criteria: study models used are not accepted as evidence for pharmacological effects (n = 25), study intervention does not focus on 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> (n = 1), and a combination of both exclusion criteria (n = 15). Thus, 27 articles from year 2002 to 2020 were selected in the final qualitative analysis of this systematic review. Three potential dissertations and theses were accessed through the two databases. Only one of the theses was selected, but the result presented in the theses has been published in one of the article selected in this review (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon et al., 2010</xref>). Other two theses were excluded because they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. A flowchart depicting the search process and study selection is presented in
