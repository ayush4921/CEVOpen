<p>Lipid peroxidation is a reaction of oxygen with unsaturated lipids that successively results in the production of oxidation products, including lipid peroxyl radicals and hydroperoxides. Among a wide variety of oxidation products from lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA) appears to be the most mutagenic product (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic>,

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al. (2019)</xref> both studied on 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> using identical treatment methods and diabetic mice models. The results of the study by 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2015)</xref> showed a significant inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder on lipid peroxidation at treatment doses as low as 1.2% of diet. However, only 10% lyophilized powder diet was able to exert significant inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the study by 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al. (2019)</xref>. This variation between findings could be due to the phytochemical or bioactivity variations that possibly correlated to intrinsic factors (age of the plant and part of the plant used) and extrinsic factors (geographical climate, nature of soil, season, and processing methods).
