<p>Five studies used the methanol extracts of 
 <italic>G. procumbens, G. pseudochina</italic> and 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> to investigate their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities in HeLa cells (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yuandani et al., 2017</xref>), murine macrophages (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Seow et al., 2014</xref>). As a continuation study of 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon et al. (2010)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon and Heinrich (2011)</xref> as well as 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yuandani et al. (2017)</xref> isolated compounds from the methanol extract of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> and determined their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects in HeLa cells or macrophages. The extraction of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> with 80% methanol at a temperature below 60Â°C would give greater retention of the total phenolic content (TPC) and greater expression of free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akowuah et al., 2009</xref>). Methanol was also identified as a more effective extraction solvent of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> compared to 95% ethanol and water extracts based on its higher TPC and FRSA (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akowuah et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Sukadeetad et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated a higher chlorogenic acid content in 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> leaf extract by microwave drying as well as good efficiency for recovering phenolic compounds by extraction with 50% (v/v) methanol. However, ethanol extract was used in this study for successive bioassays by considering ethanol as a safer solvent for health product application.
