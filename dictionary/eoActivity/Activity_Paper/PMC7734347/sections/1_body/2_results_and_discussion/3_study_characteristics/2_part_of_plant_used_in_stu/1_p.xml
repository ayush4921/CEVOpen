<p>Twenty selected studies used the leaves of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> to investigate their pharmacological effects. 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nazri et al. (2019)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al. (2019)</xref> used the whole plant of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2015)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2019)</xref> used the leaf and stem parts of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Iskander et al. (2002)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al. (2019)</xref> used the aerial part of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic>, and 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu M. et al. (2019)</xref> did not mention the part of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> used in their study. Hence, the leaf is the dominant part of the plant used in all selected research studies. Notably, the part of the plant that is usually consumed is the leaf. However, compared to the other parts of the plant, the root extract of both 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> and 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> exhibited the highest phenolic content, flavonoid content, ascorbic acid content, and antioxidant capacities (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan et al., 2015</xref>). Mice with intraperitoneal injection of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> leaf extract at 25, 50, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day for four days survived until day 30 of post-injection with no signs of toxicity such as diarrhea, excess urination, and lethargy (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Vejanan et al., 2012</xref>). On the basis of the study by 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Zahra et al. (2011)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Shwter et al. (2014)</xref>, no mortality, or organ toxicity was detected in the animals that were orally administered 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> leaf extract at doses of 2 and 5 g/kg for 14 days. The study carried out by 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Algariri et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that the leaf extract of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> was safe, with no observed acute toxicity effects as there was no treatment-related mortality at 2 g/kg throughout the 14 days observation period. Hence, the oral lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract for rats was determined to be greater than 2,000 mg/kg, and the acceptable daily intake was 700 mg/kg/day. The same study also showed that consumption of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract for 28 days did not lead to sub-chronic toxicity as no abnormal behavior, disease, or death was observed in the animal model that received the plant extract. Administration of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> leaf extract at 1,000–5,000 mg/kg did not cause mortality or significant changes in the general behavior, bodyweight, or organ gross appearance of rats (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Rosidah et al., 2009</xref>). At the same time, 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> and 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> leaf extracts both showed a negligible level of toxicity when administered orally at 300, 2,000, and 5,000 mg/kg for 14 days (
