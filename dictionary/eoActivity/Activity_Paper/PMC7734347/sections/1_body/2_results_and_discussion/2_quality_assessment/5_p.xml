<p>On the basis of the risk of bias score in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, under the domain “other sources of bias,” five studies (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon and Heinrich, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al., 2018</xref>) were rated as “definitely high” risk of bias because of the unclear or absence of statistical analysis. This finding raised the validity of the interpretations of these studies in question because the claimed significant results are possibly misinterpreted under errors of statistical analysis. Hence, the erroneous statistical methods may contribute to false positive findings and may successively become misleading literature. Under the domain “Detection bias,” 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Iskander et al. (2002)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al. (2018)</xref> were rated as definitely high risk of bias because the outcome assessment methods used were insensitive to indicate antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects.
