<p>From harvesting to manufacturing, the quality of herbal medicines can be affected by vast factors. Quality evaluation of medicinal plants is possible by detecting the presence of chemical markers within a sample (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Qualitative chemical evaluation covers identification and characterization of phytochemical constituents in the medicinal plants through different analytical techniques. Phytochemical screening techniques involve botanical identification, extraction with suitable solvents, purification, and characterization of the active constituents of pharmaceutical importance (

Chromatographic methods such as thin-layer chromatography/high-performance TLC (TLC/HP-TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which are the most commonly used chemical techniques in the identification and quality assessment of medicinal plant ingredients, have provided characteristic qualitative and quantitative patterns of the constituents. Spectroscopic techniques, including UV, IR, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), allow the quantitation of single or multiple compounds that share similarities in their UV absorbance, thus providing a more holistic view of herbal medicines in contrast to the quantitation of a single compound (
