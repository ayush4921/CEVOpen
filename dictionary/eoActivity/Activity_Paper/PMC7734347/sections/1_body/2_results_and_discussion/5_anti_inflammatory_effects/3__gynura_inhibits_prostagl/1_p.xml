<p>Prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) is a bioactive lipid that physiologically mediates the regulation of immune responses, blood pressure, gastrointestinal integrity, and fertility. However, the sequential actions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) catalyze PGE
 <sub>2</sub> synthesis. Consequently, dysregulated PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production has been correlated to a variety of pathological conditions, such as chronic inflammation (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> essential oil and its active ingredients. Both 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> essential oil and its active ingredients were showing similar COX-2 inhibitory effects as that of the positive control drug diclofenac diethylamine emulgel (

 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> extract inhibited PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production and COX-2 protein expression and activity in activated macrophages (

 <sub>2</sub> production was also inhibited using the extract of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina var. hispida</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 25.23 μg/ml (
