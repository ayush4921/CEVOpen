<p>The reporting completeness of the material used by each selected study was assessed using the information of the 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species material, voucher specimens, report on quality control of extract and chemical analysis. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by two investigators based on the OHAT guideline for any potential bias such as selection bias, performance bias, attrition or exclusion bias, detection bias, selection reporting bias, and other sources of bias. However, some of the questions in the bias assessment were excluded as they were not applicable for use in the assessment of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and human randomized control study designs.
