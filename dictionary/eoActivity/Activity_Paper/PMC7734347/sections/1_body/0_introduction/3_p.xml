<p>Incorporation of a plant-based natural antioxidant in daily diet can prevent several human illnesses (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Knekt et al., 1996</xref>) as the prevalence of many illness is inversely linked to the dietary consumption of antioxidant-rich foods (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Sies, 1993</xref>). For any herb to be developed into a dietary supplement, it is essential that the evidence for the claimed effects of the herb is scientifically demonstrated. Ideally, the mechanisms of action should also be understood. The potential use of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> as a phytomedicine with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties has been well documented, but we were unable to identify specific review articles that focused on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species. This review was undertaken to assess published experimental data that investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species to support the design of future studies. It also provided an evaluation of the quality of available information, summarized mechanisms of action data from animal and cell studies following the administration of the 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species, and identified research gaps in the literature.
