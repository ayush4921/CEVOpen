<p>Inflammation refers to a complex array of defensive immune responses (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Arulselvan et al., 2016</xref>), and tissue damage is one of the consequences of an exaggerated or uncontrolled prolonged inflammatory process (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, 2016</xref>). Inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, generate free radicals at the inflammation site, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) act as both signaling molecules and inflammation mediators. Enhancement of pro-inflammatory gene expression can be achieved via the initiation of the intracellular signaling cascade by reactive species. The exaggerated generation of reactive species in pathological inflammatory conditions may induce localized oxidative stress and tissue injury, thus promoting progression of many inflammatory diseases (
