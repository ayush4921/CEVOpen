<p>Traditionally, the quantitative kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions have been studied in terms of the correlation between initial rates and substrate concentrations according to the hyperbolic Michaelis–Menten equation. Although direct analysis that use Michaelis–Menten equation is easy to perform by various nonlinear regression curve-fitting programmes, the initial-velocity measurements still require a high number of individual experiments, due to the high sensitivity of the reaction rates to noise
