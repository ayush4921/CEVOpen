<p>As our study was designed only for the development of simple and quick methodology for determination of PON1 kinetic characteristics, we selected leftover routine blood samples of six healthy blood-donors. Since the biological material used in this report were obtained from leftover routine specimens, and the samples were not used for any other particular study, informed consent from volunteers and ethical approval was unnecessary because the samples were no longer traceable.</p>
