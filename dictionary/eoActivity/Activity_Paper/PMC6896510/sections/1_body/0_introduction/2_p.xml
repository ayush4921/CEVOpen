<p>The most convenient method for determining PON1-status and functional phenotype is based on 2-dimensional enzyme activity plot that displays rates of diazoxonase versus paraoxonase activity

 </xref>. As this 2-substrate assay/plot technique involves the use of two highly toxic organophosphates, identification and characterisation of non-toxic discriminatory substrates for determination of PON1 activity still excites an interest among clinical researchers

 </xref>. Although current assays may provide substantial diagnostic “PON1 status” values, they are constrained only to the specific enzyme activity measurements which are unavoidably affected by (unknown) PON1 concentration and its affinity to a substrate. Even though if one PON1 alloform has a lower limiting rate

 <sub>max</sub>, but it has higher affinity (i.e. lower Michaelis constant 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>) for a particular substrate, then the catalytic efficiency (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>/
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>) and consequently specific enzyme activity measurements of both PON1 alloforms can show nearly the same values. Further, another enzyme can form ternary complex with HDL and PON1; i.e. myeloperoxidase (MPO) which produces highly reactive oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl). MPO oxidises PON1 on tyrosine 71, a residue found that is critical for HDL binding which impairs catalytic abilities of PON1

 </xref>; i.e. substrate affinity to the enzyme active site and its turnover number. Although the latter cannot be determined when active enzyme concentration is unknown, the concentration independent

 <sub>m</sub> value can be more informative and consistent with true PON1 status. Thus, only an evaluation of complete set of PON1 kinetic parameters can provide predictive and conclusive evidence-based use of it as biomarker in health and disease.
