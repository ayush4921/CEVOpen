    "The anti-proliferative activities of Novel series of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line were explored via in-slico studies which includes Quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR, molecular docking studies, designing new compounds, and analyzing the pharmacokinetics properties of the designed compounds. From the QSAR analysis, model number one emerged the best as seen from the arithmetic assessments of (R<sup>2</sup>) = 0.6981, (R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub>) = 0.6433, (Q<sup>2</sup>) = 0.5460 and (R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>) of 0.5357. Model number one was used in designing new derivative compounds, with higher effectiveness against estrogen positive breast cancer (MCF-7 cell line). The Molecular docking studies between the derivatives and Polo-like kinases (Plk1) receptor proved that the derivatives of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones bind tightly to the receptor, thou ligand 24 and 27 had the highest binding affinities of -8.8 and - 9.1 kcal/mol, which was found to be higher than Doxorubicin with a docking score of -8.0 kcal/mol. These new derivatives of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones shall be excellent inhibitors against (plk1). The pharmacokinetics analysis performed on the new structures revealed that all the structures passed the test and also the Lipinski rule of five, and they could further proceed to pre-clinical tests. They both revealed a revolution in medicine for developing novel anti-breast cancer drugs against MCF-7 cell line."
