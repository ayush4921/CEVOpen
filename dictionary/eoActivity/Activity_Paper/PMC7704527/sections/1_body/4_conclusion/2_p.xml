<p id="Par59">The molecular docking result showed that compound 24 and 27 had the highest docking score of −8.8 and − 9.1 kcal/mol. From the research it is proved that some series of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones derivatives compounds bind tightly to the binding pose of the target, stabilizing the receptor Polo-like kinase 1(PKL1) in complex with B16727 which is proven from the complexes as seen above. The compounds would serve as the most capable inhibitors against (PKL1) and this shows a revolution in medicine to design and develop new estrogen-positive (MCF-7 cell line) breast cancer drugs.</p>
