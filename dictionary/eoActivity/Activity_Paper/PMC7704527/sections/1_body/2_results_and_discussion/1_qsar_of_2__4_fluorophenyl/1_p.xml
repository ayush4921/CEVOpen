<p id="Par33">QSAR examination was used to verify the relationship of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones derivatives with its anti-proliferative activities. Using the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) method, four QSAR equations were built to predict the anti-proliferative activities of imidazole derivatives. From both internal and external validation parameters, model number 1 passed with correlation coefficient squared (R
 <sup>2</sup>) of 0.6981, correlation coefficient adjusted squared (R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>adj</sub>) of 0.6433, cross-validation coefficient (Q
 <sup>2</sup>) of 0.5460 and external validation (R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>pred</sub>) of 0.5390. TablesÂ
