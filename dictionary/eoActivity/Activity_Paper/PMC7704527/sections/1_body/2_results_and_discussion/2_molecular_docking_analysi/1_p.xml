<p id="Par48">A summary of the relationship between some 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazole-5-ones derivatives and the receptor was shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>. The pictorial analysis of docked compounds was accessed by assessing the hydrogen bond interactions, hydrogen bond length, and hydrophobic interactions. Both 2D representations of the binding pose of compounds 24 and 27 to the active pocket of the protein target are shown in Figs.Â
