<p id="Par51">The results obtained from the QSAR analysis showed that both internal and external validation of the model were in agreement with the minimum proposed values used in assessing the equation as seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> above. The external validation of model 1 was achieved using the model parameters from the validation compounds as seen in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The effectiveness of the equation was measured by the reliability of the validation compounds and calculated pIC
 <sub>50</sub> of the calibration compounds. The biological, calculated and the residual values of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones compounds are seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The low residual values are obtained from the difference between the biological and calculated activities, showing the high prediction power of eq. 1. Both internal and external validation conforms eq. 1 to be greatly effective, strong, and extremely predictive. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> shows the definition of the model 1 parameters. The mean effect obtained from the model parameters, shows (GATS5e, MATS4e, and SpMax4_Bhs) carries a positive coefficient showing that an increase in those factors would increase the bioactivities of the derivatives while (RDF150u) carrying a negative coefficient indicates a decrease in the descriptor would also increase the experimental activities of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones derivative compounds. The statistical analysis shows that there is no much collinearity amongst the model parameters ensuring that the equation is highly robust as seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>.
