<p id="Par32">Again, the designed compounds were checked for their adaptability with Lipinski’s rule of five (Hou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>), well-used criteria to comprehend if a compound can be taken orally or not, such as molecular weight (MW) ≤ 500, octanol/water partition coefficient (AlogP) ≤ 5, number of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) ≤ 5 and number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) ≤ 10.6. According to the rule of five, a compound cannot be taken orally if it does not meet up to two or rules out of the rules of five (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>).
