<p id="Par9">The geometric optimization is executed such that the countable electronic and molecular parameters could depict the original physicochemical properties of the observed molecule. (Putri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). The derivatives were sketched using Chemdraw (V12.0.2) software in 2D format. They were then converted to 3D format and further optimized using Spartan 14 (V1.1.4) software, with the parameters, Density Functional Theory (DFT) at B3LYP, 6-31G/ basis set (Ibrahim et al.
