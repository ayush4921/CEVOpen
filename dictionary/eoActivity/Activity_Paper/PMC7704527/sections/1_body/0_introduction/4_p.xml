<p id="Par5">In the study of (Sanhaji et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>), it showed that Polo-like kinases (Plk1) causes destructive proliferation in tumor cells and strongly stimulates the development of cell circle. Plk1 overexpression allows cells to supersede barriers, causing genomic uncertainty and stimulating the alteration of mammalian cells. Plk1 was proven as amongst the utmost striking receptor for breast cancer treatment. Plk1 mediates estrogen receptor (ER) which regulates gene overexpression in human breast cancer cells. Recently, (Abo-Elanwar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>) reported novel Thirty-nine derivatives of Imidazolones connected to chalone moiety which showed a great anti-breast cancer activity against MCF-7 cell line. Imidazole and its derivatives have much significance in both natural products and synthetic molecules. The exclusive molecules have great electron-rich features which allow them to bind easily with diverse enzymes and receptors, thus showing wide anti-proliferative activities (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). Several activities such as anticancer, antimicrobial (Premakumari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>), cardio-activity, and angiotensin II receptor antagonistic activity have been described explicitly in compounds containing imidazolone moiety (Abo-Elanwar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>).
