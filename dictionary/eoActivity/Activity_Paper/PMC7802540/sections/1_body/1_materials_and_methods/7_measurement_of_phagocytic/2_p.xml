<p>The effect of HMR on macrophage phagocytosis was evaluated by neutral red uptake assay. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were dispensed into 12‐well plates and cultured until 70%–80% confluence. Then, cells were treated with HMR for 24 hr. After HMR treatment, after washing cells with 1 × PBS, 1 ml of a 0.01% neutral red solution was treated into cells for 2 hr. Then, after washing cells with 1 × PBS, the cells were observed with an optical microscope, and subsequently 1 ml of lysis buffer (ethanol acid: acetic acid = 1:1) was treated to elute the absorbed neutral red. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Human Cop., Xma‐3000PC).
