<p>After the sample treatment was completed, the RAW264.7 cells were washed 3 time with cold 1 × PBS, and then the cells were lysed for 30 min at 4°C using RIPA buffer (Boston Bio Products) containing protease inhibitor (Sigma‐Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma‐Aldrich) to extract cellular proteins from the cells. After 30 min, protein was quantified by BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a clear supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min. Then, the protein was separated by SDS‐PAGE and subsequently transferred to the PVDF membrane. After blocking the PVDF membrane for 1 hr by stirring at room temperature with a blocking buffer (5% not‐fat dry milk in Tris‐buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS‐T), the primary antibody was treated and reacted with stirring at 4°C overnight. Then, after washing PVDF membrane with TBS‐T, the secondary antibody was treated and reacted at room temperature for 1 hr. After washing PVDF membrane with TBS‐T, Chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using LI‐COR C‐DiGit Blot Scanner (Li‐COR Biosciences). The density of Western blot bands was calculated using the software UN‐SCAN‐IT gel version 5.1 (Silk Scientific Inc.).</p>
