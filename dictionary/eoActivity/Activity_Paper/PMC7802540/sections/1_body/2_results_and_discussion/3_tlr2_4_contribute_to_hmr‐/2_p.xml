<p>The immune response by macrophages begins when the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in the cell membrane of macrophages recognizes pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of external pathogens (Kawai &amp; Akira, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Russo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). It is known that Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) contribute to the early recognition of external pathogens by macrophage among PRRs of macrophages (Kawai &amp; Akira, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and TLR signaling has been reported to induce the secretion of various immunomodulators to fight external pathogens (Strieter et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Macrophages secretes various immunomodulators through activation of TLR2 and TLR4 among TLRs (Hoogerwerf et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Juarez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to the production of immunomodulators such as NO, iNOS, IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>, the inhibition of TLR2 by C29 and TLR4 by TAK‐242 reduced the production of immunomodulators by HMR when compared to the cell treated with HMR alone. In view of this result, both TLR2 and TLR4 may be thought to be receptors that contribute to the production of immunomodulators by HMR in RAW264.7 cells. Indeed, various natural products have been reported to stimulate TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages to activate the production of immunomodulators (Iwasaki &amp; Medzhitov, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Lee &amp; Hong, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In view of the above results, TLR2 and TLR4 may be thought to be important receptors involved in the production of immunomodulators by HMR in macrophages.
