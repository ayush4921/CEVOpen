<p>In cells involved in innate immunity such as macrophages, mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling is activated by PRRs such as TLRs, which is known to be associated with the production of the immunomodulators (Arthur &amp; Ley, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). It has also been reported that nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) activated by the stimulation of TLRs is an essential master regulatory signaling pathway that contributes to the production of immunomodulator by macrophages and other innate immune cells against external pathogens (Dorrington &amp; Fraser, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Kawai &amp; Akira, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). In addition to MAPKs and NF‐κB signalings, the phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling is also activated by TLRs and induces the production of various immunomodulators (Troutman et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether MAPKs, NF‐κB and PI3K/ATK signaling result in the production of immunomodulators such as iNOS, IL‐1β and TNF‐α by HMR in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the inhibitions of ERK1/2 by PD98059, p38 by SB203580, and JNK by SP600125 reduced the production of iNOS, IL‐1β and TNF‐α by HMR when compared to cells treated with HMR alone. However, when inhibitions of PI3K/AKT signaling by LY294002 and NF‐κB signaling by BAY 11–7082, there was no change in the production of immunomodulators such as iNOS, IL‐1β, and TNF‐α by HMR. Through these results, MAPKs is thought to be an important signaling involved in the production of immunomodulators by HMR in macrophages.
