  <p>Effect of HMR on macrophage activation. (a) NO level was measured using Griess assay at 24 hr after HMR treatment. (b) mRNA level was investigated using RT‐PCR at 24 hr after HMR treatment (c) Phagocytic capacity was measured using Neutral Red staining at 24 hr after HMR treatment. (d) Cell viability was measured using MTT assay at 24 hr after HMR treatment. (e) NO level or mRNA level was investigated using Griess assay and RT‐PCR at 24 hr after HMR and HML treatment, respectively. *
