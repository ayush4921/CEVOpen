 </sup>. The contents of SAN and CHE were significantly higher after the MJ treatment than after the other treatments (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 120 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E,F). Compared with those in the untreated group, the contents of SAN and CHE were increased by 10- and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E,F). In addition, treatment with SA and wounding resulted in less SAN and CHE accumulation compared with that in the MJ group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E,F). However, combined MJ and wounding enhanced SAN, CHE, PRO, and ALL production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B,E,F). Additionally, we compared the changes in alkaloid content after treatment for 120 h. The results showed that the impact of MJ increased with time. The SAN and CHE production showed a maximum of 2.54 ± 0.42 mg/g at 120 h after initiation of MJ treatment, and the combined MJ and wounding treatment produced a maximum of 1.6 ± 0.25 mg/g at 72 h after treatment, which was lower than that after the treatment with MJ alone. Finally, we found that 3 treatments (MJ, SA, and wounding) had significant effects on the PRO and ALL contents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast, the PRO and ALL contents continuously declined over time and were lower than those in the untreated group at 120 h. In addition, treatment with MJ significantly increased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the DHCHE content at 72 h. However, the wounding treatment in combination with either of the two other treatments (MJ or SA) had greater effects than the control, MJ and SA groups on the DHSAN content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
