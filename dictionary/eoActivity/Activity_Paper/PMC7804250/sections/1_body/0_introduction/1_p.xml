<p id="Par2">The benzophenanthridine alkaloids (BIAs) are a large and diverse alkaloid group, and these compounds, such as sanguinarine (SAN), chelerythrine (CHE), protopine (PRO), and allocryptopine (ALL), exhibit a wide range of biological activities
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. SAN has a wide spectrum of biological activities, including strong antitumour
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>, antimicrobial
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup> and anti-inflammatory activities
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, SAN and CHE are as natural growth promoters that can be used as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the livestock industry
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, SAN has real potential as an effective antischistosomal drug
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Both PRO and ALL were demonstrated to have anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. PRO has potential uses as a neuroprotective agent in stroke and as an antidepressant for mood disorders
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Currently, SAN and CHE are extracted from mainly 
 <italic>Macleaya cordata</italic>, a plant species that is a traditional herb in China and belongs to the Papaveraceae family
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. In 2006, with the ban of using low-dose antibiotics as growth promoters added in animal feed in the European Union, natural growth promoters (NGPs), such as phytogenics, are extensively exploited as alternatives to antibiotics in livestock production
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Currently, the annual requirement for this plant is increasing daily due to its commercial value. Unfortunately, this plant has generally been collected from the wild for SAN commercial production. Therefore, the massive collection of wild resources of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> caused a decline in its population and we need to establish a new stable supply method and develop a viable alternative to SAN production.
