  <p>Inhibitory percentage of quercetin on a different stage of SGIV infection. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The inhibitory percentages are based on MCP gene expression. The inhibitory percentages of quercetin on SGIV particles (test 1), SGIV binding to the membrane of host cells (test 2), SGIV invading into host cells (test 3), and SGIV replication (test 4) were 65.73, 76.14, 56.03, and 52.73%, respectively. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The inhibitory percentages based on the viral envelope protein gene were consistent with those of the MCP gene.
