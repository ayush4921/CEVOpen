  <p>Inhibition effects of quercetin on SGIV infection. GS cells incubated with SGIV and quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml) served as the test group; cells infected with SGIV alone served as the control group. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Cell morphology was observed by light microscopy. Compared to large numbers of typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) appearing in the control group, few CPEs appeared in cells incubated with SGIV and quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Compared to the control group, quercetin could significantly reduce virus titers at 48 hpi in a dose-dependent manner. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The protein levels of major capsid protein (MCP) in SGIV-infected GS cells increased significantly after quercetin treatments.
