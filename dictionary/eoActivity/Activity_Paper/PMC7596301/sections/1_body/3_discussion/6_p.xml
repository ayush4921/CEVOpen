<p>In the previous study, quercetin was isolated from 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> and proved to combat SGIV infection with an inhibitory percentage above 99.83% at a safe working concentration of 50 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020a</xref>). Quercetin meets the key requirements for developing commercially available drugs against SGIV infection in aquaculture. Systemic studies were performed to explore the anti-SGIV mechanisms of quercetin in this study. The virus life cycle is initiated with the virus attaching to the cell membrane, invasion into the host cell, virus replication in cells, and release of newly assembled virions from the host cells. Knowledge on how antiviral agents exert antiviral effects is essential to develop antiviral medicines (
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). As the complete viral structure is essential for viral infection, we first evaluated quercetin’s effects on SGIV particles. It showed that pre-incubation with quercetin could reduce the virus’ infectivity. Then, we could reasonably conclude that quercetin did have damaging effects on SGIV particles.
