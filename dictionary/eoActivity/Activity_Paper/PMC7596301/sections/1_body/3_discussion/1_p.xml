<p>As an important medicinal plant, numerous compounds have been isolated and identified from 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> Hook. f., including flavonoids, volatiles, seco-prezizaane-type sesquiterpenes, lignans, phenylpropanoids, and so on. Modern pharmacology studies have proved that these active compounds possess diverse pharmacological actions, including antiviral, antimicrobial, insecticidal, analgesic, antioxidant, sedative, and convulsive activities (

 <italic>I. verum</italic> ingredients especially have excellent antiviral effects, such as sesquiterpenes against hepatitis B virus and HIV (

 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). In the previous study, we explored the antiviral effects of some 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> extracts against SGIV. The results showed that the 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> active ingredients quercetin, shikimic acid, trans-anethole, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could combat SGIV infection. Furthermore, quercetin, at a working concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml, has the best antiviral effects, whose inhibitory percentage reached 99.83% (
