<p>Furthermore, SGIV particles are transported along both actin filaments and microtubules in host cells, and intracellular SGIV motility could be remarkably affected by the depolymerization of actin filaments or microtubules (

As the cytoskeleton of cells incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) was kept normal, it proved that the safe working concentration of quercetin (50 μg/ml) had no cytotoxic effects, which was consistent with the results of the cell morphology and cell viability assay in the previous study (
