<p>Quercetin belongs to flavonoids. 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hoensch and Weigmann (2018)</xref> reported that flavonoids could interact with toll-like receptors expressed on the surface of immune cells, then internalize into the cytoplasm and transfer to the nucleus. Then, quercetin could increase the glutathione levels and prevent cell death against an oxidative insult. Furthermore, heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays a key role in multiple cell functions, including protein translation, folding, intracellular trafficking, and degradation. Hsp70 has been isolated and identified in both nucleocapsids from rabies virus-infected cells and purified virions. Furthermore, Hsp70 also interacts with the nucleoprotein N in host cells (

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lahaye et al. (2012)</xref> applied quercetin as a specific chaperone inhibitor to down-regulate Hsp70 in rabies virus-infected cells, which resulted in a significant decrease in the number of viral mRNAs, virus proteins, and virus particles (
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lahaye et al., 2012</xref>). It is interesting to explore the effects of quercetin on Hsp70 regulation during SGIV infection in host cells in a future study.
