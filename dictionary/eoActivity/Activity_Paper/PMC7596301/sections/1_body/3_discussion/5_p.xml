<p>Chlorogenic acid has been applied to treat viral upper respiratory tract infections caused by the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. (2017)</xref> first elucidated the underlying mechanisms of chlorogenic acid against the influenza A virus. It indicated that chlorogenic acid could inhibit the influenza virus during the late stage of virus infection by down-regulating nucleoprotein expression. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid had neuraminidase activity and could block the release of the newly assembled virus from infected host cells (

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2020b)</xref> evaluated the inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>L. japonica</italic> components against SGIV infection and proved that some 
 <italic>L. japonica</italic> components (isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid C, caffeic acid, luteolin, and inositol) exhibited an antiviral activity against SGIV infection in a dose-dependent manner. 
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2017)</xref> first proved the antiviral abilities of coumarin derivatives against SVCV infection. The other antiviral mechanism results indicated that coumarins (B4 and C2) did not affect the early stage of viral infection, such as virus adhesion and delivery from the endosomes to the cytosol, but exerted antiviral effects by preventing the cell apoptosis and microfilament organization disruption caused by SVCV infection. They also could up-regulate anti-oxidative enzyme gene expression and keep the balance of intracellular redox state during virus infection (
