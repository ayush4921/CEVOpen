<p>SGIV-infected cells at 0–2 hpi treated with quercetin were the test group; SGIV-infected cells without quercetin treatment served as the control group. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for RT-qPCR analysis. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>,
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, the levels of viral MCP and VP19 gene expression in the cells of the test group decreased obviously (

 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into the host cells were also proven by flow cytometry analysis (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). After having been incubated with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) at 4°C for 30 min and washed with PBS, the cells were treated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 28°C for 2 h. Cells infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) alone served as the control group. The cells in each group were then digested in Protease K and collected for flow cytometry analysis. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on the cells of the test group decreased obviously, which proved that quercetin had inhibitory effects on SGIV invading into the host cells (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into the host cells were further identified by LSCM (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The LSCM observation results were consistent with the flow cytometry results, which showed that the fluorescence signals of Cy5 in the cells of the test group decreased obviously.
