<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV replication in the host cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR and virus titer (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). SGIV-infected cells at 2 hpi and treated with quercetin for 10 h were the test group; SGIV-infected cells without quercetin treatment served as the control group. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, the levels of viral MCP and VP19 gene expression in the cells of the test group decreased obviously (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV replication in the host cells were also proven by virus titer analysis (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Compared to the control group, quercetin could significantly reduce virus titers at 24 hpi, which suggested that SGIV replication in the host cells could be inhibited by quercetin (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).
