<p>To explore quercetinâ€™s antiviral mechanism against SGIV infection, we first evaluated the damaging effects of quercetin on SGIV particles. GS cells incubated with quercetin-treated SGIV were the test group, and cells infected with SGIV alone served as the control group. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the levels of viral MCP and VP19 gene expressions in the cells of the test group were lower than those in the control group of cells infected with SGIV alone, indicating that quercetin had damaging effects on SGIV particles.
