<p>The possible cytotoxic effects of quercetin on GS cells were evaluated after 24 h of incubation. GS cells were first observed under a light microscope (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Compared with normal cells in the control group, GS cells incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) kept normal growth; there were no pathological and morphological changes (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). It showed that, compared with cells in the control group, the cytoskeleton of cells incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) was kept normal, suggesting that safe concentrations of quercetin did not cause any cytotoxic effects. These results were consistent with observations in a previous study which showed that quercetin, at a safe working concentration (≤50 μg/ml), has no cytotoxicity on cultured GS cells (
