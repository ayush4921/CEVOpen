<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were first analyzed by RT-qPCR. GS cells pretreated with quercetin and then infected with SGIV were the test group; cells infected with SGIV alone served as the control group. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>,
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, the levels of viral MCP and VP19 gene expression in the cells of the test group were lower than those in the control group of cells infected with SGIV alone (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to the host cell surface were also proven by flow cytometry analysis (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). After having been pretreated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min, the cells were incubated with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) at 4°C for 30 min and then collected for flow cytometry analysis. Cells infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) alone served as the control group. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on the cells of the test group decreased obviously, which proved that quercetin did interfere with SGIV binding to the targets on host cells (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were further analyzed by LSCM (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The LSCM observation results were consistent with the flow cytometry results. Compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on the surface of cells in the test group decreased.
