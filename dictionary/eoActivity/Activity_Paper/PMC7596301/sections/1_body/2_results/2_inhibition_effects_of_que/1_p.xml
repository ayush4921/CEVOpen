<p>The antiviral activity of quercetin against SGIV infection was analyzed by cell morphology observation and virus titer (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). GS cells incubated with SGIV and quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml) were the test group, and cells infected with SGIV alone served as the control group. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, cell morphology was observed by light microscopy. Compared to large numbers of typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) appearing in the control group, few CPEs appeared in cells incubated with SGIV and quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml). Furthermore, compared to the control group, quercetin could significantly reduce virus titers at 48 hpi in a dose-dependent manner (
