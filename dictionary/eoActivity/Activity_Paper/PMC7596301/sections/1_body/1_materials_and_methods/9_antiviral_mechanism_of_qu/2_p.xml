<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. GS cells in a 12-well plate were incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min. Then, Cy5-labeled SGIV (Cy5-SGIV, MOI = 1) was added to the cells at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and collected for flow cytometry analysis. GS cells infected with Cy5-SGIV only (MOI = 1) served as the control group.</p>
