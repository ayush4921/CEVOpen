<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into the host cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. GS cells in a 12-well plate were infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) at 4°C for 30 min. After having been washed twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 28°C for 2 h. GS cells incubated with Cy5-SGIV only (MOI = 1) served as the control group. To remove the cellular surface’s virus particles, the cells in each group were then digested in protease K for 2 min at 28°C, respectively. After having been washed three times with PBS, the cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis.</p>
