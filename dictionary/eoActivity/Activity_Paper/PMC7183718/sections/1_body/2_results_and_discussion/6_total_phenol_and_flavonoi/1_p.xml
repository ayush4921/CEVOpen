<p id="Par34">Plants have unlimited capability to produce aromatic secondary metabolites, which most of them are phenols or their oxygen-substituted derivatives. Key subclasses in this set of compounds contain phenols, phenolic acids, quinones, flavones, flavonoids, flavonols, tannins, and coumarins. These collections of compounds indicate antimicrobial activity and apply as plant defense mechanisms versus pathogenic microorganisms. Phenolic toxicity to microorganisms is because of the number of hydroxyl groups and site(s) existing in the phenolic compounds. Phenolic compounds cause cell membrane disruption, increase of ion permeability and leakage of vital intracellular constituents or impairment of bacterial enzyme systems in pathogenic microorganisms [
