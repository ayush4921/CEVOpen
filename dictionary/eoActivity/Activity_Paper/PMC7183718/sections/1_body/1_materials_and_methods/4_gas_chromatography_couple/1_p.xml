<p id="Par11">GC/MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies 7890A (GC) coupled with Agilent Technologies 5975C, equipped with a fused silica capillary HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm iD, film thickness 0.25 µm). The oven temperature was increased from 50 to 220 °C at a speed of 15 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, retained at 220 °C for 7 min; and then incremented to 260 °C at a speed of 15 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Transfer line temperature was 250 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas, at a flow speed of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The inlet temperature was 280 °C.
