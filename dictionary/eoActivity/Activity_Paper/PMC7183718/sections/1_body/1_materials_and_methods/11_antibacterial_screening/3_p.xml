<p id="Par22">The antibacterial activity was evaluated by determining the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), employing broth dilution method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Each strain was tested with an extract serially diluted in Luria broth, to obtain concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.8 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The samples were thereafter stirred, inoculated with 50 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of physiologic solution containing 5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> microbial cells, and incubated at 37 °C for quality control strains and 27 °C for plant bacteria for 24 h. A number of wells were reserved on each plate for sterility control (no inoculum), inoculum viability (no extract added), and the positive control (Gentamicin). The MIC was stated as the lowest concentration of extract that visibly inhibited the growth of bacterial spots. The assays were performed in triplicate.
