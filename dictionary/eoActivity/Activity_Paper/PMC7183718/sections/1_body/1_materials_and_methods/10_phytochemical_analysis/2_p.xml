<p id="Par19">In order to determine the flavonoid content, the colorimetric aluminum chloride method was utilized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Each sample in methanol (0.5 mL, 1:10 g mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was blended with methanol (1.5 mL), potassium acetate (0.1 mL, 1 M), aluminum chloride (0.1 mL, 10%), and the distilled water (2.8 mL). Then, the extracts were placed at room temperature for 30 min. Afterwards, the absorbance of the reactions was recorded using spectrophotometer (Biochrom WPA Biowave II UV/Visible) at 415 nm. The calibration curve was plotted through making quercetin solutions (12.5 to 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) in methanol. Finally, the total flavonoid content was stated as mg of quercetin equivalents g
 <sup>−1</sup> of dry sample.
