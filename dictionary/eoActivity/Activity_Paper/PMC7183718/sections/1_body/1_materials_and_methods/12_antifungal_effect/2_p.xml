<p id="Par25">The antifungal property of the methanol and chloroform extracts was examined with the agar-well diffusion method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was seeded by tested fungus. Sterile paper discs of 6 mm diameter (Padtan, Iran) were impregnated by 25 µL of the methanol and chloroform extracts of samples, separately. The sterile impregnated discs were put on the level of the seeded agar plate. The incubation conditions utilized were 28 °C and 70% RH for 12–14 days for 
 <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic> and 7–9 days for 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. The antifungal activity was visualized as a zone of inhibition of fungal growth around the paper disc and the results were stated as mean ± SD after three repetitions. Pathogen grown on PDA without plant extract was utilized as control.
