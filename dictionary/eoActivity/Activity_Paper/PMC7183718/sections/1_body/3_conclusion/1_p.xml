<p id="Par44">In this work, the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of extracts of some plants used in Iranian folklore medicine were reported. Based on the results, methanolic and chloroformic extracts of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> fruit showed the maximum antibacterial activity against most of the tested bacteria pathogens, attributable to higher content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. According to the obtained results, a high resolution GC/MS method reported for the evaluation of the constituents of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flavescens</italic> plants, while in both plants, Spathulenol was the main component of the essential oil. Furthermore, in this study, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of medicinal plants extracts on plant bacteria and fungi strains were evaluated for the first time.
