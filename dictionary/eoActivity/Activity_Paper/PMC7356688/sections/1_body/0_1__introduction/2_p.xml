<p>Recent evidence points toward stem-like phenotypes in cancer cells, promoted by cancer stem cells (CSCs), as the main culprit of cancer relapse, resistance to radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or chemotherapy, and metastasis. Many mechanisms have been proposed for CSC resistance, such as drug efflux through ABC transporters, microenvironment modulation, epigenome, exomes, overactivation of the DNA damage response, apoptosis evasion, increased unfolded protein response (transforming the cells particularly susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial damage), autophagy deregulation, metabolic alterations, prosurvival pathways activation, and/or cell cycle promotion [
