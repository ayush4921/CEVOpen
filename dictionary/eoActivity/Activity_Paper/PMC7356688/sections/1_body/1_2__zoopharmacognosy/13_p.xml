<p>Albeit, the most classical example of self-medication behavior is the leaves chewing of

Particularly, the secondary metabolites present in this plant, such as sesquiterpene lactones (e.g.,: Vernodaline) and steroid glucosides (e.g.,: Vernioside) have shown anthelmintic, antiamoebic, anticancer (inhibition of tumor promotion), immunosuppressive and antibiotic activities [
