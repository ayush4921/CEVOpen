<p>Aside from this, there are some VS studies with natural substances. In 2018, it was performed ligand-based and structure-based virtual screens of 1306 sesquiterpene lactones of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> (e.g., 
 <italic>Vernonia</italic> spp.) obtained from an in-house database (SistematX database). Potential antichagasic of these secondary metabolites for the three parasitic forms and some structural features, such as skeleton type and the presence of epoxide moiety, were determined from random forest models of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Also, a structure-based virtual screen using PDB structures of eight 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> proteins for the entire sesquiterpene lactones set allowed the selection of 13 potential inhibitors of these enzymes. Finally, an approach combining structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening enabled the identification of promising single and multitarget antichagasic sesquiterpene lactones [
