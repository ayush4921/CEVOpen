<p>Other studies employed machine learning methods to determine the biomarkers with anti-inflammatory potential (dual inhibition of COX and LOX) in extracts of 57 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> species. Moreover, models to detect biomarkers in new extracts based solely on their metabolomic data, and with no prior knowledge of biological data, were also established. This combined strategy that uses metabolomics, in vitro bioactivity, decision trees, and artificial neural networks had never before been explored; therefore, the time-and money-consuming steps usually required for compound isolation, identification, and anti-inflammatory evaluation were avoided. This strategy could be useful in studies that seek to find biomarkers with a certain determined property or characteristic of complex samples (such as the extracts) and also to reveal active secondary metabolites [
