<p>In this regard, if it is known which targets are specifically involved in a certain type of cancer, and all the information until this moment of the compounds discovered using Zoopharmacology would be gathered in databases, it will be possible to interrelate them by inverse docking tools (such as Selnergy), in a process called as Reverse Pharmacognosy. Reverse pharmacognosy allows us to identify which molecule(s) from an organism is (are) responsible for the biological activity and the biological pathway(s) involved. This approach provides evidence of the therapeutic properties of products used in traditional medicine. Moreover, new activities can be discovered for the ligands, which would allow the molecule reposition, which consists of finding applications unknown until now for the plant constituents studied, which would be subsequently validated by in vitro and in vivo tests. Also, by ascribing the new properties studied to a molecule, all the standardized extracts of the organisms that contain it at the same concentration would be repositioned, as well as its adverse effects. Finally, the activity of the ligand could be optimized based on the characteristics it presents, looking for derivatives with similar properties in the same raw material or others, that are more potent, less toxic, with greater accessibility to be exploited or with a better pharmacological profile of the selected molecule, which, in short, would allow obtaining active extracts and, with it, new patents related to them [
