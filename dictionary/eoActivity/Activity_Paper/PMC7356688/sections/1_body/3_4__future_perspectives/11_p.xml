<p>Finally, bioprospecting practices have implications for medicine, environment, economy, public health, and culture [

The potential benefits of natural products-based medicines have led to the unscientific exploitation of these resources, a phenomenon that is being observed globally. This decline in biodiversity and natural loss due to species extinction is largely the result of the rise in the global population, rapid and sometimes unplanned industrialization, indiscriminate deforestation, overexploitation of natural resources, illegal trade, pollution, and finally global climate change [

Some particular aspects should be considered in Zootherapy practices such as animal products are, in most cases by-products from animals hunted for other purposes; their use is common for medicinal, religious beliefs and socio-cultural practices in both rural and urban areas of Asia, Africa or Latin America; it exists the possibility of transmitting infections or ailments from animal traditional preparations to the patient and they remain virtually unstudied and undocumented that entails their potential knowledge disappearance [

Therefore, it is of utmost importance that biodiversity is preserved, to provide future structural diversity and lead compounds for the sustainable development of human civilization. This becomes even more important for developing nations, where well-planned bioprospecting coupled with non-destructive commercialization could help in the conservation of biodiversity, ultimately benefiting mankind in the long run [
