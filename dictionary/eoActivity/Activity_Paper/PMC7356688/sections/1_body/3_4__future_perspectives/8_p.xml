<p>In terms of the methodological approach used in modeling the pairwise relationships, a highly studied topic is the development of network or graph analysis-based drug target interaction (DTI) prediction methods. In these methods, compounds and targets are represented as nodes on a graph, where the edges connecting these nodes indicate interactions. Modeled this way, the estimation of unknown DTIs becomes a link prediction task. A trend in DTI prediction that we expect to become more popular soon is integrating large-scale omic at the input level, to increase both the quality and the coverage of the predictions [
