<p>Hymenoptera venoms, those which come from bees (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and wasps (
 <italic>Polybia paulista</italic>) contain Melittin and Mastoparan as the main important compounds respectively, because of their evidenced anticancer properties as it has been reviewed in some works [

 <xref rid="B95-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Moreover, both compounds showed activity in MDR cells and improve the therapeutic activity in combination with drugs [
