<p>Some reptiles products are also being evaluated for this purpose. Siamese crocodiles (
 <italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic>) are one of the most studied species since their bile acid extract inhibited the proliferation of SK-ChA-1, Mz-ChA-1, QBC939, and SMM 7721 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and besides, enhance the sensitivity of drug uptake by human cholangiocarcinoma MDR cell line (QBC939/5-FU). In addition, their white blood cell extracts exhibited anti-angiogenic properties in HeLa cell lines [

 <italic>Gekko swinhonis</italic> GÃ¼enter was isolated the Gekko Sulfated Glycopeptide or Gepsine. Gepsine exhibited anti-proliferative activity in Bel-702 and HT-29 cell lines; besides, it showed anti-angiogenic effects in human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) due to disruption in bFGF function, which is a growth factor responsible for angiogenesis [

 <italic>Cuora trifasciata</italic>) inhibit HepG2 and MCF-7 cells [
