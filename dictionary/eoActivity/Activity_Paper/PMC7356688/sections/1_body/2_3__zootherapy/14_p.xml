<p>Despite the thriving developments in this field in the past years, comparatively few investigations focused on the collateral sensitivity of these natural products. Cell lines resistant to diverse antitumoral common drugs such as cisplatin, vinblastine, or paclitaxel, revealed collateral sensitivity to marine substances such as aragusterol A, cytochalasin B, ningalin N3 and N5, dolastatin-10 and the hemiasterlin derivative HTI-286 [
