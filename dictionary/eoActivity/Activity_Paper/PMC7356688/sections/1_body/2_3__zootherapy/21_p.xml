<p>The Yellow Israeli Scorpion (
 <italic>Leiurus quinquestriatus</italic> quinquestriatus) venom contains a peptide molecule, the chlorotoxin (CTX), that blocks small conductance Cl
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> channels, diminished annexin-2 expression, and inhibits MPP-2 in malignant cells. CTX has shown specificity to bind to neuro-ectodermal descent tumors like glio-, neuro-, and medulloblastomas, melanomas, small cell lung carcinomas among others, and no activity in normal brain cells. Nowadays, it has been proved that the combination of CTX with drugs such as methotrexate or cisplatin increases the cytotoxicity toward cancer cells when compared to the effect of the drug alone [
