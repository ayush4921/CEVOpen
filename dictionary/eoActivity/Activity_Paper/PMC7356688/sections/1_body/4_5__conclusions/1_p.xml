<p>Cancer is a multifactorial and multitarget disease treated, at present, mainly using chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. However, these therapies carry the appearance of detrimental effects mainly due to MDR. Understanding how the switch between sensitive and resistant states is activated and what factors control it would be key to designing new effective treatment strategies for MDR cancers. Ethnopharmacology-based approaches always have been a promising strategy to find new drugs. The present work is a starting point that summarizes, explains and exemplifies how Zoopharmacognosy and Zootherapy can meet this goal. Currently, Zoopharmacognostic studies have to improve in many ways: compilation of more case descriptions, evaluation of the potential for self-medication in more taxa, and determination if there are any general evolutionary or ecological predictors of the behavior; increasing phytochemical and bio-guided activity studies of a plant used by animals and searching for correlations between the use of medicinal plants of humans and animals. Great expectations have been put in secondary metabolites such as saponins and naphthoquinones unveiling in these studies as cancer lead agents. The on-going tendency in Zootherapy is focused mainly on exploring marine drugs and in keeping records of the traditional medicinal uses of animal products. However, neither a demonstration of the clinical efficacy of the popularly used remedies nor an evaluation of the sanitary implications of the prescription of animal products for the treatment of diseases was studied. In both cases, the number of studies must be increased, the techniques improved and protection measures must be promoted for these species, using research methods that cause the least possible impact and damage to the species, local community, and environment. Henceforth, intensive cross-disciplinary research approaches including chemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology, etc. that encompassing the conservation and sustainability of the species, could realize the Zoopharmacology one of the mainstreams in Oncotherapy.</p>
