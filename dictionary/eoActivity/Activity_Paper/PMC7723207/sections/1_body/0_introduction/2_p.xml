<p>Diabetes mellitus is mainly characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative stress at sugar, lipid, and protein levels. Hyperglycemia can promote superoxide buildup through different metabolic pathways for instance; augmented glucose flux through the polyol pathway; increased protein glycation; protein kinase activation; hexosamine activation and decline in antioxidant defense system. Metabolic disturbance and oxidative stress which result from hyperglycemia have long been associated with neurological, urological, cardiovascular, kidney, and eye vision disorders (Chandra et al.,

Because of the rising number of diabetic patients and scarcity of the number of antidiabetic drugs without side effects, the efforts to find new drugs with no side effects have increased. The search for natural compounds with antidiabetic effects has increased around the world. In this regard, natural antioxidants can be used as an effective approach to manage diabetes as an oxidative stress‐related disease (Daneshzad et al.,
