<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO diminished protein glycosylation in the presence of glyceraldehyde at 145–170 µg/ml similar to aminoguanidine (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Protein glycosylation is the reaction between reducing sugars (glucose, fructose, and glyceraldehyde) and amine groups of amino acid side chains leading to the formation of amadori products and over a long time produces glycosylation products (Justino et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Glycosylation of proteins and enzymes causes the progression of pathological disorders known as atherosclerosis, diabetes, neurodegenerative and renal diseases. Protein glycosylation inhibitors with their strong antioxidant activities, scavenge free radicals and may break cross‐linkages between sugars and proteins and thus interfere with the attachments of reducing sugars with proteins by preventing amadori product formation (Younus &amp; Anwar, 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Phytochemicals as nontoxic, low‐cost, and ingestible products like essential oils with broad antioxidant activity against reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals by scavenging free radicals (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and disrupting protein‐sugar interaction (Peng et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) have displayed antiglycation effects.
