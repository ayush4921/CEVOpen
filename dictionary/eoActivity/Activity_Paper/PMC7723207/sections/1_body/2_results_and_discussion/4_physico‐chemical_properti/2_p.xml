<p>The interaction among gelatin, pectin, and essential oils was analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of gelatin‐pectin and gelatin‐pectin‐essential oils to some extent are similar (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The band at 3,600 to 3,300 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is related to water OH stretch or to phenol of ZMEO or to hydrogen bonding between dendrosome polymers. The bands from 3,000 to 2,800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to CH stretch in CH, CH
 <sub>2</sub>, and CH
 <sub>3</sub> of aliphatic groups. The stretch bands from 2,900 to 2,700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are related to O‐CH
 <sub>3</sub> in the methyl ester. The band at 2,400–2,200 cm
 <sup>‐1</sup> is due to C = O and COO groups in the carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups. The band at the regions of 1,700 to 1,500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the asymmetric stretch of C = O in ester while bands in the region of 1,500 and 1,400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are the symmetric stretch of C = O in esters. The CH bending vibration of CH
 <sub>2</sub> in the terpenes can be seen at 1,450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and CH bending vibration of CH
 <sub>3</sub> can be seen at 1,340 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The C–O stretch in the phenol and monoterpenoid compounds is seen at 1,200 to 1,100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The bands at the 1,100 to 1,000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be attributed to the ether bond of C‐O‐C in the monoterpenoids (Cebi et al.,
