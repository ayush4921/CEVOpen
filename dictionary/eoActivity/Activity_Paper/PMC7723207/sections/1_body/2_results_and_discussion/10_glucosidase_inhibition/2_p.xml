<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO inhibited glucosidase activity at 210–240 µg/ml similarly but at lower levels as compared to acarbose (Table

Glucosidase is the key enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of carbohydrates such as starch and disaccharides at the final step of digestive process. Glucosidase inhibitors can retard glucose release and absorption and as a result suppress postprandial hyperglycemia (Kumar et al.,

Results obtained from the present study show that plant essential oils possess bioactive components with antioxidant along with amylase and glucosidase inhibition properties. Therefore, these plants can be used as an important approach in controlling blood glucose in diabetes patients with no adverse effects.
