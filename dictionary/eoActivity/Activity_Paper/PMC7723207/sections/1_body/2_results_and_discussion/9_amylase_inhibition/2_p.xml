<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO inhibited amylase activity at 210–230 µg/ml in a similar manner but at a lower levels as compared with acarbose (Table

Inhibition of amylase is considered a useful strategy for the treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders and related diseases like diabetes, obesity, and tooth decay (Sales et al.,
