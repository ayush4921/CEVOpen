<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrations of essential oils were added to 20 µl α‐glucosidase (50 µl/ml) in a microplate and then incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature. Then, 10 µl para‐nitrophenyl glucoside solution (10 mM) was added and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature. Then, 30 µl Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (100 mM) was added and the light absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. Acarbose (10 µg/ml) was added to some wells as control. The percent reduction in light absorbance at 405 nm was taken as the percent of enzyme inhibition as follows: percent inhibition = [(Absorbance in the absence of essential oil − Absorbance in the presence of essential oil)]/Absorbance in the absence of essential oil × 100 (Majeed et al.,
