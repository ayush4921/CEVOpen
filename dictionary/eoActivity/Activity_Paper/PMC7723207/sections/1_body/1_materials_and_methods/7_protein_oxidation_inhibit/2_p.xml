<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrated essential oils were incubated with 500 µl gelatin solution (1 mg/ml PBS) and 500 µl malondialdehyde solution (1.0 mg/ml in PBS) in a microplate. The microplate was incubated at ambient temperature for one day. Light absorbance recorded at 245 nm. The reduction in light absorbance at 245 nm was taken as the percentage inhibition in protein peroxide production as follows: percent inhibition = [(Absorbance in the absence of essential oil − Absorbance in the presence of essential oil)]/Absorbance in the absence of essential oil × 100. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 10 mg/ml) was used as control (Ansari et al.,
