<p>A homogeneous solution containing gelatin (7 g), pectin (3 g), and 100 ml acetic acid (60%) was prepared and stirred continuously at 40°C. Gelatin‐pectin nanocomposite incorporated with plant essential oils was prepared by mixing the essential oil (100 mg/g of total polymer) with the gelatin‐pectin solution and stirred for 12 hr, at ambient temperature. Glycerol (100 mg/g of total polymer) and glutaraldehyde (10 mg/g of total polymer) were added to the composite solution then mixed thoroughly (Kavoosi et al.,

Particles Zeta‐potential were calculated by Brookhaven Instrument (New York, USA) based on the phase analysis light scattering (PALS) method. The particles hydrodynamic diameters were calculated using a Brookhaven Instrument (USA) based on the principle of dynamic light scattering (DLS) method (Kavoosi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The surface tension of the composite solution was calculated by Du Nouy tensiometer (Kruss, Germany) at ambient temperature. The viscosities of the composite solutions were quantified using the MCR302 rheometer (Anton Paar) at a shear rate of 0.01 to 100 s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the viscosity values were reported at 50 s
 <sup>−1</sup>.
