<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrated essential oils were incubated with 500 µl gelatin solution (1.0 mg/ml PBS) and 500 µl glyceraldehyde solution (40 mg/ml in PBS). The microplate was then kept at ambient temperature for 24 hr. The solutions fluorescence was read at 370 nm (excitation) and 440 nm (emission). The percentage reduction in fluorescence intensity was taken as the percentage inhibition in protein glycation as follows: percent inhibition = [(fluorescence intensity in the absence of essential oil − fluorescence intensity in the presence of essential oil)]/fluorescence intensity in the absence of essential oil × 100. Aminoguanidine (10 mg/ml) was used as a positive control (Peng et al.,
