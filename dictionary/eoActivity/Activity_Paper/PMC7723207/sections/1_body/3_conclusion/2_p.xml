<p>In summary, thymol, carvacrol, gamma‐terpinene, para‐cymene, geraniol, and spathulenol are the main components of essential oils. All essential oils extracted from the plants used in this study, displayed strong antioxidant activity against glucose oxidation, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, protein glycation, and had anti‐diabetic effects against amylase and glucosidase activities. With these antioxidant and antidiabetic activities, the incorporation of the thymol and carvacrol bearing essential oils in the gelatin‐pectin composite provides a functional biomaterial for food product stability food encapsulation, wound healing, and cosmetics materials. However, more research is needed to be carried out on the intracellular antidiabetic activity of these essential oils to examine the molecular mechanisms of their antidiabetic activities at the cellular level or in living organisms. In addition, the efficacy of these composites in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers should be investigated. Furthermore, the antidiabetic activity of pure chemical compounds and the synergistic effects among these compounds must be taken into account.</p>
