<p>Metrani et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have conducted a study to analyze the quality of functional food due to the added value of phytochemicals and the nutritional composition of red onions. The study reported an analysis of polyphenol, protein, nitrogen, mineral, sugar, pyruvate, antioxidant, and α-amylase inhibition activities of red onion cultivars, sweet Italian and honeysuckle, grown in California and Texas, respectively. Cyanidin-3-(6″-malonoylglucoside) and cyanidin-3-(6″-malonoyl-laminaribioside) were the major polyphenols present in the cultivars, as evident from the principal component analysis of different cultivars of red onion. Cyanidin derivatives possessed strong antioxidant activity and are responsible for the inhibition of α-amylase.
