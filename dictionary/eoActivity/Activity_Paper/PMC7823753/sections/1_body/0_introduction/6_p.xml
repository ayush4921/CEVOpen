<p>Laganà et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have described the anthocyanin profile of lemon bottlebrush (
 <italic>Callistemon citrinus</italic> (Curtis) Skeels) flowers by RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis of an anthocyanin enriched fraction of acidified methanolic extract and performed a deep analysis of its antioxidant, cytoprotective, and anti-angiogenetic properties. The work led to the identification of four anthocyanins: cyanidin-3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-diglucoside (cyanin), peonidin-3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-diglucoside (peonin), cyanidin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and cyanidin-coumaroylglucoside-pyruvic acid. The abilities of cultivation, robustness, and adaptability to different environments make the plant a useful source of anthocyanins, which show interesting applications due to their unique structural/chemical features. The anthocyanin-enriched fraction of acidified methanolic extract is able to actively scavenge DPPH, ABTS, and AAPH radicals and to counteract β-carotene bleaching. Based on these data, the effects of hydroxylation and methoxylation at the level of the B ring have a remarkable effect on antioxidant activity and the basic structure of anthocyanins. Moreover, they protect human mononuclear cells from oxidative injuries and prevent angiogenesis.
