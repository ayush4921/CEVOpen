<p id="par0140">In general, the plant of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> needs to be dried after harvesting in the primary processing process. During the subsequent extracting process, it will be softened with water or steam, and then sliced, and finally dried for extraction. Thus, it is of great importance to investigate how the storage time before extraction affects the contents of active ingredients in the industrial production of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. In this study, the fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were directly crushed after removing sediments. The samples were then stored for different times at room temperature to reveal the trend of the contents of eight active ingredients changing with storage time. The results showed that the contents of chrysin, baicalein, wogonin and scutellarein in the fresh-crushed roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> increased from 0 h to 25 h at room temperature (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ). Among them, the contents of chrysin and wogonin showed similar trend, and then they reached the highest level at 25 h (Dry weight: 1.97 mg/g and 13.94 mg/g, respectively), which were 6.0 % and 10.9 % higher than those in the beginning time (0 h). The content of baicalein increased slowly, reaching a stable level at about 38.84 mg/g after 2 h. On the contrary, the contents of baicalin and wogonoside continued to decline with the extension of storage time, and tended to be stable at around 22 h. The two active ingredients decreased from 95.67 mg/g and 17.89 mg/g (0 h storage) to 5.04 mg/g and 1.13 mg/g (22 h storage), with decreases of 94.7 % and 93.7 %, respectively. In particular, the contents of baicalin and wogonoside decreased significantly from 0 h to 1 h. The content of apigenin showed a generally downward trend with the extension of storage time, and it rebounded at 3 h–4 h with a peak of 0.03 mg/g, and then continued to decline after 4 h. Collectively, the above results showed that the storage time at room temperature had a significant effect on the eight active ingredients in fresh-crushed roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. According to the trends of active ingredients to be extracted, specific extraction process should be developed for the industrial production of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>.
