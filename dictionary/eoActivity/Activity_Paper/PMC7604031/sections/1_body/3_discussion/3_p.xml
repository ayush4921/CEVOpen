<p id="par0170">The duration of storage time is also an important factor that effects the yield of active ingredients. In traditional processing of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> products, the farmers usually dried the roots immediately in the sun after harvesting, and then softened the dried roots with steam and cut the soft roots into slices. Finally, the dried slices were sold to pharmaceutical companies or hospitals for further processing. Typically, this process will take considerable time and lead to loss of active ingredients. Thus, new processing approaches are needed to solve this problem. Reducing the effect of storage time is a potential way to achieve such gorals. For the industrial production of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, it will greatly improve efficiency and reduce cost if the fresh roots are directly used for the extraction of medicinal active ingredients. However, the medicinal active ingredients of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> are mainly flavonoids, which are secondary metabolites synthesized by a variety of key enzymes (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016b</xref>). It is necessary to systematically reveal how the contents of active ingredients changes with the prolongation of storage time at room temperature after crushing or cutting, thereby determining whether the processing methods are effective and reliable. Previous studies have demonstrated that the four main medicinal active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> are located in the downstream of flavonoid synthesis pathway (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016b</xref>). Glycosides and aglycones can be mutually transformed by the enzymes of UDP-glucuronate: baicalein 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase (UBGAT) (
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Nagashima et al., 2000</xref>) and glucuronidase (GUS) (
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">Sakurama et al., 2013</xref>). When the plant of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> is affected by external stress environment, the cells will produce a large amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Baicalin, a glycoside component in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, is immediately hydrolyzed to baicalein (an aglycone component) under the action of GUS (
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Dikaya et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we revealed the dynamic change of the effects of storage time on the contents of eight active ingredients in fresh-crushed and fresh-cut roots at room temperature. The results showed that the contents of glycosides (baicalin and wogonoside) decreased linearly with the extension of storage time after the fresh roots were crushed or cut, while those of aglycones (baicalein and scutellarin) increased linearly (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.01). These results indicated that the secondary metabolism in tissues of fresh roots did not stop immediately after crushing or cutting. With the extension of storage time at room temperature, the UBGAT enzyme hydrolyzed the glycosides to produce glucuronic acid and aglycones in suitable conditions. Based on these observations, the best processing methods for the extraction of active ingredients should be determined according to characteristics of specific products. For instance, for the extraction of chrysin, baicalein, and wogonin, the fresh slices should be stored at room temperature (22°C) for more than 25 h after roots were fresh-crushed or fresh-cut. On the contrary, for the extraction of baicalin, wogonoside, and apigenin, the fresh slices should be extracted as soon as possible after roots were fresh-crushed or fresh-cut. Compared with fresh-crushing treatment, the content of glycosides under fresh-cutting treatment in roots has a little decrease. Collectively, the processing technology for fresh-crushed or fresh-cut roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> should be further studied in the future.
