<p id="par0180">In traditional processing methods, the roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> need to be dried twice (one for killing enzyme activity by steam, while another for cutting to slices), which is energy-consuming and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the traditional processing technology of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> to minimize energy consumption during the drying process and the softening treatment by steam. A prospective strategy is that the fresh medicinal materials being cut into slices and processed after harvest in the original cultivated areas, which will not only save time and energy during the processing process, but also maintain the quality of medicinal materials (
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to the processing technology of Chinese medicinal materials using fresh slicing on the premise of ensuring the quality (
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, it is clearly proposed that further studies should focus on the deep processing technology of fresh-cutting for medicinal materials in the Protection and Development Plan of Chinese Medicinal Materials (2015–2020). Up to date, a series of studies aimed at reducing the effects of softening in dried medicinal materials and exploring the fresh-cutting methods have been reported in Chinese medicinal materials including common peony (
 <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> Pall.) (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2011</xref>), dan shen (
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bge.) (
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), and cassia bark tree (
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> Presl) (
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). Inevitably, the traditional processing technology (
 <italic>D-S- C-D</italic>) for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> have the issues of mutual conversion and hydrolysis of active ingredients. Our results first demonstrated that the 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic> treatment of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> would be a candidate of optimal processing approaches that produce the maximum yield of active ingredients. The comparative analysis results of six processing technology in this study showed that the total contents of eight active ingredients and four main active ingredients in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were less affected under 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic> treatment than that of the traditional processing technology (
 <italic>D-S-C–D</italic>). Collectively, the processing technology of fresh-cutting for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> will become the mainstream processing technology with cost-saving, environment-friendly and energy-saving for the extraction of active ingredients in pharmaceutical enterprises in the future, which is of epochal significance for accelerating the modernization of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.
