<p id="par0120">For the generation of standard curves, the standards of the eight active ingredients were prepared with a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/μL. The eight standards were then injected with volumes of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20 μL, respectively, and were detected at wavelength of 274 nm. The peak area values of each standard were recorded. The linear regression equations were then calculated using the sample volume of standards as abscissa (
 <italic>X</italic>) and the peak areas as ordinate (
 <italic>Y</italic>) (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). For the quantity evaluation of estimated samples, the peak values of each active ingredient were substituted to the linear regression equations to obtain the sample sizes. Then the content of each active ingredient of 10 μL was calculated by multiplying by the concentration of standards (5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mg/μL). Finally, the contents of the eight active ingredients of samples (mg/g) were calculated by multiplying by the dilution ratio.
