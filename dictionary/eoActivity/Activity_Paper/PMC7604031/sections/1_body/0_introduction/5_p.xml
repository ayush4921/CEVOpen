<p id="par0045">Nevertheless, most of the active ingredients (e.g., alkaloid salts, inorganic salts, etc.) of TCM have different affinity degrees with water (

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the contents of active ingredients in medicinal materials are closely related to the enzyme activity of plant tissues (

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). For medicinal crops that are rich in alkaloids and polysaccharides, the contents of active ingredients as well as the quality of medicinal materials will rapidly decline, due to the absence of high-temperature treatment that can inactivate enzyme activity in tissues and organs after harvest. For example, for the important medicinal crop tall gastrodia tuber (
 <italic>Gastrodia elata</italic> Bl.), high-temperature steam is firstly used to inactivate enzyme activity in the root after harvesting, and then the steamed roots are dried. As an alternative, it can also inactivate enzyme activity by boiling the root in water. However, the boiling process will significantly reduce the content of gastrodin, which will further reduce the quality of medicinal materials (

Accordingly, it is necessary to investigate the effects of processing methods on the quality formation of different active ingredients in medicinal crops, thereby providing optimum processing methods that will obtain the maximum yield of products for the industrial production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.
