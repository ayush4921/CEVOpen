<p id="p0245">The efficacy of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> seed oil and its effect on hair loss was also evaluated in healthy women with long hair but susceptible to excessive hair breakage. The hair length and hair mass index among other parameters as well as questionnaires were employed in the study. The findings revealed significant growth in the hair length, hair mass and hair index of women within 4 8 months of the seed oil usage. It was thus concluded that the hair oil product formulated from 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> seed might be a harmless and active choice for the treatment of women suffering from hair breakage and damaged hair (
