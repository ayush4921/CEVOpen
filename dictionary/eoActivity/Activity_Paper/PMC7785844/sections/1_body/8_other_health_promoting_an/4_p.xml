 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> methanolic fruit extract on oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity indices in rats following subacute administration of the extract (50–200 mg/kg) was carried out (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akinmoladun, 2016</xref>). The result showed a decrease in serum total bilirubin and hepatic malondialdehyde levels in treated groups level while glutathione-S-transferase activity was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased in the liver. The findings suggested that extract at lower dose (&lt;100 mg/kg) could boost the antioxidant defense and exert hepatoprotective properties.
