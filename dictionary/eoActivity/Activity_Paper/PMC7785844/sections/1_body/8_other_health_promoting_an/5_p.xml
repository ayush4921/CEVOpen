 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> was evaluated by (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>) using a hamster's model under an experimental diet consisting of 2% of ethanolic and water extract of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> seed, leaves and dry pulp. Experimental diets containing the seed extract of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> reduced the plasma total cholesterol while lupeol acetate and β-amyrin acetate (triterpenoids isolated from the seed extract) decrease plasma total cholesterol by 15%–20% in hamsters. It was concluded that the ethanol extract of the seed decreased plasma total cholesterol which could be associated with active triterpenoids in the extract.
