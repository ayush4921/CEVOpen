<p id="p0180">In another study, the effect of aqueous leaf extracts of miracle fruit on 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mutation and oxidative damage was evaluated (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The leaf extracts caused concentration-dependent inhibition of the mutagenicity of 2-AA (an indirect mutagen) and 4-NQO (a direct mutagen) toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. The antimutagenic activity was attributed to the phenolic constituents of
