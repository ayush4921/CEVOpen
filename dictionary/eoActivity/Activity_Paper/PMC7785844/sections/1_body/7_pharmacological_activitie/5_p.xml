 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Obafemi et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) evaluated the antidiabetic potential of both methanolic and flavonoid-rich leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> on fructose-fed, streptozotocin-injected rats. Biochemical parameters, such as liver and kidney function tests, lipid profile, markers of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes as well as pathological changes in the type 2 diabetes model were assessed. Oral administration of the plant extract to rats for 21 days significantly improved the biochemical and pathological alterations in type 2 diabetes. Altered glycated hemoglobin and serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in diabetic animals were corrected by treatment with the extract. Also, 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> fruit and leaf extracts showed significant α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. In addition, molecular docking analyses suggested that some polyphenolic component of the plant possess strong binding affinities with glucokinase.
