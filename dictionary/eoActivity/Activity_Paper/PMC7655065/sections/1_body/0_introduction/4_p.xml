<p>Recent reports brought our attention to the development of selective inhibitors and on further modifying the lead molecule (
 <bold>6</bold>), we reported the design and synthesis of 
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-4-((quinolin-8-ylamino)methyl)benzamide (
 <bold>13</bold>), a selective HDAC6 inhibitor which exhibits potent activity against multiple myeloma (

 </xref>. Continuing our efforts on investigation of quinoline-containing molecules, the current study focuses on the modification of compound 
 <bold>13</bold>, and evaluates the effect of various substituents at C3 of quinoline to generate a series of 3-substituted quinolinehydroxamic acids with selective inhibitory and anti-proliferative activities against HDAC6 (
