 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref> describes the synthesis of designed compounds (
 <bold>14–29</bold>), which begins with halogenation of 8-nitroquinoline (
 <bold>30</bold>) with 
 <italic>N</italic>-halosuccinimide to furnish 3-halogenated 8-nitroquinolines (
 <bold>31a–31c</bold>). The iodine in compound 
 <bold>31c</bold> was replaced by a methoxy group in the presence of CuI and 1,10-phenanthroline to generate compound 
 <bold>31d</bold>. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>31b</bold> underwent a Suzuki arylation with phenylboronic acid to furnish compound 
 <bold>31e</bold>. Subsequently, reduction of the nitro groups of 
 <bold>31a–31e</bold> by iron powder, followed by reductive amination with methyl 4-formylbenzoate in the presence of NaBH(OAc)
 <sub>3</sub>, led to compounds 
 <bold>32</bold>–
 <bold>36</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> underwent Suzuki arylation with various arylboronic acids to further afford compounds 
 <bold>37–47</bold>. The conversion of 
 <bold>32–47</bold> to the desired hydroxamic acids (
 <bold>14–29</bold>) was achieved by hydrolysis of the ester by LiOH, amidation with NH
 <sub>2</sub>OTHP, and TFA-mediated deprotection, reactions that were conducted sequentially.
