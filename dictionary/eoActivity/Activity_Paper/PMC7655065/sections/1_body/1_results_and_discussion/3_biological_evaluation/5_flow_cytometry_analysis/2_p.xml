<p>The effects of compound 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>25</bold>, and 
 <bold>26</bold> on cell cycle progression on A549 cells were examined by flow cytometry. Treatment of A549 cells with 
 <bold>25</bold> and 
 <bold>26</bold> resulted in concentration dependent accumulation of A549 cells in sub G1 phase with concomitant losses from the G0/G1 phase. Compounds followed the same trend in their activity as that of western blot analysis owing to same reason. Furthermore, a characteristic hypo diploid sub G0/1-peak was observed as a consequence of increased apoptosis and partial DNA loss in A549 cells treated with 
 <bold>25</bold> or 
 <bold>26</bold> in a dose dependent manner (
