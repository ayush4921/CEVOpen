<p>Western blot analysis indicated that compounds of this series induce apoptosis by activation of caspase and PARP pathways. Compound 
 <bold>25</bold> with a 3-pyridyl substituent and compound 
 <bold>26</bold> with a 4-pyridyl substitution at C3 of quinoline demonstrated dose dependent increases in caspase 3, 8, and 9 cleavage in A549 cells treated with 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>25</bold>, and 
 <bold>26</bold> for 48 h. 
 <bold>23</bold> was found to be the most potent compound amongst these three tested compounds followed by 
 <bold>26</bold> which was further followed by 
 <bold>17</bold>. The order of their efficacy in cleaving caspase isoforms also follows the same order as their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell growth inhibitory activity with 
 <bold>17</bold> being the least potent amongst these three compounds. These molecules also increase dose dependent expression of gamma H2AX indicating increased DNA double strand fragmentation (
