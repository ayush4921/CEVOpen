<p>The activity of several compounds and reference compounds against trichostatin A ((R,2E,4E)-7â€“(4-dimethylamino)phenyl)-
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-4.6-dimethyl-7-oxahepta-2,4-dienamide (
 <bold>5</bold>) were tested for HDAC isoform selectivity against HDAC1, 2, 6 and 8 (1
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results from compounds 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>25</bold>, and 
 <bold>26</bold> reveals that a polar substituent at C3 shows improvement of HDAC6 selectivity and six-membered aromatic rings at C3 are favoured for HDAC6 selectivity. Compound 
 <bold>25</bold>, with a 3-pyridyl group at C3 of quinoline shows remarkable HDAC6 selectivity over HDAC1, 2, and 8 with selectivity ratios of 552, 276, and 379 respectively (values under IC
 <sub>50</sub> in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, presented parenthetically). On the other hand, five-membered heterocycles such as furan (
 <bold>27</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>) and thiophene (
 <bold>29</bold>), which act as bioisosteres of a phenyl ring, result in decrease of HDAC6 selectivity over that of HDAC 1, 2 and 8.
