<p>This study investigated the effect of C3 substitution of quinolinehydroxamic acids on related biological activities, such as antiproliferative and HDAC inhibitory activity. Synthesised compounds showed potent antitumor activities in A549 cells and HCT116 cells with single digit micromolar activities. Pyridine substitution at C3 of quinoline was found to be optimum for the activity of these compounds. The 3-pyridyl compound (
 <bold>25</bold>) is more potent than the 4-pyridyl isomer (
 <bold>26</bold>) and with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.75â€‰nM, displayed better HDAC6 selectivity. These compounds exhibit their anticancer effects by induction of apoptosis and by fragmenting DNA double strands as revealed by western blot analysis. The increased population of treated A549 cells in sub G1 phase reveals cell cycle arrest in the sub G1 phase indicating DNA loss and apoptosis. These compounds (
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>25</bold>, 
 <bold>26</bold>) are potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitors and are crucial to development of the SAR of quinolinehydroxamic acids and to explore the possibilities of structural modifications to yield compounds with selectivity towards HDAC inhibition.
