 <italic>)</italic>: A mixture of nitro compound (1 eq), iron powder (4 eq), NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl (5 eq), and 75% MeOH (10 ml) was heated to reflux. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic>, and then extracted with DCM and H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, and concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> to afford a crude residue. A mixture of the residue (1 eq), methyl 4-formylbenzoate (1.2 eq), sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.5 eq), AcOH (2–4 drops), and anhydrous DCM (10 ml) was stirred at RT. The mixture was poured into H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and then extracted with DCM. The combined organic layer was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with EtOAc/
 <italic>n</italic>-Hexane to afford corresponding ester compound 
 <bold>32</bold>–
 <bold>36</bold>.
