 <italic>General procedure for hydroxamic acid synthesis</italic>. A mixture of 1 N LiOH (3 ml) and ester (1 mmol) was stirred at 40 °C for 2 h. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then H
 <sub>2</sub>O was added. The mixture was acidified with 3 N HCl to give an off-white precipitate. This off-white solid (1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 ml) and EDC·HCl (1.5 mmol) was added, followed by HOBt hydrate (1.5 mmol) and TEA (3 mmol). After being stirred at RT for 30 min, NH
 <sub>2</sub>OTHP (1.2 mmol) was added and allowed to stir for an additional 5 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with H
 <sub>2</sub>O and was extracted with EtOAc (25 ml × 3). The combined organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a light yellow residue, which was purified by silica gel chromatography (EtOAc: 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane = 1:1) to give a colourless liquid. 10% TFA (5 ml) was added to the resulting product dissolved in MeOH (5 ml) and the mixture was stirred at RT for 5 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a white residue, which was recrystallized from MeOH to afford the desired compound.
