<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained with Bruker DRX-300 spectrometer operating at 300 MHz, with chemical shifts reported in parts per million (ppm, 
 <italic>δ</italic>) downfield from TMS, an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured with a JEOL (JMS-700) electron impact (EI) mass spectrometer. Purity of the final compounds was determined using a Hitachi 2000 series HPLC system using C-18 column (Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 5 µm. 4.6 mm × 150 mm) and was found to be ≥ 95% in all cases. Flash column chromatography was carried out using silica gel (Merck Kieselgel 60, No. 9385, 230–400 mesh ASTM). All reactions were done under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen.
