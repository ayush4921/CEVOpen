<p>Briefly, A549 cells were starved with EBM-2 medium overnight and were subsequently replenished with EGM-2 medium with or without

 <bold>26</bold> (0.25, 0.5, 10 µM) for 48 h. After being trypsinized and fixed in ice-cold 75% MeOH for 1 h at −20 °C, A549 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.2 ml DNA extraction buffer (0.2 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M citric acid; pH 7.8) for 30 min. Then the cells were stained with propidium iodide solution (PI; 100 µg/ml RNase, 80 µg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100) in PBS. FACScan flow cytometry was utilised to determine cell cycle distribution, and data analysis was performed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
