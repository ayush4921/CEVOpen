<p>Cells were seeded at the density of 5000 cells/well into 96-plate overnight. Basal cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to represent the cell population at the time of compound addition (T
 <sub>0</sub>). After additional incubation of DMSO (C) or different doses of test compounds (Tx) for 48 h, cells were fixed with 10% TCA and stained with SRB at 0.4% (w/v) in 1% AcOH. Unbound SRB was washed out using 1% AcOH and SRB bound cells were solubilised with 10 mM Trizma base. The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 515 nm. The 50% growth inhibition (GI
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by 100 − [(T
 <sub>x</sub> – T
 <sub>0</sub>)/(C – T
 <sub>0</sub>)] × 100.
