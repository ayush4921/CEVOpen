 <caption>
  <p>Graphical representation of the frostbite wound-healing area and percentage survival area. (a) Wound area reduction in mm; (b) percentage survival area during the phase of the study. The graph shows the manifestation of values (mm) and percentages on frostbite induction on the 3
   <sup>rd</sup>, 7
   <sup>th</sup>, 14
   <sup>th</sup>, and 21
   <sup>st</sup> days. The values are expressed as the mean ± SEM of six animals in a group. Statistical analysis is performed with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test. All the groups are compared with the frostbite control group. Results are nonsignificant (∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, significant (∗∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and highly significant (∗∗∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.
