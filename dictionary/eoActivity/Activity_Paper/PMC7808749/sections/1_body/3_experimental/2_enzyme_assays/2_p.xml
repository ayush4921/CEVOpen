 </xref> was used to measure AChE and BChE activities, using 0.5 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) and 
 <italic>S</italic>-butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI), respectively, as substrates for 10 min at 412 nm

 </xref>. Colour development was performed using 0.5 mM 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which reacts with thiocholine (a product of ATCI by AChE or of BTCI by BChE) to produce 5-thio 2-nitrobenzoic acid. Preincubation was treated for 15 min before adding ATCI and DTNB.
