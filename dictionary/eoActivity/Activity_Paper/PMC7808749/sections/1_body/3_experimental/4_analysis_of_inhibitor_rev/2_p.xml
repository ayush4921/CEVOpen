<p>Inhibition types (reversible or irreversible) were determined by dialysis, as previously described
 <sup>51,52</sup>, but by using 0.06 mM kynuramine and 0.3 mM benzylamine. For the experiment of AChE, 0.5 mM ATCI was used. Dialysis experiments were performed by preincubating enzymes and inhibitors (or reference inhibitors) at ∼2 × IC
 <sub>50</sub> in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30 min, and then dialysing solutions with stirring for 6 h with a buffer change at 3 h. Residual activities were calculated using the measured activities of undialyzed (A
 <sub>U</sub>) and dialysed (A
 <sub>D</sub>) solutions and the activities of untreated controls (i.e. without inhibitor).
