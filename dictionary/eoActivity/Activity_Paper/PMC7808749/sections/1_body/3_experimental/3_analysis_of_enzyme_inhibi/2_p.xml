<p>MAO-A, MAO-B, AChE and BChE activities were measured after exposure to inhibitors at a concentration of 10 µM. Inhibitions of MAO-B at 10 µM of these compounds tested were too excessive, and thus, a concentration of 1.0 µM was used. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by measuring the residual enzyme activities. Toloxatone, lazabemide and tacrine, were used as reference reversible inhibitors of MAO-A, MAO-B and AChE, respectively, and clorgyline and pargyline as reference irreversible inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively.
