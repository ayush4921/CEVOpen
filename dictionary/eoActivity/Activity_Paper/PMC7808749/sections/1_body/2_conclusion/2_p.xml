<p>We describe the synthesis of morpholine-containing α,β-unsaturated ketones, and the results of an investigation of their MAOs and AChE inhibition profiles. Most of the nine compounds synthesised exhibited potent MAO-B inhibition with moderate AChE inhibition. Interestingly, 
 <bold>MO1</bold> (the lead compound) inhibited MAO-B inhibition in the low nanomolar range and was more potent than lazabemide (the reference compound). The low cytotoxicity and the ability of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> to transit the BBB support our drug design strategy. In addition, the ROS scavenging efficacy of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> suggests improved neuroprotective effects.
