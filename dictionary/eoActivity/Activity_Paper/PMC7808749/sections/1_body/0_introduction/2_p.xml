<p>Due to the extreme complexities of brain systems and their diverse dysfunctions, research focus is being directed towards the design of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs)

 </xref>. In fact, it has been suggested that functional equilibrium of brain after a neurologic disorder is unlikely to be achieved by focussing on a single molecular target

 </xref>. The major challenge presented by the development of MTDLs is to preserve balance between the effects drugs have by acting at their individual molecular targets

 </xref>. On the other hand, some ligands can target two or more specific entities within numerous biological networks. The likelihood of successful MTDL design can be enhanced by considering the design of molecular scaffolds via suitable molecular hybridisation and by understanding the pathophysiologies of multifaceted diseases. The design process can be accelerated by selecting pharmacophores based on pre-clinical studies, emphasising structureâ€“activity relationships (SARs) and by performing
