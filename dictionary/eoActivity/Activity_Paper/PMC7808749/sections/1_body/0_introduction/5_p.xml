<p>The chalcones framework is considered an excellent starting point for the design for MAO-B and AChE enzyme inhibitors

 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>B</bold> rings of chalcones can impart electrophilic character to the Michael acceptor present. The introductions of electron-donating/lipophilic halogens onto the phenyl 
 <bold>B</bold> ring of chalcones have resulted in the syntheses of highly selective MAO-B inhibitors
