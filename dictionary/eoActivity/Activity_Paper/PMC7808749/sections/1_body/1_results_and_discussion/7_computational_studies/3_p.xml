<p>Docking studies were performed on 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> using the X-ray resolved structures of MAO-A, MAO-B and AChE in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as entries 2Z5X, 2VZ5 and 4EY7

 </xref>. Molecular docking simulations were performed to investigate interactions between 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and MAO-A, MAO-B and AChE. The docking scores resulting from 
 <italic>in silico</italic> simulations are reported in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Results showed that the carbonyl and the 4-morpholin-phenyl groups of the chalcone scaffolds of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> hydrogen-bonded with F295 and formed π − π interactions with the side chain of W286 at the peripheral anionic subsite (PAS) of AChE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8(A)</xref>). Also, the dimethylamino group of 
 <bold>MO5</bold> established a weak hydrophobic interaction with W86 at the catalytic anionic subsite (CAS). 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> formed π − π interactions with the selective MAO-B residue Y326 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8(B)</xref>). In addition, the styryl and dimethylaminophenyl groups of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold>, respectively, established π–π interactions with Y398 and were sandwiched within an aromatic cage formed by Y328, Y435 and FAD. 
 <bold>MO1</bold> engaged in a π − π interaction with Y407 and was entangled in a hydrophobic cage consisting of Y407, Y444 and FAD of MAO-A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8(C)</xref>), whereas 
 <bold>MO5</bold> established π–π interactions with a selective MAO-A residue F208 using its 4-morpholine-phenyl group. In order to point out the selectivity of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold>, molecular docking analyses were performed on BChE crystal structure. Docking score values of 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> for BChE were worse than those for AChE (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> can predominantly establish hydrophobic interactions in the BChE binding pocket; in particular 
 <bold>MO1</bold> engaged a π–π interaction with F329, but both compounds cannot make crucial interactions with the catalytic W82 residue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8(D)</xref>).
