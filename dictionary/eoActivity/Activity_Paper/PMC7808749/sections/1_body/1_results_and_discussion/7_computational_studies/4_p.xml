<p>Overall, computational analyses provided a sound explanation of the experimental data. Docking scores and the binding modes obtained demonstrated that 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> can meaningfully interact with MAO-B as indicated by IC
 <sub>50</sub> experimental values. Interestingly, even if 
 <bold>MO1</bold> had adopted a similar binding mode in MAO-A and MAO-B binding pockets, the two docking score values would have been quite different, due to a lack of π–π interaction with the MAO-A selective residue F208 and lesser hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, 
 <bold>MO5</bold> assumed a switched pose within the MAO-A binding pocket, with its morpholine ring facing FAD, presumably because the dimethylamino substituent on the phenyl ring did not allow adequate access to the binding site. As regards AChE, molecular docking awarded a better score for 
 <bold>MO5</bold> than 
 <bold>MO1</bold>, which also agreed with experimental data, despite the resemblance between their binding poses.
