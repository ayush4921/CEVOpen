<p>The biocompatibilities of 
 <bold>MO1, MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> were investigated using an MTT (3–(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and normal VERO cells

 </xref>. Results showed that 
 <bold>MO1, MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> were non-toxic to normal VERO cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 195.14, 185.44 and 188.34 µg/mL, respectively, indicating that the therapeutic potentials of these compounds would be suitable.
