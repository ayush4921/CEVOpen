<p>Lineweaver–Burk plots and secondary plots showed that 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> competitively and non-competitively, respectively, inhibited AChE (

 </italic> values of 2.52 ± 0.17 and 7.04 ± 0.32 µM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B,D)</xref>), which suggest that 
 <bold>MO5</bold> is a potent, selective and competitive inhibitor of AChE that binds to the active site of AChE, and that 
 <bold>MO9</bold> binds to a site other than the active site of AChE and changes the 3D structure of the enzyme, thus inhibiting enzyme activity.
