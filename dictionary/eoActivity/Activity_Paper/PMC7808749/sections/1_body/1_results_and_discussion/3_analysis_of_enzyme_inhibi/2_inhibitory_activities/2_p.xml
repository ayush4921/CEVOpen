<p>In this study, nine morpholine-based compounds (
 <bold>MO1</bold>–
 <bold>MO9</bold>) were analysed with respect to their abilities to inhibit MAO-A, MAO-B and AChE. Most of the compounds inhibited MAO-B by ∼ 50% at 1.0 µM, except 
 <bold>MO3</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>MO1</bold> most potently inhibited MAO-B (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.030 µM), followed by 
 <bold>MO7</bold>, 
 <bold>MO8</bold>, 
 <bold>MO4</bold>, 
 <bold>MO9</bold>, 
 <bold>MO6</bold>, 
 <bold>MO2</bold>, 
 <bold>MO3</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25, 0.32, 0.33, 0.36, 0.64, 0.70, 1.01 and 1.31 µM, respectively). In addition, 
 <bold>MO5</bold> most potently inhibited AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.1 µM), followed by 
 <bold>MO9</bold> and 
 <bold>MO8</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.01 and 12.07 µM, respectively). 
 <bold>MO7</bold> most potently inhibited MAO-A (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.1 µM), followed by 
 <bold>MO6</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.7 µM). 
 <bold>MO5</bold> most potently inhibited BChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.09 µM), with weaker inhibitory activity compared to AChE, followed by 
 <bold>MO7</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.83 µM) (
