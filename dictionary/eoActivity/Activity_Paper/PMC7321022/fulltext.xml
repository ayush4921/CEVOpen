These activities may only be legally conducted with the necessary statutes and regulations in place to facilitate the timely development, manufacturing, evaluation, and distribution of products that meet quality standards. The present regulatory landscape for medicinal and medical products for human use has been shaped by nearly 12 decades of statutory history that followed in reaction to disasters and tragedies. Five distinct, closely woven threads of statutory history have led to the regulatory infrastructure we have in place: (1) standardized processes for routine development of medicinal and medical device products for human use; (2) processes for expedited development to shorten time frames and expand patient populations; (3) mechanisms of Expanded Access to make medicinal products available to patients prior to approval of the US Food and Drug Administration; (4) Emergency Use Authorization during public health emergencies; and (5) the development of pathways for bringing generic drugs and biosimilar biologics to market. These mechanisms are being brought to bear to facilitate the defeat of infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key words</title><kwd>emergency use authorization</kwd><kwd>expanded access</kwd><kwd>expedited drug development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">On May 1, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir, intended for use in the treatment of adults and children with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and <italic>severe disease,</italic> defined as an Sp<sc>o</sc>

Such a description is best considered in the context of nearly 12 decades of statutory history promulgated in response to major disasters and tragedies that have led to the development of our present regulatory landscape. There are 5 distinct, closely woven threads of statutory history that have come to form our present regulatory framework for making medicinal and medical products available to patients under varying clinical and societal conditions and pressures: (1) standardized processes for the routine development of medicinal and medical device products for human use; (2) processes for expedited development to shorten time frames and expand patient populations; (3) Expanded Access to medicinal products prior to FDA approval; (4) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during public health emergencies; and (5) the development of pathways for bringing generic drugs and biosimilar biologics to market.

</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0015">Relevant historical events that led to the eventual regulation of medicinal products, including drugs, biologics, and vaccines, include the following: the Biologics Control Act of 1902, which established the concepts of tolerability, purity, and potency standards for biologics<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>; the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which established the concepts of adulteration and misbranding of drugs<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>; the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which created a safety standard for drugs that must be met prior to entering the market and which also developed the concepts of the Investigational New Drug exemption (IND) and the New Drug Application (NDA)<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>; and the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962, which established an efficacy standard for drugs that must be met prior to entering the market.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Important populations of patients that have been specifically addressed through statutes and enabling regulations include patients with orphan diseases<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and children.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0020">There is a parallel series of statutes that directed the regulation of medical device products, including scalpels, personal protective equipment, orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, heart&#x02013;lung pumps, and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> diagnostic tests. These include the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which created a risk-based classification system and accompanying controls to ensure safe use; the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, which established requirements for adverse-events reporting<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>; and the Unique Device Identification system for tracking implantable devices.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0025">Important events that have occurred in the current era of regulation include the quinquennially renewed User Fee Acts, which began in 1992.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This was a sea change in how funding for premarket and postmarket regulatory science would be sourced, shifting from wholly congressionally budgeted funding to partially congressionally budgeted funding that is augmented by user fees obtained from regulated industries seeking market access. In fiscal year 2020, the FDA's budget is 5.94 billion USD, of which 2.67 billion USD (45%) is expected to come from user fees.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> User fee-augmented budgets have been successful in having the intended effects of facilitating product-development activities and of reducing standard NDA review times to a goal of 10 months, and priority NDA review times to a goal of 6 months. Five-year review of accompanying legislation has had the further effect of offering regularly scheduled opportunities for legislating innovation and other prospectively considered concerns, issues, and activities that might otherwise be limited to statutory remedies in response to disasters and tragedies. Similar benefits have followed the adoption of user fees for medical devices.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Regularized Drug Development</title><p id="p0030">Regulatory processes for the routine development of medicinal and medical device products were gradually standardized over the first 8 decades of the 20th century<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> to meet the medical and scientific communities' expectations of the majority of products, although improvements in timeliness would have to await the enactment of user fees in the 1990s to address business expectations. The HIV epidemic that began in the early 1980s had laid bare weaknesses in the standardized routine model of drug development in responding to the urgent pressures of expedited development of new drugs and in facilitating the availability of promising drugs to large numbers of patients without alternatives during company preparation of NDAs and FDA reviews of applications. These experiences acute attention to the need for expedited development processes and Expanded Access approaches to medicinal products prior to FDA approval.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Expedited Development</title><p id="p0035">

<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The 3 categories of Expanded Access are individual use, including emergency use; use in intermediate-sized populations of patients; and widespread use. Expanded Access provides access to drugs, including biologics, by patients when a use is not primarily intended for the collection of information about the tolerability or effectiveness of an investigational agent. Between 1992 and 2017, there were 92 FDA approvals of drugs, including biologics, with the Expanded Access designation, half of which were for use in patients with cancer.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Emergency Use Authorization</title><p id="p0070">Prior to September 11, 2001, there was only 1 statute that addressed preparedness and public health emergencies: the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Since 9/11, Congress has enacted an additional nine statutes to enhance preparedness for the full gamut of circumstances: emerging infectious diseases; threats stemming from chemical, biological, radiologic, and nuclear sources; and agents of war.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> One of these provisions is the EUA, established as part of the Project Bioshield Act of 2004.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> With this provision, the secretaries of the US departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services (HHS) are empowered to make a determination of need, that is, that a military/domestic/public health emergency, or a significant potential for an emergency, exists. The secretary of HHS declares that the described circumstance justifies an EUA, and the FDA commissioner evaluates the request using the four criteria necessary for supporting the issuance of an EUA, namely that: (1) there is a serious or life-threatening illness/condition caused by the identified agent(s); (2) there is reasonable belief that the product may be effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by the agent(s); (3) the known or potential benefits outweigh the known or potential risks; and (4) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.8"><title>COVID-19</title><p id="p0075s">With this description of the regulatory framework that is in place for the development of medicinal and medical device products for human use, we can begin to understand how regulations support and contextualize responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="p0080">To diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of interest, there must be an <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> diagnostic kit that has received either FDA 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. However, in a public health emergency, the HHS secretary can make a determination of need and declare that a public health emergency exists, and the FDA commissioner can issue Emergency Use Authorizations of specific <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> diagnostic test kits. The same process may serve for the issuance of EUAs for serologic test kits used for measuring antibody levels in convalescence. Thus far, 81 individual EUAs for molecular diagnostic tests have been issued, as well as an umbrella EUA for molecular diagnostic tests for use in laboratories that are CLIA-certified to perform 37 high-complexity nucleic acid tests, an individual EUA for antigen diagnostic tests, 20 individual EUAs for serologic tests, an umbrella EUA for an independently validated serologic test, and an individual EUA for a test for the management of COVID-19&#x02013;infected patients.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>

New antiviral drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 will have to undergo premarket evaluation under an IND for the generation of data for use in supporting an NDA for submission to the FDA, which will likely take years. New, SARS-CoV-2&#x02013;targeted drugs will be given a Priority Review designation, and will likely be given the Fast Track designation, which is accompanied by close collaboration between the developer and the FDA to speed development, review, and approval.</p><p id="p0090">To prevent new infections and to end the pandemic quickly, vaccine candidates are being evaluated through the IND mechanism. Expedited development and FDA review mechanisms will likely be applied, including possibly a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation.</p><p id="p0095">To employ the Expanded Access mechanism, both acute antiviral treatments and prophylactic vaccines can be expected to be widely distributed under a treatment IND as soon as a manufactured product is available and evaluated by the FDA.</p><p id="p0100">It is likely that each manufacturer of drug products, including biologics, or vaccine products will have short- and long-term postmarketing commitments to ensure the continuation of collecting postmarketing efficacy data, as well as to consider special populations and issues (eg, pediatric and elderly populations, patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, and patients with a risk for drug&#x02013;drug interactions) in the further evaluation of the product. To maintain the safety profile of marketed products, adverse-events reports on all products will be passively collected.</p><p id="p0105">Finally, EUAs may be issued for antiviral drug products as well as for anti-inflammatory drug/biologic medicinal products as they are identified and directed toward specific patient populations, possibly as early as Phase II for new products and possibly any time after a repurposed product is considered potentially effective. EUAs may also play a role in making vaccines available. We have also seen EUA withdrawals in the cases of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after the FDA determined that they were &#x0201c;unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>
