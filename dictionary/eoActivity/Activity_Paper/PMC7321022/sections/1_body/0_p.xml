 </xref> Given the medical community's general lack of familiarity with the regulatory mechanism Emergency Use Authorization, a useful description of the statute and its use would be helpful. Such a description is best considered in the context of nearly 12 decades of statutory history promulgated in response to major disasters and tragedies that have led to the development of our present regulatory landscape. There are 5 distinct, closely woven threads of statutory history that have come to form our present regulatory framework for making medicinal and medical products available to patients under varying clinical and societal conditions and pressures: (1) standardized processes for the routine development of medicinal and medical device products for human use; (2) processes for expedited development to shorten time frames and expand patient populations; (3) Expanded Access to medicinal products prior to FDA approval; (4) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during public health emergencies; and (5) the development of pathways for bringing generic drugs and biosimilar biologics to market. Although of fiscal importance to federal and state programs and of financial importance to company and family budgets, this fifth series of statutory developments has been discussed elsewhere and will not be discussed further.
