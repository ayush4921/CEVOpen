<p id="p0080">To diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of interest, there must be an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostic kit that has received either FDA 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. However, in a public health emergency, the HHS secretary can make a determination of need and declare that a public health emergency exists, and the FDA commissioner can issue Emergency Use Authorizations of specific 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostic test kits. The same process may serve for the issuance of EUAs for serologic test kits used for measuring antibody levels in convalescence. Thus far, 81 individual EUAs for molecular diagnostic tests have been issued, as well as an umbrella EUA for molecular diagnostic tests for use in laboratories that are CLIA-certified to perform 37 high-complexity nucleic acid tests, an individual EUA for antigen diagnostic tests, 20 individual EUAs for serologic tests, an umbrella EUA for an independently validated serologic test, and an individual EUA for a test for the management of COVID-19–infected patients.
