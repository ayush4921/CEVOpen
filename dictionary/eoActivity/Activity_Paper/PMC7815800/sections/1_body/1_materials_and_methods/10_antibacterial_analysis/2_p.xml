<p id="p0105">The antibacterial properties of P3a and SP3a were performed against Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The bacterial cells were grown in nutrient agar medium at 37 °C and sub-cultured before each experiment. As described by previous authors, the antibacterial activity was determined by a good diffusion method of agar (

 <sup>6</sup> colonies forming unit (CFU)/mL of bacterial cell suspension on Mueller–Hinton broth agar media. A hole with a diameter of 5 mm was punched into the agar medium, and 20 μL of P3a and SP3a (25 and 50 mg/mL) were inoculated, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for one day. The antibacterial activity was observed by observing the inhibition area (mm) and compared with chloramphenicol (positive control) and distilled water (negative control).
