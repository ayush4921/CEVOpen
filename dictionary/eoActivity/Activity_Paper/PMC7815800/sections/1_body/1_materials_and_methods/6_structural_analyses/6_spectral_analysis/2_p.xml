<p id="p0080">In the wavelength of 200â€“500 nm (UV-1800; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), ultraviolet-visible spectra of P3a and SP3a (1 mg/mL) were recorded. The functional groups present in P3a and SP3a were identified by a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 5700 IR spectrophotometer by mixing 1 mg dry sample with 100 mg KBr and pressing into pellets.</p>
