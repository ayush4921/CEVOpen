 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative activity of P3a and SP3a (10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 μg/mL) against HeLa and Jurkat cell lines were measured by MTT method (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann, 1983</xref>). Cisplatin was chosen as a positive control. The cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin (100 IU/mL) in a humid environment (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Cell suspensions of HeLa and Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well microplates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL. Add 100 μL of suspension to each well, incubate for one day, and treat with different concentrations of P3a and SP3a. After incubating for one day of at 37 °C, MTT reagent (20 μL, 5 mg/mL) was added to each well, and further incubated for four hours. The supernatant was removed and restored with DMSO (150 μL). The absorbance was recorded (490 nm) using a Bio Tek ELISA microplate reader, Winooski, Vermont, USA. The anti-proliferative activity is calculated using the formula given in
