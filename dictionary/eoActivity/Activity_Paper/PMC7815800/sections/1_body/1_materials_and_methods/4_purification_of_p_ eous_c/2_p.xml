<p id="p0035">PECP was purified by DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-100 chromatography as per the described protocols by minor alterations (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). After equilibrating the DEAE cellulose-52 column with deionized water, the PECP solution (5 mL, 20 mg/mL) was loaded into it. The polysaccharide was fractionated and eluted with double-distilled water, and then using a saline solution (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mol/L) was gradually added at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (5 mL/tube). The first fraction was eluted with double-distilled water (neutral polysaccharide), whereas the second and third fractions were eluted by using 0.1 M and 0.3 M brine solution (acidic polysaccharide) respectively (

The phenol–sulfuric acid process was utilized to determine the carbohydrates in the neutral and acidic polysaccharide fractions by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. The 0.3 N NaCl fractions showing a single peak was recovered, lyophilized and further purified on Sephadex G-100 gel filtration assembly (1.6 × 50 cm). Purification was completed by using deionized water (run rate: 0.5 mL/min) to obtain pure of P3a fraction, which was dialyzed, lyophilized and used for further study. The reliability of the purification process was checked by performing the process for three times and the results are found to be same.
