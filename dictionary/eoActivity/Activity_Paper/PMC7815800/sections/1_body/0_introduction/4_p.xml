 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> mushroom belongs to the 
 <italic>Basidiomycota</italic> family and is one of the most cultivated mushrooms across the globe. Compared with other mushrooms, it has high health benefits (

 <italic>Pleurotus eous</italic> (Berk.), commonly known as the pink oyster mushroom, is a nutritious and valuable edible mushroom. However, till date, there seems to be no investigation on purification and sulfated modification of purified acidic fraction of 
 <italic>Pleurotus eous</italic> polysaccharide. Therefore, this study inspired us to explore the potential, functional and medicinal value of this mushroom polysaccharide. The present study illustrates the sulfation of acidic fraction (P3a), its structural characterization and biological properties. Besides, the anti-oxidant, anti-coagulant, anti-bacterial and anti-tumour activity P3a was compared with SP3a.
