<p id="p0220">In this study, water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted and purified through ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and sulfated by SO
 <sub>3</sub>-Pyr complex method. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to study the structural characteristics, such as UV, FT-IR, NMR, GCMS, HPGPC and Congo red experiment. These results demonstrate that the molecular modification by sulfation caused changes in chemical composition. The molecular weight decreases during the sulfation process, indicating polysaccharide degradation. The monosaccharide composition of P3a and SP3a is the same, but the mass fraction is different, except that there is no ribose and arabinose. At high alkali concentrations, the triple helix structure becomes random coils. The results of DPPH, hydroxyl radical scavenging and reducing capacity measurements showed that sulfated modification enhanced the antioxidant activity. For Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>S. aureus, B. subtilis</italic> the bacteriostatic areas of P3a and SP3a were evaluated, and it was found that sulfation was significantly improved antibacterial activity of P3a. Sulfation confers P3a anti-proliferative activity against Jurkat and HeLa cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Through various anticoagulant tests, sulfated derivatives show better antioxidant activity. The results of this study indicate that the changes in sulfation enhance the antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-tumour, and antibacterial activities of P3a, which in turn is related to physical and chemical properties, Mw, and monosaccharide composition. SP3a can be used as a natural antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-tumour and antibacterial agent for industrial and biomedical applications.
