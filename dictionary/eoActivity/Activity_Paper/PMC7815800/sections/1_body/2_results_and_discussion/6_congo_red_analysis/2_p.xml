 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> depicts the λmax change of Congo red in the existence of P3a and SP3a at different concentrations of sodium hydroxide (0–0.5 M). The results show that as the sodium hydroxide concentration increases, λmax first increases, and then gradually decrease until it reaches a constant. In the presence of P3a and SP3a, the λmax of Congo red has been red-shifted to a large extent, which indicates that they have a triple-helix conformation in low concentration of sodium hydroxide (0–0.2 M). As the NaOH concentration increased above 0.2 M, the λmax of Congo red-polysaccharide complex progressively reduced, demonstrating that the triple-helix structure decomposed into random coils. At alkaline pH, the triple-helix of polysaccharides is confirmed to be broken by the breaking of intramolecular and intermolecular bonds, and the λmax will be significantly reduced. Previous studies have stated that sulfated polysaccharides display diverse intra-molecular hydrogen bonds and show chain extension that expands as sulfate groups increase (
