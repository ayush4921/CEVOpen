<p id="p0115">The crude polysaccharide (PECP) resulted after hot water extraction, precipitation with ethanol, Sevag's deproteinization and lyophilization were then purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-52 cellulose column. PECP is divided into three parts, called P1, P2 and P3 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). P3 was applied to a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column for further purification. The column was eluted with ultrapure water, and then the subsequent eluent was concentrated, dialyzed and lyophilized. As displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, the single elution peak P3a is further sulfated to obtain SP3a.
