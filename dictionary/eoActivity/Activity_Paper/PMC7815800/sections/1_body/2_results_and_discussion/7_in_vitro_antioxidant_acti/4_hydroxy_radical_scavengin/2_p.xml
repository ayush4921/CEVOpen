 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2008</xref>). The scavenging ability of P3a and SP3a for hydroxyl radicals increased from 1.0 to 5.0 mg/mL in a dose-dependent mode (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). The scavenging effect of P3a in 5 mg/mL was 87.24%, the EC50 value was 2.52 mg/mL, while the scavenging effect of SP3a in 5 mg/mL was 89.91% and the EC50 value was 2.33 mg/mL. The scavenging activity of vitamin C (V
 <sub>c</sub>) at 0.5 mg/mL was 96.01%, and the EC50 was 0.37 mg/mL. Compared with Vc, the clearance ability of the two samples is weaker, but the clearance ability of P3a is lower than that of SP3a. This result indicates that SP3a with sulfate groups exhibited better scavenging activity towards hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which is consistent with the results of

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li and Shah (2014)</xref>, 
 <italic>Pleurotus eryngii</italic> polysaccharide with greater DS was found to be further effective in quenching hydroxyl radicals than non-sulphated polysaccharides, and our results are consistent with this study. Sulfation can improve the water solubility of the polysaccharide, and reduce its chain conformation. Also, the sulfated group can activate the hydrogen atom of the anomeric carbon, thereby providing thee polysaccharide with a strong hydrogen donor ability, changing its biological activity.
