<p id="p0200">A concentration-dependent increase in clotting time was noticed in P3a and SP3a at the tested concentrations (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Compared with P3a, SP3a prolongs the clotting time with an increase in sample concentration. The prolonged APTT, PT and TT respectively represent the internal pathway to inhibit the coagulation process, the external pathway and inhibit thrombin-mediated fibrin formation. Compared with P3a, SP3a effectively prolongs the time of APTT, TT and PT, because the introduction of sulfate into polysaccharide might form a complex with plasma inhibitors and target proteases (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), and play a significant role in the anticoagulant activity of polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). In general, the interactions between amino acid residues on coagulation factors (such as antithrombin and sulfate groups) exhibit the anticoagulant activity of sulfated polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). The results show that sulfation effectively improved the anticoagulant behaviour of natural polysaccharides. The coagulation time of sulfated polysaccharides was observed to increase with decreasing molecular weight, which is following former reports (

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). The longer SP3a coagulation time associated with sulfate content and triple-helix properties of polysaccharides show its importance in anticoagulant activity (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>). The DS of polysaccharides is an important parameter affecting anticoagulant activity. Our results are consistent with earlier reports on the anticoagulant behaviour of sulfated

 <italic>Russula virescens</italic> polysaccharide (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Compared with natural polysaccharide, sulphated

 <sub>1</sub>) prolonged APTT from 45.56s to 50.32s (1.1 fold higher) and PT from 16.96s to 19.36s (1.1 fold higher) at 4 mg/mL. In comparison with 5 mg/mL P3a, SP3a lengthened APTT from 23.6s to 27.8s (1.1 fold higher) and PT from 12.7s to 15.9s (1.3 fold higher). In this study, the anticoagulant activity was enhanced due to sulfation, and the trend of sulfation was similar to
