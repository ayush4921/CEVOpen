<p id="p0135">Polysaccharides display a wide range of solubility and in particular, water solubility is essential for polysaccharides to employ their functional properties in the medicinal application. PEPA-2 is soluble in water and SPEPA-2 was highly soluble in water. The chemical composition of P3a and SP3a (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) is determined by measuring the content of sugar, protein and uronic acid. P3a contains 80.6% carbohydrate, 2.01 % protein and 7.55 % uronic acid. It was found that the contents of carbohydrate, protein and uronic acid in SP3a were 68.80 %, 0.50 % and 16.34 % respectively. Compared with natural P3a, the chemical composition of sulfated derivatives has changed significantly. The carbohydrate and protein content in SP3a increased significantly. Studies have shown that sulfated modification will change the chemical composition of P3a, which may affect the different bioactivities of polysaccharides. The outcomes of the tests are on par with the report on the sulfate modification of

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2019)</xref>. The uronic acid content is higher than P3a, which is due to slight degradation that may occur during the sulfation process. The present findings are on par with the study of
