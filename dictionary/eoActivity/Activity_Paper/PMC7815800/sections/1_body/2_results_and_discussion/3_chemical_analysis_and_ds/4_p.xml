<p id="p0130">The sulfur content detected in P3a was 3.02 %, but it increased to 7.50 % after sulfation and the DS was 0.498. The elements in P3a and SP3a were analyzed by CHN analyzer, and P3a contained 41.08 % carbon, 6.25 % hydrogen, 4.99 % nitrogen, and 2.79 % sulfur, followed by SP3a containing 41.11 % carbon, 6.11 % hydrogen, 3.87 % nitrogen and 8.09 % sulfur. The sulfur content of SP3a determined by elemental analysis is 2.79 % higher than that of natural polysaccharides, reaching 8.09 %, and the DS of SP3a is 0.443. The increased sulphate content of SP3a as compared to P3a indicates successful sulfation. These results are on par with the findings of
