<p id="p0145">The biological efficacy of polysaccharides is closely associated with its monosaccharide composition and was analyzed using HPGPC. The type of monosaccharide is determined by comparing the retention time among sample and standard. The compositions of standard monosaccharides, P3a and SP3a are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (A, B and C) and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> respectively. P3a and SP3a are heteropolysaccharides. P3a, contains xylose, arabinose, ribose, rhamnose, mannose, galactose and glucose, the molar percentage are 14.33, 29.94, 6.54, 9.76, 9.93, 24.70, 4.80, while SP3a consists of xylose, rhamnose, mannose, galactose and glucose, the molar percentages are 6.18, 1.53, 6.02, 78.42 and 7.86. Arabinose and galactose are the predominant sugars in P3a, while SP3a is galactose. Sulfated modification can change the mole percentage of each monosaccharide without changing the type of monosaccharide. In the absence of Rib and Ara, the mole percentage of Gal and Glu in SP3a increased, while the mole percentage of Xyl, Rha, and Man decreased. Our findings revealed that the sulfation modification changes the monosaccharide composition and additionally reduces the sugar content, which may be due to mild degradation of the polysaccharide backbone in the course of sulfation procedure (
