<p id="p0140">The biological activity of polysaccharides is affected by their molecular weight. As per the calibration curve of dextran standards, the molecular weight of P3a and SP3a was calculated to be 5.660 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 2.513 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> Da respectively as depicted in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results show that both P3a and SP3a are both low molecular weight polysaccharides. Low molecular weight polysaccharides have high biological activity and our findings agree with the literature of 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2008)</xref> and our findings are on par with the literature. It can be inferred from our research that the relative molecular mass of SP3a is less than P3a. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2019)</xref> reported that the M
 <sub>w</sub> of sulfated derivatives were reduced, compared to the native 
 <italic>R. virescens</italic> polysaccharide (RVP), which is consistent with the current findings. The decrease in M
 <sub>w</sub> may be owing to the mild degradation of polysaccharides, and these results are in agreement with earlier reports (
