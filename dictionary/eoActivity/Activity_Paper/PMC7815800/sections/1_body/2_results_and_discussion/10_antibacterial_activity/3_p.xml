<p id="p0215">It can be observed that SP3a shows stronger antibacterial activity than P3a, indicating that sulfation can improve antibacterial activity, which indicates that sulfation is an effective alteration to enhance the biological activity of polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). Sulfated modification of polysaccharides can enhance the destruction of the tested bacteria on the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of P3a, thus bringing the higher antibacterial activity of SP3a. Both P3a and SP3a can be used as effective antibacterial agents. Our results are in concurrence with earlier reports (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li and Shah, 2014</xref>), which revealed that the antibacterial activity against sulfated polysaccharides of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is stronger than natural polysaccharides.
