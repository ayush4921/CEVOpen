<p id="p0210">The inhibition ranges of P3a and SP3a at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for two Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>) and two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>) was 8.1–12.3 mm and 10.4–14.2 mm (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the most sensitive to P3a and SP3a has the largest inhibition zone. The inhibition zones of chloramphenicol against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were 24.6, 28.5, 25.3 and 20.8 mm, respectively. The inhibition zone of P3a and SP3a significantly inhibited the growth of bacteria. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of SP3a against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is higher than the antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, indicating that SP3a has a stronger antibacterial effect on Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria, which is in line with the research on sulphated
