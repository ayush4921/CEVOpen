<p>According to AChE enzyme inhibitory results of the compounds, converting intermediate compound 2 to final compounds moderately enhanced bioactivity with AChE, except compound 3e having sulfadiazine moiety. The most potent AChE inhibitor was compound 3f having sulfamerazine moiety in terms of Ki value. Among the pyrimidine bearing compounds 3e, 3f, and 3g, the compound 3f having one methyl group on pyrimidine ring was 1.5× more potent than dimethyl substituted derivative 3g while it was 3.8× more potent than unsubstituted derivative 3e. The substitution of secondary sulfonamide groups was found as a useful modification to increase AChE inhibition, except 3e.</p>
