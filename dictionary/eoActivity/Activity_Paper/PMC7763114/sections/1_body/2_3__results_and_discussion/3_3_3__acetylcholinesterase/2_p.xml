<p>Ki values of 3a–g were in the range of 8.91 ± 1.65 – 34.02 ± 5.90 nM. The compounds 3a–g were 1.4–1.7-fold more potent than the reference drug tacrine, except 3c and 3e. Compound 3f which has sulfamerazine moiety can be considered as a lead compound in AChE inhibition study with the lowest Ki (8.91 ± 1.65 nM) and IC50 (9.11 nM) values.</p>
