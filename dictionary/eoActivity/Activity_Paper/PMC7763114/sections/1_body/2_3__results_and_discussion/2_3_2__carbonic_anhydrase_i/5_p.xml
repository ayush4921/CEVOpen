<p>Regarding hCA II, the most potent compound 3c having sulfanilamide moiety was 2× and 5.8× more potent than reference AZA and the intermediate compound 2, respectively. All of the secondary sulfonamide derivatives were less effective on hCA II than primary sulfonamide. Additionally, the compounds 3a–g can be considered as selective hCA I inhibitors according to Ki values. Furthermore, the second lead compound was 3b having sulfaguanidine moiety while pyrimidine ring bearing compounds 3e, 3f, and 3g were less effective than 3b.</p>
