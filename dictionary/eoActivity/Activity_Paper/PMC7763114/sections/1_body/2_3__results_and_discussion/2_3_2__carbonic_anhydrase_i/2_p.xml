<p>The hCA I and hCA II isoenzymes were effectively inhibited by compounds 3a–g with IC50 values in the range of 19.80–28.88 nM (hCA I) and 21.00–30.13 nM (hCA II) while reference drug AZA had IC50 values as 46.75 nM (hCA I) and 38.25 (hCA II). Compounds 3a–g were found 1.6–2.4× and 1.3–1.9× more potent than reference AZA against hCA I and hCA II, respectively, by considering IC50 values.</p>
