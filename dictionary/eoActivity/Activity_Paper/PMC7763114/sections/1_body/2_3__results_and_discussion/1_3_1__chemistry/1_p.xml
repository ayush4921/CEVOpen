<p>In this study, compounds having the chemical structure of [ 
 <italic>N</italic> -(1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-oxo-3-((4-( 
 <italic>N</italic> -(substituted)sulfamoyl)phenyl)amino)prop-1-en-1-yl)benzamide] (3a–g, Figure 2), were designed and successfully synthesized for the first time (except compounds 3c and 3d) by conventional method using 4-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2-phenyloxazol-5(4H)-one (2) as an intermediate compound in acetic acid-sodium acetate reaction medium [31]. The chemical structures of the final compounds 3a–g and intermediates (compounds 1 and 2) were confirmed using spectral techniques. Primary sulfonamide sulfanilamide (3c) derivative and secondary sulfonamide derivatives as sulfacetamide (3a), sulfaguanidine (3b), sulfathiazole (3d), sulfadiazine (3e), sulfamerazine (3f), and sulfamethazine (3g) were synthesized. The compounds 3a–g were first reported in this study (except compounds 3c and 3d) [31].
