<p>Georgey et al. reported several compounds having similar structures with our target compounds in this study. They isolated 1,2,4-trisubstituted imidazolinones by heating 2-substitutedphenyl-4-(substituted benzylidene)oxazole-5(4 
 <italic>H</italic> )-ones, the appropriate sulfonamide derivative and freshly prepared fused sodium acetate in a boiling water bath while we obtained open chain benzamide derivatives under reflux conditions in glacial acetic acid [23]. According to our TLC, there were more than two main big spots in addition to slight spots. We tried several solvent systems to purify the crude, resulting in DMF-ethanol-water mixture being found as the most suitable crystallization solvent mixture to obtain pure compounds.
