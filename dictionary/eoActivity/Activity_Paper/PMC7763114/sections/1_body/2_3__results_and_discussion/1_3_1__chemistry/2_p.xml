<p>NH protons belong to benzamide moieties indicating open-ring forms of the compounds (3a–g, Figure 2) were in the range of 10.54–10.09 ppm and 10.12–10.09 ppm as singlet. -NH2 protons belonging to primary sulfonamide moiety were seen at 7.28 ppm while other -NH protons of the secondary sulfonamides were seen in the range of 12.71–10.39 ppm as singlet. In addition, β-proton of the 3-oxopropen-1-yl chain was observed in the range of 7.18–7.14 ppm for 3a–g. Methoxy protons on phenyl ring was also seen in the range of 3.77–3.76 ppm as a singlet. In addition to 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS, results also confirmed the proposed chemical structure of the final compounds 3a–g.</p>
