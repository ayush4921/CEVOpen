<p>CA isoenzymes (CA I and CA II) were purified using a Sepharose-4B-L tyrosine-sulphanilamide affinity chromatography [32]. Activities of CA isoenzymes were determined according to method by Verpoorte et al. [33]. The absorbance differences were recorded at 348 nm. The quantity of protein was determined at 595 nm according to the Bradford method [34]. The experimental procedure was given in detail in our previous papers [12, 35–37]. SSpectrophotometry-based Ellman’s method was used to test the compounds’ AChE inhibitory effects [38,39]. Acetylthiocholine iodide (AChI) was used as a substrate of the reaction. 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitro-benzoic acid) (DTNB) was used for the determination of the AChE activities. An activity (%)-[Compound] graph was drawn to calculate the inhibition effects of the compounds on CAs and AChE. The IC50 values were obtained from activity (%) versus compounds plots. Three different concentrations were used to calculate Ki values. The Lineweaver–Burk plots [40] were drawn, and calculations were realized as described [41].</p>
