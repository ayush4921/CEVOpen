<p>Current studies indicate that benzamide bearing benzene sulfonamides showed inhibitory potency against CA I, CA II, and AChE enzymes (Figure 1). 2-Hydroxy- 
 <italic>N</italic> -phenylbenzamides 1 (Figure 1) were reported as novel inhibitors of cholinesterases [11]. The benzamides moderately inhibited AChE with IC50 values in the range of 33.1 to 85.8 µM while their IC50 values for BuChE were in the range of 53.5–228.4 µM. Most of the compounds studied in literature inhibited AChE more efficiently than BuChE [11]. In a study, sulfonamide and its derivatives bearing benzamide moiety 2 (Figure 1) were declared as potent inhibitors of hCA II with IC50 values 0.09–0.58 µM [21]. 4-Amino-N-(5-sulfamoyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzamide derivatives 3 were investigated as inhibitors of CAI, CAII, CAVII, and CA IV in another study. Ki values of the compounds mentioned on hCA I and II were in the range of 6.7–335.2 nM (hCA I) and 0.5–55.4 nM (hCA II) while hCA IV and VII were inhibited with Ki values in the range of 29.7–708.8 nM (hCA IV), and of 1.3–90.7 nM (hCA VII) [25]. In a different study, benzamides bearing 4-sulfamoyl moieties 4 inhibited the hCA II, VII, and IX in the nanomolar ranges [26]. In another study, novel sulfonamide derivatives 6a–i (Figure 1), as novel carbonic anhydrase inhibitors which are candidates for glaucoma treatment were synthesized. In vitro results showed that the novel compounds had a significant inhibitory profile against hCA I and hCA II enzymes at the nanomolar levels. Ki values were in the range of 0.020 ± 0.0003 – 0.065 ± 0.0005 nM for hCA I and 0.011 ± 0.0001 – 0.045 ± 0.0004 nM for hCA II [27].
