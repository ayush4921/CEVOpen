<p>Bozdag M et al. reported CAs inhibitory studies of 2-benzamido-N-(2-oxo-4-(methyl/trifluoromethyl)-2 
 <italic>H</italic> -chromen-7-yl) benzamide 3aâ€“f (Figure 1), as selective inhibitors of the tumor associated with hCA IX and XII isoforms. Among the compounds reported, the trifluoromethyl derivative 3d was the most potent against these CA isoforms with Ki valuess of 10.9 and 6.7 nM [28]. In a different study, new series of indolylpropyl-piperazinyl oxoethyl-benzamido piperazines were synthesized and evaluated as multitarget-directed drugs for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In vitro results showed that at least four compounds displayed promising activity against AChE. Compounds 18 and 19 (Figure 1), (IC50 = 3.4 and 3.6 mM respectively) exhibited AChE inhibition profile in the same order of magnitude as donepezil (DPZ, IC50 = 2.17 mM) [29].
