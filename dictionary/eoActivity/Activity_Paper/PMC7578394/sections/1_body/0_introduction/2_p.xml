<p>Continuous cropping means that the same crop species or its relatives is sown on the same area of land over long-term. Even if the field management regime is good, the crop may still suffer from reduced crop growth and development, decreased yield quality, and an increase in disease (

It also reduces the number and types of antagonistic, beneficial bacterial groups, breaks the soil microbial flora balance (
