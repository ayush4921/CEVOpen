<p>The dilution curves for the bacteria and fungi (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) show that the soil and rhizosphere microbial diversity decreased with CC. Furthermore, microorganism diversity was lowest in SPb, but increased in the intercropping samples (ITb and IGb), even after CC with patchouli. NMDS was used to investigate the differences between the rhizosphere soil microbial communities in the four experimental groups. The MiSeq sequencing analysis suggested that there were distinct differences in the fungal and bacterial community structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The distance between the SPa and SPb samples indicated that the microbial community structure had a low similarity. After patchouli intercropping with turmeric, the distance between SPa and ITb was relatively close, which indicated the microbial structure became similar to SPa. The results indicated that intercropping with turmeric had improved the soil microbial structure.
