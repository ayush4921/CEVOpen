<p>The SPb showed large numbers of significant soil nutrient changes compared to SPa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These differences included decreases in pH, AK, and Ca, and increases in EC, OM, AN, P, Mo, and EB. However, the pH, AK, and Ca improved after intercropping with turmeric or ginger. The results indicated that intercropping turmeric or ginger with patchouli could change soil nutrient levels when the soil was used to continuously crop patchouli.
