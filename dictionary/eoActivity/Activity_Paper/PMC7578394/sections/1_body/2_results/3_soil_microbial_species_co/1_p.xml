<p>The cluster analysis, based on differential species abundance at the phylum level, revealed differences in microbial diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The results showed that the relative abundance of several phyla, including Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes in SPb, had decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The relative abundances of Mortierellomycota and Glomeromycota also significantly decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), but the Basidiomycota relative distribution substantially increased. The results showed a significant change in the abundance of those microorganisms after patchouli intercropping with turmeric or ginger. Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Mortierellomycota, and Glomeromycota may be beneficial microorganisms, and Basidiomycetes may be harmful fungi, which have a significant impact on the soil microbial community. The top 10 species in the sample with mean abundance were showed that the abundance of Paraburkholderia_caribensis, Humibacter_ginesengisoli, Xanthomonadles_bacterium_66-474, and Leucocoprinus_ianthinus in SPb were higher than Spa (
