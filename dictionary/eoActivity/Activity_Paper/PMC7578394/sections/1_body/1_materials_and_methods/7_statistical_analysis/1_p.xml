<p>A general statistical analysis was performed using OriginPro version 9.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, United States) and SPSS version 21.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Normality was checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity was confirmed by testing the homogeneity of variance. The mean separation between the experimental groups was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s multi-range test (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The alpha index comparison between groups was calculated using Welch’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test and the Wilcoxon rank test by the R project Vegan package version 2.5.3 (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Oksanen et al., 2010</xref>). Correlation coefficients were used to correlate the physical and chemical properties of the different planting patterns and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to analyze the MiSeq sequencing results. Heat maps were used to show the relative abundances of the fungal and bacterial communities, and a percentage of similarity analysis (SIMPER) was carried out using R software version 3.3.1 to assess the relative contribution made by each microbial taxon to the detected dissimilarity between samples (%). Redundancy analysis (RDA) and mantel test was used to correlate changes in the functional structures and soil properties due to the environmental variables. GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, United States) was used for the soil enzyme activity analysis, the patchouli chemical active ingredient analysis, and the soil microbial population analysis.
