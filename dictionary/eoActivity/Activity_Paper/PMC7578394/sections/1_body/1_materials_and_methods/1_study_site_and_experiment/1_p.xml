There were four experimental planting treatments, which were single patchouli group a where the patchouli had only been grown for the first time (SPa), single patchouli group b (SPb) where patchouli had been grown for a number of years, a continuously cropped patchouli intercropped with turmeric group (ITb), and a continuously cropped patchouli intercropped with ginger group (IGb). Each site was 2 m × 20 m and was divided into two ridges. Each treatment was repeated three times.
