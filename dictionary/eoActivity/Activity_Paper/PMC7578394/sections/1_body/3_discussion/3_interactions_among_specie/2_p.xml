<p>Therefore, we concluded that intercropping may increase the concentration of nutrients required by plants in the rhizosphere by increasing the content number of microorganisms related to nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism, which is beneficial to the growth of improves patchouli growth. Turmeric and ginger are likely to probably secrete secondary metabolites, which increase the content of Actinomycetes contents in the rhizosphere of patchouli, thereby, and it enhances the defense against pathogenic bacteria. The volatile oil components released by from turmeric and ginger have a bactericidal effect (
