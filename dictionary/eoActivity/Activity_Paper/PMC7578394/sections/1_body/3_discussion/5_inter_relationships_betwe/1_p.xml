<p>An RDA analysis showed that pH and Ca are essential factors that shape the composition of soil microbial communities. Furthermore, pH and Ca were positively correlated with Verrucomicrobia, and the protease, dehydrogenase, urease, and phosphatase enzymes. The results also showed that pH and Ca were positively correlated with each other. Related studies have shown that soil organic carbon, water content, electrical conductivity, and pH may affect microbial communities (

Our results showed that most of the dominant groups of bacteria were correlated with AN, Ca, OM, and P, which indicated that soil chemical factors affect the bacterial community structure. The analyses also showed that AN, OM, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and dehydrogenases were all positively related. Dehydrogenases participate in the soil N cycle. It has been speculated that Actinobacteria and floating molds can promote dehydrogenase activity in the soil microenvironment, which leads to the accumulation of N elements and the accumulation of organic matter. Based on this, it can be inferred that Verrucomicrobia can change the pH of the soil by secreting a particular chemical substance and alter the protease, dehydrogenase, urease, and phosphatase activities in the soil, which would improve Ca levels in the soil.
