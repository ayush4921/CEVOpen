<p>The main role of functional gene expression could ensure the survival of bacteria by absorbing nutrients, amino acids, energy, carbohydrates, etc. (

Rhizosphere microorganisms of patchouli absorbed more nucleotides and amino acids from soil through these the expression of functional genes, which was conducive to the N cycle and participates in the P cycle by Lipid Metabolism. P is one of the most important elements required for plant growth, while the plants have relatively low absorption rate for P in soil (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al., 2017</xref>). Microorganisms can fix available P and convert it into microbial biomass P that were the most active part of soil organophosphorus (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Marschner et al., 2011</xref>). After many twists and turns, inorganic P is released to participate in nutrient circulation. In soil, the content of P is correlated with Acidobacteria playing an important role in helping plants to absorb P (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), which may be the reason for the increase of harmful bacteria during the CC patchouli. Microbial carbohydrate metabolism produces a series of substances. When they are sensed by plants as signal substances, they will cause changes in related enzyme activities or expressions of related genes in plants, regulate plant physiological metabolic processes and nutrient accumulation levels, and further promote plant growth and development (

The down-regulation of the signal transduction function may cause a decrease in the number of beneficial bacteria or an increase in the number of harmful bacteria, which will eventually lead to an imbalance in the soil micro-ecology.
