<p>Some previous studies have suggested that the ecological balance of the microbial communities can be reflected by the physical and chemical properties of soils (

The results showed that pH, AK, Ca, Cu, and the activities of four enzymes improved compared to SPb when intercropping was used, which was probably due to ginger or turmeric rhizosphere microorganisms. The normal physiological activities of those microorganisms promote biochemical reactions in the soil microenvironment by secreting extracellular enzymes and releasing intracellular enzymes into the soil. Therefore, intercropping improves the growth of microorganisms by adjusting soil nutrient levels (pH, AK, Ca, and Cu), and plays an important role in ameliorating the problems associated with CC (
