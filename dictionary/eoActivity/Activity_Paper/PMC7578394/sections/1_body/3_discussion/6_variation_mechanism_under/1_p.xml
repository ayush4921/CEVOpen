<p>Rhizosphere microorganisms can directly act on plants, promote or inhibit their growth, and change medicinal plant yield, quality, and active ingredient contents. Intercropping with turmeric or ginger increased baiqiuli contents when patchouli was continuously cropped (

Therefore, research on the symbiosis and interaction mechanism that controls rhizosphere microbes around medicinal plants will help regulate the microbial flora within or around the medicinal plants, which would improve the quality and yields of medicinal plant extracts.
