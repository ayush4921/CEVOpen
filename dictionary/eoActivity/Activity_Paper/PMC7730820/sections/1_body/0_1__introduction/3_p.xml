<p>Analytical tools, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), coupled with chemometric analyses (i.e., principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and discriminant analysis) have been recognized as comprehensive and useful techniques for the discrimination of geographical plants origins, chemotaxonomic authentication of botanical species, and quality evaluations of herbal medicines [
