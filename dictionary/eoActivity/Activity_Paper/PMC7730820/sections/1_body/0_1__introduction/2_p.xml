<p>Phytochemical content is usually specific to each plant organ. For example, 
 <italic>Empetrum hermaphroditum</italic> contains abundant anthocyanins and flavanols in the fruits, stilbenoids in the leaves, and catechins, procyanidins, and proanthocyanidins in the stems and roots [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Lycium intricatum</italic> has different phenolic compound and flavonoid levels in the fruits and leaves [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These properties are due to the fact that the genes in charge of phytochemical biosynthesis are differentially expressed in various plant organs and tissues. For example, gene expression differences in the different organs of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> results in biosynthesis differences in flavonoids, caffeine, and theanine [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, differences in cytochrome P450 genes are responsible for differences in diterpene biosynthesis in the different organs of 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Organ-specific differences in phytochemicals allows for each organ to fulfil its function, such as plant growth, herbivore, and microbial defense, pollinator attraction, flowering, pigment development, fruit development, and ripening, or allelopathy [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, determining the phytochemical contents of each plant part is an initial and crucial research step, since these chemical differences might contribute to variations in the biological or pharmacological efficacies of each part.
