<p>The distributions of the 
 <italic>Morus</italic> samples and their marker compounds were analyzed, then visualized using the chemometric tools. A matrix consisting of rows (
 <italic>Morus</italic> samples) and columns (marker compound contents) was used to perform the chemometric analyses. The quantitative differences in the 12 marker compounds were compared using the Tukey’s test. The differences were considered statistically significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The Tukey’s test and chemometric analyses were performed using open-source software R (v. 4.0.2; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
