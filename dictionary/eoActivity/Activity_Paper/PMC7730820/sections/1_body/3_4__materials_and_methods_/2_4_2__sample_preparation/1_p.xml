<p>Dried 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> samples were pulverized and homogenized using a 500 μm testing sieve (Chunggyesanggong-sa; Gunpo, Gyeonggi, Korea). The powder (40 mg) was weighed and extracted with 1 mL of 70% methanol (methanol:water = 7:3, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 30 min using an ultrasonic extractor (Power Sonic 520; Hwashin Tech, Daegu, Korea). The extracted solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, then the supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube after filtration through a 0.2 μm syringe filter (BioFact, Daejeon, Korea). The filtered extract was evaporated using a nitrogen-blowing concentrator (MGS2200; Eyela, Miyagi, Japan). The concentrated extract was dissolved in an HPLC-grade solvent mixture (methanol:water = 7:3, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) prior to HPLC injection.
