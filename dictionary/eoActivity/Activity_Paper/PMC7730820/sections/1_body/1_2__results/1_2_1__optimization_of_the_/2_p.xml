<p>The HPLC analytical conditions were optimized by adjusting the mobile phase modifier, the mobile phase composition, and the UV detection wavelength. The aqueous mobile phase composition with acetonitrile was compared to water alone and water with modifiers, including 0.1% Formic acid (FA) (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). The mobile phase composition of 0.1% TFA containing water and acetonitrile showed higher peak presence and better interpeak separations of the marker compounds. The UV wavelengths for the diode array detector were selected using the optimal UV absorbance for each peak: UV 255 nm for rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin; UV 265 nm for astragalin and kuwanon G; UV 275 nm for morusin; UV 290 nm for taxifolin; UV 310 nm for 4-hydroxycinnamic acid; and UV 325 nm for skimming, mulberroside A, chlorogenic acid, and oxyresveratrol (
