<p>It is reported that kuwanon G, an isoprenylated-flavone derivate, is synthesized and found in the root barks of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> as a Diels-Alder adduct of a chalcone and a dehydroprenylflavone [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Another isoprenylated flavone, morusin, is also contained primarily in the root barks of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A previous study reported that chalcone flavanone isomerase and flavonoid 3,5-hydroxylase, which are found only in roots, participate in flavonoid biosynthesis, which explains the characteristically higher accumulation of the two flavones in the root of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Two root bark samples (SB7 and SB11) did not contained mulberroside A, but contained taxifolin (dihydroquercetin) and interestingly very lower levels of kuwanon G and morusin. It is assumed that unexplained intrinsic or extrinsic factors disrupt the biosynthesis of mulberroside A, kuwanon G, and morusin simultaneously in two SB samples above.
