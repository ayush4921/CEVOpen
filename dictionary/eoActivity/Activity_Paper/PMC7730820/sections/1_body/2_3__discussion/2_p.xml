<p>In our findings, chlorogenic acid (3-caffeoylquinic acid) was found at the highest amount in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves, followed by rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-O-glucoside), as previously reported [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid is preferentially formed in the leaves of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> by shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), particularly MaHCT4, during the chlorogenic acid biosynthetic process [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Isoquercitrin is derived from quercetin primarily in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves via flavonol-3-O-glucosyltransferase (F3GT), and is subsequently transformed to rutin via flavonol-3-O-glucoside-L-rhamnosyltransferase (UGT78D1), particularly MaUGT78D1, which was expressed more in the leaves than in the other medicinal parts during the glycosylation of flavanols [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, skimmin (umbelliferone-glucoside) and astragalin (kaempferol-3-O-glucoside), which were found only in the leaves, were also considered to be distinct compounds in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], where F3GT catalyses the biosynthesis of astragalin [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Quercitrin was found in a wide variation in the leaves of the different leaf samples, but its presence was not supported by previous studies.
