<p>PharmMapper Server is a freely accessible web-server designed to identify potential target candidates of small molecules for a given probe by means of pharmacogenetic mapping [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Meanwhile, the DRAR-CPI server can identify targetable proteins for small molecules by chemical-protein interactome analysis [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both are powerful tools for computational target fishing. The structures of RA were sketched using ChemDraw (Professional 18.0, CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA, USA) and uploaded to the PharmMapper and DRAR-CPI servers. All parameters were set to default values, and the top nine protein targets were selected separately from two servers for further investigation.
