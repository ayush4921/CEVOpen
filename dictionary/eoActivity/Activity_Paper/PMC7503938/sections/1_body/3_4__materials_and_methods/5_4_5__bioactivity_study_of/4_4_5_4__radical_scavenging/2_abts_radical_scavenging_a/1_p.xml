<p>The antioxidant activities of various solvent extracts were determined by a stable ABTS radical cation, following the method of Re [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with slight modifications. The generation of the ABTS cationic radical was completed by the reaction of the ABTS solution with potassium persulfate in the dark at room temperature for 12~16 h. In the presence of the hydrogen-supplying antioxidant, the ABTS radical will be reduced. After mixing 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate (final concentration), the resulting ABTS solution was diluted with water so that its absorbance at 734 nm was 0.7 ± 0.05. RA solutions (50 μL) in 95% ethanol at different concentrations (0.5–2.0 mg/mL) were mixed with ABTS solution (1.9 mL), and then the absorbances were read at ambient temperature after 3 min. PBS solution was used as a control. Each sample was operated in parallel three times.
