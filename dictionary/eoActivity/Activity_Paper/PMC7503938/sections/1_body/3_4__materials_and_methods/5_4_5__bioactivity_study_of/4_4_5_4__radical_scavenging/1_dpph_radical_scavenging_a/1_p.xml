<p>The DPPH radical-scavenging activity of different fractions was measured with a modified method, described by Shimada [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, RA solutions (100 μL) in 95% ethanol at different concentrations (0.5–2.0 mg/mL) were added to a 4 mL 0.004% (

 <italic>v</italic>) solution of DPPH in 95% ethanol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 28 °C. The scavenging activities on the DPPH radical were determined by measuring the absorbance at 515 nm after 10 min. The antioxidant activity was expressed as a percentage of the scavenging of DPPH: SC% = [1 − (absorbance of sample)/(absorbance of control)] × 100%. The control contained all reagents, except the extract. The DPPH radical scavenging activities of BHT at the same concentration were also assayed for comparison. All tests were performed in triplicate, and the means were centered.
