<p>The Topo I enzyme inhibitory activity was determined by measuring the conversion of supercoiled pBR322 DNA to relaxed isomers. Topo I and pBR322 were purchased from Takara Bio Inc., Tokyo, Japan. The reaction system (20 μL) was mixed with 2 μL reaction buffer solution, 0.5 μg pBR322 DNA, 2 μL of different compounds, 1 μL One unit of Topo I, and distilled water added to 20 μL, and this was reacted at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5% SDS, 0.25 μg/mL bromophenol blue and 15% glycerol. The reaction products were subjected to 0.8% agarose gel at 90 V for 50 min at room temperature, which was stained with 5 μg/mL ethidium bromide, after which imaging was conducted by the Bio-Rad Gel Doc
