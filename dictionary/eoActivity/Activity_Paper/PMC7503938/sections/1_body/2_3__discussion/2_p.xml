<p>Anti-angiogenesis might represent an important mechanism underlying anti-tumor activity. Oxidative stress represents a disturbance in the equilibrium status of prooxidant/antioxidant reactions in living organisms. The excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cellular lipids, proteins or DNA. Oxidative imbalance has been implicated in a number of diseases, including cancers, atherosclerosis and heart diseases, as well as the ageing process [

The DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assays have been widely accepted for estimating the free radical scavenging activities of antioxidants. We showed that this RA possessed the highest scavenging capacity on the DPPH radical and ABTS radical at 2.0 mg/mL, at 74.85% and 82.5% (
