<p>We reported and isolated a new pyranocoumarin, identified as RA, from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>D. benthami</italic> Prain. The content of RA in the extract was estimated to be 3.5%. It has been reported that coumarins exhibit excellent anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antioxidant and other pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, our findings suggest that the RA can be considered as one of the principal components for therapy in the plants from the 
 <italic>Dalbergia</italic> genus. The properties of this RA meet the requirements of Lipinski’s “rule of five”, and this suggested that it may be considered for compounds with oral delivery in mind [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the antineoplastic, anti-free radical activities and Topo I inhibitory activity of RA were predicted. It has been reported that the Topo I inhibitor activity could be the basis of anti-tumor activity [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the previous report, we chose the conformation with the highest score (7.89) for analysis [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the differences with this manuscript were the hydrophobic residue and bond length. Nevertheless, they all indicated that the hydrophobic interactions between the benzene ring of RA and hydrophobic residues of the Topo I-DNA complex were likely to be responsible for the stability of the docked complex, RA inhibiting the Topo I activity in an allosteric manner. The biological activity experiments showed that RA displayed an inhibitory effect on tumor cells, Topo I inhibitory activity and anti-angiogenesis activity in zebrafish embryos, as well as on free radical scavenging activity, which was reported as the basis of anti-tumor activity. These results were consistent with the predicted results by PASS online.
