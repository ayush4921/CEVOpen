<p>We isolated a new pyranocoumarin from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>D. benthami</italic> Prain, which was identified as RA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). It was shown that the structure of RA referred to a new linear pyranocoumarin. Next, we used the SwissADME software for an in-depth evaluation of the ADME-related properties of this RA. The values of Lipinski’s “rule of five”, such as the MW, log P, Hdon, Hacc and Rbon, can be seen in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03919-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In addition, the TPSA and solubility (Log S) of this RA were calculated as 78.13 (Å) and −4.80, respectively. Then, we predicted the biological activities of this RA using the PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) online tools and obtained the probabilities as being active (Pa) and inactive (Pi). We listed some of the most relevant activities according to the Pa values in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03919-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and found that the Pa values for the antineoplastic, anti-free radical activities and topo I inhibitory activity were 0.784, 0.655 and 0.379, respectively. To further analyze the topo I inhibitory activity of the RA by investigating the binding mode of the potent inhibitor of RA with the human DNA-TopoI complex, we carried out the molecular docking experiment using the Surflex-Dock in Sybyl 2.0 by Tripos Associates. The conformation was selected based on the Total Score (7.80) and C Score (4) for speculating the detailed binding mode in the site (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03919-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It showed that RA was located at the hydrophobic pocket, surrounded by the residues Glu356, Asn352, Asp533 and adenosine DC112, DA113 forming a stable hydrophobic binding. Furthermore, the oxygen atom in the amides group of the RA executed a moderate binding force by forming a hydrogen bond with the residues Arg362 (bond length: 2.83 Å) and Thr718 (bond length: 2.96 Å). Apart from the hydrogen bond force, the benzene ring of RA could also have an effect with the base pair DT10 and TGP11 in order to improve the π-π stacking force (
