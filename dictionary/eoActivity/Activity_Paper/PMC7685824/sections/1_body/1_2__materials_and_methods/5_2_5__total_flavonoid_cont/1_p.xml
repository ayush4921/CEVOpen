<p>Total flavonoid content was measured by the aluminum chloride colorimetric assay [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, an aliquot (1 mL) of the extracts or standard solution of quercetin (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 240 mg/L) was added to a volumetric flask. To the flask were added 75 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> and 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>. After 5 min, 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1 M NaOH was added, and the volume was adjusted by H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The solution was mixed well, and the absorbance was measured against the prepared reagent blank at 510 nm. The concentration of total flavonoid content in the test samples was calculated from the calibration plot (
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.0162
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0044, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.999) and expressed as mg quercetin equivalent/g of dried plant. All the determinations were carried out in triplicate.
