<p>Cytotoxicity of the extracts was investigated by using sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 24 hours. Each extract was diluted by DMSO to produce stock solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml except TTW, which was diluted by water. The stock solution was diluted serially by culture medium to produce a working solution (2, 20, 100, and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The seeded cells were treated with various concentrations of working solution of plant and remedy extracts and incubated for 72 hours. The final concentrations of extract in the seeded cell were 1, 10, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and the maximum final concentration of DMSO in the seeded cell was 1%v/v. The medium was replaced with cell culture media and the plates were continuously incubated at 37°C for three days in order to observe cytotoxicity after a recovery period. The cells were fixed with 40% trichloroacetic acid and the plates left at 4°C for 45 min. The media were removed and the cells were stained with 0.4% SRB in acetic acid. The %survival was determined by colorimetric measurement at 492 nm and calculated by the following equation. The half inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the extracts were calculated by using GraphPad Prism software (CA, USA)
