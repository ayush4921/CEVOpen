<p>Flavonoids, a group of phenolic compounds found in several medicinal plants, have a diverse range of derivatives depending on the substituted groups on their skeletal structure. This variety of flavonoids make the medicinal plants more valuable for their role in health promotion and prevention of several chronic diseases including cancer. In this study, we investigated the total flavonoid contents of the plants and analyzed their correlation with cytotoxicity against cancer cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the total flavonoid content of the extracts exhibited weak or no correlation to cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cells with coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) less than 0.35. However, in MCF-7, when the outlier data were excluded and the correlation recalculated, some extracts showed a strong correlation between total flavonoid content and cytotoxicity with the coefficient of âˆ’0.81 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This indicated that flavonoids found in plants such as 
 <italic>T. indica</italic>, 
 <italic>B. rotunda, and A. dahurica</italic> might be related to their cytotoxicity against MCF-7.
