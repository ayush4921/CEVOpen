<p>There has been an increasing interest in herbal medicine as an alternative treatment and prevention of cancer. Traditional Thai medicine is an alternative healthcare approach utilizing medicinal plants as a component in the holistic treatment of cancer patients [

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of selected Thai medicinal plants and remedy against cancer cells commonly occurred in women: breast (MCF-7), ovarian (SKOV3), and cervical cancer (HeLa). In the cytotoxic screening of 44 plants and two TTM extracts, the results were analyzed by HCA and visualized them into a heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Three major groups of the extracts were categorized by their cytotoxicity characteristics. Group I is composed of plant extracts which exerted less or no cytotoxic activity. Group II was the extracts that selectively exerted cytotoxicity against MCF-7. The extracts with moderate to high activity against all cancer cells were clustered into group III. With regard to the extracts obtained from the selected cancer remedy, TTW was not active against all tested cells, while TTE exerted moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7. These results indicated that the cytotoxic compounds were extracted from the remedy in a small amount. However, the results of cancer treatment by TTM may occur by the accumulation of the cytotoxic compounds in the body when it was taken for long-term multiple doses. In TTM, many plants in remedy are used as many functions or biological activities related to cancer such as antiinflammation, increase immunology, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities. Another reason, TTM extract may help with another mechanism on cancer treatment such as increased immunology or angiogenesis, when this remedy was absorbed in the patient's body. Thus, this suggestion should be clarify further studied including
