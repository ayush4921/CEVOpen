<p>Among the 44 plants in a selected cancer remedy used for cancer treatments, 17 plants are food ingredients in Thai cuisine and nine of them exerted significant cytotoxicity against the tested cancer cell lines. Eleven plants normally used in TTM were active against at least one of the cancer cell lines, while 66.7% of all extracts were active against all the tested cell lines. The remaining plant extracts may not have any cytotoxic activity but may be necessary adjuvants according to the TTM theory which considers the correction of the imbalance of body functions as an important aspect in designing a medicine. The correlation and HCA studies provided an alternative way to investigate the biological activities of plant ingredients in polyherbal traditional remedies. This method was designed to predict the correlation between their active components and biological activities. However, the results may not show a strong correlation between the active components in traditional remedies or mixed herbs and their cytotoxicity against cancer cells. This is because only some herbs in the remedy possess cytotoxic effects while the others are included to balance other physiological functions in the body to improve patient's well-being. Therefore, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are necessary to elucidate the true efficacy of herbal medicines. Hierarchical cluster analysis can help interpret the results of
