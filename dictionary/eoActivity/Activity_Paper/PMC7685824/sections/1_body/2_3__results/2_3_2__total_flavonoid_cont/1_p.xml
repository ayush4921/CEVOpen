<p>The total flavonoid content of the extracts is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> showed the highest content (259.7 ± 3.21 mg quercetin eq./g) followed by 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic> (259.70 ± 2.59 mg quercetin eq./g) and 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> (227.95 ± 5.69 mg quercetin eq./g). The ethanolic extract of the Thai traditional remedy showed total flavonoid content of 105.67 ± 4.33 mg quercetin eq./g. The correlation between flavonoid content and cytotoxic activity of the extracts was investigated. Total flavonoid contents of the extracts were plotted against their cytotoxic activities, and the correlation coefficients (
 <italic>r</italic>) were evaluated. The results showed that there was no correlation between the total flavonoid content of the extracts and their cytotoxic activity against all tested cell lines (
 <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.35) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, in MCF-7, when some outlier data were excluded, there was a strong correlation between flavonoid content and cytotoxicity with 
 <italic>r</italic> value −0.81 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
