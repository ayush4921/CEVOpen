<p>HCA is a multivariate statistical method to evaluate the pattern of data, which is classified into clusters according to their similar characteristics. The similarity or dissimilarity of the extracts is illustrated, as shown in the dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this study, 44 plant extracts and two Thai traditional remedy extracts were classified by HemI software based on their cytotoxic activity against all tested cancer cells. The euclidean metric was selected to evaluate the similarity of the cytotoxic pattern. The heat map was generated to visualize the intensity of cytotoxic activity, and the linkages of similar extracts were shown in the horizontal dimension. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, HCA classified 46 extracts into three main groups. The extracts expressing low cytotoxicity against cancer cells were clustered into group I. Group II was composed of the extracts that selectively exhibited cytotoxicity against MCF-7. The extracts showing cytotoxicity against two or more cancer cells were clustered in group III.
