<p>Apple and its peel are associated with good human health and experimental evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies indicative of its positive role in the prevention and treatment of diseases. Our review supports all the previous studies that have been reported. However, in many reported review articles, the literature is very insufficient. Our review focused on animal model studies, which are suitable as per the exact amount of concentration reported. In both in vivo and in vitro studies, the efficacy of nutrients present in apple against diseases was evaluated. At present, there is still a great prospect for the development and utilization of bioactive substances in apple. The consumption of apple and its processed products or extracts rich in polyphenols has been linked to reduced risk in cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and many other chronic diseases, including asthma. Polyphenols exert these health effects through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and by modulating biomarkers in various cell signalling pathways. While sufficient evidence has been found for some of the health beneficial effects, many of them still require further studies. Further research should focus on the extraction of more apple bioactive substances and the development of drugs and functional food that can prevent tumor, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. It will not only contribute to the protection of human health, but also provide economic benefits.</p>
