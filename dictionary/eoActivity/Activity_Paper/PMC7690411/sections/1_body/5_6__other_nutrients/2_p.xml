The vitamin C contained in apples can enhance human immunity, prevent pernicious anaemia, and also has good antioxidant and anti-ageing effects. Apple contains zinc, which is an indispensable element that constitutes nucleic acids and proteins that are closely related to memory. Zinc deficiency causes children’s hippocampus to develop poorly [

The average fat content of different varieties of apple seeds is about 21.98%, which is 4.92 times that of chestnut. The average protein content is 38.53%, which is 4.64 times that of chestnut. The fatty acid composition of apple seeds shows that the potentially dominant compounds are oleic acid (46.5%) and linoleic acid (43.81%). The physical and chemical properties of apple seed oil are comparable to edible oils, indicating that it has better stability and potentially used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Apple seed oil has the characteristics of high iodine and saponification value. Apple seed oil may be a good source of natural antioxidants and its antioxidant capacity (IC
