<p>Ohkami et al. (1995) found that apple pectin can significantly inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in rats. If 20% of pectin is added into the diet and feed rate, the incidence of colon cancer was significantly lower than the control group, suggesting that apple pectin can effectively prevent and suppress colon cancer [

In particular, it has a significant inhibitory effect on Hep G2 human liver cancer cell, MCF-7 human breast cancer cell, and CaCo-2 human colon cancer cell [

Animal experiments have found that long-term intake of apple pectin can enhance the intestinal absorption of quercetin [
