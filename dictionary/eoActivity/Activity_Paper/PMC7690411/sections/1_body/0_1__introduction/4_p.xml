<p>Also, many types of antioxidant compounds present in apple and apple peels have been reported such as catechin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, cyanidin-3-galactoside, procyanidin, coumaric acid, gallic acid, phloridzin, quercetin-3 galactoside and quercetin-3-rhamnoside. However, in apple flesh, there are some compounds found in a lesser amount, i.e., epicatechin, catechin, phloridzin, and procyanidin than in the peels. In apple, concentrations of compounds have been reported as quercetin glycosides, 13.2 mg/100 g fruit; phloretin glycosides, 5.59 mg/100 g fruit; procyanidin B, 9.35 mg/100 g fruit; chlorogenic acid, 9.02 mg/100 g fruit; vitamin C, 12.8 mg/100 g fruit; epicatechin, 8.65 mg/100 g fruit [

Finally, we will cast a future perspective of the apple bioactive substances in disease treatment and the development of functional healthcare food. We hope this review will help to understand the function of apple bioactive substancesand provide some new lights on the drug or functional healthcare food development from bioactive substances in apple.
