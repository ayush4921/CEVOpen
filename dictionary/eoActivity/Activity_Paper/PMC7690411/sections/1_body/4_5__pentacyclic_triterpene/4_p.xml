<p>Pentacyclic triterpenes, however, exhibit other interesting effects on the humans. For example, ursolic acid has significant anabolic effects on skeletal muscles, which plays a vital role in the process of ageing [

The same study has shown that ursolic acid strengthens neomyogenesis by increasing the number of satellite cells, and it increases the performance of skeletal muscles. Therefore it is a suitable candidate for the treatment of pathological states connected with muscle atrophy and muscle dysfunction, including atrophy of skeletal muscles, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sarcopenia, and metabolic diseases of muscles [
