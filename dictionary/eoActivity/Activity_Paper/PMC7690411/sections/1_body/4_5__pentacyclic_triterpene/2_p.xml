<p>Similarly, like apple polyphenols, pentacyclic triterpenes also exhibit many biological effects out of which the most significant is their cytotoxicity [

New therapeutic strategies also modify the microenvironment of the tumor to prevent angiogenesis, modulation of the immune response, or chronic inflammation, which is often associated with cancer. Especially triterpenes of lupine, oleanolic, and ursolic type [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01408" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], which are all richly represented in the apple peels, are very promising in this respect [
