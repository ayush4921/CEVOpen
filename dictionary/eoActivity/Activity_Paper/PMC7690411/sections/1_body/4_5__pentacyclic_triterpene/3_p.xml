<p>Most of these triterpenes exhibit a high anti-tumor potential with significant differences in human tumor cell lines. Acid 2α-hydroxy-ursolic,2α-hydroxy-3β-{[(2E)-3-phenyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl] oxy} Olean-12-en-28-oic acid and the 3β-p-trans-2α cumaroyloxy-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic, exhibited a higher anti-proliferative activity against the tumor cells of HepG2. Ursolic acid, 2α-hydroxy-ursolic, and 3β-trans-beta-cumaroyloxy-2α-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic exhibited higher anti-proliferative activity against the cancer cells of MCF-7. The anti-proliferative activity against the cancer cells of Caco-2 was exhibited by all pentacyclic triterpenes isolated from the apple peel, particularly by 2α-hydroxy-ursolic acid, maslinovo acid, 2α-hydroxy-3β-{[(2E)-3-phenyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl] oxy} Olean-12-en-28-oic acid, and the 3β-trans-beta-cumaroyloxy-2α-hydroxyolean-12-ene-28-oic, which had the highest level of the anti-proliferative activity [
