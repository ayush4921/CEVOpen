<p>Some phenolic compounds were quantified using the UHPLC Dionex 3000 RS with photodiode array detector at flavonoid (255 and 265 nm) and phenolic acid (330 nm) wavelength as reported previously carried out according to ICH Guideline Q2 (R1) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Barrientos et al., 2020b</xref>). Some curves for representative compounds, each one covering six points from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/ml solutions, in triplicate, and injecting 10 ml. The linearity of the chromatographic method developed was confirmed by the coefficients of determination all around 0.999. For kaempferol based compounds the calibration curve was performed with kaempferol standard, (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9989), and other phenolic acid were quantified using a chlorogenic acid curve (

Using PDA, the lowest detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits, 0.0115 and 0.0322 mg/L respectively, were obtained for kaempferol, while the highest limits, 0.5543, and 1.476 mg/l were for chlorogenic acid. For the quantification the prepared infusion was injected (10 ml) in triplicate at 25°C.
