<p>The Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) activity was determined according to the method previously reported by Huang with some modifications (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). Fluorescein (3′,6′-dihydroxyspiro[2-benzofuran-3,9′-xanthene]-1-one) stock solution (4 μM) was made in 75 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, stored at 4°C and used as the fluorescent probe (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). AAPH (203.4 mg) was freshly prepared in 15 ml of 75 mM phosphate buffer and used to generate the peroxyl radical. Trolox was used as internal standard. In all the experiments, 150 µl of fluorescein was added to each well. Blank wells received 25 μl of phosphate buffer, standards 25 μl of Trolox dilution, and samples 25 μl of the sample. Excitation was monitored at 485 nm and emission at 528 nm with a 20 nm bandpass on an HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. The results were obtained by quadratic regression equation (Trolox/samples vs. fluorescence decay curves) and expressed as μM Trolox equivalents per 100 g of the dry plant.
