<p>For the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) test, the methodology determined by (

 <sub>2</sub>O solution were prepared. Trolox was used as standard solution. Briefly, to some 100 µl of the solution (or standards at 1 mg/ml), 3 ml of the FRAP solution was added and mixed using a vortex, allowed to react in the dark at room temperature for 5 min. The absorbance measurement of the colored Fe-TPTZ complex was performed at 593 nm. Absorbance values were replaced in the Trolox standard curve equation (μmol/l). The results were expressed as mg equivalents of Trolox/100 g of the dry plant.
