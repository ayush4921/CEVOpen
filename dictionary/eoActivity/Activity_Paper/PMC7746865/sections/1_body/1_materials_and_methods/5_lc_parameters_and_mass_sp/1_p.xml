<p>Liquid chromatography was run using an Acclaim UHPLC C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm ID, 2.5 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) set at 25°C. The wavelength detection was 354, 254, 280, and 330 nm, and PDA was acquired from 200 to 800 nm for full characterization of peaks. Mobile phases employed were acetonitrile (B) and 1% formic aqueous solution (A) while the gradient program was: (time in minutes and % B), (0.00 min, 5% B); (5.00 min, 5% B); (10.00 min, 30% B); (15.00 min, 30% B); (20.00 min, 70% B); (25.00 min, 70% B); (35.00 min, 5% B) and 12 min for column equilibration before injections. The flow rate employed was 1.00 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the injection volume was 10 µl. Standards dissolved in methanol and infusions were maintained at 10°C during storage in the auto-sampler. The HESI II and OT spectrometer parameters were set as informed previously (
