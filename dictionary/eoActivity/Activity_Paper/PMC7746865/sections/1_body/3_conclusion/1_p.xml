<p>The potential antioxidant, antiprotozoal, and cholinesterase inhibition activity plus the chemical profiling of 
 <italic>Artemisia copa</italic> infusion were assessed. UHPLC-MS were used for the first time to detected 47 compounds in the infusion of the Altiplano plant, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first investigation on the cholinesterase inhibition activity. Our docking studies suggest that the inhibitory activity over the enzymes lies predominantly on kaempferol‐3‐O‐galactoside and kaempferol‐3‐O‐acetyl‐glucoside. 
 <italic>A. copa</italic> could be recommended as a supplementary beverage with cholinesterase inhibition potentials. The antiprotozoal evaluation showed no significant results against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>. However, should be considered that activity was evaluated in extracts where the potential active product(s) against these protozoa would be highly diluted. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the chemistry and biological activity of this plant.
