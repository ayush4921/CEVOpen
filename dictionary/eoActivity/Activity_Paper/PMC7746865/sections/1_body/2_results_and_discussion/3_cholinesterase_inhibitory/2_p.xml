<p>Regarding the constituents identified in the infusion of 
 <italic>A. copa</italic>, the literature has indicated that, for example, the increase of brain AChE activity was reported for citric acid, acting as a neuroprotective agent in animal models (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Salam et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding hydroxybenzoic acid, have evaluated the antioxidants and ChE inhibitors properties of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives as dual-targets (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>). In a previous report phenolic acids from malt, included hydroxybenzoic acid, showed efficient properties against AChE and BChE respectively (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Szwajgier and Borowiec, 2012</xref>). Chlorogenic acid exert protective effects on learning and memory impairment. Furthermore, 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments showed inhibition of AChE activity in hippocampus and frontal cortex. On the other hand, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments inhibit AChE activity with a IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 98.17 µg/ml (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>). Also, the combination of chlorogenic acid with caffeic acid displayed an antagonist response against AChE and BChE. The neuroprotective properties have been associated to the ChE inhibition, as well to the prevention of oxidative damage (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Oboh et al., 2013</xref>). AChE activity have been reported for 
 <bold>7-</bold>demethylsuberosin isolated from genus 
 <italic>Angelica</italic>, suggesting a potential agent for the AD (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Schaftoside isolated from the water layer of 
 <italic>Lycopodiella cernua</italic> (L.) Pic.Serm. showed strong inhibitory activity against BChE (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2015</xref>).
