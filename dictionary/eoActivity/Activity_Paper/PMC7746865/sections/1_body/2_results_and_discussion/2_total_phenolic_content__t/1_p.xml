 <italic>Artemisia copa</italic> infusions were assessed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) also, DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC assays were used to determine the antioxidant properties and are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are simple and widely employed for the evaluation of antioxidant power and ROS quenching (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Moon and Shibamoto, 2009</xref>). These results were compared to another very used Andean altiplano plant, 
 <italic>Aloysia deserticola</italic> (Phil.) Lu-Irving and O'Leary (syn. 
 <italic>Acantholippia deserticola</italic> Phil.) (Verbenaceae) previously reported by us (

 <italic>.</italic> Phenolic compounds are structurally diverse and comprise phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, chalcones, iridoids, among others, most of them bearing phenolic moieties that give them antioxidant and beneficial health properties. In this study three main classes of compounds were tentatively identified: organic acids, feruloyl and coumaroyl derivatives, plus flavonoids. In addition, 47 compounds were detected in their corresponding infusion, that could be responsible for the bioactivities reported. The results observed for TPC and TFC of 
 <italic>A. copa</italic> infusion were 155.6 ± 2.9 mg/g and the 5.5 ± 0.2 mg/g of dry plant, respectively. On the other hand, DPPH was performed to know the bleaching capacities of the infusion, and showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 89.72 ± 0.01 µg/ml infusion. While the ABTS and DPPH values for 
 <italic>A. deserticola</italic> infusions were 337 and 438 µg/ml (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Larrazabal et al., 2018</xref>). Also, the FRAP assay was conducted giving the lower antioxidant power obtained (6.2 ± 0.2 mg trolox equivalent per 100 g of the dry plant.) compared to the famous infusions of the arid plant 
 <italic>A. deserticola</italic> (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Larrazabal et al., 2018</xref>). This assay is based on the ability to reduce Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup> by antioxidants in a sample. Regarding the ORAC assay, the infusion value was 1989 ± 5.2 μM Trolox equivalents (TEAC) per 100 g of the dry plant. These values can classify these 
 <italic>A. copa</italic> infusions as moderate antioxidants properties, like edible fruits such as cherries, strawberries, and plums (
