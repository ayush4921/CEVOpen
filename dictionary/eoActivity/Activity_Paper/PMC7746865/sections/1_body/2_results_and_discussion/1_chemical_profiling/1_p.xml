<p>In this study, 47 compounds were detected and tentatively identified in the infusion of 
 <italic>A. copa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Previously, from a Argentinean sample of this plant 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, luteolin, chrysoeriol, and vitexin were reported, to present vasodilation (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gorzalczany et al., 2013b</xref>) also, some flavonoids were isolated from the sample: spinacetin, tricin, jaceosidin, axillarin, penduletin, and chrysoeriol which showed anti-inflammatory activity (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Moscatelli et al., 2006</xref>), the compound: 3,5-dihydroxy 6,7,3’,4’-tetramethoxyflavone was isolated previously and presented antimicrobial activity (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 2003</xref>). Several sesquiterpene lactones such as chrysartemin A, were also reported previously from this species (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente et al., 1986</xref>). In this work several compounds are reported for the first time in this species and the determination of those metabolites in this Chilean sample were characterized based on UV absorption and high-resolution mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns for the first time (

 <bold>30</bold> was not quantified, due to lack of standard.
