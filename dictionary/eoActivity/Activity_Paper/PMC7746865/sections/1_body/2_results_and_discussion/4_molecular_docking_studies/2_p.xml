<p>In 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE the binding energy descriptors for flavonoids kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside turned out to be better than for flavonoids apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-7-rhamnoside. Apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, as well as kaempferol-7-rhamnoside displayed deficient binding energies of 9.76 kcal/mol and 12.66 kcal/mol respectively, compared to -2.04 kcal/mol of kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and −1.27 kcal/mol of kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside, suggesting that the inhibitory activity over the enzyme lies predominantly in the first two flavonoids mentioned above. This could be explained due flavonoids kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside are arranged in similar manners into the catalytic site of the enzyme. In the same way, apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-7-rhamnoside are also closely overlapped between them. Therefore, both pairs of compounds carry out different interactions with the amino acids, although derivatives kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside performed hydrogen bond interactions with the amino acid Glu199 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The differences in the abilities to inhibit the enzyme and the differences in the binding energies of the four flavonoids, must be due because of the greatest amount of hydrogen bond interactions performed by kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside, as well as the π-π interactions (especially compared to T-shaped interaction in apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and only one π-π interaction in kaempferol-7-rhamnoside) performed by the phenyl ring of the 4
 <italic>H</italic>-chromen-4-one in kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside with the indole rings of Trp84 and Trp432 and with the same phenyl moiety in kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside and Phe330 of the 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE. The hydrogen bonding and the π-π interactions mentioned above must be stronger in kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside than those for apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-7-rhamnoside. For example, Trp bears electron-deficient aromatic rings, whereas the phenyl ring of kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside possesses an electron-donating hydroxyl group (−OH) causing a stronger interaction than apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside.
