<p id="par0040">Previous toxicity studies established relative safety of the EOs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and decoction in rats [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Extrapolation of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity to human is less reliable and there is a need for animal model toxicity study. Given the numerous studies confirming the medicinal use and wide traditional use of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> as inhalation, characterization of its EO toxicity profile is required in order to protect and promote public health. Hence, this is the continuation of our previous study [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to establish the acute and repeated-dose toxicities of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EOs. The study predicted the safety of the EO in human use, ensure the public safety, and promote further development.
