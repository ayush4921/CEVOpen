<p id="par0150">Lower albumin concentration observed among medium dose treated groups may be associated with the observed lymphocytic infiltrates which could confer some level of renal toxicity in medium-dose treated group. Renal inflammatory responses could increase renal excretion of albumin [

Renal toxicity dose-response curve in this study appears to be concentration-dependent peaking in the middle, while toxicity observed with middle-dose compared to a higher or a lower dose requires confirmation from a large sample size.
