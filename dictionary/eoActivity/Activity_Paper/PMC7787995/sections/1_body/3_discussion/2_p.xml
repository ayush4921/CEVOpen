<p id="par0130">The present study revealed the relative safety of EO of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> in a mouse model. Acute toxicity and repeated-dose 28-day toxicity studies did not show significant physiological alterations. No death was observed up to the 2000 mg/kg dose, and hence 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EO could be considered Category 4 according to GHS classification [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Changes observed in body weight, relative organ weight, food consumption, clinical chemistry parameters and histopathology were not significant in 28-day repeated-dose toxicity studies. However relative right kidney weight, AST and albumin levels in treated groups showed significant variations compared to controls. Food consumption, relative liver weight, relative left kidney weight, relative right kidney weight, and urea as well as albumin concentrations were observed to be higher in males compared to females.
