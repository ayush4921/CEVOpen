<p>Historically, FCB was firstly documented in “Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing” (a classic medical book of the Han dynasty) and has been widely used clinically owing to its remarkable antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic activities [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the development of separation and identification technique, numerous phytochemical investigations concerning FCB have been carried out during the past several decades. Also, many constituents derived from FCB have been identified, including steroidal alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, and glycosides [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among them, steroidal alkaloids have been regarded as the indicator agent for evaluating the quality of FCB [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, increasing pharmacological evidence indicates that FCB has a wide range of pharmaceutical properties, such as expectorant, antitussive, antiasthma, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which lay the groundwork for further clinical applications of FCB and trigger a growing enthusiasm among researchers for the ancient herb. Nevertheless, there is no systematic summary of the modern study findings of FCB. Herein, we provided a systematic review on the traditional uses, sources, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of FCB in this work, to provide a reference for further development and utilization of FCB.
