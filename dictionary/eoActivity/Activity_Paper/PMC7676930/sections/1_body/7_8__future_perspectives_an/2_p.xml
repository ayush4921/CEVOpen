<p>In the traditional viewpoint, it is commonly acknowledged that the major bioactive constituents of FCB are alkaloids. Also, a large proportion of pharmacological and chemical studies are focused on them. Moreover, the content of alkaloids has been regarded as an important index to evaluate the qualities of FCB. However, the chemical researches have shown that FCB has the lowest levels of alkaloids compared with other

 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which indicates that saponins may play a pivotal role in the pharmacologic activities of FCB. Hence, it is necessary to conduct more pharmacologic studies to investigate the biological activity of saponins and other compounds from FCB, and more chemical investigations are recommended to concentrate on the other compounds of FCB.
