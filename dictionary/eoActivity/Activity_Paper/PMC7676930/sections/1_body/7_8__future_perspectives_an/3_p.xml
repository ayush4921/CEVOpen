<p>In the past few decades, extensive studies have attempted to assess the pharmacological effects of FCB. To our best knowledge, FCB exerts unexceptionable therapeutic effects on various diseases, including cough, expectoration, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and some type of cancers, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of its pharmacology actions are still unclear. For instance, the antitussive and expectorant activities have been demonstrated in the previous studies, but the hidden mechanism is not fully understood. Therefore, we should conduct more molecular studies to gain a broader knowledge on the mechanism of FCB's pharmacologic action in future. Additionally, there are not enough studies regarding the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of FCB or its active ingredients. More profound evaluations are required to investigate the pharmacokinetics of other constituents besides alkaloids from FCB. Also, the toxicity studies focusing on molecular levels are still a promising direction.</p>
