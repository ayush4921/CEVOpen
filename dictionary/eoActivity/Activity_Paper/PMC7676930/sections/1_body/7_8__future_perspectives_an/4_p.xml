<p>In the recent years, the growing market demand leads to a rapid rise of the price of FCB. The price of FCB was beyond $260 per kilogram in 2014, almost nine-folds of that in 2004, and it is much higher than other Fritillariae Bulbus [

However, it is very difficult to distinguish those fakes from FCB by conventional morphological analyses because they have similar morphological characteristics [

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Recently, some identification methods based on chemical analyses, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to identify and determine isosteroidal alkaloids, which are also inadequate for distinguishing Fritillariae species because the content of chemical compositions is often affected by different practices of planting, harvesting, storage, and manufacturing [

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Thus, an accurate and efficient identification method should be imminently explored to control the quality of this herb and ensure the drug safety of FCB. Currently, DNA barcodes have been confirmed to be an effective tool for rapid and accurate species discrimination. It could identify plants species by employing a short and standardized DNA region [

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Based on the previous investigation, ITS2 sequences (a DNA barcode) could successfully distinguish the six original species of FCB from other Fritillariae species. Nevertheless, it is incapable to distinguish the six original species of FCB from each other [
