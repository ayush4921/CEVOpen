<p>Nucleosides belong to a class of organic compounds with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic nucleobase and a 5-carbon sugar [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They have attracted attention because of their multiple pharmacological effects, such as antitumor, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fungal effects [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Recent chemical investigations suggested that nucleosides are present in the water extract of Fritillaria Bulbs [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which indicates that nucleosides may participant in the pharmacological activities of FCB. To date, more than 10 nucleosides have been isolated and identified from FCB, such as uracil, thymine, cytidine, inosine, and thymidine. The details of that are shown in
