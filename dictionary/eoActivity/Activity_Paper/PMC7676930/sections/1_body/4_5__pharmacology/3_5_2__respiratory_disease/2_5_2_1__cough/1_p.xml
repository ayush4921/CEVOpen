<p>Cough is a crucial defense mechanism which maintains airway patency and eliminates the potential harmful stimuli from the airway and lung [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Generally, cough is mostly caused by the common cold [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. FCB has been used to suppress cough in China for thousands of years. A large number of studies have been carried out to explore the ameliorative effects of FCB on cough. An in vivo study has evaluated the antitussive activities of the alkaloids derived from FCB. Also, the results indicated that imperialine, chuanbeinone, peimine, and peiminine (1.5, 3.0 mg/kg for 1 h) obviously enhanced the latent period of cough and inhibited the cough frequency in mice [

 <italic>β</italic>-N-oxide (1.5–4.5 mg/kg for 1 h) establishe mitigative effects in mice with cough [
