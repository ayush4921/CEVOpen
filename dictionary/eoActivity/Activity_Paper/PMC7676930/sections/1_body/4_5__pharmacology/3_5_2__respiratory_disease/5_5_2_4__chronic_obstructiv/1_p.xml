<p>COPD has long been considered as a severe public health problem. It is urgent to find new compounds for minimizing the risk of this disease [

 <italic>β</italic> (p-GSK3
 <italic>β</italic>) while increasing the expression of phosphorylated myosin light chain2 (p-MLC2). Increasingly, an FCB-based traditional Chinese medicine formula, Chuan Bei Pi Pa dropping pills (50–200 mg/kg for 35 days), has been demonstrated to block the progression of COPD through decreasing the number of leukocytes [
