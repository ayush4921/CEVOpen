<p>During the past years, the anti-inflammatory effects of FCB have attracted more and more attention. On the grounds of the previous studies, total alkaloid fraction of FCB (0–14 mg/kg/day for 7 days) could significantly attenuate carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Consistently, Wang et al. pointed out that the alkaloids isolated from FCB, including imperialine, chuanbeinone, peimine, and peiminine (1.5, 3.0 mg/kg for 0.5 h), could inhibit the xylene-induced mice ear edema in a dose-dependent manner [

 <italic>β</italic>-N-oxide, isoverticine, and isoverticine-
 <italic>β</italic>-N-oxide (1.5–4.5 mg/kg for 0.5 h), also have been found establish similar anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, Yi et al. suggested that peimine (0–25 mg/L for 18 h) suppressed the inflammatory response through inhibiting the expression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, p38, ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p65, and I
 <italic>κ</italic>B and increasing the productions of IL-10 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages [

 <italic>μ</italic>M for 24 h) could dose-dependently inhibit the expression of nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and p–NF–
 <italic>κ</italic>B p65 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Furthermore, another study has indicated that treatment with the five isosteroid alkaloids derived from FCB (including imperialine, peiminine, delavine, peimisine (0–40 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for 24 h), and peimine (0–10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for 24 h)) could inhibit the productions of NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 and suppress the activation of ERK1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages [
