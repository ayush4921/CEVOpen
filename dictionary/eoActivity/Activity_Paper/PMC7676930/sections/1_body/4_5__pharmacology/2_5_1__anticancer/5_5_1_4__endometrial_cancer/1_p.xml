<p>As research continues, some studies have discovered that the FC-AE has huge therapeutic potential in endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. For instance, Bokhari et al. illustrated that FC-AE (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h) could markedly repress the growth of endometrial cancer cells through downregulating the transforming growth factor-
 <italic>β</italic> (TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>)/Smad signaling pathway [

Additionally, another study denoted that FC-AE (200 mg/mL for 96 h) prominently inhibited the viability of ovarian and endometrial cancer cells, which involves the accumulation of S-phase cells and the increase of apoptotic cells. Further investigation showed that FC-AE attenuated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B subunit p50 (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>Bp50), p-I
 <italic>κ</italic>Ba, cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and augmented the expression of p27 and caspase-3. The results given above indicate that FC-AE suppresses progression of endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer by activating apoptotic pathways and cell cycle arrest, as well as abrogating the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathways activation [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 0–72 h) notably blocked the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cell through inducing apoptosis via increasing G0/G1 phase cell arrest [
