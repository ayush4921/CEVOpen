<p>As a major bioactive constituent of FCB, peiminine has been validated to exert promising antitumor effects. Based on the past studies, peiminine (3 mg/kg/2 days for 14 days) could significantly repress the growth of transplantable HCT-116 tumor in mice through inducing apoptosis and autophagy. The molecular mechanism was related to the enhancement of microtubule-associated protein light chain3B (LC3B) and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Analogously, it was discovered that the cell viability was dose-dependently decreased in colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells treated with peiminine (0–400 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for 24 h). The positive results may ascribe the elevation of the ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I and the upregulation of phosphorylated Unc51-like kinase 1 (p-ULK1), phosphorylated adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 levels, as well as the damping of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), p-Akt, phosphorylated phosphatase, and tensin homolog (p-PTEN) activities [

 <italic>μ</italic>M for 48 h) could trigger the death of HCT-116 cells by promoting apoptosis and autophagic flux via modulating the production of metabolites, such as glucose, glutamine, oleate, and lignocerate [
