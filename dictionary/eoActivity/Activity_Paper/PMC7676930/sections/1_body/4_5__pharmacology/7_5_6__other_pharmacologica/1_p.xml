<p>FCB is a natural agent with various pharmacological effects; in addition to the abovementioned pharmacological effects, other biological activities have also been reported in many researches in the last few decades. For instance, peiminine (0–5 mg/kg for 28 days) markedly attenuated behavioural dysfunction and inhibited the loss of dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the LPS-induced Parkinson's disease rat model. Moreover, it was ascertained that peiminine (0–50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mLfor 13 h) obviously decreased the expression of the proinflammatory mediators TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6 and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, COX-2, and iNOS by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B p65 in LPS-induced BV-2 cells [

 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, COX-2, iNOS, AKT, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>Bp65, ERK1/2, and p38. Consistent to the results, peiminine (0–70 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 4 h) inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced mouse mammary epithelial cells via repressing AKT/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 24 h) performed hypoglycemic activities by enhancing the levels of insulin and glucose uptake ability in b-TC6 pancreatic and C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, which implies that peimine has huge therapeutic potential in diabetes [
