<p>Over the past several millennia, it is generally assumed that FCB is a nontoxic or low toxic herb. To date, few studies focused on the toxicity of FCB. Recently, the acute oral toxicity of FCB has been assessed by an in vivo study. The results revealed that the maximum feasible dose value of FCB in mice was 452.14 g/kg. There were no mice dead after administering the FCB extract at the maximum feasible dose for 14 days. In the histological examination, only the liver showed significant pathological changes [

It was demonstrated that FC-AE (80 and 160 mg/mL for 72 h) caused mitotic aberrations and genomic instability by inducing spindle assembly checkpoint dysfunction [
