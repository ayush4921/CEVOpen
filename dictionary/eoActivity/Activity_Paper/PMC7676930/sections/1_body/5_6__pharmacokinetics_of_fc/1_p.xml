<p>In the past few decades, the pharmacokinetics studies of FCB mainly focused on its alkaloids, such as imperialine, peimisine, and peimine. Imperialine has high oral bioavailability, and a previous study have shown that the bioavailability of administered imperialine at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg was 31.2%, 53.6%, and 47.4%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, the half life of imperialine is short, and if prepared, imperialine is supposed to be taken, at least, at three times a day, which will certainly degrade the patient compliance. Nevertheless, the sustained-release imperialine tablets based on hydroxypropylmethylcellulose could significantly prolong the drug action time and simultaneously improve the oral bioavailability [

To further evaluate the intestinal absorption characteristics of imperialine, an in vitro study found that the uptake of imperialine was increased with increasing PH and concentration in Caco-2 cells. Also, some transporters, such as P-glycoprotein and Niemann–Pick C1-Like 1, did not participate in the absorption. Additionally, based on the in situ assessments, the absorption of imperialine varied in four intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon). Among them, the colon displayed the highest level of absorption [

Also, the results suggested that peimisine was slowly distributed and eliminated from rat plasma and showed linear dynamics in a dose range of 0.26–6.5 mg/kg. Moreover, peimisine was primarily distributed in the spleen, liver, kidney, heart, and lung. Intriguingly, the drug blood and tissue levels in male rats were apparently higher than the female counterparts after oral administration. Moreover, it was confirmed that the major elimination route of male rats was urine excretion after oral peimisine [

The results showed that the oral bioavailability in male rats (45.8%) was much higher than in female rats (2.74%). Nevertheless, peimine was metabolized more extensively in female rats than in male rats, and peimine had good tissue penetrability and high tissue affinity in most studied tissues [

They found that peimine transport was concentration dependent and was increased with increasing PH (6.0–7.4), and P-glycoprotein may participant in the transport of peimine [
