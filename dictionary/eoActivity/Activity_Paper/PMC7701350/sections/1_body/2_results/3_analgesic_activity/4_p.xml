<p id="p0120">The effect of extract of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> fruit (ZAB) and isolated alkaloids (ZABA) was investigated for writhing response in mice and the results are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It was found that both ZAB and ZABA caused a significant inhibition of writhing in mice at 300 mg/kg (36.49%, p &gt; 0.05) and 100 mg/kg (38.53%, p &gt; 0.001) dose-dependent inhibition on the writhing response in 10 min time.
