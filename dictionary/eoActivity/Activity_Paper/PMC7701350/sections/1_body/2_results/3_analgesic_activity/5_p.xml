<p id="p0125">Analgesic effect of fruit extract (ZAF) and crude alkaloids (ZAFA) was evaluated by performing tail-flick test. The time in which mice flick the tail from the water bath was noted for all the doses of whole extracts and crude alkaloids and was compared with the effect of the standard drug (tramadol). The effect of ZAF (at 200 and 300 mg/kg) and ZAFA (100 mg/kg) was significant (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001) and was more pronounced in case of crude alkaloids as compared with standard drug Tramadol. It showed that crude alkaloids have the ability to reduce the pain in mice and effect was similar to standard drug.
