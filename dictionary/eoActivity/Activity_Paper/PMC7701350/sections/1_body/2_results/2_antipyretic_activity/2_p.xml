<p id="p0090">Effect of methanol extract of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> fruit (ZAF) and isolated total alkaloid fraction (ZAFA) on pyrexia induced body temperature in mice is shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The subcutaneous injection of 10 ml kg–1 of 15% w/v of yeast suspension prominently raised the rectal temperature after 19 h. It was found that ZAF at doses of 300 mg/kg caused a significant (p &lt; 0.01) decrease of body temperature in mice up to 5 h. Similarly, ZAFA caused a significant (p &lt; 0.001) lowering of rectal temperature in mice after 5 h and these result were comparable to Paracetamol which was used as a standard drug. The sample ZAFA (100 mg/kg) showed a similar pattern of pyrexia control as shown by standard drug and temperature was started reducing from 1st h.
