<p id="p0215">Results showed that carrageenan-induced paw edema was decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) with fruit extract (ZAF) and crude alkaloids (ZAFA). The degree of swelling of the carrageenan-injected paws was maximal 3 h after injection and the mean increase in volume at that time was about 100% in the control group. Statistical analysis showed that the edema inhibition of extract and crude alkaloids at higher doses were a little less from the effect exerted by standard drug (diclofenac). Anti-inflammatory activity of bark, leaves and root extracts and crude alkaloids from
