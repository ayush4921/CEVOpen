<p id="p0220">The extract and crude alkaloids from 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> were also tested in vitro for cyclooxygenase inhibition assay to explore the mechanism of action. It has been reported that different groups of alkaloids showed promising COX inhibitory activities. Alkaloids also have the ability to reduce the inflammatory responses by suppressing COX 2. The famous COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, celecoxib, parecoxib, and etoricoxib. These drugs have also been advised not to use in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis unless there is no other option. Therefore, search for new COX inhibitors and especially from natural sources is the demand of the time. A lot of studies have shown alkaloids as potent inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and suppressors of PGE2. This role is helpful in reducing inflammation and growth of tumor cells (
