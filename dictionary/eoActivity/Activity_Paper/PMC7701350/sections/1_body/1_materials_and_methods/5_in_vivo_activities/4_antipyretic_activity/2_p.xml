The animal was fasted overnight but supplied with drinking water ad libitum. Rectal temperature of mice was recorded after 17 h. Induction of pyrexia was confirmed by 0.5 °C rise in temperature. The animals with a raised temperature of less than 0.5 °C were excluded. The extract, crude alkaloids, standard (Paracetamol), and normal saline (vehicle) were administered intraperitoneal and the rectal temperature of mice was noted at 30 min intervals for 5 h subsequent to the administration of plant extract.
