 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> (fruit ZAF, leaves ZAL, stem bark ZAB and root bark ZAR and corresponding total alkaloids ZAFA (alkaloids from fruit), ZALA (alkaloids from leaves), ZABA (alkaloids from stem bark), and ZARA (alkaloids from root bark), respectively) was investigated using the model of carrageenan-induced mice paw edema. Inflammation was induced as previously employed protocol (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kifayatullah et al., 2019</xref>). Methanolic extract, total alkaloid fraction, standard (Diclofenac sodium) and normal saline as vehicle were administered intraperitoneal 30 min before the injection of carrageenan. The water displacement method was used to measure the paw volume using Plythysmometer before and after carrageenan injection for 1, 3, and 5 h.
