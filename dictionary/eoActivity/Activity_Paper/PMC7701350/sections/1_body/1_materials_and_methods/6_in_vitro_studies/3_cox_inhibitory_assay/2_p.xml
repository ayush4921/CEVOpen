<p id="p0070">Human prostaglandin H synthase isozyme (hPGHS-I) expression occurs in cos-1 cells. The COX activity was determined by using microsomal membranes (ca. 5 mg protein/ml in 0.1 M Tris HCL, pH 7.4). The membrane was sham-transfected cos-l cells. During the assay the temperature was kept at 37 °C. The starting rate of O
 <sub>2</sub> was monitored employing O
 <sub>2</sub> electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth). The test mixture was consisted of 3 ml of 0.1 M Tris HCI′3 ml of 0.1 M Tris HCI (pH 8.0), 1 mmol phenol, 85 μg Hb and 100 p mol Arachidonic acid. Reaction was started with the addition of 5–25 μg of microsomal protein at a volume of 10–20 μl. Instant cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity was measured by adding aliquots of microsomal suspensions of hPGHS1 (10 μmol 02/min cyclooxygenase activity/aliquot) to test mixtures comprising 10 μmol arachidonate and 1000 μM concentrations of the extract/total alkaloids. The results were compared with the standard drug Aspirin (
