 <italic>Wistar</italic> strain rats aged between 8 and 12 weeks with an average weight of 170 g were used for the acute oral toxicity study. Concerning the subchronic oral toxicity study, a total of forty (40) albino rats of both sexes (20 males and 20 females) of 
 <italic>Wistar</italic> strain aged between 8 and 12 weeks, with an average weight of 170 g were used. They were maintained in an animal room at temperature of 20 ± 2 °C under a standard animal room condition of 12 h light/dark cycle; the animals were raised in the animal house of the Biochemistry Department of the University of Dschang. They were fed with a standard rat feed and had free access to water. The acclimatization of the animals lasted two weeks, during which time it was ensured that they were in good health before testing. There is no ethical committee regarding research on animals in Cameroon.
