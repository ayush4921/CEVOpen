<p id="p0175">The main organs subjected to damage following exposure of an organism to a product are the liver (as the main organ of metabolism) and the kidneys (as the main organ of elimination). The histopathological examinations performed on these two organs in this study showed some slight alterations both on the liver and kidneys at doses 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day but there were no signs of toxicity following a long exposure (28 days) of the extract to methanol from
