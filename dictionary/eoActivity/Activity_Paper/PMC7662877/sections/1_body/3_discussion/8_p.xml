 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Onyeyilli et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, after administration of the extract from 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> at different doses in rats, there was no significant difference between the haematological parameters of the test groups compared to those of the control group in female rats. However, in male rats some differences were observed, including an increase in WBCs and Granulocyte levels at doses 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. This could be attributed to the boosting capacity of the immune system of the test animals by the bioactive molecules in the extract (

 <italic>P. capense</italic> fruits at doses 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. A possible explanation would be the insufficient erythropoietin production impeding the synthesis of RBCs by the bone marrow due to the adverse effect of the biologically active molecules contained in the extract at these doses (
