<p id="p0125">Today we are increasingly witnessing not only a resurgence of diseases that were once controlled by the scientific community, but also the emergence of new diseases causing a significant number of deaths worldwide. In the search for ways and means to deal with these diseases, scientists are increasingly turning to natural sources (plants) as this is considered a field that is diversifying due to secondary metabolites and very little has been explored so far. Large groups of secondary metabolites are the target of scientists because they are known for their diverse biological activities. However, these same compounds with significant toxic effects well established in literature (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bello et al., 2016</xref>) may be harmful to human organisms as they are considered to be the main beneficiaries. The search of plants with the best bioactive compounds including the data on the study of their toxicity is therefore an absolute necessity. That is why this work with the aim of evaluating the acute and subchronic oral toxicities of the methanol extract from 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> fruits used in Cameroon as an edible plant was carried out. Several studies have demonstrated its biological activity, but none of the studies has evaluated its toxicity, hence the importance of this work.
