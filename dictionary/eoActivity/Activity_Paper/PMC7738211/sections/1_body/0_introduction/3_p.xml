<p>Many advantageous findings were reported for the uridine derivatives especially its esters. For example, uridine 5′ esters showed neuroprotective effect and is capable of compensating the harmful effect of neurotoxins with the increase the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels (Susilo, 2008). 3′,4′-Uridine acetonide (

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some uridine esters were found to exhibit promising antimicrobial properties (Kabir, Matin, &amp; Kawsar,
