<p>Quantum mechanical (QM) methods has gained attention on calculation of thermodynamic properties, molecular orbital features, dipole moment and as well as interpretation of different types of interactions. Molecular geometry optimization and further modification of all uridine derivatives carried out using Gaussian 16 program. All the structures were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) employing Becke’s (B) three-parameter hybrid model, Lee, Yang and Parr’s (LYP) correlation functional under 3-21G basis set (Kruse et al.,
