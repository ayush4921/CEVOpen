<p>Online computational approaches were made to predict absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) for 5′-

 <italic>in silico</italic> screening approaches employing pkCSM server (

The pkCSM signatures were successfully used across five main different pharmacokinetic property classes to develop predictive regression and classification models (Pires et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Firstly, all the structures of uridine esters were drawn in ChemDraw 16.0 to collect InChI Key, isomeric SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system), and SD file format. ADMET of all the uridine esters were predicted by using pkCSM-pharmacokinetics and SwissADME free web tools (
