<p>In our present study, twelve uridine-based esters with different side chain length and different groups 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> were used as test chemicals. These compounds (mainly 5′-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>t</italic>-butylbenzoyl esters of uridine), as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>, were synthesized from 
 <bold>1</bold> by direct method and well characterized earlier (Chowdhury et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For comparative study, uridine (
 <bold>1</bold>), standard antibacterial antibiotic ampicillin and antifungal antibiotic nystatin were also used.
