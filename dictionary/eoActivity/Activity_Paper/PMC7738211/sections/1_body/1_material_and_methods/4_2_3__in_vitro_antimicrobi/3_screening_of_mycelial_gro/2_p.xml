Necessary amount of medium was taken in a conical flask separately and was sterilized in an autoclave (at 121 °C and 15 psi) for 15 min. After autoclaving, weighed amount of test chemical (2% in DMF) was added to the sterilized medium in conical flask at the point of pouring to obtain desired concentration. The flask was shaken thoroughly to mix the chemical with the medium homogeneously before pouring. The medium with definite concentration (2%) of chemical was poured at the rate of 100 μg/mL PDA in sterilized glass petri dishes individually and subjected for incubation. Finally, linear mycelial growth of fungus was measured after 2–5 days (24 h interval) of incubation. The percentage of radial mycelial growth inhibition of the test fungus was calculated using the following equation:
