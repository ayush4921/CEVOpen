 <italic>In vitro</italic> antibacterial activities of uridine 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> were conducted by paper disc diffusion method (Kabir et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Matin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which was determined by the presence or absence of diameter of zone of inhibition (in mm). In this method, initially a 2% solution of the uridine compound(s) in DMF was prepared. Mueller-Hinton (agar and broth) medium was used to culture the bacteria. Paper disc of 4 mm in a diameter and petri plate of 70 mm in a diameter was used throughout the experiment. These paper discs were sterilized in an autoclave and dried at 150 °C in an electric oven. Then, the discs were socked with test compound(s) at the rate of 100 μg (dry weight) per disc. These paper discs were put in the petri-plates and were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h for growth of test organisms followed by the cooling for 4 h at low temperature (4 °C). The test chemicals diffused from disc to the surrounding medium by this time. The growth inhibition was calculated at 24 h intervals for two days. Each experiment was carried out three times. All the results were compared with the standard antibacterial antibiotic ampicillin (50 μg/disc, brand name Decapen, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Bangladesh). Ampicillin was also used as a positive control and proper control was maintained with DMF without chemicals under identical conditions.
