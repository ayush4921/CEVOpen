<p>Covid-19, toxicity and evolution of MDR organisms in the microbial world caused a huge threat, and hence, novel antiviral and antimicrobial drugs preferably with newer mode of action, and reduced side-effects are essential. In this context several uridine esters were analyzed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> for their antimicrobial, thermodynamic, molecular docking and drug likeness properties. The study revealed that chloro-substituted benzoyl esters 
 <bold>13</bold>â€“
 <bold>15</bold> of uridine were more potential against fungal organisms with better pharmacokinetic and drug likeness spectra. In addition, some aliphatic acyl esters especially with lower carbon chains (C2-C6) showed promising binding score with COVID-19 main protease (7BQY). In this promising context, more drug likeness 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study such as nontoxic concentration towards healthy cells may be conducted in the near future.
