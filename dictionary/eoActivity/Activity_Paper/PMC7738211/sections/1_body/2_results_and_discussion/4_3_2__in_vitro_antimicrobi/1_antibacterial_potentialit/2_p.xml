<p>For the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial efficacy test we followed disc diffusion method (Kabir et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The results of diameter of inhibition zone (mm) of the uridine-based esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> against four Gram-positive, and five Gram-negative bacteria are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). It was evident that these esters are less susceptible towards both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, and similar results were reported for other uridine esters (Kabir, Matin, &amp; Kawsar, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Kabir, Matin, Kawsar, &amp; Anwar, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Kabir, Matin, Mridha, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Kabir et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>b). Amongst the uridine derivatives, compound 
 <bold>8</bold> (C6 chain) and 
 <bold>10</bold> (C12 chain) showed moderate inhibition against 
 <italic>B. megaterium</italic>, 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Also, mesyl derivative 
 <bold>6</bold> and chlorobenzoyl derivatives 
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> showed very little antibacterial functionality which is in agreement with the PASS results (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In general, compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> were found more prone against Gram-negative pathogens than the Gram-positive organisms.
