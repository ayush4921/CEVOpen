<p>On the other hand, saturated fatty acyl esters with

 <bold>8</bold> smaller chain length (C2–C6) showed slightly better binding score (–7.9 to –8.0 kcal/mol) than chlorobenzoyl esters 
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> (–7.6 to –7.8 kcal/mol) with 7BQY (COVID-19 main protease). Methanesuphonyl ester 
 <bold>6</bold> (–6.6 kcal/mol) and HQC (–6.1 kcal/mol) had lower binding energy. The present results, thus, might have pave the way for discovery of novel drugs related to COVID-19 treatment although related further study is needed.
