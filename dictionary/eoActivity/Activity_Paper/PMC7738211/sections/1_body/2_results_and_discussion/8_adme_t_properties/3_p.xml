<p>We have also calculated their toxicity values along with standard antibiotics. hERG (human ether‐à‐go‐go‐related gene I) showed negative values for these compounds like nystatin. Hence, these compounds could be safe and will not generate QT syndrome like fatal ventricular arrhythmia (Matin, Bhattacharjee, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Matin, Bhuiyan, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Matin, Chakraborty, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition, it is important to consider the lethal dosage (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) values and is used to assess the relative toxicity of different molecules. Here, most of the ester's LD
 <sub>50</sub> values (&lt;3 mol/kg) are in good consistent with the value of nystatin (2.52 mol/kg).
