<p>Drug likeness calculations were calculated from SwissADME tool and are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0009" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>. For comparison both the uridine esters and standard antibiotics' drug likeness values were calculated. It was found that all the esters (except mesylate 
 <bold>6</bold>) have good hydrogen bonds donor and acceptor which is in consistent with the Lipnski's rule of five. The more the value topological polar surface area (TPSA) more the polarity of the compounds and should be less than 140 Å
 <sup>2</sup>. The TPSA in these molecules was in excellent agreement (∼143 Å
 <sup>2</sup>) with the most important rules of drug likeness (Lipinski et al.,
