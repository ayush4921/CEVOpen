<p>Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) related pharmacokinetic profile is mentioned in 
 <xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. It is evident that these compounds possess better absorption value than standard antibiotics (ampicillin and nystatin) although they are P-glycoprotein inhibitor (except 
 <bold>15</bold>). Distribution like BBB (&gt;–1) and CNS (&gt;–2) permeability values are comparable to standard drugs. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold> are CYP3A4 enzyme substrate while 
 <bold>15</bold> is non-substrate for this enzyme. Their excretion, presented as total clearance, is comparable to ampicillin.
