<p>The HOMO and LUMO energies, HOMO-LUMO gap (Δ����), hardness (
 <italic>η</italic>), softness (
 <italic>S</italic>) and chemical potential (
 <italic>µ</italic>) index of all compounds are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, energies of HOMO and LUMO play an important role in chemical reactivity. The HOMO-LUMO gap is also related to the chemical hardness, softness, chemical potential and electrophilic index of a molecule (Cohen &amp; Benson, 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Lien et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Large HOMO-LUMO gap is responsible for high kinetic stability and low chemical reactivity. On the other hand, small HOMO-LUMO gap is important for low chemical stability, because addition of electrons to a high-lying LUMO and/or removal of electrons from a low-lying HOMO is energetically favorable in any potential reaction. In these esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>, Δ���� value was found lower than uridine (
 <bold>1</bold>), and thus, favorable for energetically favorable reaction. We noticed that, with the increase of the number of ester group(s) and chain length (
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) hardness of these compounds gradually decreased while their softness gradually increased. All these properties may contribute to show higher chemical activity and polarizability in the drug related chemical and biochemical functionalities.
