<p>The molecular structure significantly influences the structural properties such as free energy (
 <italic>G</italic>), enthalpy (
 <italic>H</italic>), dipole moment and electrostatic potential. Spontaneity of a reaction and stability of a product can be predicted from Gibb’s free energy, enthalpy and electronic energy. Free energy (
 <italic>G</italic>) is a significant criterion to represent the interaction of binding partners, where negative value favorable for spontaneous binding and interaction. Greater negative values predict better thermodynamic properties. In the present study, all the uridine esters possess greater negative value for 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic> than the parent uridine, and hence, indicated that the attachment of ester group could improve interaction and binding of these molecules with different microbial enzymes. Due to these higher values (–2990 to –3903 Hartree) chlorobenzoyl esters 
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> exhibited better inhibition against 
 <italic>M. phaseolina</italic>. In addition, these increased negative values of compound 
 <bold>4–15</bold> suggested that these are energetically and configurationally more stable.
