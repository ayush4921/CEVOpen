<p>In the present study, twelve uridine esters with different aliphatic and aromatic chains (
 <bold>4–15</bold>) were selected as test compounds, and screened for their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial and antifungal activities against nine bacteria and, and three phytopathogenic fungi, respectively. Initially, we predicted these activities using PASS program followed by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> determination. The observed activities were then rationalized by calculating their physicochemical (DFT method), cytotoxicity (shrimp), molecular docking and ADMET properties. Finally, all these findings were used to summarize their structure–activity relationship (SAR).
