<p>New 1,2,4-triazine derivative 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> has been shown to exert potent antitumor activity on CRC. It effectively inhibits cell survival in BTK-dependent mechanism and apoptosis was the main response of CRC cells to 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> treatment. This new synthesised compound successfully reduces tumour development in zebrafish embryo xenograft model. 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> possesses cytotoxic, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activity and its effectiveness is much higher compared with the standard chemotherapy for CRC, i.e. 5-FU. The discovery of an innovative therapeutic option that improves the prospects of treating patients is currently a crucial challenge. There is a real chance that the results presented in this study will help in the development of a new, effective therapy, which could be an attractive alternative to the already existing methods of colon cancer treatment.
