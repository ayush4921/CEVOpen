<p>Another interesting and little studied in the group of 1,2,4-triazines condensed with a five-membered heterocycle is the pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>e</italic>][1,2,4]triazine ring system. Its derivatives are the least known in the group of condensed pyrazolotriazines and were less studied compared to pyrrolotriazines. Some synthesised derivatives of this system were evaluated for their anticancer activity against five type tumour cell lines (CEM, CEM-DNR, K-562, K-562-tax, and A549) and they showed antiproliferative activity against A549 cell line in the micromolar range
