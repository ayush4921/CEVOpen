<p>Therefore, the search for new lead structures and chemical entities for the development of new effective anticancer agents is an increasingly important task in medicinal chemistry. This trend of global research includes work on the use of 1,2,4-triazine scaffold as a source for the design of biologically relevant molecules with well-known broad biological applications
