 </xref>. Screening results revealed that compound 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> exhibited strong inhibition activity towards DLD-1 and HT-29 (two of the cell lines of CRC). It showed potent antiproliferative effects against colon cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 3.1 µM compared to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and roscovitine (RSC) with values above 10 µM. 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> has a similar chemical structure to RSC, which is in the clinical trial phase. We also evaluated the mechanism of action of novel sulphonamide derivative and found that it plays anticancer roles through inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and activation of apoptosis. In this study, we successfully developed zebrafish xenografts with human DLD-1 and HT-29 CRC cells and validated these models with anticancer drug 5-FU, used clinically to treat cancer patients. We found that 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> effectively inhibits tumour development in both DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts.
