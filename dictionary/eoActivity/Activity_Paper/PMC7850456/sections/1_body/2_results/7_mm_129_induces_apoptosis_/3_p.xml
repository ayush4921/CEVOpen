<p>A decrease in MMP is one of the earliest changes associated with PCD. During apoptosis, the permeability of the external and the internal mitochondrial membrane is increased. As a consequence, the mitochondrial proteins are released into the cytosol through the outer membrane, e.g. cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). The exposure to RSC, 5-FU, and 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> for 24 h resulted in the loss of membrane integrity in both colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (

The rate of MMP-disrupted cells was increased in a concentration dependent manner. This effect was particularly seen in the case of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a concentration of 3 µM, where the percentage of cells with decreased levels of MMP reached 71.3% and 81% for DLD-1 (
