<p>The antiproliferative activity of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> and the reference drugs (RSC, 5-FU) were also examined in a zebrafish embryo model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). At a constant temperature of 28.5 °C (ST), the ZF egg cleaves first at 45 min post fertilisation forming the two-cell stage egg. Zebrafish embryos reach 4-cell, 8-cell, and 64-cell stages within 1, 1.25, and 2 h post fertilisation (hpf), respectively. Subsequently, they enter into the blastula stage (2.25–5.25 hpf), the gastrula stage (5.25–10 hpf), and the segmentation stage (10–24 hpf) to finally hatch out between 48 and 72 hpf

 </xref>. In untreated eggs, we observed normal embryo development revealed in consecutive synchronous cleavages. This process was disturbed in embryos exposed to 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, RSC, and 5-FU. At 1 hpt (hours post treatment), 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>-treated eggs showed a deterioration of cell division, cell disorientation, and initial signs of cell fusion. Within the next 30 min, fusion dramatically progressed in 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>-treated eggs, while the control eggs continued cell division without any apparent delay. When zebrafish eggs were treated with RSC and 5-FU, they developed normally for 1 h up to the four-cell stage, and then at the eight-cell stage they showed proliferation arrest. After two hours of incubation, we noticed complete cell fusion and lysis in groups exposed to 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> and RSC. 5-FU did not show such strong changes during the study period. No alteration in cell division and development in untreated control eggs were observed.
