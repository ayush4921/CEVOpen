<p>Stimulation of the extrinsic pathway starts with the activation of death receptors. After binding the appropriate death ligand, the receptors accumulate in clusters in the cell membrane and promote the recruitment of adapter proteins. These proteins have the death effector domain (DED), through which they interact with procaspase-8 and procaspase-10. The receptor, adapter protein, and procaspase form the complex DISC, that led to the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10, and subsequently cell death. The activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10 was determined after 24-h treatment with RSC, 5-FU, and 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> by FLICA Caspase-8 Assay Kit (

It was shown that tested compound increased the expression of the active form of caspase-8 and caspase-10 in both cell lines. The highest percent of cells with the active form of caspase 8 was observed for 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a 3 µM concentration, and it was 81.2% on DLD-1 cell line and 67.8% on HT-29 cell (

 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a 3 µM concentration; the percentage of cells with the active form of initiator caspase-10 was 42.9%. The highest percentage of HT-29 cells expressing active caspase-10 was also evoked by compound 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, and it was 37.9% (
