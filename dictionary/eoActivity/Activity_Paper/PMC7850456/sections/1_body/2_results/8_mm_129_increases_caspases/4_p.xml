<p>The caspases-3/7 belong to the group of executive caspases. Procaspases-3/7 are cleaved into their active forms, caspase-3 and caspase-7, by activated caspases-8, -10, and -9. Using flow cytometry, it was examined whether the process of PCD in the studied cell lines initiated by new pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>e</italic>]tetrazolo[1,5-
 <italic>b</italic>][1,2,4]triazine derivative and reference compounds is related with caspase-3/7. The obtained results showed that 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> increased the expression of the active form of caspases-3/7 in DLD-1 and HT-29 cell lines (

 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a 3 µM concentration in both DLD-1 and HT-29. The percentage of cells with active executive caspase-3/7 was 74.8% on DLD-1 and 57.9% on HT-29 cells, respectively (
