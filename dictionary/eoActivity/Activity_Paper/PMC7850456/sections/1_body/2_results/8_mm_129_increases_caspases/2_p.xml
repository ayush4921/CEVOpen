<p>Caspases play a major role in the activation of apoptosis. There are two main pathways that can lead to the activation of caspases: the internal (mitochondrial) and the external (receptor) pathway. The first path leads to mitochondrial membrane perturbation and release of cytochrome C to the cytosol. This protein binds to the Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 in the cytoplasm creating a multiprotein complex-apoptosome, which activates executive caspases. Hence, the effect of RSC and 5-FU or 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> on the activation of caspase-9 was examined after 24 h incubation (

 <italic>b</italic>][1,2,4]triazine derivative leds to an increased expression of caspase-9 in both cell lines. In the DLD-1 cell culture, compound 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a 3 µM concentration showed a stronger effect on the activation of caspase-9 than the reference drugs. In this case, the percentage of cells with the active form of this initiator caspase was 78.7% (

 <bold>MM-129</bold> at the same concentration.
