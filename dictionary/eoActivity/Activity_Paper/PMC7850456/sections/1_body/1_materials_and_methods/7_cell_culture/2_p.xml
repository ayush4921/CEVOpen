<p>Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 (CCL-221) and HT-29 (HTB-38) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The DLD-1 line histologically is the most similar to a primary tumour. Line HT-29, in turn, is used to assess multidrug resistance, absorption of nutrients, and chemically induced differentiation of enterocytes. Cells (passage number range of 6–8) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and McCoy’s 5a medium (ATCC), respectively, complemented with 10% of foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% of antibiotics: penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained in an incubator, which provides optimal growth conditions for cell culture: 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C, and humidity in a range of 90–95%. The cells were cultured in 100 mm plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). Subsequently, after obtaining a subconfluent cell culture, the cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (Corning, Corning, NY). Then, utilising a haemocytometer, the number of cells was quantified and seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in six-well plates (“Nunc”) in 2 mL of the growth medium (RPMI 1640 and McCoy’s 5a). In the present study, cells that obtained 80% of confluency were used.
