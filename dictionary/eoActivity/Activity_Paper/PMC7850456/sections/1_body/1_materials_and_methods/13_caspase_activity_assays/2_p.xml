<p>Detection of caspase-8, -9, -10, and -3/7 activity was assessed with the appropriate kit (caspase-8: FLICA Caspase-8 Assay Kit, caspase-9: FLICA Caspase-9 Assay Kit, caspase-10: FLICA Caspase-10 Assay Kit, caspase-3/7: FLICA Caspase-3/7 Assay Kit). DLD-1 and HT-29 were incubated for 24 h with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> and reference drugs, RSC and 5-FU, in two concentrations: 1 µM and 3 µM. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in the required buffer (93 µL was gently mixed with 5 µL required FLICA and 2 µL Hoechst 33342) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Then, the cells were washed twice with apoptosis wash buffer and centrifuged at 300×
 <italic>g</italic>. After preparing, the samples, the cells were resuspended in 100 µL buffer and labelled with 10 µg/mL propidium iodide. The experiment was performed using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and the results were parsed with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences Systems, San Jose, CA). The values were obtained from three independent experiments done in duplicate (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6).
