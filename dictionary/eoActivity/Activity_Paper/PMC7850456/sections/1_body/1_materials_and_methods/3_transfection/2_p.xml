<p>HT-29 and DLD-1 cell lines were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A day before transfection, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were seeded per well in 24-well plate. Transfection was performed using 1000 ng of the plasmid DNA (pmR-mCherry Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, cat no. 632542), 1.5 μL Lipofectamine
 <sup>®</sup>3000 Reagent and 1 μL P3000™ Reagent per well, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were selected 48 h upon transfection for another 2 weeks in 1 mg/mL of Geneticin (G418) (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Polyclonal cells after selection were reseeded on 96-well plate in density one cell per well. A monoclonal clone with high mCherry expression was selected for further research. After selection, the monoclonal cells remained stable (mCherry expression) without the addition of G418 for 4 weeks before experiments were carried out.
