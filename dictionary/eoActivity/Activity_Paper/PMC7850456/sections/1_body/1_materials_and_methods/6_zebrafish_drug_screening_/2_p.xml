<p>The zebrafish (
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at 28.5 °C in E3 buffer in 30 L aquaria at a rate of one fish per litre of water with cycles of 14/10 h of light/darkness and fed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Research Animals Department of the RSPCA. The use of animals in scientific research in Europe is governed by the Directive 2010/63/EU of 22 September 2010. According to EU Directive earliest life-stages of zebrafish (embryo and eleutheroembryo cultures) are regarded as equivalent to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture therefore, do not fall into the regulatory frameworks dealing with animal experiments. In contrast, experiments with the free‐feeding larvae older than 120 h of development are classified as animal experiments and require permission. The rationale is that active hunting reflects a perception of environmental stimuli that go beyond simple reflexes. This is taken as an indication of a mature nervous system that controls behaviour. In our experiment, we used zebrafish larvae younger than 120 hpf (hours post-fertilisation) therefore ethic approval was not required. Zebrafish embryos were obtained from mating adults, maintained and raised as described previously

 </xref>. The final volume of the medium in each well was 2 mL. DMSO was used as a drug solvent. The final concentration of DMSO in the wells did not exceed the damaging concentration of above 0.1%. The mock control embryos were incubated in embryo medium in the presence of 0.1% DMSO. The drug effect was recognised when all the eggs from one well changed in the same characteristic manner. Each experiment was carried out in three independent experiments. Observations of cell division and development of the zebrafish eggs were carried out using SteREO Discovery.V8 stereo microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) once every 15 min within the first three hours of incubation.
