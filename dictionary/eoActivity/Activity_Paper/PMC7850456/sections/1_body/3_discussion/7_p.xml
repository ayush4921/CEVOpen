<p>An increasing number of experimental and clinical studies indicates a major role of BTK not only in B cell malignancies but also in other solid tumours, including breast, ovarian, prostate, and colon cancer (BJP)

 </xref>. To investigate the mechanism involved in antitumor effects of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells, the level of pBTK was determined. We observed that new 1,2,4-triazine derivative significant decreased levels of active form of BTK in both cell lines. Previously, it has been demonstrated that BTK plays an important role in the development of tumours via activation of antiapoptotic pathways

 </xref>. In turn BTK inhibition besides blocking NFκB-DNA binding, reducing proliferation, survival and cell migration, is able to induce apoptosis

 </xref>. This is in line with our results because treatment of DLD-1 and HT-29 with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> resulted in BTK inhibition and activation of apoptosis (
