<p>We also tested the synthesised compound for its effects on cell survival using DLD-1 and HT-29 cell lines. Cytotoxicity assay revealed that the novel 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> was more effective than hitherto used agents, including RSC and reference drug 5-FU. The available evidence indicates dose-dependent cytotoxicity of RSC with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 15 to 25 μM in multiple myeloma cells, from 18 to 22 µM in cervical carcinoma (C33A, HCE-1, HeLa, SiHa) and 67.55 µM in human glioblastoma A172

 </xref>. New 1,2,4-triazine derivative displayed a significantly higher potency compared with the currently used compounds as well as other triazine derivatives. 1,2,4-Triazine derivatives bearing thiophene moieties were tested for their cytotoxic effect against Hep-G2, MCF-7, and HCT-116. Their impact on the viability of cells after 48 h incubation were assessed using paclitaxel as a reference drug and they presented IC
