<p>Our results are in agreement with Jiang et al., who synthesised 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide derivatives and demonstrated that they determined apoptosis in cancer cells by inducing a loss of MMP

 </xref>. Mechanism studies of other 1,2,4-triazine derivatives bearing an extra 1,2,4-benzotriazine-1-oxide chromophore also revealed that the cytotoxic activity seems to be due to the activation of caspase 3/7 and G2/M arrest-mediated apoptosis

 </xref>. Herein, RSC or 5-FU used at low concentrations had no effect on apoptosis. This is in line with previous reports indicating that 5 FU induces caspase-dependent apoptosis of CRC cells at concentrations of 50 µM

 </xref>. We intentionally used the same concentrations for all compounds, both tested and reference. Our results clearly indicate that new 1,2,4-triazine derivative is an apoptosis-inducing factor with higher efficiency than RSC or 5-FU.
