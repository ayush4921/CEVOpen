 </xref>. The mechanism of apoptosis is highly complex, multistage, and involves many pathways. Based on the mechanism of RSC action, which is widely described as an effective inducer of apoptosis and apoptosis-dependent cell death (Hep-G2, MCF-7, HCT-116), we assessed the impact of new 1,2,4-triazine derivative on several apoptotic pathways

 </xref>. As has been summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>, the tested compound affected several cellular targets involved in the induction of apoptosis-dependent cell death. First, we noticed significant accumulation of apoptotic colon cancer cells with externalised PS after incubation with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>. To explore the cellular mechanism, by which the synthesised compound triggers induction of apoptosis, we examined the alterations of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase activity by using flow cytometry analysis. We found that new derivative increased the number of cells with decreased levels of MMP and contributed to a marked increase in the activity of all tested caspases compared with the control cells in both lines.
