  <p>The down-regulation of Bruton’s kinase (BTK) expression by 
   <bold>MM-129</bold>. Phosphorylated BTK (pBTK) expression was determined by Western blot (a) and confocal microscopy (d) in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells treated with 
   <bold>MM-129</bold>, roscovitine and 5-flurouracil in two concentrations: 1 µM and 3 µM for 24 h. The band staining was quantified by densitometry (b, c). Samples used for electrophoresis consisted of 20 µg of protein from six pooled cell extracts (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). ***
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001 vs. CON intensity of cytoplasmic/nuclear fluorescence was analysed in cell populations. Images of cells labelled with FITC were obtained using a 515LP emission laser and a 488/10 excitation laser (d).
