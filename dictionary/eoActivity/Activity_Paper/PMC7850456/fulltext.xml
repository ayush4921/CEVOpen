It is expected to cause about 53,200 deaths during 2020<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Treatments against CRC are surgery, drugs (hormonal therapy and chemotherapy), radiation, and/or immunotherapy. For patients with CRC, chemotherapy remains the most common treatment. However, it is often followed by tumour relapse and acquired chemotherapy-resistance. An effective drug for therapy and prognosis after surgery still does not exist<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2&#x02013;4</sup></xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the search for new lead structures and chemical entities for the development of new effective anticancer agents is an increasingly important task in medicinal chemistry. This trend of global research includes work on the use of 1,2,4-triazine scaffold as a source for the design of biologically relevant molecules with well-known broad biological applications<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Thus, the 1,2,4-triazine ring is an eminent structural motif found in plentiful natural and synthetic biologically active compounds<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>. Among the known various biological activities of 1,2,4-triazines and their related benzo- and heterofused derivatives, antitumor activity deserves special attention. Recently, a few reviews on the chemistry and the biological properties of this class of compounds have been published<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7&#x02013;9</sup></xref>.</p><p>It should be emphasised that compounds with the 1,2,4-triazine nucleus condensed with five-membered heterocycles have received considerable attention because they are bioisosteric with a purine core. Among the fused 1,2,4-triazine derivatives with one heterocycle, compounds bearing a pyrrole ring, such as pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,2,4]triazine and pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine, represent the most abundant class of triazine with antitumor activity<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Derivatives bearing this heterocyclic system are widely described as potent kinase inhibitors. Pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4] triazine scaffold, miming the adenine ring of ATP, was also employed to afford other kinase inhibitors such as Met kinase inhibitors<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>.</p><p>Another interesting and little studied in the group of 1,2,4-triazines condensed with a five-membered heterocycle is the pyrazolo[4,3-<italic>e</italic>][1,2,4]triazine ring system. Its derivatives are the least known in the group of condensed pyrazolotriazines and were less studied compared to pyrrolotriazines. Some synthesised derivatives of this system were evaluated for their anticancer activity against five type tumour cell lines (CEM, CEM-DNR, K-562, K-562-tax, and A549) and they showed antiproliferative activity against A549 cell line in the micromolar range<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>. Bernat et&#x000a0;al. reported that pyrazolo triazine derivates show increased antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in cancerous cell lines, as compared to normal tissue<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>. Another group is pyrazolo[4,3-<italic>e</italic>][1,2,4]triazine sulphonamides prepared as inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase hCA IX and XII with antitumor activity<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. Moreover, some previously described pyrazolotriazine sulphonamides were found to have dose-dependent antiproliferative effects against two Bcr-Abl positive cancer cell lines, K562 and BV173. Therefore, they were tested against Abl kinase<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. On the other hand, our earlier study showed that tricyclic derivatives of the pyrazolo[4,3-<italic>e</italic>][1,2,4]triazines condensed with triazole or tetrazole were the most active against cancer cell lines<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. Replacement of triazole with a tetrazole ring results in increase of the anticancer activity.</p><p>In our previous study, we described synthesis and characterisation of novel pyrazolo[4,3-<italic>e</italic>]tetrazolo[1,5-<italic>b</italic>][1,2,4]triazine sulphonamides differing in the structure of the sulphonamide group<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>. Screening results revealed that compound <bold>MM-129</bold> presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> exhibited strong inhibition activity towards DLD-1 and HT-29 (two of the cell lines of CRC). It showed potent antiproliferative effects against colon cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values 3.1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M compared to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and roscovitine (RSC) with values above 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M. <bold>MM-129</bold> has a similar chemical structure to RSC, which is in the clinical trial phase. We also evaluated the mechanism of action of novel sulphonamide derivative and found that it plays anticancer roles through inhibition of Bruton&#x02019;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and activation of apoptosis. In this study, we successfully developed zebrafish xenografts with human DLD-1 and HT-29 CRC cells and validated these models with anticancer drug 5-FU, used clinically to treat cancer patients. We found that <bold>MM-129</bold> effectively inhibits tumour development in both DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of <bold>MM-129</bold>.</p></caption><graphic content-type="black-white" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1879803_F0001_B"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="S0002" disp-level="1"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001" disp-level="2"><label>2.1.</label><title>Synthesis</title><sec id="S0002-S2001-S3001" disp-level="3"><label>2.1.1.</label><title>General</title><p>Melting points were determined on a Mel-Temp apparatus and were uncorrected. <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian spectrometer (400&#x02009;MHz for <sup>1</sup>H and 100&#x02009;MHz for <sup>13</sup>C).

The use of animals in scientific research in Europe is governed by the Directive 2010/63/EU of 22 September 2010. According to EU Directive earliest life-stages of zebrafish (embryo and eleutheroembryo cultures) are regarded as equivalent to <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> cell culture therefore, do not fall into the regulatory frameworks dealing with animal experiments. In contrast, experiments with the free&#x02010;feeding larvae older than 120&#x02009;h of development are classified as animal experiments and require permission. The rationale is that active hunting reflects a perception of environmental stimuli that go beyond simple reflexes. This is taken as an indication of a mature nervous system that controls behaviour. In our experiment, we used zebrafish larvae younger than 120&#x000a0;hpf (hours post-fertilisation) therefore ethic approval was not required.

A basic element of colon cancer treatment is surgery, which is aimed at obtaining intestinal tissue free of cancer. Chemotherapy complements surgical intervention and is based mainly on 5-FU. For chemo, either the FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CapeOx (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens are used most often, but some patients may get 5-FU with leucovorin or capecitabine alone based on their age and health needs (NCCN Guidelines 2018).

Herein, RSC or 5-FU used at low concentrations had no effect on apoptosis. This is in line with previous reports indicating that 5 FU induces caspase-dependent apoptosis of CRC cells at concentrations of 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref>. Roscovitine also exhibited a clear proapoptotic effect in the A172 and G28 only at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M and 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, respectively<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>. We intentionally used the same concentrations for all compounds, both tested and reference. Our results clearly indicate that new 1,2,4-triazine derivative is an apoptosis-inducing factor with higher efficiency than RSC or 5-FU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005" disp-level="1"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>New 1,2,4-triazine derivative <bold>MM-129</bold> has been shown to exert potent antitumor activity on CRC. It effectively inhibits cell survival in BTK-dependent mechanism and apoptosis was the main response of CRC cells to <bold>MM-129</bold> treatment. This new synthesised compound successfully reduces tumour development in zebrafish embryo xenograft model. <bold>MM-129</bold> possesses cytotoxic, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activity and its effectiveness is much higher compared with the standard chemotherapy for CRC, i.e. 5-FU. The discovery of an innovative therapeutic option that improves the prospects of treating patients is currently a crucial challenge. There is a real chance that the results presented in this study will help in the development of a new, effective therapy, which could be an attractive alternative to the already existing methods of colon cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM9052"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IENZ_A_1879803_SM9052.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.
