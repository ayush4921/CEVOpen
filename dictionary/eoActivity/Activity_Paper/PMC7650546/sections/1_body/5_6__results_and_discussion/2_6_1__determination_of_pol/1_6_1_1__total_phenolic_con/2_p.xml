<p>As shown on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>, polyphenol contents significantly varied depending on the medicinal plant considered. 
 <italic>S. cumini, H. lanceolatum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extracts exhibited higher concentrations of polyphenols with, respectively, 7.6%, 5.2% and 4.9% GAE, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>. Furthermore, these values are comparable to that of other dietary sources of polyphenols such as star anise, cocoa, spearmint, rosemary or thyme [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Traditional extraction consisting in infusion and decoction provided similar results, suggesting that these three aforementioned plants contained more polyphenols than the others. As expected, the decoction procedure allowed a better extraction than infusion (statistical significance was reached for 
 <italic>A. theiformis, S. cumini, H. lanceolatum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Acetone/water extraction led to a lower yield than aqueous extraction (decoction/infusion) probably due to a different ratio of mash to solvent (4 g/20 mL acetone-water then reduced to about 10 mL of extract for PRE versus 1 g/1000 mL for decoction and infusion). Traditional preparation is therefore very efficient for extracting polyphenols.
