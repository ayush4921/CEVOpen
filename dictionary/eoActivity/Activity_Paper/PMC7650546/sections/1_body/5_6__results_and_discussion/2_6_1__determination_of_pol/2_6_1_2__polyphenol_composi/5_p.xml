<p>Interestingly, UPLC-MS analysis led to the detection of a wide range of polyphenols in infusions and decoctions that may constitute the basis of their bioactivity. Indeed, these components, such as quercetin, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid and kaempferol, that represent about 20 to 40% of the total polyphenol composition of 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum, P. x graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> are known to exert an antioxidant activity, for example, by limiting ROS production. As reported in detail in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-00959">Table S2</xref>, most of the compounds detected and identified by mass spectrometry have already been described in the literature for their antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory bioactivity. Another example is the composition of 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> extracts; it has been shown that mangiferin and its metabolites represent more than 95% of the total polyphenol content. Mangiferin may be responsible for 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> antidiabetic and cholesterol lowering effects traditionally reported for this medicinal plant. In fact, the bioactivity observed in medicinal plants results from the synergistical or individual action of the different components identified in aqueous extracts, and particularly polyphenols. Although our study is intended to test the bioactivity of these eight medicinal plants, our results underline the importance of studying the polyphenol contents of these extracts. The mode of preparation did not significantly impact the polyphenol qualitative composition and further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying plant bioactivity. (
