<p>The preparation mode did not have a significant impact on the medicinal plant protective effects except for red blood cell lysis where infusions were significantly more efficient than decoctions. One limitation of our study is that we analyzed plant extracts, which implies a mixture of several antioxidant compounds at different concentrations acting alone or in synergy. Further investigations would be needed to investigate the individual contribution of each component to the global antioxidant activity. In addition, depending on environmental conditions, industrial process (drying, milling, conditioning) and extraction method, the composition of plant herbal tea may slightly vary from one preparation method to another, but the main components and biological function should be globally similar.</p>
