<p>Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were determined by measuring the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a 96-well black plate, cells were seeded at a density of 10 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and incubated with cell culture medium containing the different medicinal plant preparations. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and exposed to DCFH-DA (10 µM) for 45 min. After the incubation with the probe, cells were washed and then incubated for 1 h with or without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (200 µM). ROS were detected by fluorimetry (Fluostar Omega, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK) at 492 nm for excitation and 520 nm for emission.
