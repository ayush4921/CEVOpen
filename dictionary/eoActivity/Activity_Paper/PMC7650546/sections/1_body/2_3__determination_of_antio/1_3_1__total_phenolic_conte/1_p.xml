<p>To determine the total polyphenol content of the different samples, the Folin–Ciocalteu test was used [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, 25 µL of each sample, 125 µL of Folin–Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) and 100 µL of sodium carbonate (75 g/L) were added to a 96-well microplate and incubated at 50 °C for 5 min. After cooling for 5 min at 4 °C, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm (Fluostar Omega, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK). A calibration curve was made using a standard solution of gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA). For the polyphenol-rich extracts (PRE), the total polyphenol content was expressed as g gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/1 g plant mash. For infusions and decoction, the total polyphenol content was expressed as mg GAE/1 g (=mg GAE/1 L since these preparations are made at a ratio of 1 g/L)
