<p>Polyphenols contained in medicinal plant PRE, infusions and decoctions were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography analysis coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS, Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France) in Polyphenols Biotech platform (ADERA, Villenave d’Ornon, France). Briefly, samples were diluted, filtered on PTFE (0.45 µm) and injected at 1 µL on an Agilent ZORBAX RRHD SB-C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm) for chromatographic separation. The content of the column was eluted with a gradient mixture of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) at the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, with 1% B at 0–0.4 min, 1–10% B at 0.4–2 min, 10–35% B at 2–6 min, 35–50% B at 6–7 min, 50–70% B at 7–8.8 min, 70–92% B at 8.8–10.8 min, 92–100% B at 10.8–12 min, 100–1% B at 12–15.2 min. The column temperature was held at room temperature and the detection wavelength was set to 280, 320 and 380 nm. For the mass spectrometer conditions, an electrospray ionization source was used. </p>
