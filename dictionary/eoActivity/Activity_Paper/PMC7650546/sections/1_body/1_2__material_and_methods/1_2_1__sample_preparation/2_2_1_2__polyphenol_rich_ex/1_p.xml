<p>Plant powders were incubated with an acetone/water (70/30) solvent mixture at 4 °C for 90 min (4 g of plant mash in 20 mL acetone/water). The mixture was then centrifuged at 1372 g, 4 °C for 20 min. The polyphenol-rich supernatant (ranging from 7 to 15 mL depending on the level of solvent retention by the plant material) was collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Each sample was prepared in triplicate.</p>
