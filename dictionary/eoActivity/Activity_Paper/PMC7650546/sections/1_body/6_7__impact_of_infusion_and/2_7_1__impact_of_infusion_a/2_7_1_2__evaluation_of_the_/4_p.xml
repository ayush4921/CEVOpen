<p>It is important to note that PRE exert high protective effects at 25 µM by increasing the HT50 from 8.01 ± 0.16 h (for 
 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic>) to 11.72 ± 0.12 h (for 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>). As previously reported, polyphenols may prevent hemolysis and thus increase red blood cell half-life [

 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f004">Figure 4</xref>, at a final concentration of 25 µM GAE, half-hemolysis time was prolonged from 2.9 ± 0.2 h to 6.9 ± 0.1 h for the infusions, from 2.3 ± 0.2 h to 5.8 ± 0.1 h for the decoctions and from 1.5 ± 0.2 h to 5.2 ± 0.1 h for the PRE. Our results suggest that, whatever the mode of extraction, polyphenols exert a protective effect on red blood cell damage induced by AAPH. Interestingly, infusions of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>, 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> have a higher protective effect than decoctions.
