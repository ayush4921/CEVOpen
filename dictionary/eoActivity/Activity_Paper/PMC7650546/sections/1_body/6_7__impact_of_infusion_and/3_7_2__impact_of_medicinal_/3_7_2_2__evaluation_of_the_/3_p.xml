 <sub>2</sub>. This protective effect is more pronounced at 25 µM. Unexpectedly, only a few PRE displayed a significant protective effect at this concentration despite their higher polyphenol diversity as compared to infusions and decoctions. This suggests that the bioavailability of polyphenols contained in PRE and water-based extractions is different, being more efficient for infusions and decoctions. Moreover, the comparative analysis between infusions and decoctions did not reveal any significant difference that could be due to the preparation mode; both significantly reduced the intracellular ROS production to the basal level, for all plant tested (

These results point out the importance of the antioxidant activity of medicinal plant bioactive compounds that are known to exert peroxide inactivation leading to a protective effect on oxidative stress damages (mitochondrial stress, activation of redox signaling, cell death) [
