  <p>Effect of medicinal plant preparation on the half-time hemolysis (HT50) of red blood cells. Red blood cell hemolysis was induced by AAPH. Optical density at 450 nm was measured every 3 min for 18.5 h. The decrease in optical density indicated the progression of hemolysis. (

   <italic>D viscosa</italic> infusions at different polyphenol final concentrations. (
