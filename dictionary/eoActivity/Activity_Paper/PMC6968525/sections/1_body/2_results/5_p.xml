<p>GC-MS analysis of sterol profile of three different clinical strains of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (CAAL93), C. 
 <italic>krusei</italic> (CAKR7) and C. 
 <italic>glabrata</italic> (CAGL2) showed ergosterol as the major sterol accounting for 69% to 83% of total cellular sterols. Small quantities of ergosterol intermediates such as zymosterol, ergosta-7,22-dienol, fecosterol and episterol were also detected to a lesser extent (between 2% and 5%). Ergosterol precursor in 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, i.e. lanosterol, was also found in a small quantity (0.7% to 5.2%). These sterol profiles were in accordance with classical metabolism of ergosterol

 <bold>8 g</bold> (4 ng/mL) of C. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> fluconazole-susceptible strain (CAAL93 – MIC = 0.125 µg/mL) resulted in a significant reduction of ergosterol content (70%), an accumulation of lanosterol and the emerging of 14α-methyl sterols such as eburicol, 14α-methylfecosterol and 14α-methylepisterol. Same modifications in sterol profile were observed when CAAL93 was treated with fluconazole at a 1000-fold higher dose (4 µg/mL) (
