<p>A PLA2-like activity was clearly characterised in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> CA98001, including cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and secreted PLA2 activities. Indeed, using intact 
 <italic>Candida</italic> cells, 53% and 34% of PLA2 activity was inhibited by 10 µM BpB and 
 <bold>8 g</bold>, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the case of 
 <bold>8 g</bold>, the impact on the production of arachidonic acid is marked (0.12 for 
 <bold>8 g</bold>
 <italic>versus</italic> 0.22 for the control).
