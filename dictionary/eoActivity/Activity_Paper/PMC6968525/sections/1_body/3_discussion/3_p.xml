<p>Several events are involved in the membrane biosynthesis, especially the production of lipids as sterols and phospholipids. We demonstrated that 
 <bold>8 g</bold> inhibits 
 <italic>Candida</italic> ergosterol synthesis as observed with other azole drugs. This inhibition led to membrane integrity perturbations through ergosterol depletion, precursor accumulation (lanosterol) and production of alternative 14α-methyl sterols (14α-methyl-fecosterol, 14α-methyl-episterol and 14α-methyl-3,6-diol). Identification of 14α-methylated sterols evidenced a blockage of CYP51 as a way of action of 
 <bold>8 g</bold>. Interestingly, the effects of 
 <bold>8 g</bold> on sterol metabolism are observed in CAAL93 (fluconazole susceptible strain) at 4 ng/mL whereas the same results are observed after fluconazole treatment at a 1000-fold higher concentration (4 µg/mL). Moreover, the same effects are seen when fluconazole-resistant strains (CAKR7 and CAGL2) were treated by 
 <bold>8 g</bold> at 4 µg/mL whereas nothing happened after treatment with the same dose of fluconazole. These results show the potency of this new indole-triazole derivative compound.
