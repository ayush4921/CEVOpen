<p>Phospholipids are vital structural and functional entities of biomembranes. Phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid, is in part metabolised by phospholipases A (PLAs). These enzymes are known to be essentials for the turnover of the membrane phospholipids. Pugh 
 <italic>et</italic> 
 <italic>al</italic> showed that PLAs were present at the site of bud formation suggesting that they are involved in growth and change in shape of the cell wall

 <bold>8 g</bold> did not inhibit the secreted phospholipase activity (data not shown). However, no gene coding for PLA2 was identified in yeast but lipases with patatin-like domains which have a cPLA2-like activity, have already been described in

 </xref>. Patatin-like phospholipases role is well established for membrane biogenis and sporulation, but their implication in virulence or pathogenesis had still to be determined. Such enzymes could be future targets for new antifungals. Thus, high 
 <bold>8 g</bold> concentrations (10 µM) could inhibit cell phospholipid organisation and could complete the main mechanism of action, e.g. inhibition of sterol biosynthesis.
