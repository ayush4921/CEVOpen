<p>In conclusion, 
 <bold>8 g</bold> showed high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, including low fluconazole-susceptible species (
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>) which remain one of the main challenges in candidiasis therapy. Its mechanism of action involved a strong blockage of CYP51 and in a minor importance inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub>-like activity. This promising compound has low toxicity on MRC5 cells and a significant 
 <italic>in</italic> 
 <italic>vivo</italic> activity. Further investigations must be done to evaluate antifungal activity of 
 <bold>8 g</bold> and its enantiomers in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models of candidiasis and against other fungi.
