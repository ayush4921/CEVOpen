<p>Mice (8 per groups) were immunodepressed by subcutaneous injection of 30 mg/kg prednisolone one day before challenge. On day 0, mice were infected intravenously with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (CAAL93) blastoconidia (5.10
 <sup>5</sup> in 100 µL of NaCl 0.9%). One hour after infection, mice were treated intraperitoneally for five consecutive days with 100 µL 0.5% Tween 20-sterile saline solution (control), twice daily with 30 mg/kg or three times a day with 20 mg/kg body weight of compound 
 <bold>8 g</bold>. Fluconazole (Sigma, St Quentin Fallavier, France) was administered 
 <italic>per os</italic> three times a day at 5 mg/kg. Mice were monitored for 14 days post inoculation. For reduction of animal distress, the body weights of the mice were recorded daily, and when they lost 20% of their initial weight, mice were euthanized. On day 14, all surviving mice were euthanized.
