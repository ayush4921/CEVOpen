<p>Sterols as TMS derivatives were analysed by GC-MS using an Agilent 6890 N GC system, with a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness, Agilent Technologies) coupled with a quadrupole mass detector (Agilent 5973i – E.I. 70 eV). Two microliters of sample were injected in splitless mode at 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The oven was set at 150 °C for 0.5 min and then raised to 280 °C at 40 °C/min and from 280 °C to 300 °C at 2 °C/min. Sterols were identified via their electron ionisation fragmentation pattern, compared to published data. Results are expressed as percent area of total sterols.</p>
