<p>MICs for

 </xref>. Yeasts were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco Laboratories) at 35 °C for 24 h. The wells were inoculated with 100 µL of the culture suspension diluted to a final inoculum of 5 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 2.5 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL. Fungal growth was observed 48 h after incubation at 35 °C. The MICs of the azoles were the lowest drug concentrations to give a 50% decrease in turbidity from that of the control fungal growth. MIC
 <sub>90</sub> was the concentration of a drug required at which 90% of the clinical isolates tested were inhibited.
