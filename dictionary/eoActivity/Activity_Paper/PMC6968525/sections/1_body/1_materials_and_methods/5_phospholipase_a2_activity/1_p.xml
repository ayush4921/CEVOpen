<p>Phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub>-like activity (PLA

 <italic>C. albicans</italic> CA98001 clinical isolate incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the specific modified phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> substrate, 1-octadecanoyl-2–(1-
 <sup>14</sup>C)-eicosatetraenoyl-glycerol-3-phosphocholine. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol mixture. Aliquots of chloroformic phases were placed in scintillation flasks for measures of total lipid radioactivity. The chromatography solvent phase was toluene/dioxane/acetic acid/formic acid 85/15/0.2/0.2 (v/v). Lipid classes were visualised with iodine vapours on an analytical thin-layer chromatography. Each spot was cut and the lipids were solubilised in scintillation liquid. Then, radioactivity was measured in a LKB 1909 scintillation spectrophotometer

 <sub>2</sub> activity was expressed as the ratio of radioactive fatty acids versus total radioactivity of sample.
