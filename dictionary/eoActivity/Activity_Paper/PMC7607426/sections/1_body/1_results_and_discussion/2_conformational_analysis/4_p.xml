<p>Structure 
 <bold>2f</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which was among the higher-energy calculated conformers of 
 <bold>2</bold> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>), bears a close resemblance to the solid-state conformation of piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The structure 
 <bold>2f</bold> has a F–C–C–F dihedral angle of 57° and a F–C–C=O dihedral angle of –133°. These angles approximate rotamers I and IV, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The unexpectedly high relative energy that was calculated for compound 
 <bold>2f</bold> might be partially attributable to the fact that it features only a single F···H contact within 2.50 Å. The calculations suggest that the conformer 
 <bold>2f</bold> is not significantly populated in chloroform solution but it was not possible to verify this by NMR measurements, because 
 <bold>2f</bold> is essentially superimposable with 
 <bold>2a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> within the fluoroalkyl segment. In more polar solvents such as water, the intramolecular F···H interactions would be expected to decrease in significance [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and this might increase the accessibility of conformer 
 <bold>2f</bold>. We reasoned that comparing the biological activities of 
 <bold>1</bold> vs 
 <bold>2</bold> might shed light on this possibility (vide infra).
