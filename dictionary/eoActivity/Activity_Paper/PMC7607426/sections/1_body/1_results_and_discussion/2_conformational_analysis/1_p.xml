<p>Having completed the synthesis of the target molecule 
 <bold>2</bold>, the next task was to investigate the conformational behavior of this molecule. This was achieved by performing a DFT study in the Gaussian software, using the M06-2X level of theory with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, parameters similar to those employed by Linclau and co-workers for their studies of vicinal difluoro systems [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A set of starting structures of 
 <bold>2</bold> was generated by systematically rotating three bonds (i.e., F–C–C–F, F–C–C=O, and O=C–N–C) in 120° increments and the starting structures were then geometry optimised and their energies calculated. To enable benchmarking against experiment, NMR spin–spin coupling constants were calculated for the lowest-energy final structures of 
 <bold>2</bold> using the GIAO method with the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. Chloroform was used as the solvent for both the NMR experiments and the SMD calculations.
