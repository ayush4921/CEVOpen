<p>A noteworthy feature of structures 
 <bold>2a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) is that both, the α-fluorine and the β-fluorine atoms of each structure make close contacts with the hydrogen atoms on the piperidine ring (2.08–2.34 Å). This manifests in the observation of a through-space coupling (
 <italic>J</italic> = 1.9 Hz) between the α-fluorine and a piperidine hydrogen in the experimental NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> (i.e., spins 6/7, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The attractive F···H interactions might explain why the amide bond is twisted by 11–20° from planarity in 
 <bold>2a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>. In structure 
 <bold>2c</bold>, only the α-fluorine makes close contacts with hydrogens on the piperidine ring, and the amide is twisted to a lesser degree in that case (8° away from planarity). It is interesting that in the crystal structure of piperine itself (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the amide bond is also twisted by 15° away from planarity. In this case the distortion might be attributable to a H···H clash (1.99 Å).
