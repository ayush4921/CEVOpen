<p>In order to circumvent the troublesome oxidation reaction (i.e., 
 <bold>13→14</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C2">Scheme 2</xref>), and to seek higher enantiopurity of the target, we modified the synthetic plan to include an ester moiety throughout (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C3">Scheme 3</xref>). Thus, the α,β-unsaturated ester 
 <bold>15</bold> [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was carried through a similar sequence to that previously described, i.e., dihydroxylation, cyclic sulfate formation, ring-opening with TBAF (although note the regioselectivity [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), deoxyfluorination, and deprotection to deliver the difluorinated acid 
 <bold>20</bold>. Finally, coupling of the acid 
 <bold>20</bold> with piperidine afforded the target compound 
 <bold>2</bold> in moderate yield (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C3">Scheme 3</xref>). The enantiopurity of 
 <bold>2</bold> was investigated using chiral HPLC. From a spectroscopically pure sample of 
 <bold>2</bold>, two HPLC peaks were observed, with an integral ratio of 99:1. It is assumed that the two peaks correspond to the two enantiomers of 
 <bold>2</bold> and, if that assumption is true, then the optical purity of this sample is 98% ee.
