<p>There are several conceivable explanations for the reversed relative activities of 
 <bold>1</bold> vs 
 <bold>2</bold> in the AChE vs BACE-1 assays. One possibility is that analog 
 <bold>2</bold> is induced to adopt the “correct” conformation when binding to both targets (i.e., 
 <bold>2f</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and this structure fits well within the AChE active site but poorly within the BACE-1 active site, perhaps due to unfavourable interactions of the fluorine substituents of 
 <bold>2</bold> with BACE-1 active site residues. A second possibility is that 
 <bold>2</bold> adopts an “incorrect” conformation upon binding to both targets (e.g., 
 <bold>2a</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and this novel molecular shape is readily accommodated by AChE [
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] but not by BACE-1, perhaps due to different levels of flexibility within the enzyme active sites. A third possibility is that the analog 
 <bold>2</bold> adopts different conformations upon binding to AChE vs BACE-1, since the microenvironments within the enzymes’ active sites could be different (e.g., more/less polar), the “correct” binding geometry of 
 <bold>2</bold> might be favoured in AChE but not in BACE-1. These possibilities all remain speculative in the absence of high-resolution structural data of the enzyme–ligand complexes.
