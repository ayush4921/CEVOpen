<p>The inhibition of BACE-1 was measured using a fluorogenic peptide substrate according to an established method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>) [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Intriguingly, the relative activities of 
 <bold>1</bold> vs 
 <bold>2</bold> were reversed in comparison with the AChE assay. The lead compound 
 <bold>1</bold> achieved the complete inhibition of BACE-1 under the conditions of the assay, giving an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 59.2 μM. In contrast, analog 
 <bold>2</bold> was a much weaker inhibitor of BACE-1, failing to achieve complete inhibition, and giving an estimated IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of &gt;1,000 μM.
