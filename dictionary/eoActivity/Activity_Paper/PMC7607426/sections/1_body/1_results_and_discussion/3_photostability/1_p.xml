<p>A limitation of piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>) as a drug lead is its instability under UV light. The conjugated system of 
 <bold>1</bold> is well-known to undergo facile 
 <italic>E</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> isomerization upon the absorption of UV photons, leading rapidly to a mixture of all four possible geometric isomers of 
 <bold>1</bold> [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present work, this phenomenon was confirmed by exposing an ethanolic solution of 
 <bold>1</bold> to sunlight for 2.5 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis of the product by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy revealed a multitude of new signals in the alkenyl region. In contrast, the analog 
 <bold>2</bold> lacks conjugation in the central portion of the molecule and was therefore expected to be more stable to UV light. Indeed, the exposure of 
 <bold>2</bold> to sunlight in an identical manner to that described for 
 <bold>1</bold> led to no detectable decomposition (
