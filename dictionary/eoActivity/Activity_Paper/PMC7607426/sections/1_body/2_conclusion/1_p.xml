<p>A 
 <italic>threo</italic>-difluorinated piperine analog (
 <bold>2</bold>) was successfully synthesised through a stepwise route. The physicochemical properties of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> were found to be superior to piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>) itself in two key respects, namely photostability and aqueous solubility. The conformational analysis of 
 <bold>2</bold> by DFT and NMR spectroscopy revealed that the lowest-energy conformations 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> are imperfect mimics of 
 <bold>1</bold> but that a somewhat higher-energy conformation (
 <bold>2f</bold>) is a close match for 
 <bold>1</bold>. A preliminary biological investigation revealed that the analog 
 <bold>2</bold> displays superior inhibitory activity towards AChE but inferior activity towards BACE-1, relative to 
 <bold>1</bold>. While the inhibition of both AChE and BACE-1 is potentially desirable for the purpose of treating Alzheimer’s disease, it should be noted that problems have been encountered in clinical trials with BACE-1 as the target [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], suggesting that the analog 
 <bold>2</bold> might still have relevance in the context of an Alzheimer’s treatment. More generally, our finding that the 
 <italic>threo</italic>-difluoroalkane motif is sometimes but not always an effective surrogate for 
 <italic>E</italic>-alkenes suggests that this bioisosteric switch could be exploited more widely in medicinal chemistry as a means of increasing the selectivity of a lead compound towards its desired target.
