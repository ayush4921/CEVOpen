<p>However, piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>) has some limitations as a drug lead. For example, it has poor solubility, and it is susceptible to photoisomerization of the conjugated system [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This prompted us to consider whether there was another structural motif that could (i) mimic the extended geometry of an 
 <italic>E-</italic>alkene, (ii) impart better solubility, and (iii) be more stable in the presence of UV light. Such a C=C surrogate might offer an improved lead compound for the development of drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
