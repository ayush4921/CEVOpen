 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> methanol extract in MCF-7. At the end of treatment (after 72 h), the percentage of feasible cells decreased ominously by 7.78%, while the percentage of cells increased by 3.99% at early apoptosis. The cell proportion also rises by 1.06% in the late apoptotic period. Nevertheless, the percentage of cells in early apoptosis decreased by 3.8% for the control culture at 72 h; the late apoptotic stage also decreased by 0.02%, while the number of viable cells increased by 8.02%. Although the proportion of cells in the group of live cells decreased significantly by 28.43% in MDA-MB-231 after 72 h of treatment, the percentage of cells in early apoptosis increased by 29.37%. Similarly, at the necrotic level, the proportion of cells increased by 41.46% but decreased by 0.74% in the late apoptotic period. However, for the control culture at 72 h, the proportion of cells with early apoptosis decreased by 4.14%, the late apoptotic stage also decreased by 14.62%, while the apoptotic period increased by 1.08%, and a number of viable cells also decreased by 11.92%.
