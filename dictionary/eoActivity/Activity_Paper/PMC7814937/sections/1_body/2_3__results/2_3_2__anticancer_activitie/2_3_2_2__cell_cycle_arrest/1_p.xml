<p>Using the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration from MTT assay for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, cell cycle analysis was evaluated after exposure of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> methanol extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In MCF-7, there was a momentous arrest at sub-G
 <sub>1</sub>, at 24 h–72 h, and the number of cells at S and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases and the number of cells at G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> were reduced substantially. In MDA-MB-231, there was a significant arrest at sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the number of cells in G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> and the number of cells in G
 <sub>2</sub>/M were markedly reduced. At 48 h, there was also considerable arrest at sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub>, and the number of cells in S and the number of cells in G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases were markedly reduced, and eventually at 72 h, there was a substantial arrest at sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> and S, and the number of cells in G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases decreased significantly.
