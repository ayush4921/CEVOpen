<p>Since one antioxidant assay is not sufficient to provide an adequate picture of the scavenging activities, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> leaf extracts were subjected to several antioxidant assays. Antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> leaf extracts was evaluated using DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the DPPH assay, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> had the highest scavenging activity with the value of 79.0 ± 0.31 %, followed by the ethyl acetate extract with 23.2 ± 0.05 % and hexane extract with 11.5 ± 0.31 %, respectively. The same observation was also found in the FRAP assay where the methanol extract demonstrated highest reducing capacity with a value of 65.6 ± 0.35 mM Fe

 </sup>/g, respectively. Whereas for the ABTS assay, the methanol extract also had the highest scavenging activity with a value of 31.34 ± 2.06 mg AEAC/g, followed by the ethyl acetate extract with 10.98 ± 0.64 mg AEAC/g and hexane extract with a value of 9.50 ± 0.48 mg AEAC/g. Plant phenolics are a significant group of compounds that serve as major antioxidants or free radical scavengers. Hence, in this analysis, the observed high free radical scavenging behavior of the methanol extract may have accounted for its polarity for the radical scavenging ability of the plant extracts. The radical scavenging activities may be due to the presence of some flavonoids with a free hydroxyl group, capable of donating hydrogen and electron [
