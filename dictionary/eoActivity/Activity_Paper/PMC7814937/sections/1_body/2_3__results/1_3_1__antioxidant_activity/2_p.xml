<p>The findings showed that the plant extracts had substantial disparities in their ability to compare ascorbic acid, which may also be ascribed to various characteristics, reaction, and mechanisms. Organic media can be used in solubilising DPPH radical chromogens. A strong positive correlation (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9399,

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8143, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was found. FRAP also correlates with ABTS• +  (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.87), whereas ABTS• +  showed a stiff positive association to VCEAC (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.6784). The practical difference in these comparisons was DPPH•, which also correlates poorly with ABTS (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.53).
