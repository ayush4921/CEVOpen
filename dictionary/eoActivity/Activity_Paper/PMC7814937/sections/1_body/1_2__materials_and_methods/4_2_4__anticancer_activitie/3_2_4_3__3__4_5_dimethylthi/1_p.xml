<p>Following a procedure described by Rahmat et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 6.9 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were plated in 96-well plate and grown in 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L complete growth media (CGM) and treated for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extract was added in 96-well plates in serial dilution (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL–5.625 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL), and then, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT was added into each well and nurtured for 4 h. Afterward, to liquefy and solubilize the colored crystals, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DMSO was added into each well, and absorbance was read at 570 nm using an ELISA reader (AWARENESS-State Fax, USA). The following formula was used to determine the cytotoxicity of the extract:
