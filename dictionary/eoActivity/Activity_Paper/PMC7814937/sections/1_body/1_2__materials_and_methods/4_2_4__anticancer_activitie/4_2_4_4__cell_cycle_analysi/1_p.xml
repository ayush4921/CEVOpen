<p>Cell cycle analysis was carried out with some modifications as described by Queiroz et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were nurtured for 24 h and subsequently treated for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h using crude extracts at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Altogether, the detached and adhering cells were reaped and reassigned in a disinfected centrifuge tube. The cells were then centrifuged (1,200 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C. Cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to wash the cells where the cells were resuspended with 0.5 mL of cold PBS, and ice-cold ethanol (70%) was then added to the cell suspension and incubated at −20°C for 2 h. Then, the ethanol was expelled from the sample after centrifugation. The cells that have been rinsed twice using cool PBS previously were stained with propidium iodide (500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and RNase (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) at room temperature for about 30 min. Dispersion of the cell cycle was analysed using flow cytometry.
