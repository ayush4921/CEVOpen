<p>This method was performed according to Tor et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The viability of the cells was measured using an annexin V-FITC/PI kit, following the manufacturer's procedure. Both treated and control cells were centrifuged and washed twice using PBS. At room temperature, cell staining was carried out using FITC annexin V (5 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) and 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L PI for 15 min, and cell death was also analysed using flow cytometry.
