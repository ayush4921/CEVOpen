<p>To solubilise the plant extract, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM which was kept at 4°C under light protection was used. DMSO concentration that does not exceed 1% was used for the whole experiment. Fresh complete culture media were diluted with 20 mg/10 mL of standard drug (doxorubicin), and the extract was serially diluted to the cell plates at varying concentrations from 100
