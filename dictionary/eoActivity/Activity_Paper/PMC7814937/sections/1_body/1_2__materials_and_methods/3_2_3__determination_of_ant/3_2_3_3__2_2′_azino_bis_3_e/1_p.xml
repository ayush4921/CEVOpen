<p>ABTS assay was carried in line with Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with some modifications. Reacting of ABTS solution (7 mM) with 2.45 mM of potassium persulfate produced the preformed radical monocation of ABTS. The solution was kept in the dark and left to stand for 15 h at room temperature. To obtain the units of absorbance at 734 nm, the solution was diluted with either methanol, ethyl acetate, or hexane; aliquot for every sample (200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) was added to 2000 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of ABTS. Using a spectrometer, the absorbance was monitored for 5 min at 734 nm. Blank solvents were run appropriately in every assay. The proportion of inhibition was calculated against control and matched to a vitamin C standard curve (10–100 mm), and the percentage was used to express the radical scavenging activities.
