<p>FRAP assay was conducted according to Dusuki et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with some modifications. The FRAP mixture was formed by mixing 300 mM acetate buffer with 3.6 pH, 2.5 mL of 10 mM TPTZ solution in 40 mM HCl, and 0.25 mL of 20 mM FeCl3, and the substances were tested in 0.1 mL methanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane or methanol. Plain reading was recorded at 593 nm using a test tube with extra 3 mL of FRAP reagent. Plant extract (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) and distilled water (300 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) were supplemented to the test tube. Using a spectrometer, after 30 min of incubation, absorbance was read at 593 nm. Ferric reducing capacity in 1 g of dried sample (mM/g) was measured as mM for the final result. All tests were run in triplicate.
