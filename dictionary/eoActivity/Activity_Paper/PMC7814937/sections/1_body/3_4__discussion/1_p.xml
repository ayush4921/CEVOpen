<p>Medicinal plants have been of great interest as a source of natural antioxidants used for health promotion such as anticancer properties. In this present study, the radical scavenging activities of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> leaf extracts were quantified using DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays. All the extracts demonstrated scavenging of stable DPPH and ABTS as well as reducing activity in FRAP assay. The secondary metabolites, namely, phenolics and flavonoids, present in this species make it potential for antioxidant activities by functioning as reducing agents [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Numerous antioxidants that are described to have therapeutic potential such as vanillic acid, isovanillic acid, epicatechin, and myricetin are essential bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>. Tubers of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> have displayed higher scavenging activity, reducing power, and ferrous ion chelating due to its high content of polyphenols such as oxalic acid, citric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid. Thus, the secondary metabolites might be the key role players behind its biological activities [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> has been reported to demonstrate DPPH radical-scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Studies of antioxidants from different platinum–palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (PtNPs) made from 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> indicates that PtNPs could inhibit radical DPPH by up to 30.16%, while palladium (PdNPs) showed up to 28.97% of the activity. Despite this, Ptfor–PdNPs reveal 38.49% scavenging when compared separately with PtNPs and PdNPs. In addition, for Pt–PdNPs (56.71%), a synergistic enhancement activity against radical superoxide was also observed as contrasted and only PtNPs (31.87%) or PdNPs (27.1%).
