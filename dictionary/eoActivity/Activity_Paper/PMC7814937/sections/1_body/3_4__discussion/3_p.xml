<p>The results of the present study indicated that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> was found to be the most cytotoxic extract in both cell lines due to the presence of plentiful active compounds, namely, diosgenin in yam, the edible tubers of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp. These results are compatible with the studies conducted by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Diosgenin has been shown to enhance metabolism of lipids, improve antioxidant activities, reduce glucose levels, and suppress inflammation [
