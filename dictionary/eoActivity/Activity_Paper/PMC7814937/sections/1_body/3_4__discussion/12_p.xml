<p>Annexin-V-FITC/PI-flow cytometry analysis ascertained the induction of apoptosis by plant crude in both MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231. Distinctive biochemical features characterise apoptosis in the removal of damaged cells or tumour cells without causing irritation. The commencement of enzymatic and catabolic procedures in apoptosis in this manner empower cell morphological changes, for example, externalization of the plasma layer, phosphatidylserine (PS), shrinking of the cells, blebbing in cell membrane, condensation of chromatin, nuclear fragmentation, and apoptotic bodies formation [
