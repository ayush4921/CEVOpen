 <p>Breast cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women globally. Malaysia is a country that is rich in medicinal plant species. Hence, this research aims to explore the secondary metabolites, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activities of 
  <italic>Dioscorea bulbifera</italic> leaf collected from Endau Rompin, Johor, Malaysia. Antioxidant activity was assessed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays, while the cytotoxicity of 
  <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry analysis. Phytochemical profiling was conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that methanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays, followed by ethyl acetate and hexane extracts. 
  <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> tested against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines showed a pronounced cytotoxic effect with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 8.96 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 6.88 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 3.27 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in MCF-7 and 14.29 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 11.86 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 7.23 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in MDA-MB-231, respectively. Cell cycle analysis also indicated that 
  <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> prompted apoptosis at various stages, and a significant decrease in viable cells was detected within 24 h and substantially improved after 48 h and 72 h of treatment. Phytochemical profiling of methanol extract revealed the presence of 39 metabolites such as acetic acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, acetin, hexadecanoate, 7-tetradecenal, phytol, octadecanoic acid, cholesterol, palmitic acid, and linolenate. Hence, these findings concluded that 
  <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> extract has promising anticancer and natural antioxidant agents. However, further study is needed to isolate the bioactive compounds and validate the effectiveness of this extract in the In 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> model.
