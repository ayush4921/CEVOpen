<p>Abraham in 2016 reported that some of the wild edible trees contributed as additional income sources [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Engulmanzy</italic> and 
 <italic>M. kummel</italic> fruits are harvested mostly freely from the wild and sold at the weekly local and daily urban markets in fresh conditions. Market assessment of wild edible plant species showed that most of the edible plants are not sold only for food purposes but also for other purposes such as timber, agricultural tools, construction, and fuel wood purposes. Some of the wild edible plant part(s) such as the fruits of 
 <italic>Syzygium guineense</italic>, 
 <italic>Balanites aegyptiaca</italic>, 
 <italic>Boswellia neglecta</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ximenia americana</italic> and the leaves of 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> are most commonly sold by women and children and provide the opportunity to supplement household income [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A study conducted in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also revealed that the sale of wild edible plants supplements low farm returns and contributes additional income to households. The marketability of wild edible plants has revealed that the majority of WEPs (75.7%) in East Shewa were not marketed. It has been found that 24.3% were widely marketed from the wild harvest to the local market [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The wild edible plants in the Bule Hora Woreda, Southern Ethiopia, are almost not sold as food in the local market except for a few; that is, only 
 <italic>Syzygium guineense</italic> (Willd.) DC. and 
 <italic>Syzygium guineense</italic> var. (Wild.) DC. have been sold in the past during the shortage of food in the area.
