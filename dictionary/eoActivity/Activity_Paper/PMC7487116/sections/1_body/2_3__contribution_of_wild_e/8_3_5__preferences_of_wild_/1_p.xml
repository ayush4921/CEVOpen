<p>The preference of wild edible plants varied; some of the wild edible plants are consumed only during famine and not consumed during normal periods [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The individual preference for wild edible plant consumption varies from one locality to another [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The condition or time when each plant is consumed also varies. Some plants are consumed always even in the presence of appreciable food stock, while others are consumed only at times of acute food shortage and scarcity ([
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; Assefa and Abebe, 2014; [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]). Plants that are consumed at normal periods are highly valued during periods of food scarcity at all levels. Majority of the wild edible plants in the area were eaten as extra food instead of being served as regular meals. This indicates the use of wild edible plants for other purposes such as materials for house construction and as charcoal during periods when there is sufficient access to cultivated plants.
