<p>Fruit was the dominant part of wild edible plants that was reported to be highly edible in most studies undertaken in different parts of Ethiopia [

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The increased use of wild fruits compared to other parts of the plant may be because the fruits are used more during seasons of food shortages, and fruit has good taste and flavour because of its chemical composition. However, the result of Amenu [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and Mesfin et al. [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] indicated that roots are mostly used for medicinal and edible purposes. On the other hand, Guyu and Muluneh [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] reported that 52.4% of the total amount of wild foods came from wild vegetables, which is about 5 times higher than fruits and roots. The variation in consumption of wild edible plant parts might be due to the variation of plant species in adapting to different ecological zones and culture of the people in different areas. Figures
