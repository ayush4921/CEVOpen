 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> the assignment of all the peaks detected is also shown. Only the most intense peaks were considered to assess the time courses for the peptides degradation by IDE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figures 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">3</xref>). The relative intensity of cryptic peptide at 1617.8 
 <italic>m/z</italic> for NPAF reaches a maximum after about 30 min of incubation of NPAF with IDE and diminishes its abundance after that time. This trend is easily explained by considering that IDE cleaves peptides in a sequential manner

 </xref>, and therefore longer peptides can be further degraded into shorter fragments by the enzyme soon after their formation. These results clearly demonstrate that IDE is able to cleave both peptides and the observed cleavage sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) are in accordance with the observation that IDE exhibits some preference for basic (Arg) or large hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Tyr) amino acids at the carboxyl side of the cleavage site
