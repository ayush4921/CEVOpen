<p>A further insight into the reciprocal effect that insulin and the NPs have on IDE proteolytic activity can be obtained by following insulin degradation by IDE in the presence of the NPs. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, the relative intensities of the insulin molecular peak as a function of time is plotted for solutions containing IDE and insulin or a mixture of IDE, insulin and the NPs. In this case, although the curves are all very similar to each other, a small but reproducible (experiments were performed three times) activating effect for NPAF on insulin degradation by IDE is observed (faster degradation of the intact insulin). It is well known that small molecules and peptides can be activators of IDE through their binding to allosteric sites

 </xref> and our results indicate that NPAF but not NPFF can be an IDE activator as well as a substrate. In addition, we performed experiments co-incubating IDE and NPs for 3 h prior the addition of insulin, in order to see if the small activation effect observed in the case of NPAF can be attributed to the full-length peptide or to an IDE generated cryptide. We observed no activation effect in this case as all the curves recorded (incubation for 3 h of IDE with and without NPAF/NPFF and then addition of insulin) are superimposable (data not shown). This means that the small activation effect observed in the case of NPAF is due to the full-length peptide and not to any of its IDE produced cryptides.
