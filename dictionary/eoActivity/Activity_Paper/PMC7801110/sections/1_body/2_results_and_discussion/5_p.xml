<p>In order to see if the NPAF small activatory effect on insulin degradation by IDE is site specific, and therefore leads to an increase in the amount of specific insulin cryptides rather than to an overall aspecific increase of insulin degradation, we have monitored the relative intensities of all the insulin fragments versus time of incubation

 </xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>, the time courses of the most intense IDE produced insulin fragments are reported, for solutions containing IDE and insulin with and without NPAF. It is shown that for some insulin fragments [A(14–21) B(14–24), A(1–14) B(14–30) and A(1–14) B(14–25), see 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>] the detected time courses are evidently altered in the presence of NPAF, while others remain unaffected. Particularly, the analysis of the fragments whose abundance is increased by the presence of NPAF, indicates that the latter increases IDE activity towards insulin in a site-specific manner, favouring the action of the enzyme mainly at the B13–14 insulin cleavage site. This result hints that the interaction of IDE with NPAF somehow must modify the binding of insulin with the enzyme, so that the latter increases its catalytic activity towards a specific portion of the insulin amino acidic sequence.
