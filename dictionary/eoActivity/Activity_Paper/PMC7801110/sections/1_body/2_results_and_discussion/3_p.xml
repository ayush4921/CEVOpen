<p>Once the degradation of the two peptides by IDE was assessed, the next question that needed a more thorough explanation was how this enzymatic activity affects/is affected by insulin degradation. The latter has been already well characterised in our previous reports

 </xref> and here we investigated only how the presence of insulin in the incubation mixture affects NPFF and NPAF degradation, and how NPFF and NPAF and their fragments affect insulin degradation by IDE. In order to elucidate the first point, that is how insulin affects NPFF and NPAF degradation, we co-incubated insulin, IDE and NPFF or NPAF together and studied the time courses of the cryptic peptides which are formed. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">5</xref>, the results for NPFF and NPAF are reported, respectively. Strikingly, insulin has a very different effect on the degradation of the two peptides by IDE. Indeed, insulin does not alter NPAF degradation by IDE at short times of incubation, having an inhibitory effect on the peptide degradation only after several minutes of co-incubation. Considering that insulin degradation and the formation of insulin fragments by IDE are very quick at these experimental conditions

 </xref>, the observed results can be explained by assuming that the insulin fragments, rather than the full-length hormone, exert an inhibitory effect on NPAF degradation by IDE. On the contrary, insulin inhibitory effect observed in the case of NPFF at very short incubation times indicates that, in this case, it is the full-length insulin, which is slowing down the peptide degradation, whereas the insulin fragments have little effect on IDE degrading activity towards NPFF. For a peptide to be degraded by IDE, the former must bind to the enzyme, access its catalytic site containing a zinc ion, form an intermediate complex, and finally fragments will be released. If there are more than one IDE substrates in solution (as in our case with the coexistence of insulin and the NPs), it is conceivable that IDE will degrade first and more quickly the peptides which have a higher binding affinity for the enzyme. We have already reported that longer NPs have higher affinity for IDE than shorter ones

 </xref> and NPFF is much shorter than NPAF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). From this perspective, our different results on the inhibitory role of insulin on cleavage of the two peptides can be easily explained by assuming that, also in this case, NPFF has lower affinity for the enzyme. Therefore, in a solution containing insulin and NPFF, IDE will first bind and degrade insulin. Longer incubation times will be needed for IDE to degrade appreciably the NPFF present in solution with the insulin. On the contrary, the larger dimensions of NPAF make this peptide a more suitable candidate to bind IDE competitively also in the presence of insulin, therefore, when NPAF and insulin coexist in solution, IDE cleaves both very efficiently. Of course, as time goes by and the solution becomes rich of insulin and peptide fragments, a competition for the occupation of the enzyme catalytic site occurs and a decrease of NPAF degradation at longer incubation time is observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>).
