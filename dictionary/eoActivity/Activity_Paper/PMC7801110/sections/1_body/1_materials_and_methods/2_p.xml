<p>IDE, His-Tag, rat, recombinant, 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. NPAF, NPFF were manually synthesised by the solid-phase method using Fmoc chemistry. Peptides were purified by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and tested for their purity using ESI MS. Purity was above 95%. Human insulin, phosphate buffer solution (PBS), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), acetonitrile (C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>3</sub>N) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) experiments were carried out by using a LCQ Deca XP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). All solutions were incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. After incubations, sample aliquots at time 0; 10; 30; 45; 60 and 180 min were taken and a 10% solution of TFA was added to the aliquots in order to achieve a final TFA concentration of 1% in all the samples to stop the enzymatic reaction. Samples were kept at 4 °C before HPLC-MS analysis. NPAF or NPFF (20 μM) were incubated with IDE (135 nM), while the concentration of insulin, when used, was 10 μM. In order to assess the effect of NPAF and NPFF fragments on insulin degradation, the peptides were incubated for three hours with IDE and then insulin (10 μM) was added to the reaction mixture. Separation of the generated fragments was carried out by the reversed-phase chromatography using a Jupiter
 <sup>®</sup> 5 µm C4 300 Å (LC Column 150 × 4.6 mm) column from Phenomenex at the flow rate of 250 μl/min. MS-MS experiments were used for final identification of the peptide fragments. All methodological details and a semiquantitative method were already described in our previous work, and the absolute intensities of the peaks were normalised to the total ion current
