<p>The most common method of storing plants in vitro is storage in conditions of slow growth, characterized by a decrease in the vegetative activity of the stored material. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of long-term deposition of plants with lower storage costs, which is provided by increasing the intervals between subcultures [
