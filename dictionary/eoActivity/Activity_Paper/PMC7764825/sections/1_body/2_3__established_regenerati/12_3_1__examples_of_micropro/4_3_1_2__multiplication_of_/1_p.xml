<p>Of the tested variants of nutrient media, the highest multiplication coefficient of shoots (17.0 Â± 1.0) was recorded on MS medium with a twice-reduced concentration of macronutrients and the joint addition of 0.5 mg/L BAP and 0.1 mg/L IBA. This coefficient value significantly exceeds the parameter values for other variants of nutrient media (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01733-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Presumably, the main influence on the multiplication of shoots here is the combined use of cytokinin and auxin, which often has a positive effect on the degree of multiplication of shoots [

 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> shoots, BAP at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/L and a IBA of 0.1 mg/L were added to the MS medium. In one of the experiment variants, vitamins were used according to the prescription of the B5 medium [
