<p>The QL culture medium with 0.5 mg/L BAP shows best stimulation for 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> in vitro shoots multiplication. Using this nutrient medium, the multiplication coefficient statistically significantly exceeds the values of this indicator for other used nutrient media (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01733-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Thus, the results of our experiment, on the one hand, confirm the information from the literature about the success of using theQL (Quorin and LePoivre) medium for 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> multiplication, on the other hand, show new data on the effectiveness of using BAP instead of benzimidazole and PP-40 [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The MS and QL [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] media were used to stimulate the multiplication of 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> shoots without adding phytohormones and with the addition of 0.2 mg/L and 0.5 mg/l BAP. Auxins in various concentrations were used for the formation of roots by plants of 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic>: IBA (Indole-3-butyric acid) (2 mg/L, 5 mg/L), IAA (indolyl acetic acid) (2 mg/L), NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) (0.5 mg/L, 0.025 mg/L) and combined application of NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid), 0.5 mg/L and BAP (6-Benzylaminopurine) at a concentration of 0.05 mg/L.
