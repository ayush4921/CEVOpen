<p>Of the 12 tested variants of nutrient media, the highest percentage of rooting in vitro were found on the half MS and MS media—the percentage of rooting in both variants reached 40% (

At the same time, our data contradict the results of other studies, where WPM (woody plant medium) and QL (Quorin and LePoivre) with the addition of NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L are indicated as the most effective variants of nutrient media for rooting in vitro

 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This may be due to the fact that some of researchers distinguish 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> as a variation of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic>, rather than as a separate species, and most of the nutrient media are presented for 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. To activate in vitro Rhizogenesis, 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> plants were transferred to MS (Murashige and Skoog), QL (Quorin and LePoivre), and WPM (woody plant medium) media [
 <xref rid="B92-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and they were whole and had a reduced concentration of macroelements. The nutrient media were quenched without the addition of auxins, and with the addition of NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) at a concentration of 1 mg/L. With the statistical analysis used, we determined such indicators as the multiplication coefficient and the percentage of rooting. The values of the proliferation coefficient were compared with each other using Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. Standard statistical errors were determined for each value.
