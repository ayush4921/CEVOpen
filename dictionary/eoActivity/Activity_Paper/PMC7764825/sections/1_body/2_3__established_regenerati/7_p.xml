<p>The cultivation of 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> in vitro has still not been investigated. There are known technologies for cultivating some other species of the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. For example, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> demonstrates high values of the multiplication coefficient on MS medium with the addition of 1.0 mg/L 6-(γ,γ-Dimethylallylamino) purine (2-iP). Rhizogenesis of this species is successfully stimulated on the same medium with the addition of indolyl acetic acid (IAA) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L, providing data on the positive effect of vitamins in concentrations of B5 on the proliferation of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> shoots [

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, it is recommended to add 1.0 mg/L 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) together with 0.5 mg/L kinetin in order to achieve better multiplication on the MS medium. For rhizogenesis, IAA at a concentration of 1.5 mg/L is recommended (data are not given). For 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>, the best medium for multiplication of shoots is MS with the addition of 1.0 mg/L of BAP, and, for rhizogenesis, it is MS with the addition of 5.0 mg/L of Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) [

 <italic>A. nilagirica</italic> var. 
 <italic>nilagirica</italic> requires the combined addition of BAP and 2-iP at concentrations of 0.2 mg/L for a high degree of regeneration of shoots from the callus. Rhizogenesis of this species was noticeably observed on MS with the addition of IBA at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. To obtain the callus of the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> plants, it was recommended to use Thidiazuron (TDZ) in various concentrations [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Sujatha and Ranjitha [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], in their study on 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, provided data on the positive effect of vitamins in concentrations of B5 on the proliferation of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> shoots. The use of surfactants such as Dettol or Tween-20 was indicated in the literature as sterilizing agents during the first stages of sterilization of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> explants. To sterilize deeper layers of explants, it was recommended to use 0.1% HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution and 95% C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>OH solution (1:4).
