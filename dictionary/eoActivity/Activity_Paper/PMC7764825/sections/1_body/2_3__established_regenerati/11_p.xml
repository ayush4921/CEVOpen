<p>The method of dehydration encapsulation is actively used to create artificial seeds: explants are encapsulated in alginate beads, growing them in a liquid medium, partially dried (airflow, silica gel), and then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Methodically, the regeneration of endangered plant species and endemics directly includes micropropagation from apical meristems and direct somatic embryogenesis to produce artificial seeds. This, combined with the methods of depositing and cryopreservation, allows to create both banks of germplasm of rare and endangered species, and to reintroduce them into the environment.
