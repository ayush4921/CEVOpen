<p>Currently, there are three ways to preserve plants in vitro: storage in conditions of active growth, deposition under slow-growth conditions at low temperatures (+2–15 °C) and cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). Storing plants in conditions of active growth allows conservationists to successfully preserve, reproduce, and reintroduce for which the use of seeds is difficult due to their low germination and/or requirements for growing conditions. This method is widely used for in vitro conservation of both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Besides, for the conservation of rare and endangered species, it is preferable to use cultures of apical shoots and axillary buds to get healthy materials. Activation of meristems existing in the plant also obtains genetically identical offspring [
