<p>When cultivating aquatic plants, biotechnology face a high degree of contamination of plant material, as well as low seed germination [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. To avoid in vitro contamination of aquatic plants, new types of explants must be sought. A striking example is the representatives of the family 
 <italic>Nymphaeaceae</italic> Salisb family. The species 
 <italic>Nymphaea</italic> ‘Daubeniana’ has special epiphyllous shoots that can be used for micropropagation [

 <xref rid="B109-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], as well as when adapting them ex situ, since many orchids are highly specialized species adapted to specific habitats. Acclimatization of many orchids, such as the ghost orchid (
 <italic>Dendrophylax lindenii</italic>), is a multi-stage and long-term process [
