<p>However, today, there are some new techniques and technologies that are useful for in vitro cultivation and which are not only species-specific but also for use with many species of threatened plants that are close in systematic or ecological terms. Recently a robust regeneration method for a crop wild legume and rare plant species “
 <italic>Cicer microphyllum</italic>” has been demonstrated to conserve the germplasm and to ensure the availability of germplasm for breeding programs [
 <xref rid="B94-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This wild legume has been proved as a natural repository of valuable traits for crop improvement programs [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. However, this species has endemic habitats in cold deserts of Himalayan mountain regions and diminishing very fast due to overgrazing by animals, and seeds were being eaten by birds. The method optimized for this species could help for large-scale propagation of disease-free plants in a containment facility for breeders to use in a crop improvement program, and may be useful for other rare wild legume species.
