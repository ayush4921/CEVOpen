<p>The basis for rapid growth and obtaining certain organs and tissues at a particular stage of micropropagation is the use of various growth regulators. Among the many commonly used phytohormones, rarer substances sometimes appear in vitro. One of these is triacontanol, which stimulates the formation of chlorophyll and increases the intensity of photosynthesis. The effect of the presented phytohormone is described on such plants as sweet wormwood (
