<p>It is important to note the problem of the symbiosis of orchids with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to the almost complete lack of nutrients in the seeds of orchids, these plants are forced to enter into a symbiotic relationship with some mycorrhizal fungi. Without mycorrhizal fungi, even with micropropagation, the cultivation of orchids can become almost impossible. Therefore, in the case of orchids, introducing fungal cultures into in vitro cultures specific to each particular type of orchid is actively practiced. This technology is particularly important for the acclimatization of orchids to indoor and outdoor conditions [
