<p>In our work, we observed prospects for their use for monitoring rare and endangered plant species. For these purposes, it is necessary to create spectral libraries of “red list” plant species. In this case, cell and tissue culture can be used as a base for obtaining experimental samples of “red list” plant species to develop a similar technology that allows remote and short-term monitoring of rare and endangered plant species.</p>
