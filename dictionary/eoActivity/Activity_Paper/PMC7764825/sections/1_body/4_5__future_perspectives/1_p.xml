<p>Conservation of diversity is one of the main mechanisms that support the stability of life on earth, while the disappearance of certain plant species may result in an increase in imbalance of natural fitness and lead to a shortage of raw materials that could be used for specific traits in crop improvement programs, medicine, the chemical industry, etc. (
