<p>Nowadays, one of the most pressing issues in biology is the preservation of the genetic diversity of living organisms. Special attention is paid to the conservation of the gene pool of many plant species since the most often the price-forming organisms in nature for breeder-preferred traits, as well as consumer-preferred traits [

The important preserving gene pool is not only for vital agriculture, but also for rare and endangered plants, which often have medicinal, decorative, forage, and other properties. Also, rare plants are important components of vegetation in a particular region. Their disappearance can lead to the destruction of the essence of the biological flora of plant communities [
