<p>To preserve the genetic diversity, germplasm is the possibility of further repatriation and creation of a collection of rare and endangered plant species of the Rostov region in vitro. The 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> is a promising plant species for which microclonal propagation technology needs to be developed. The importance of preserving various rare and endangered plant species used by humans has been discussed in many reports. For example, Grigoriadou et al. [
