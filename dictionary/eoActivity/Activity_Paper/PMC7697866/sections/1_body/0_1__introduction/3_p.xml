 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A variety of flavonoids, including baicalin, have been isolated and characterized from 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. Baicalin, which is a major bioactive compound [
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], is used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating diarrhea, dysentery, hypertension, hemorrhage, insomnia, inflammation, and respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, it exerts a potent antioxidant effect through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [
