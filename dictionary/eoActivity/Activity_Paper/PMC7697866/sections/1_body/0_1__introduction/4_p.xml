<p>Despite remarkable therapeutic effects, these plants also have several adverse effects including cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and developmental toxicity [

 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To overcome these problems, many researchers have studied the effects of complex mixtures containing extracts from these plants in different combinations. Combinations of these extracts often showed positive synergistic effects that surpassed the activities of the individual components [

 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we tried to optimize the extraction conditions for enhancing the phenolic compounds content in extracts of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> roots (SBR) and 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> barks (MOB), and evaluated different combinations of SBR and MOB for a reduction in cytotoxicity. The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities of the individual compounds and combinations thereof were also assessed.
