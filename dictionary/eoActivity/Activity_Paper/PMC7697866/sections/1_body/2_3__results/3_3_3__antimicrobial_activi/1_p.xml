<p>Agar disk diffusion and microdilution methods were used for determining the antimicrobial activities of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 against pathogenic microorganisms; the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01111-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01111-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The obtained results revealed a sensitivity variation among the microorganisms tested (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01111">Figure S4</xref>). Particularly, GenoTX-407 showed the highest antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and fungi used in this study. In the disk diffusion assay, SBR did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms, although a MIC of 2500 μg/mL was recorded against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in the microdilution assay. In general, MOB was less effective than GenoTX-407 and had no influence on the growth of the gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, only GenoTX-407 showed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (10.20 ± 0.131 mm) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (9.89 ± 0.083 mm). The MBC values further revealed that GenoTX-407 exhibited bactericidal effects. Among the gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> was the most sensitive strain to MOB and GenoTX-407 treatment, exhibiting inhibition zones of 30.54 ± 0.922 and 35.10 ± 0.676 mm, respectively. The MBC values indicated that MOB and GenoTX-407 exhibited bacteriostatic effects against 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>, while 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was the most resistant, with inhibition zones of 16.53 ± 0.361 and 18.90 ± 0.335 mm, respectively. Furthermore, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were less sensitive to MOB and GenoTX-407 treatment.
