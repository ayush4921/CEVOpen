<p>To optimize the extraction of phenolic compounds from SBR and MOB, various ethanol concentrations and extraction times (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01111">Tables S1 and S2</xref>), and treatments with different solvents (butanol, chloroform, acetone, and hexane) for different time periods were tested. The total baicalin content (64.2%) in SBR extract was maximized via extraction with 0% ethanol for 2 h followed by treatment with 1.5% phosphoric acid for 0.5 h. Extraction with 50% ethanol for 2 h followed by hexane treatment for 0.5 h resulted in the MOB extract with the highest total magnolol and honokiol contents (51.2%). Each polyphenol in the extracts of GenoTX-407 (
