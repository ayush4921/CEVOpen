<p>To evaluate cytotoxicity, the viability of RAW 264.7 cells was determined by an MTT assay after treatment with various concentrations (0–1000 μg/mL) of SBR and MOB extracts. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01111-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, low concentrations (0–10 μg/mL) did not significantly influence cell viability. The concentrations required to inhibit cell viability by 50% were 95.46 and 15.89 μg/mL of SBR and MOB, respectively. At SBR and MOB concentrations of 250 and 31.3 μg/mL, respectively, RAW 264.7 growth was almost completely inhibited. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of GenoTX-407 was 131.9 μg/mL. Based on these data, we analyzed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of SBR (25, 50, and 100 μg/mL), MOB (5, 10, and 20 μg/mL), and GenoTX-407 (20 and 100 μg/mL).
