<p>Antimicrobial tests involved agar disk diffusion using 100 µL of a suspension containing 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL bacteria and 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL yeast, spread onto the respective agar plates [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The disks (8 mm in diameter, ADVANTEC CO., LTD., Tokyo, Japan) were impregnated with 20 µL of the 100 mg/mL extracts (2 mg/disk) and placed on the inoculated agar. DMSO-loaded disks were used as negative controls. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in case of bacteria and at 30 °C for 2 to 5 days in case of yeast and fungi. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the clear zones around the disks. Antibacterial activity was expressed as the mean zone of inhibition diameters (mm) produced by the extract. Each assay in this experiment was repeated three times.
