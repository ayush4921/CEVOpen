<p>HeLa cells were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate and pre-incubated at 37 °C for 12 h to achieve stable attachment. Next, the wells were washed with PBS, refreshed with media containing either SBR (100 µg/mL) or MOB (20 µg/mL) or GenoTX-407 (20, 50 and 100 µg/mL), and incubated for 24 h. HeLa cells were homogenized in 10 volumes of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Western blot analysis was conducted as previously described [

The membranes were then immunoblotted with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The antibodies used in this study are Nrf2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), HO-1 (Abcam), SOD1 (Abcam), and CAT (Abcam). The band densities were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, NIH, MD, USA) and normalized to the density of actin.
