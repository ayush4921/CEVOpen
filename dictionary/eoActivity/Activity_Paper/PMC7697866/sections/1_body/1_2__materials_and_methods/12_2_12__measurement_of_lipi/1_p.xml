<p>Lipid peroxidation was measured by determining the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the brain. Briefly, the brains of ICR mice were dissected immediately after intracardial perfusion with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brain tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of cold PBS and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. To induce lipid peroxidation, 450 µL of the brain homogenate was mixed with 25 µL 50 µM ferric chloride in the presence or absence of various concentrations of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 (25 µL) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (500 μL of an 8.1%
