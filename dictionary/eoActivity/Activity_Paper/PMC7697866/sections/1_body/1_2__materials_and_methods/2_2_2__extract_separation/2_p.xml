<p>Finely ground SBR powder was extracted with 0% ethanol at 80 °C for 2 h. The ratio of root powder to water was 1:8 (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The resulting slurries were filtered through Whatman Grade 1 filter paper. This procedure was repeated twice for the residue and the filtrates were combined. The extracted solution was further treated with 1.5% phosphoric acid for 30 min. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor; BUCHI Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) and freeze-dried (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). The obtained extract powder was desiccated and stored at 4 °C and used directly in the antioxidant tests. Each fraction was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and highly concentrated stock solutions were prepared to ensure that the DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.1% in any of the experiments.
