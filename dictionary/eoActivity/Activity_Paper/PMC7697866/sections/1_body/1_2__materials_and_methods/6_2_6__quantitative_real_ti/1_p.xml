<p>Total RNA was isolated from cells and brain tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed according to previously described methods. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal standard to normalize the expression of the target transcripts. The primer sets used to amplify tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are shown in
