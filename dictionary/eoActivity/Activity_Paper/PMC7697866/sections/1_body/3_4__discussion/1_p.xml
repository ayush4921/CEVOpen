<p>In this study, we demonstrated that SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 exhibited antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, SBR exhibited more potent antioxidant activity than MOB. Contrastingly, MOB exhibited more potent anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities than SBR. In the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory tests, both SBR and MOB showed concentration-dependent effects, and the proportion was determined at 5:1 (SBR: MOB) based on the cytotoxicity test. GenoTX-407, a combination of SBR and MOB extracts, revealed a synergistic effect of SBR and MOB in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity tests. Moreover, in comparison to MOB, GenoTX-407 showed higher antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and fungi investigated in this study.</p>
