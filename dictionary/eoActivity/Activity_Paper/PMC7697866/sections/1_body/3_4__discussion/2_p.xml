<p>It is well known that baicalin is the predominant flavonoid in SBR and it has a defined chemical structure [

Although several factors influence baicalin extraction, previous studies have revealed that extraction time is the major determining factor in optimizing the extraction process [

 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, the effects of two experimental factors, i.e., ethanol concentration and extraction time, on baicalin yield from SBR were studied using HPLC. Then, we verified the stability and precision of the optimized extraction process by determining the optimum conditions, including ethanol concentration (0%) and extraction time (2 h). Magnolol and honokiol are major components isolated from MOB and the optimized conditions for their extraction are 50% ethanol concentration and 2 h extraction time [
