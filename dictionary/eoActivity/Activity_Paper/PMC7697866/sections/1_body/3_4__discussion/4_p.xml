<p>Moreover, treatment with SBR was less effective against bacteria, compared to MOB treatment. Although MOB exhibited activity against some bacteria, GenoTX-407 exhibited the highest activity against all bacteria and fungi that were investigated in this study. In many studies, co-treatment with baicalin enhanced the growth-inhibitory effects of antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides, it has been reported that baicalin restores the inhibition of TetK-mediated tetracycline efflux [
