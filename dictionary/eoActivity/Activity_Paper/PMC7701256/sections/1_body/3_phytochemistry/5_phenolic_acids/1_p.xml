<p>The chemical constituents of phenolic acids in 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> are polar, and the active components are mainly enriched in n-butanol and water extracts. It has been found that phenolic acids have anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, which may be related to the Gallic acyl groups in the structure. At present, 12 compounds of phenolic acids have been isolated from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> (
 <bold>40‒51</bold>). 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2009)</xref> reported 7 compounds: Protocatechuic acid (
 <bold>40</bold>), Gallic acid (
 <bold>41</bold>), Ellagic acid (
 <bold>42</bold>), 3,3’-dimethoxy Ellagic acid (
 <bold>43</bold>), 1-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (
 <bold>44</bold>), Mucic acid dimethyl ester-2-O-gallate (
 <bold>45</bold>), and Caffeic acid ethyl ester (
 <bold>48</bold>). The other 5 compounds are Caffeic acid (
 <bold>46</bold>), Methyl 3,4-dihydroxycinnamate (
 <bold>47</bold>), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid methyl ester (
 <bold>49</bold>), Methyl 4-hydroxycinnamate (
 <bold>50</bold>), and 4-dihydroxy-5,7-dihydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) coumarin (
