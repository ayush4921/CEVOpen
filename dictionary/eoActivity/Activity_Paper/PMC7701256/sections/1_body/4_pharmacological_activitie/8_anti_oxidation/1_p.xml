<p>The ethyl acetate and methanol extract isolated from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> can scavenge ABTS and DPPH free radicals in a dose-dependent manner. 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2020)</xref> obtained the polyphenol extract from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> by ultrasonic combined with Tween 80 extraction method, and found that it had strong antioxidant activity, at the same concentration, the scavenging rate and total reduction ability of polyphenol extract to DPPH free radicals was stronger than positive control drug Vitamin C, and the scavenging effect was positively correlated with the mass concentration. In addition, the extract of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> also had inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase activity (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2011</xref>), among which methanol extract had the strongest inhibitory activity, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 16.14 mg/L, which was much lower than positive control group (1081.27 mg/L).
