<p>The syrup and decoction made of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> are clinically used in the treatment of pertussis, and the curative effect is remarkable (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhan, 1996</xref>). It was found that the 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> water extract inhibited the cough of ammonia-induced cough mice in a dose-dependent manner. The high dose group (0.2g/10g) significantly promoted the excretion of phenol red in the respiratory tract of mice in the phenol red expectorant experiment, and this shows that the higher dose of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> water extract has expectorant effect (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Long and Li (2010)</xref> used SO
 <sub>2</sub> to induce cough in mice and found that 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> could prolong the cough latency of mice induced by SO
 <sub>2</sub> stimulation, reduce the number of coughs, relieve cough significantly, and increase the sputum excretion of Wistar rats after drug modeling. 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2016)</xref> found that 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> with honey can effectively prolong the latency of cough induced by concentrated ammonia water in mice, reduce the number of cough in mice, and the antitussive effect is stronger than crude plant.
