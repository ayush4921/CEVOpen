<p>In the HPLC chromatogram obtained from anti-inflammatory extracts of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, the researcher found that the peak of quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide is the highest. Moreover, it was found that quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide could inhibit lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Shirai et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Begum and Terao, 2002</xref>), angiotensin II-stimulated JNK activation (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kyaw et al., 2004</xref>), and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Shirai et al., 2006</xref>). The content of quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide was 0.90%, which was higher than that of quercetin in 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, indicating that the quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide was one of the major active compounds of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, and it is closely related to the anti-inflammatory effect.
