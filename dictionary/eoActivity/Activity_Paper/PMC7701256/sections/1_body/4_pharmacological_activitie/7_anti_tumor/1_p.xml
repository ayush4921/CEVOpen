<p>The ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has a good inhibitory effect on tumor proliferation in vivo and in vitro (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Zhang, 2013</xref>), and it can strongly inhibit the growth and proliferation of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells, colon cancer Colo320 cells, prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and acute myeloid leukemia HL60 cells in vitro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 50ug/mL), but has a weak inhibitory effect on mouse melanoma B-16 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> â‰¥ 91.63ug/mL). In vivo, the inhibition rate of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> ethyl acetate extract high dose group (200 mg/kg) on implanted sarcoma (S-180) in mice was 58.46%, and the inhibition rate of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in the positive control group was 52.31%.
