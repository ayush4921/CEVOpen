 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Li etÂ al. (2019)</xref> obtained an anti-tumor active component named PEC, through the separation of ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, and found that flavonoids were the main active components of PEC. PEC can effectively inhibit the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells, gastric cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, glioma cells, and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. It also has obvious inhibitory effect on mouse hepatoma cell and sarcoma cell in vivo, and its inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. In addition, PEC can reduce the expression of VEGF in tumor tissue, reduce the density of microvascular system in tumor tissue, increase the activity of NK cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL), promote the proliferation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, increase the activity of T lymphocytes, enhance the secretion of splenocyte IL-2, and raise the levels of IgG, IgG2a, and IgG2b in serum. It is suggested that its anti-tumor mechanism may be to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by improving immune ability, promoting tumor vascular necrosis, or hijacking tumor cells stagnated in G2 phase.
