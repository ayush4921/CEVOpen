<p>Cinnamon essential oil was obtained using the hydrodistillation method, subsequently the oil obtained was dehydrated with Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and then filtered at 0.22 µm. Then the vials were stored at a temperature of 4°C. All the analyses were obtained at an initial temperature of 50°C with helium gas as a vehicle. The hydrolate, the result of the distillate, was separated, taking into account its properties of immiscibility and density difference between water and essential oil, using a glass pear-shaped separating funnel, dehydrating water, and essential oil impurities with Na

 <sub>4</sub> anhydrous; the pure oil was filtered and stored at −20°C until use. The essential oil concentration preparations were made using the Tween solution also known as polysorbate because they are polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, whose main characteristics are brownish yellow, oily liquid and water-soluble, anhydrous ethanol and methanol.With a density of 1.10 g/ml; HLB (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) of 16.7; and a molecular weight of 1227.5. Then the concentrations of cinnamon essential oils were placed in a water bath at 37°C to avoid solidification.
