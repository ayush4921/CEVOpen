<p>We live in a world surrounded by microbes, the endophyte in a plant includes both the endogenous bacteria that are inherent to the plant and the inter-endogenous bacteria that coexist between the plants. As a class of microbes coexisting with host plants, endophytes have become an increasingly good resource for finding new active compounds. Plant seeds are not merely reproductive organs or important tools in agricultural production, they are also carriers of both pathogens and beneficial endophytes, particularly, inherent and non-invasive characteristic endophytes in host plant. However, in comparison to the well-studied endophytic fungi of roots, stems and leaves in those plants, little is known about microbes associated with plant seeds, in particular, the true knowledge of endophytic diversity in medicinal plant seeds.</p>
