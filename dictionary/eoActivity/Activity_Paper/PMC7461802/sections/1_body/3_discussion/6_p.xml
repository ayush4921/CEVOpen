<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by triplet state oxygen reacting with other molecules, such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (H

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2013</xref>). When these species are produced in excess due to pathophysiological processes or environmental interference, ROS can promote tissue damage and result in disease. Antioxidants are known to prevent those reactions caused by free radicals (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Marson Ascencio et al., 2014</xref>). In this paper, six antioxidant activity assays, including DPPH, hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, FRAP assay, total antioxidant capacity assay, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging assay and superoxide anion radical scavenging assay, were used to comprehensively evaluate the antioxidant activities of endophytic metabolites. The results showed that the sample JH-4 mycelium displayed the best antioxidant activity. Furthermore, total phenols and total flavonoids are known as the main components of antioxidant activity, and their contents are determined. Phenolic compounds are known to have very important biological activities, such as preventing hormone-related cancers, and as potent antioxidant agents (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pise et al., 2010</xref>). The antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is mostly derived from their redox actions, neutralizing free radicals, quenching singlet and triplet oxygen, or decomposing peroxides. Flavonoids are widely distributed polyphenolic compounds and have recently received extensive attention due to their important antioxidant properties (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pietta, 2000</xref>). Flavonoids probably showed antioxidant activities because of their high total number of OH groups (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Firuzi et al., 2005</xref>). According to the current results, we found a significant correlation between flavonoid content and radical scavenging effect, but the correlation between total phenolics content and antioxidant activity was relatively weaker. The results further suggest that antioxidants in the bacteria may be flavonoids. The results obtained in this study also agree with those published previously in the literature (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Moein et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, there were few studies on the activity of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> endophytes besides (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of isolated endophytes from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> were detected using the paper disc diffusion method with five tested strains, including

 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and

 <italic>aureus</italic>, with a MIC of 25 Î¼g/mL, which also indicates that further research is necessary.
