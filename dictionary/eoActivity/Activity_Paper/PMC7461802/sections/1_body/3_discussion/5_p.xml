<p>Genetic evidence suggests that uncultured microorganisms account for a high percentage of environmental microbial communities in natural ecosystems, and yet the accessible (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rapp√© et al., 2002</xref>), cultivable fraction is less than 1% (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Epstein, 2013</xref>). Therefore, this study used metagenomics to analyze endophytic diversity in the seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> and compared with endophytes isolated from healthy leaves, stems, roots and seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> using 20 different media. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) showed that the most frequent endophytic fungi were also 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. as seen in artificial media; moreover, our results showed that endophytic fungi obtained through artificial cultivation are mainly phyla 
 <italic>Ascomycota</italic>, among which none of the endophytes isolated from the 
 <italic>Angelica</italic> seed belonged to 
 <italic>Pseudallescheria</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp., as seen in the diversity analysis by high-throughput sequencing. Correspondingly, the microorganisms of 
 <italic>Basidiomycetes</italic> were not isolated on artificial media. The results suggest that pathogenic fungi, including 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Pseudallescheria</italic> sp., may not be inherent endophytes in plants, but are formed by transfection from the environment during plant growth. As such, the microorganisms inherent in those plants, rather than the microorganisms obtained from the outside world, may be true endophytes. In addition, the endophytic bacteria obtained by artificially separating the medium are mainly divided into two phyla, 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. Furthermore, the endophytes in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> seed contained seven phyla isolated with the high-throughput sequencing of microorganisms, and five phyla of endophytic bacteria, including 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, 
 <italic>Microgenomates</italic>, and 
 <italic>Saccharibacteria</italic>, were not isolated on artificial medium. Therefore, we believe the endophytes in the roots, stems and leaves of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> possibly derived from the seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, and changes in individual dominant strains of roots, stems and leaves of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> may be due to changes in growth environment of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. Our results also suggested that seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> is a good material for studying the endophytes of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. Moreover, in another study, in order to simulate the natural environment as much as possible, we used plant extract as the medium for the microorganisms cultured. However, we found that this medium was too difficult to culture the fungus and further added potato extract as a growth factor (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Beever and Bollard, 1970</xref>), which significantly increased the fungal colony rate (data not shown). This result also indicates that different separation methods are necessary if more intrinsic endophytic bacteria and endophytic fungi are to be isolated.
