<p>Endophytes are widely distributed in plant tissues as well as the interior of plant tissues. Endophytes with different morphologies and functions are isolated from various plant species in natural ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Tejesvi et al., 2011</xref>), and play an important role in host life cycles (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Western China, especially in Gansu Province, has a unique alpine climate and is a suitable place for

 <italic>sinensis</italic> planting. Some areas are called as “the homeland of Chinese 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>,” and its production of artificially cultivated 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> constitutes 70% of China’s total production (

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> plants from Min County of Gansu province were used to isolate endophytes using a tissue homogenate method.
