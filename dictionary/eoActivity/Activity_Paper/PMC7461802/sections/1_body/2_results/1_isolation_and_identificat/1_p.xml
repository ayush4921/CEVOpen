<p>Many studies have confirmed that endophytes have obvious distribution diversity in different tissue of host plants (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kumar and Hyde, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Promputtha et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jeewon et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, in this study, different tissue of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, including roots, stems, leaves, and seeds, are used for the isolation of endophytes. A large number of endophytes were isolated from different tissues of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, including leaves, stems, roots and seeds, all of which showed that endophytes are very abundant and diverse in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. After inoculation and culturing for more than 1 week, 226 endophyte strains with distinct morphology were isolated from the roots, stems, leaves and seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> samples. All tissues showed a variation in the colonization frequency of endophytes. Among the tissues sampled, maximum colonization frequency was found in seed (29%), followed by leaf (26%) and lastly in stem and root with 23 and 22%, respectively. The molecular identification of 47 typical strains combined with morphology is shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The maximum nucleotide identity of the 16S DNA sequences of endophyte compared with those available in GenBank ranged from 99 to 100% (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kusari et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tree shows two major groups, which comprise 13 isolates belonging to 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, and includes 
 <italic>Brevibacillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Erwinia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, a phylogenetic tree was built from 18S rDNA sequences of endophytic fungi. The tree shows two major groups, which comprises 34 isolates belonging to 
 <italic>Ascomycota</italic> and 
 <italic>Deuteromycetes</italic>, and corresponds to 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Trichothecium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp.
