<p>The method of estimation of total flavonoid content and total phenol content was developed in the present study, the result of which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. The standard curve of the rutin standard and gallic acid show a good linearity (

 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99) over the concentration range of 0–1.2 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,C</xref>). The results suggests that the method is applicable for the determination of total flavonoid content and total phenol content (

The total phenolic content in JH-4 fermentation, JH-4 mycelium, GT-2 fermentation and ZP4-3 fermentation were estimated to be 0.164 ± 0.008 mg/mL, 0.142 ± 0.009 mg/mL, 0.148 ± 0.004 mg/mL, and 0.229 ± 0.008 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The total flavonoid content in JH-4 fermentation, JH-4 mycelium, GT-2 fermentation and ZP4-3 fermentation were estimated to be 0.156 ± 0.004 mg/mL, 0.173 ± 0.003 mg/mL, 0.044 ± 0.004 mg/mL, and 0.084 ± 0.006 mg/mL, respectively, of which the highest total content of flavonoids was found in the JH- 4 mycelium, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>.
