<p>The relative ratio of bacteria to fungi composition at the phylum level is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, bacterial sequences were classified into 7 phyla. the main phyla in the four biological samples were 
 <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> (65.45–90.4%), 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (7.64–33.23%), and 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (0.04–1.46%). The relatively low abundance (0.24–1.24%) of 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, 
 <italic>Microgenomates</italic>, and 
 <italic>Saccharibacteria</italic> was also detected in a most biosamples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, fungi from two phyla were detected, the main phylum in the four biosamples was 
 <italic>Ascomycota</italic> (98.15–99.56%). The relatively low abundance (0.44–1.85%) of 
 <italic>Basidiomycota</italic> was also detected in most biosamples.
