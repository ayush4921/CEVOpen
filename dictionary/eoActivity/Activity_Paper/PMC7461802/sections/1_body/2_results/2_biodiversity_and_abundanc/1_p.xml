<p>A total of 252,400 fungi sequences and 362,404 bacterial sequences were obtained from 4 seed samples of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. The length of these valid sequences was approximately 280–340 bp for bacteria and 220–260 for fungi, accounting for 99% of the total valid sequences. The mean length of these valid sequences was nearly 290 bp for bacteria and 250 bp for fungi. The rarefaction curves of sequence data showed clear asymptotes in the number of observed species, demonstrating that bacterial and fungal communities from each seed sample of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> were well-covered by pyrosequencing (
