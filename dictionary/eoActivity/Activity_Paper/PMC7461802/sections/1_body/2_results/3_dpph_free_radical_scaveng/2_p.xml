<p>Moreover, the antioxidant activities of these four samples were further determined using different methods at different concentrations. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–F</xref>, our results showed that four tested samples exhibited antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner within a concentration range of 0.02–0.1 mg/mL. Similar to the standard V
