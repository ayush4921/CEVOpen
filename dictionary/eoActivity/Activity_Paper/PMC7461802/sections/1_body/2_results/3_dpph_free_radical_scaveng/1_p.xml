<p>In the current study, the antioxidant activity of 190 endophytic metabolite extracts was evaluated using the DPPH scavenging method. The primary results of the DPPH radical scavenging assay are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (scavenging rates &gt; 70%). As can be seen, scavenging rates between 0 and 70%, 70 and 80%, 80 and 90%, and 9 and 100% were found in 49 (46.23%), 13 (12.26%), 21 (19.81%), and 1 (0.94%) isolates, respectively (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The DPPH radical scavenging rate of ZP4-3 fermentation, JH-4 mycelia, JH-4 fermentation and GT-2 fermentation exceeded 85%, indicating significant antioxidant activity, with the highest values observed for ZP4-3 fermentation (95.21 Â± 1.131%).
