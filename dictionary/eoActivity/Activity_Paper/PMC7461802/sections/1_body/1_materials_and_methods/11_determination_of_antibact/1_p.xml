<p>Antimicrobial activity of the secondary metabolite of endophytes was evaluated using the paper disc diffusion method, as described by 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Doughari (2006)</xref>. For determination of antibacterial activity, all bacterial strains were suspended in nutrient broth and incubated at 37°C, after which they were adjusted to approximately 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony forming units/mL with sterile saline (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2002</xref>) and 200 μL of suspensions was spread over nutrient agar (beef-oxoid) plates (diameter: 9 cm). Extracts were dissolved in 10% aqueous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. Under aseptic conditions, empty sterilized discs (diameter: 6 mm) were impregnated with 10 μL of extract dilutions (10 mg/mL) and placed on the previously-seeded agar surface. Paper discs impregnated with 10 μL of penicillin (5 mg/mL) and 10 μL of DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the apparent zone clear zones of inhibition around the paper discs. For each extract, three replicates were performed against each organism (
