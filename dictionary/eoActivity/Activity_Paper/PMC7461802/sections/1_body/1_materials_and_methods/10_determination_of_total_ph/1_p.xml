<p>Total phenolic acid content was determined by the Folin-phenol method (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). One milliliter of tested sample (0.1 mg/mL) and 1 mL Folin-ciocalteu reagent were added to a flask and mixed thoroughly. After 3 min, 3 mL of sodium carbonate (2%) was added and the mixture incubated at 23Â°C for 90 min with intermittent shaking. The absorbance was measured at 750 nm versus water blank with gallic acid as a standard compound.
