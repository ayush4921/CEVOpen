<p>The Illumina reads of raw fastq files were demultiplexed and quality-filtered using Trimmomatic v0.36 (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). Overlapping paired-end reads were merged using FLASH (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Magoc and Salzberg, 2011</xref>) according to specific criteria as reported by 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref>. Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Edgar et al., 2011</xref>). Sequences with 97% sequence similarity were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using UPARSE (version 7.1; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2013</xref>)
 <sup>
