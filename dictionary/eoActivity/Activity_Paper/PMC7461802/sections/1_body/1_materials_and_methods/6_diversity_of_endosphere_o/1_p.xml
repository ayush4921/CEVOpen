 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ravel et al., 2011</xref>) by PCR using a GeneAmp 9700 PCR system (ABI, United States). The TS1F_ITS2R hypervariable regions of the fungi 18S rRNA gene were amplified with primers ITS1F (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′) and ITS2R (5′-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC −3′) by PCR. PCR reactions were performed using previous method (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 45 s, and a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min (
