<p>Ezup Column Genome DNA Extracting Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) was used to extract genomic DNA from high activity strains according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 16S rDNA from the extracted DNA was amplified by PCR using primer 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCC TGGCTCAG-3′) and primer 338R (5′-TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT3′) (
