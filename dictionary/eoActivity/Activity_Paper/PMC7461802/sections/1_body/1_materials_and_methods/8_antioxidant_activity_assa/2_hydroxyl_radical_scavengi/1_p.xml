<p>The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of the endophytic metabolite extracts was measured following a method by 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Smirnoff and Cumbes (1989)</xref>. 2.0 mL of different concentrations of the tested sample (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) was added into a tube containing 1.0 mL FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> (6.0 mmol/L), salicylic acid-ethanol (6.0 mmol/L) and 0.1% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reaction mixture, and cultured in a 37Â°C constant temperature water bath for 30 min. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 510 nm. The hydroxyl radical-scavenging rate was calculated using the following formula:
