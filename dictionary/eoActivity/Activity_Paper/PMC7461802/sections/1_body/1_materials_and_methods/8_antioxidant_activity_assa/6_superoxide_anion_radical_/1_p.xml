<p>The superoxide anion scavenging activity of the endophytic metabolite extracts was measured by following the method of 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Nishikimi et al. (1972)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kaur and Arora (2010)</xref>. One milliliter nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (156 μM NBT in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), 1 mL NADH solution (468 μM in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH8.0) and 1 mL of different concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) of the tested sample were mixed. 60 μM of phenazine methyl sulfate (PMS) was dissolved in pH 8.0, 100 mM phosphate buffer, and further 100 μl PMS was added to start the reaction. After the reaction was carried out at 25°C for 5 min, the absorbance values of 560 nm were measured. The capability of scavenging super oxide radicals was calculated using the following formula (
