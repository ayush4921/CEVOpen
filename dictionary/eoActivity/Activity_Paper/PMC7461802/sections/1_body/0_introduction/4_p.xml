<p>As a traditional Chinese medicine material, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> is well documented for its various medicinal attributes and is clinically widely used. In view of the medicinal value of the host, in this study, we selected 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> as a source plant to examine the diversity of the endophytic community with 20 different media. We also studied the diversity of endophytes in the seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> using high-throughput sequencing. Finally, endophytes were isolated from healthy leaves, stems, roots and seeds of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, and the metabolites of endophytic strains were evaluated with six different methods for their antioxidant activity and the paper disc diffusion method for antimicrobial activities. Our research will aid in the search for new and effective biologically active ingredients from endophytes associated with this medicinal plant and pave the way for future approaches to examining medicinal plants for their endophytes and systematically studying product isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds.
