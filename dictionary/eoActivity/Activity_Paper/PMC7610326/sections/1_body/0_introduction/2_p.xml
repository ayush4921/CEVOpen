In this study, the proper quantitative amounts of most of the above-mentioned components were unveiled using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis was also performed for the identification and quantification of the minerals.
