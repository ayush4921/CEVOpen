 <sup>●+</sup> of blue-green chromosphere was produced by oxidation due to the addition of potassium persulfate. Here, activity was measured in terms of the amount of decolorized radical and was the highest for BM (86.42 ± 0.26%). The lowest activity was observed for BH (79.65 ± 0.1%) and an insignificant change was observed among the other two dried (BF and BS) samples (p = 0.07).
