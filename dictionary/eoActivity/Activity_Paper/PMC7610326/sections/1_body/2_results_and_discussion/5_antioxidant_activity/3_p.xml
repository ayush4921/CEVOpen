<p id="p0270">In the case of FRAP, ferric ion (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) reduced to the ferrous ion (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) form by accepting an electron, donated by antioxidant under acidic conditions, which with TPTZ (2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine) forms a complex to give an intense blue color and shows a strong absorption maximum at 593 nm. Similar to the ABTS assay, in the FRAP assay, the highest reducing power was observed for BM (96.18 ± 0.34%), but here the lowest activity was for BF (89.91 ± 0.42%). Here, the changes for BP and BH were insignificant (p = 0.06). Previously, a similar trend for both FRAP and ABTS assay of differently dried (freeze, sun, microwave, and hot air) oyster mushroom was reported by
