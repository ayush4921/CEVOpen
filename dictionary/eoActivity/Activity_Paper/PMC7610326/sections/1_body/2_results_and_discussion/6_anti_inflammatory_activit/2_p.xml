<p id="p0300">This investigation was carried out to observe the ability of differently dried and fresh 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) pulp extracts to prevent the thermal protein denaturation and coagulation, to evaluate its anti-inflammatory activity. The denatured protein expressed as antigens, which are associated with Type III hypersensitive reaction causes diseases like, serum sickness, glomerulo-nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Gell and Benacerraf (1959)</xref>, it can be concluded that the heat-denatured proteins are potent as native proteins to stimulate delayed hypersensitivity and it was already confirmed by 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gilman et al. (1990)</xref> that the conventional Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) also work by preventing the denaturation of proteins. Thusit can be concluded that the anti-denaturation assay is an appropriate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> procedure to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Drying methods significantly affected the BSA (p = 9.41 × 10
 <sup>−13</sup>) and egg-albumin (p = 2.62 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup>) inhibitory activity. The order of BSA and egg-albumin heat-induced protein denaturation inhibitory activity was as follows: BS &lt; BH &lt; BP &lt; BF &lt; BM. With comparison to the fresh pulp, the BSA and egg-albumin denaturation inhibition activity increased by 6.77%, 10.03% and 2.67%, 6.29% for BM and BF respectively, whereas the same was decreased with respect to the BP by 18.68%, 14.49%, and 9.2%, 5.29% for BS and BH respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al. (2006)</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Rahman and Parvin (2014)</xref> reported 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) possessed the 
 <italic>invitro</italic> and 
 <italic>invivo</italic> anti-inflammatory activity. We have found a positive correlation by 0.89, 0.85, and 0.86 respectively with TPC for BSA, egg-albumin denaturation inhibitory activity, and anti-proteinase. The review article of 
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2018)</xref> also seconds our observation which mentioned multiple studies that reported anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenols against various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models.
