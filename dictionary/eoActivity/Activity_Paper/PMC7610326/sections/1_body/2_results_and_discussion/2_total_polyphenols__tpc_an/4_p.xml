<p id="p0145">During the microwave drying the polar molecules present in the cellular matrix vibrate spontaneously by the microwave radiation, this causes rapid temperature rise with the generation of vigorous compressive forces which consecutively distort the cell wall and allows more polyphenols to be accessible. The hastier heating phenomenon in the microwave drying causes the deactivation of polyphenol oxidases more quickly than other drying processes, so the degradation of enzymatic polyphenol was reduced. And even for the freeze-drying, the enzyme gets inactivated at low temperature, so the maximum retention was observed.
