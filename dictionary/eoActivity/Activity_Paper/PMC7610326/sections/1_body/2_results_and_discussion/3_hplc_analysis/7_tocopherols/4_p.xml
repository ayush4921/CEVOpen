<p id="p0255">Some earlier studies also reported the enhancement of α-tocopherol along with temperature till 60 °C in convective drying (

While in BF, the change in the amount of α- and β-tocopherol was insignificant with respect to BP, which may be explained as, the optimum temperature for γ-tocopherol methyltransferase is about 40 °C, at a lower temperature the enzyme may be deactivated (

However, the actual reaction mechanism is yet to be revealed. As some of the earlier studies reported opposite trends also for α-tocopherol in jujube fruit and
