<p id="p0245">Tocopherols are important lipophilic antioxidants, which naturally occur in four isomeric forms (δ-, γ-, α- and β-tocopherols). During the biosynthesis of tocopherols, γ-tocopherol methyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of γ- and δ-tocopherols respectively to α- and β-tocopherols (
