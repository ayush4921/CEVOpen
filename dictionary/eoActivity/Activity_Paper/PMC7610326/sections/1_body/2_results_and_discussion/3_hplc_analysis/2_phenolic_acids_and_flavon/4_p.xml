 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Manandhar et al. (2018)</xref> reported that rutin is the major flavonoid present in 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.). During HPLC analysis, only rutin was detected among the other given flavonoids. It was found maximum for BM (59.90 ± 0.05 mg/100 g) and a minimum for BP (32.25 ± 0.17 mg/100 g). The rutin content was significantly increased by 87.18%, 75.78%, 35.62%, and 26.56% after microwave, sun, hot air, and freeze-drying, respectively. Previously some studies also reported that in the case of freeze and sun drying the amount of rutin content increased for black grape and figs respectively (
