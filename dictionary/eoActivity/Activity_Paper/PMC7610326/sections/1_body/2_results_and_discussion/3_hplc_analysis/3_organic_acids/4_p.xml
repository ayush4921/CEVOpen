<p id="p0180">Most of the previous studies reported the effect of drying on the amount of citric, malic, and succinic acids for edible mushrooms (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. (2012)</xref> observed a similar trend for fresh, freeze, sun, and oven-dried jujube. In the case of malic acid, retentions of 82.22%, 55.5%, 58.36% were observed for BS, BH, and BF, while the same for BM increased by 72.79%. This is in agreement with the observations reported by 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Calín-Sánchez et al. (2013)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gasecka et al. (2020)</xref> for vacuum microwave, convective, and freeze dried pomegranate and hot air-dried 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> (Bull.), respectively. Likewise, citric acid, the amount for succinic acid decreased with processing by 86.31%, 93.45%, 69.51%, and 1.62% for BM, BS, BH, and BF respectively. An insignificant difference was also observed between BP and BF for the succinic acid content (p = 0.55). This is in line with the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. (2012)</xref> for fresh, sun, and oven-dried jujube.
