<p id="p0315">Multivariate analysis is performed if, it is not feasible to proceed with a simple visual assessment to determine the differences between different samples. We used PCA, HCA heat map, and correlation for altogether 43 factors, including bioactive compounds and medicinal activities to study the relative variability among the different 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.)samples. The results of PCA shows that 94.05% of the total variability comprised of the first three components, PC1 (37.82%), PC2 (27.07%), and PC3 (22.29%). From 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, it can be observed that BS, BH, and BF exist on the positive side of the PC1 while BP and BM contributed to the negative side. BM and BF loading showed similar positive PC2 scores, but the BP, BH, and BS were located differently from the other two samples in the negative quadrant of PC2. The 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> also suggested that the most of the factors like vitamin B
 <sub>2</sub> (B2), succinic acid (SA), tartaric acid (TA), citric acid (CA), ascorbic acid (Asc A), vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> (B12), vitamin B
 <sub>3</sub> (B3), δ-tocopherol (delta T) and α-carotene (alpha C), went along with the BP, followed by BM where, anti-inflammatory activity, super-oxide activity (SO), bovine-serum activity, egg-albumin activity, anti-diabetic activity, TPC, DPPH formed a cluster and malic acid (MA), ABTS, oxalic acid (OA), TFC are overlapped by both BM and BF. For the BS, vanillic acid (VA), dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHBA), protocatechuic acid (p-CA), α-tocopherol (alpha T), β-tocopherol (beta T), β-carotene (beta C), δ-carotene (delta C) formed a cluster separately and only vitamin C went with the BH. Even from the dendrogram of the factors shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, three main clusters were observed. Based on the characteristics of the investigated factors, the dendrogram of the different samples clearly depicted that BP stands differently, while BF and BM shared a common cluster. For both BH and BS, higher destruction of some of factors was observed due to prolonged processing time, so they were clustered together. The heat map provided a correlation between the samples and factors, which provide a clear summary of the interrelation within the effects of drying and compositional aspects of bael.
