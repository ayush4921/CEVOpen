<p id="p0095">For elemental analysis using an energy-dissipative X-ray system (Quantax, Bruker Nano GmbH, Germany) differently dried samples (BM, BS, BH, and BF) were powdered, and pellets were formed of 50 mm Ã— 50 mm x 20 mm. All spectra were processed to quantify potassium (K), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn). The machine was operated at a voltage of 10 kV and an X-flash 5010 detector (silicon drift detector) was used for secondary electrons at a high vacuum.</p>
