<p id="p0075">The ethanolic extract was injected into an RP-HPLC system (Alliance 2695 HPLC system, Waters Corporation, Massachusetts, USA) for quantification of phenolic acids and flavonoids. The separation was achieved with a C
 <sub>18</sub> column of 4.6 mm (internal diameter) and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m pore size. Two solvents, solvent A (0.5% aqueous H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> solution) and solvent B (9:1 methanol-water solution) were used as eluents at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in the following order: 100% A for the first 8 min, 7:3 A-B in the interval of 8–15 min, 1:1 A-B for 15–20 min, 2:3 A-B for 20–25 min, 3:7 A-B for 25–35 min and 100 % B for the last 5 min by maintaining 38 °C temperature. Quantification was carried out with a dual lambda (λ) absorbance UV detector 2487 at 280 nm and for data processing, Empower 2 software (Waters Corporation) was used (
