<p id="p0065">1.00 g of each sample (BP, BM, BS, BH, and BF) were extracted with 30.00 ml of the ethanol-water mixture (1:1) using ultra-sonication (Trans-O-Sonic, Mumbai) for an hour and filtered with 0.45 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>m Millipore filter. The final volume of the filtrate was 25.00 ml, so the dose becomes 1.00 gm/25.00 ml or, 40 mg/ml. This filtrate was used for the overall quantification of polyphenols, flavonoids, determination of medicinal values (antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-diabetic activity), also in HPLC analysis of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and organic acids.
