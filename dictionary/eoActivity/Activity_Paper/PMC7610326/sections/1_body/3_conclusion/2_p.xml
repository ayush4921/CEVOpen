<p id="p0320">From the results it can be observed that different components get affected differently depending on the mechanism of the drying like, in BM bound components (mainly polyphenols) get released, so the total content increased with respect to BP and some were destroyed in the lesser amount due lower time of operation. For, BS some enzymes get optimal working conditions, which affected the compounds differently (polyphenols get reduced, whereas tocopherols increased), while surprisingly BH showed enhancements of vitamin (vitamin B
 <sub>1</sub> and B
 <sub>5</sub>) and carotene (Î³-carotene) content. Maximum retention for most of the components was observed in low-temperature treatment (BF). The best result was found in BM, with respect to the medicinal activities. The study also shows that the mineral content doesn't change along with different drying using EDXRF analysis.
