<p id="p0325">This comprehensive study gives a detailed discussion on the effects of drying on different components (in total of 50 factors for each drying technique) and shows the diversity in the behaviour of the factors. It also reveals the proper quantitative composition of bael, many of them not previously revealed. It also reflects light upon the traditional preservation method, which can be used to overproduced pulpy crops.</p>
