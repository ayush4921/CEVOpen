 <sup>Â®</sup> bioreactors could be a rich potential source of glucosinolates (gluconasturtiin and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin) and rutoside, famous plant antioxidants. The biomass extracts possess the antioxidant (CUPRAC, FRAP, DPPH assays), antibacterial and antifungal activity comparable with plant herb extracts. Anti-inflammatory assays documented a higher inhibition of COX-2 for biomass cultured in vitro. The authors propose the rapidly grown biomass in bioreactors as an alternative source of bioactive compounds.
