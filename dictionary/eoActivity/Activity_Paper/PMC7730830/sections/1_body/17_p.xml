<p>Some articles concentrate on the neuroprotective and hepatoprotective activity of plant-derived substances. Mohamed et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] evidenced the neuroprotective effect of 7-geranyloxycinnamic acid, isolated from 
 <italic>Melicope lunu-ankenda</italic> leaves, against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cells. This compound protected the cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis. It is a good candidate for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
