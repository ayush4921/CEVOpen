<p>One of them by Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] documented the possibility to use extraction waste of 
 <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (earlier 
 <italic>Ganoderma camphoratum</italic>), a mushroom species endemic to Taiwan, in aquaculture (fish) industry. This mushroom species is produced in China in extremely high quantities as an anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and immunomodulatory agent. The high amounts of extraction waste rich in proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids and also containing bioactive triterpenoids led the authors to recommend it for application as a supplement in aquaculture feeds. These waste extracts inhibited the growth of microorganisms in water, increased feed efficacy in zebrafish model, improved the tolerance of zebrafish to dramatic temperature changes, enhanced its regenerative ability, and reduced symptoms of inflammation.
