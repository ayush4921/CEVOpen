<p>Szypu≈Ça et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] proposed the in vitro cultures of gametophytes of the European club-moss species 
 <italic>Huperzia selago</italic> as a rich source of two potent reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: huperzine A (HA) and huperzine B (HB). They documented that the contents of (HA) were higher than in the 
 <italic>H. serrata</italic> Asian species grown in open air, which is a current source of (HA) for pharmaceutical industry. The authors confirmed for the first time the presence of (HB) in in vitro cultures of 
 <italic>H. selago</italic> gametophytes and identified eight new alkaloids previously unreported in this species.
