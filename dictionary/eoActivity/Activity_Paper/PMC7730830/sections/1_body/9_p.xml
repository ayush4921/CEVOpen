<p>Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] evidenced the antitumor effect of fresh bark extract of 
 <italic>Cedrus atlantica</italic>, a forest tree species distributed in northern Africa. Its anticancer activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was confirmed in in vitro and in vivo studies. The lipid fraction from a steam-distilled preparation of the bark, which contains thujopsene and Î±-cedrene, as the main compounds showed marked dose-dependent inhibitory effects on HCC cells. The extract was less cytotoxic to normal cells (in vitro tests) and induced no obvious pathological changes in the morphology or body weight of the experimental animals (female nude mice), suggesting an absence of toxicity. The authors recommended the investigated extract as a potential anticancer therapeutic agent.
