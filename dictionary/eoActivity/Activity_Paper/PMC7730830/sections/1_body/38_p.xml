<p>The article by Mahdi et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] demonstrated the chemical profile of ethanolic extracts and antimicrobial activity of termites 
 <italic>Macrotermes bellicosus</italic>. This termite is used in nutrition and traditional medicine in Benin for treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases. The tested extracts were prepared from soldier and worker caste, termite mound, and fungus comb. Only the soldier caste showed antimicrobial activity against various bacterial strains. The most active compounds were identified for the first time and included hydroquinone, methylhydroquinone, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyl glycol, and 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyldopamine. They contributed to the growth inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Additionally, the authors confirmed the presence of fatty acids in the extracts, which highlights the nutritional value of soldier caste extracts. The results provide the rationale for the traditional medicinal use of 
 <italic>M. bellicosus</italic>.
