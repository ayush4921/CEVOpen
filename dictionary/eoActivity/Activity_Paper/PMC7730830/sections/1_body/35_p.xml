<p>The next article presents a new proposal for microscopic technique with the use of semi-synthetic curcumin derivatives. Obreg√≥n-Mendoza et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] synthesized mono, di-, tri-, and tetra-benzylated and dibenzylfluoroborate curcumin derivatives to obtain some ideal fluorophores. Dibenzyl (DB) and dibenzylfluoroborate (DBF) fluorophores possessed the highest fluorescence properties. Both (DB) and (DBF) made it possible to observe membranes of living cells. (DB) excited with blue or green laser allowed the observation of the nucleus. On the other hand, (DBF) was a good tool to observe the cytoplasm or exclusively the nucleus using different lasers. The authors proposed these two new fluorophores as an attractive alternative to known fluorescent dyes for the use in biomedical sciences.
