<p>A good example is the article by KÅ‚eczek et al., [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which deals with chemical analysis of aerial parts of 
 <italic>Xerolekia speciosissima</italic>. The root extracts of this plant species, which is endemic to the pre-Alpine area, were investigated earlier by the authors. In the present work, more than 25 compounds were identified in its hydroalcoholic and chloroform extracts. One compound isolated from chloroform extract, namely 7,10-diisobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymyl isobutyrate showed anti-inflammatory activity.
