 <sub>50</sub> of 181.8 ± 11.0 µg/mL, resulting remarkably less active then the hydroalcoholic extract tested in this study (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 19.26 ± 1.16 µg/mL). This difference may be due both to the different assay conditions, particularly incubation time and types of substrate, and to the diverse extraction method employed, since solvent properties strongly affect compounds extraction and consequently the inhibitory effect of a plant extract
