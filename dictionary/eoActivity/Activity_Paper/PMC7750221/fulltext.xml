A circular skin wound of about 1 cm was made on the paravertebral region of each mouse under anesthetized and aseptic conditions. The wounds were topically treated every 24 h with the respective extracts for 22 days, after which skin tissue specimens were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson&#x02019;s trichrome.

Their stems, roots, leaves, seeds, fruits, and latex are used in medicinal folklore to treat various diseases [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, some studies have warned against consuming them as herbal medicine; in particular, the seed oil can be highly toxic, and the leaves of <italic>J. integerrima</italic> can provoke vomiting and dehydration. For these reasons, their use in herbal medicine is cautioned against [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nonetheless, <italic>Jatropha</italic> lattices are still widely used in medicinal folklore to treat ulcers and wounds [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In the past two decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, several studies have reported on the beneficial properties of <italic>Jatropha</italic> lattices. Proanthocyanidin polymers have been found in the latex of <italic>J. multifida</italic> and showed anti-complement activity [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latex of <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> has a proteolytic enzyme of around 22 kDa, and the diluted latex showed healing action when applied topically, although the undiluted latex produced caustic lesions [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, a novel cyclic nonapeptide with L-amino acids was identified in <italic>J. podagrica</italic> latex with cytotoxicity activity [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, some researchers continued to explore the potential uses of <italic>Jatropha</italic> lattice and their chemical characterizations. The whole <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex reduced the clotting time of blood, but its diluted latex prolonged it; this is significant because it demonstrates that the latex possesses both pro-hemostatic and anti-hemostatic activities [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to <italic>Jatropha</italic>, the latex of other plants has also demonstrated thrombin-like proteases that can treat bleeding wounds [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The presence of cyclic nonapeptide in lattices supports their potential use as cytotoxic compounds against tumoral cells [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other biological activities identified in lattices include anti-inflammatory effects and wound healing. The lattices of <italic>Jatropha neopauciflora</italic> Pax species, which are endemic to Mexico, promote wound healing that can attain up to 100% of the tensile strength of undamaged skin in a murine model. These lattices also promote antibacterial activity without toxicity when tested in cell lines [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When the cells infiltrating the lesion site were characterized, it was noted that CD68+ and CD34+ cells mobilized to skin tissues treated with <italic>J. curcas</italic> Linn. latex [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In Yucat&#x000e1;n, Mexico, <italic>Jatropha gaumeri</italic> Greenm., an endemic tree, is commonly known in the Mayan language as <italic>pomolch&#x000e9;</italic>, is commonly used to treat mouth blisters and skin rashes.

In addition, dermal white adipose tissue and adipogenesis can help recruit fibroblasts to the wound site, favoring wound closure, and the regeneration of hair follicles. Finally, myofibroblasts, contractile collagen-secreting cells, are activated during the wound healing process, and their precursor cells comprise fibroblasts, endothelial, and epithelial cells. Excessive stimulation can result in fibrosis, while insufficient stimulation can delay wound healing [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this context, we macroscopically observed that mice treated with aqueous latex fraction and A-Derma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (positive control) had similar rates of healing and extents of wound closure, but hair growth was more abundant in the aqueous latex fraction group than in the positive control.

On the other hand, the positive control and placebo groups had wound sites that resembled healthy skin but with less collagen organization and progression of new hair follicles. In addition, whole latex and the ethyl acetate latex fraction resulted in delayed wound healing, and reepithelialization was still in progress at the end of the experiment. We made the significant observation that mice treated with extracts in glycerin instead of carboxymethylcellulose showed improved wound healing, which indicates that the choice of vehicle used may influence wound healing.</p><p>It should be noted that Masson&#x02019;s trichrome is limited in its ability to reveal the complexity of regeneration of injured skin at the cellular and molecular levels; however, hypertrophic or keloid scars were not observed in any treated group. Nonetheless, it is necessary to use other tools, such as histochemistry and molecular techniques, to elucidate the mechanism of action of the latex&#x02019;s wound healing effects. Although there are few reports on the mechanism of action of latex, two papers have recently described the infiltration and mobilization of CD68+ and CD34+ cells in skin tissues treated with <italic>J. curcas</italic> Linn. latex [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Wound healing efficacy was assessed by mechanically measuring the tensile strength of the wound and expressing it as a percentage of that of healthy skin. We observed that the wound healing efficacy in mice treated with the aqueous latex fraction was 97%, similar to that of healthy skin; these data agree with the histologic and macroscopic observations. However, in mice treated with the A-Derma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> positive control, the wound healing efficacy was 79%. Both the aqueous latex fraction and positive control groups appeared to have identical macroscopic features, but on further analysis, the aqueous latex fraction yielded better results. The mice treated with whole latex and ethyl acetate latex extract experienced the worst results: 59% and 72% wound healing efficacy, respectively. These data parallel the histological analysis and progress of reepithelialization.</p><p>Significantly, whole latex was less effective in promoting wound healing than 5% aqueous latex fraction; these data may suggest that the concentration and composition of phytochemical compounds are an important factor in promoting specific activity, as reported in a study where whole undiluted <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex shortened the clotting time of blood but diluted latex prolonged it [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, diluted <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex has been shown to have healing properties, but undiluted latex has produced caustic lesions [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings contrast with another study in which the latex of <italic>J. neopauciflora</italic> Pax showed wound healing efficacy at 50%, 70%, and even 100% concentrations [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; this contrasts with the data of Salas <italic>et al</italic>. who reported caustic lesions [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and our results. In summary, the above data suggest that the composition and concentration of phytochemicals can differ significantly among the latex of different <italic>Jatropha</italic> species.</p><p>Finally, the composition analysis of the latex and its fractions revealed flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes in whole latex, while terpenes and alkaloids were detected in the aqueous fraction, which exhibited the best wound healing activity. Conversely, only terpenes were found in the chloroform fraction, which had poorer wound healing activity. According to this broad analysis, it is likely that alkaloids were the phytochemical compounds responsible for wound healing activity because they were not detected in the chloroform fraction. Although the composition of latex is similar among <italic>Jatropha</italic> species, some phytochemicals are present at lower concentrations or completely absent depending on the specific <italic>Jatropha</italic> species [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The differences in latex phytochemical composition detected among different published papers may suggest that composition is dependent on the species of <italic>Jatropha</italic> species and the sensitivity of the analytical techniques used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>J. gaumeri</italic> latex exhibited wound healing activity in its aqueous fraction, with alkaloids likely being the phytochemicals involved.
