<p>In untreated and healthy skin, we observed that the collagen fibers beneath the epidermis were compact, well-organized, and wavy, with moderate cellularity, well-conserved hair follicles, and sebaceous glands in the deep dermis. Conversely, in the skin of the positive control mice treated with A-Derma
 <sup>Â®</sup>, collagen was less abundant and organized into thicker fibers, whereas the cellular cytoplasm had strong red staining, presumably due to the activation and presence of myofibroblasts. In addition, the hair follicles had recovered. In the placebo group treated with glycerin, the appearance of collagen resembled that of normal skin except for reduced cellularity in the dermis, but we noted that the hair follicles were less evident than in the positive control and untreated skin. In the group treated with 5% aqueous latex fraction in carboxymethylcellulose, collagen fibers were less abundant, but hair follicles were present. Finally, the epidermis, and the dermis displayed organized reepithelialization with hair follicles and glands such that it resembled normal skin in groups treated with 5% aqueous latex fraction or 5% chloroform latex fraction in glycerin, (
