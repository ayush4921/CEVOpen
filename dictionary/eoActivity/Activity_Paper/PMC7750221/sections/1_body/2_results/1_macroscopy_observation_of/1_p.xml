<p>The progression of wound healing in the mice was recorded at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. On day 5, the lesions remained open in all mice except in the positive controls treated with A-Derma
 <sup>Â®</sup> and those treated with whole latex. White scars had formed in the positive control group, whereas dark scars had formed in the group treated with whole latex. On day 10, the lesions were dramatically reduced in the positive control and aqueous latex fraction groups. After 2 weeks, the lesions had completely closed, and regrowth of hair had begun in the positive control and aqueous latex fraction groups. Likewise, the mice treated with only glycerin exhibited closed lesions like those treated with the chloroform and ethyl acetate latex fractions. Notably, the lesions remained open in the mice treated with whole latex.
