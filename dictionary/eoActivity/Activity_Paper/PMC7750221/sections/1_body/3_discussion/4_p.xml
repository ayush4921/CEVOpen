<p>The wound healing and reepithelialization at the histological level in mice treated with aqueous latex fraction produced results that closely resembled that of healthy skin in terms of the appearance of collagen, the regeneration of hair follicles, and cellularity in the dermis, which showed organized epithelialization. On the other hand, the positive control and placebo groups had wound sites that resembled healthy skin but with less collagen organization and progression of new hair follicles. In addition, whole latex and the ethyl acetate latex fraction resulted in delayed wound healing, and reepithelialization was still in progress at the end of the experiment. We made the significant observation that mice treated with extracts in glycerin instead of carboxymethylcellulose showed improved wound healing, which indicates that the choice of vehicle used may influence wound healing.</p>
