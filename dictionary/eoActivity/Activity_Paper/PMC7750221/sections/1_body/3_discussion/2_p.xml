<p>In this context, we macroscopically observed that mice treated with aqueous latex fraction and A-Derma
 <sup>Â®</sup> (positive control) had similar rates of healing and extents of wound closure, but hair growth was more abundant in the aqueous latex fraction group than in the positive control. The other latex extracts, as well as whole unfractionated latex, exhibited weaker efficacy in wound healing. These data suggest that phytochemicals with wound healing activity are more abundant and concentrated in the aqueous fraction.
