<p>In a previous study, we found that 
 <italic>J. gaumeri</italic> latex demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in patients with buccal ulcers [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have now also demonstrated the wound healing effects of 
 <italic>J. gaumeri</italic> latex in a murine model. To date, the phytochemical composition of 
 <italic>J. gaumeri</italic> latex and its medicinal activities have not been extensively studied; however, several published papers have demonstrated the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, angiogenic, coagulant, and anticoagulant effects of other 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There is no doubt that the lattices of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species have broad spectra of activity that deserves further research to elucidate the active phytochemicals involved.
