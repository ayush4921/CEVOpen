 </xref>. These above interesting findings about LSD1 inhibitors and our continuous quest to identify more potently anticancer agents led to the molecular hybridisation of a LSD1 scaffold and an antitumor fragment to generate a new LSD1 inhibitor with the potentially anticancer activity. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, a molecular hybridisation strategy based on the structures of the reported LSD1 inhibitor 
 <bold>26</bold> and antitumor agent 
 <bold>4</bold> produced a scaffold that has three parts: (i) chalcone as an anticancer pharmacophore; (ii) a dithiocarbamate unit as the potential LSD1 moiety; (iii) an amide linker between chalcone and dithiocarbamate to form the hydrogen bond with LSD1. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few literature reports regarding anticancer chalcone derivatives as potent LSD1 inhibitors so far.
