 </xref>. In view of the inhibitory potency against LSD1, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> was chosen for further antiproliferative studies. In this work, we used the LSD1 knock-down MOLT-4 cells (MOLT-4&amp;shLSD1) and control cells (MOLT-4&amp;shControl) to investigate its antiproliferative activity. Firstly, the gene expression of LSD1 in MOLT-4&amp;shLSD1 cells and MOLT-4&amp;shControl cells was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, the results were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(A)</xref>. With these two cell lines in hand, we nextly used the MTT assay to examine the antiproliferative effects of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against MOLT-4&amp;shLSD1 cells and MOLT-4&amp;shControl cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(B)</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> significantly suppressed the proliferation of MOLT-4&amp;shControl cells in a concentration dependent manner with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.89 μM. In contrast, 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited MOLT-4&amp;shLSD1 cells with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.83 μM, about 8 ∼ 9-fold less potent against MOLT-4&amp;shControl cells. The activity discrepancy observed indicated that the antiproliferative effects of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against MOLT-4 cells were dependent on LSD1 inhibition, and also suggested that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> was cellularly active against LSD1, excluding off-target effects.
