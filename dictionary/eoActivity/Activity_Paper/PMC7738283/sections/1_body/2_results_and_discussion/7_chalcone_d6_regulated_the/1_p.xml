<p>To further determine the inhibitory effects of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against LSD1 in MOLT-4 cells, amount of two reported LSD1 substrates H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 were analysed by western blotting experiments. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>, the amount of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 showed a concentration dependent accumulation in the presence of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold>. In addition, the treatment of 
 <bold>D6</bold> in MOLT-4 cells did not affect the expression level of LSD1. Collectively, these results suggested that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> is a cellular active LSD1 inhibitor in leukaemia MOLT-4 cells.
