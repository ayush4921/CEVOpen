<p>Since the potently antiproliferative activity of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against MOLT-4 cells, we also evaluated the anticancer effects of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> on xenograft models bearing MOLT-4 cells. After the treatment of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> (60 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg), the body weight of mice, the tumour weight and the tumour volume were measured and recorded. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited tumour growth remarkably, while the body weight was almost unchanged, suggesting the antitumor efficacy and low global toxicity.
