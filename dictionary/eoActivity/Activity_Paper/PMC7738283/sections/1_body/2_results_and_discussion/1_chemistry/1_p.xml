<p>A typical synthetic route for chalcone based LSD1 inhibitors is described in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001">Scheme 1</xref>. Chalcone B was prepared by the condensation reaction of 1–(4-azidophenyl)ethan-1-one with different benzaldehydes. Intermediates 
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold> were formed by the reduction reaction and acylation reaction. Next, the intermediates 
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold> were reacted with carbon disulphide and piperazines under the presence of triethylamine to form chalcones 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold>.
