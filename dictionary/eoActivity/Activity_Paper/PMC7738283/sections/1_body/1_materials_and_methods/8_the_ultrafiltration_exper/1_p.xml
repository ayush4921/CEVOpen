<p>In the ultrafiltration experiment, LSD1 recombinant was incubated with a concentration of 20-fold IC 50 inhibitor. The mixture was then added to a 10â€‰kDa cut-off ultrafiltration tube (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for centrifugation to remove the unbound compound. Finally, reversibility of the compound was evaluated by LSD1 assay for the upper chamber reaction system.</p>
