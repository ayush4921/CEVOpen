<p>Chalcone derivatives 
 <bold>B</bold> were prepared by a condensation reaction from 1–(4-azidophenyl)ethan-1-one 
 <bold>A</bold> and different benzaldehydes without purification. To a solution of triphenylphosphine (1 mmol), chalcone intermediates 
 <bold>B</bold> (2 mmol), and tetrahydrofuran (12 ml) was added water (3 ml), the mixture was stirred for 4 h. Upon the completion, ethyl acetate and water were added. The organic layers were washed with water for several times to remove the tetrahydrofuran, and then evaporated to give the crude products. The crude product (1 mmol), chloroacetyl chloride (1.2 mmol), and triethylamine (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in acetone (10 ml) to stir for 8 h at room temperature. Upon completion, the system was purified with column chromatography (hexane: ethyl acetate = 9:1) to obtain analogues 
 <bold>C1∼C4</bold>. Compound C4 was a reported chalcone intermediate from the previous reference [
