<p>Taken together the results of this study suggest that 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> consumption might have health-promoting properties, including anticancer effects. The safety status (the absence of gelatinase and hemolytic activity, susceptibility to the clinically relevant antibiotics) and health promoting potential (survival in the simulated GIT passage, the ability to colonize the intestinal mucosa and immunomodulatory potential) of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic>-associated 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains isolated in this study indicate that the strains might be used as probiotics for human consumption. However, the extensive 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> research is required to fully evaluate the possible cancer preventive efficacy of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> and its bioactive compounds, as well as probiotic activity of its associated 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains in addition to further bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies.
