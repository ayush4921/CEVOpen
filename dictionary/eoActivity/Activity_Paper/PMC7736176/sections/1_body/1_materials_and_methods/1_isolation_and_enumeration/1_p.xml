<p>The 10 g of fresh leaves was immersed in 90 ml of 0.85% saline and incubated for 3 h on 37°C with agitation. A volume of 1 ml of leaves and saline mixture was supplemented with 15% (w/v) glycerol, and later used for microbiological and microbiota analysis. After 3 h, 5 ml of mixture was added to 45 ml of 3 different media most suitable for isolation of LAB (MRS [Oxoid,], GM17 [Oxoid] and Nutrient broth[Oxoid]) and incubated for 72 h aerobically at 22°C and 30°C, and anaerobically (BD GasPak

After the incubation approx. 30 colonies from each plate were selected randomly, streaked on new MRS, GM17, and Nutrient agar plates, respectively and examined under a microscope. The pure cultures were stored at −80°C in GM17, MRS or Nutrient broth supplemented with 15% (w/v) glycerol.
