<p>Total phenolic content was determined according to the previously described method of 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Julkunen-Tiitto (1985)</xref> with slight modifications. Aliquots of supernatants obtained after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion (20 μl) were mixed with 1580 μl of distilled water and 100 μl of Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent and shaken vigorously. After 15 min incubation at room temperature, 300 μl of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added to the mixture which was then incubated for additional 2 h. After the incubation absorbance of the mixture was recorded at 765 nm. Total phenolic content was calculated using gallic acid standard curve and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents per ml of supernatant (mg GAE/ml).
