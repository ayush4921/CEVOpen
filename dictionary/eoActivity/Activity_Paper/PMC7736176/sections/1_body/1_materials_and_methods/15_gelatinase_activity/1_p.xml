<p>Gelatinase activity was assayed according to the procedure described by 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. (1991)</xref>. The bacterial isolates were plated on agar plates containing 3% gelatin (Oxoid) at 37Â°C for 48 h and flooded with a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate (Centrohem, Stara Pazova, Serbia). A transparent halo around cells and gelatin precipitates was used as an indication for gelatinase producers.
