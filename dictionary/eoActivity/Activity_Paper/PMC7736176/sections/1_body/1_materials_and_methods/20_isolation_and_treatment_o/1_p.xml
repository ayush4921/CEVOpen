<p>Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were isolated from Wistar rats and the suspension of cells (MLNC) was prepared by mechanical disruption of MLN, as described at 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bajić et al. (2020)</xref>. MLNC were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich, 2.5 μg/ml) and treated with cell culture supernatants originating from 2.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> bacterial cells, with UV inactivated bacteria at a ratio of 10:1 (bacteria to eukaryotic cell), 1% of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extract after passing through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and complex food matrix used as a carrier while passing through the GIT for 72 h. After 72 h of incubation, the cell culture supernatants were collected and subjected to cytotoxicity assay and cytokines quantification.
