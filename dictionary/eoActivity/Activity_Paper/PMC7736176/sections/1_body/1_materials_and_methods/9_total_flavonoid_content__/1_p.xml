<p>Supernatants collected after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestions were concentrated five times by evaporating under vacuum at 60°C. Obtained concentrates were then centrifuged at 5000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to precipitate insoluble particles. The total flavonoid content in the concentrated supernatants was then determined by aluminum chloride assay according to the previously described method of 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro et al. (2015)</xref> with modifications. Supernatants (125 μl) were mixed with 625 μl of distilled water and 37.5 μl 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 6 min of incubation at room temperature, 75 μl of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added and incubation was prolonged for 5 min. After the second incubation, 250 μl of 1M NaOH was added and mixture was supplemented with distilled water to a final volume of 1.25 ml. Absorbance of the samples was recorded at 510 nm. The flavonoid content was calculated using quercetin standard curve (5–100 μg/ml) and expressed as μg of quercetin equivalents per mL of supernatant (μg QE/ml).
