<p>To examine whether 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts could activate apoptosis in HeLa cells, the specific irreversible peptide inhibitor of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, United States) was used for cell cycle analysis, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Matić et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, HeLa cells were preincubated for 2 h with Z-DEVD-FMK at a final concentration of 40 μM. Afterwards, the cells were treated with extracts (applied at a concentration of 5%). After 24 h treatment, the cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cell cycle analysis was performed as described in the previous section.
