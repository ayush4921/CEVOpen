<p>According to the literature data dominant organosulfur compounds (cysteine sulfoxides) of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> are methiin and alliin, but it also contains certain amounts of isoalliin, propiin and ethiinas well (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Sobolewska et al., 2015</xref>). Thiosulfinates are formed from cysteine sulfoxides upon tissue mechanical injury by the hydrolyticaction of the alliinase (C,S-lyase). The optimal conditions for hydrolytic cleavage of sulfoxides are pH = 6 and temperature of 35°C. The primary products of this reaction are thiosulfinates, pyruvic acid, and ammonia. The most abundant (75–90%) thiosulfinates detected in various ramson extracts were: allicin (diallylthiosulfinate = di-2-propenyl thiosulfinate) and methyl-allyl- or dimethyl thiosulfinates (

 <italic>Allium</italic> species and specific conditions, thiosulfinates decomposition could yield a variety of constituents such as methyl allyl, diallyl diethyl mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasulfides, vinyldithiins, as well as (E)- and (Z)-ajoene (

The most abundant thiosulfinate detected previously in ramson leaf extracts are represented by: allyl methyl disulfide, diallyldisulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, allyl (E)-1-propenyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, methyl (E)-1-propenyl disulfide, allyl propyl disulfide and allyl (Z)-1-propenyl disulfide (
