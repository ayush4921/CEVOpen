<p>Our analysis determined presence of seven volatile compounds including: 3,4-dimethylthiophene; 1,3-dithiane; diallyl disulfide; allyl methyl disulfide; 2-vinyl-1,3-dithiane; (E)-1-propenyl methyl disulfide; (E)-1-propenyl allyl disulfide. At least to the best of our knowledge, there are no available literature data on of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> organosulfur compounds in bioaccessible fraction obtained after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion. However, similar studies have been conducted on several other 
 <italic>Allium</italic> species. It has been shown previously that hydrolytic action of alliinase can be preserved in stomach especially in presence moderate to high protein meal which can transiently raise pH to 4.4 or higher, which is sufficient to enable catalysis and produce allyl-thiosulfinates (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lawson and Hunsaker, 2018</xref>). Diallyl disulfide detected in our study belongs to allyl polysulfides spontaneous transformation products of allyl-thiosulfinates (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lawson and Hunsaker, 2018</xref>). The presence of 3,4-dimethylthiophene was previously detected in 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> essential oil from Clevenger distillation as one of major sulfur-containing compounds (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Satyal et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> leaf extract as a minor compound (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2009</xref>). According to literature data 2-vinyl-1,3-dithiane is being formed during thermal degradation of aliin on temperatures above 180°C (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kubec et al., 1997</xref>) and it was also found in fried and baked garlic (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 1994</xref>), but there is also evidence that it could be formed at 40°C (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Keleş et al., 2014</xref>). This compound was recently detected in fresh leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2009</xref>). Cyclic organosulfur compound reported in our study-1,3-dithiane has been characterized previously as a minor constituent of garlic with the ability to stimulate production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Schepetkin et al., 2019</xref>). It was also detected in 
 <italic>Allium roseum</italic>, (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zouari et al., 2012</xref>) but this is the first report in 
 <italic>Allium ursinum</italic>. Allyl methyl disulfide, (E)-1-propenyl methyl disulfide, (E)-1-propenyl allyl disulfide presence was reported previously in 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vienale</italic> essential oil (Prabodh 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Satyal et al., 2017</xref>), as well in 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> oil and leaf extracts (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gođevac et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Sobolewska et al., 2015</xref>).
