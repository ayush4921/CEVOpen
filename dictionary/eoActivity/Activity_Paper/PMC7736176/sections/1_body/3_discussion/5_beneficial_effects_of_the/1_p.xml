<p>Recent literature data revealed that many of the phytotherapeutic molecules originate from plant-associated microbiota, although it is still highly unexplored area (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Köberl et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, the microbiota of medicinal plants is highly specific, depending on the unique bioactive secondary metabolites produced by medicinal plants (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2012</xref>). Plants are acknowledged as an important source of LAB, although not systematically investigated. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Köberl et al. (2019)</xref> identified the leaf surfaces and leaf endosphere of 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L. as a source of LAB, with 
 <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> dominantly present in both plants, while 
 <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Carnobacteriaceae</italic> were more abundant on 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic>, and 
 <italic>Leuconostocaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcaceae</italic> more abundant on 
 <italic>C. officinalis</italic>. The specific aim of this study was the determination of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic>-associated microbiota, as well as isolation and identification of LAB from 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> with potential health-promoting effects.
