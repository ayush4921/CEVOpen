<p>Taken together the results obtained in this study revealed discrepancies between the two methods used, pointing that the less abundant species have not been entirely detected by culture-dependent method. The noticed discrepancies could be also related to the PCR detection of remaining DNA from dead cells that could not be detected by culture-dependant method, as well as related to the growth media used in the study, as some species have specific growth requirements that were not met in the experimental setup.</p>
