<p>Transitory colonization of the intestinal mucosa is another important criterion proposed by FAO/WHO guideline for selection of probiotic strains. In this study, the adhesion of 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains BGSR163 and BGSR227 to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was investigated. Both strains exhibited the adherence ability to IEC in a range common for probiotic strains (

 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 than in the strain 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227.
