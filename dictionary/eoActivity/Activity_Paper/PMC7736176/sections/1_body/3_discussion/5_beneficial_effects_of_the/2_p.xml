<p>In general, the microbial communities could be evaluated by traditional and molecular methods. The number of studies related to evaluation of ecology of microbial communities demonstrated that the diversity and structure of the associated microbiota cannot be successfully studied by using only one of the above-mentioned approaches. The conventional culture-dependent methods are time consuming and require the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms prior to their identification as well as physiological tests. Hence, the lower abundant taxa might often be outcompeted on culture plates by numerically more abundant species. In contrast, the DGGE analysis, as one of the most frequently and highly reliable molecular techniques used for the study of complex microbial ecology is based on direct DNA isolation, although this method lack quantitative information related to the proportions of the present taxa. Indeed, it is highly appreciated that the combination of both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches should be used to describe the diversity, structure and dynamic of the complex microbial communities (
