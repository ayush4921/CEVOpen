<p>The adherence abilities of the 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> isolates BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 were investigated on Caco-2 cells. Both strains were able to adhere to Caco-2 cells, although in different extent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The strain 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 exhibited higher adherence ability (13.73%), comparing to the strain 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 (4.45%) (
