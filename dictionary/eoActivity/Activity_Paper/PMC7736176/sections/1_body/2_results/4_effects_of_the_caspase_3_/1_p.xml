<p>To explore whether the observed increase of HeLa cells within the subG1 phase after 24 h exposure to undigested and digested 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts could be attributed to apoptotic cell death, the cell cycle analysis of cells pretreated with a specific inhibitor of caspase-3 was performed. The decrease in the percentage of subG1 HeLa cells pretreated with caspase-3 inhibitor before exposure to each of the tested extracts was found when compared with treated cells which were not preincubated with an inhibitor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results point to the ability of both undigested and digested extracts of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells through activation of main effector caspase-3.
