<p>In order to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of potential probiotic bacteria (UV inactivated bacteria and cell culture supernatant) as well as 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extract, the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ, and immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 of MLNC stimulated with a ConA was tested. Importantly, none of the used treatments exhibited cytotoxic effects (data not shown). Treatments of MLNC with cell-free culture supernatants and UV inactivated bacteria 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 significantly stimulated the production of IL-17 (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.001 respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), while the treatments of MLNC with cell-free culture supernatants of 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and UV inactivated bacteria of both strains led to the decreased production of IFN-γ (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 0.001 respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 cell culture supernatants as well as their UV inactivated bacteria statistically significantly stimulated the production of IL-10 in MLNC (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Plant extract treatment and treatment with complex food matrix did not exert effects on cytokine production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A–C</xref>).
