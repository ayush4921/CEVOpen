<p>In order to determine the composition of LAB and closely related bacteria associated with 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic>, DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons obtained by using lactobacilli-specific primers Lab-0159f and Uni-0515-GCr was performed. DGGE analysis of the dominant microbiota present in the first dilution of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> leaves revealed the predominant presence of genera: 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, corresponded to the bands 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (69.2%), 
 <italic>Lactococcus</italic>, corresponded to the bands 2, 3, and 4 (23.1%), and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, corresponded to the bands 11 and 13 (15.3%). Sequencing results of the re-amplified bands from DGGE gel indicated the domination of 
 <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> (
