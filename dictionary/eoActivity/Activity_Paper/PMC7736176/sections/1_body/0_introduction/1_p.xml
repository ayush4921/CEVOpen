<p>Ramsons or wild garlic (
 <italic>Allium ursinum</italic>) belongs to medicinal plant species which has been recognized as an important source of biologically active compounds, with the long history of application in traditional medicine as a natural remedy for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Sobolewska et al., 2015</xref>). However, its chemical composition and biological activities have been rarely studied to date. The most important ramsons chemical constituents with pharmacological activity are undoubtedly sulfur compounds; among the most common are glutamyl peptides and sulfoxides, which are at the same time the most widely studied chemicals in this plant species. 
 <italic>Allium</italic> species are characterized by high content of S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine-sulfoxides which after hydrolysis yields many different volatile compounds including thiosulfinates and polysulfides responsible for characteristic odor and flavor (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Sobolewska et al., 2015</xref>). The quantitative profile of cysteine-sulfoxides which could be found in ramson is highly variable depending on plant organ and harvest time. The most abundant sulfoxides are: methiin [(+)-S-methyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide], aliin [(+)-S-2-propenyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide], isoaliin [(+)-S-(1-propenyl)-L-cysteine-sulfoxide], propiin [(+)-S-propyl-L-cysteine-sulfoxide], as well as ethiin (S-ethyl-cysteine-sulfoxide). Tissue damage induced by processing or pathogen attack leads to hydrolytic cleavage of sulfoxides by C,S-lyases and formation of thiosulfinates responsible for the characteristic odor, as well as pyruvic acid and ammonia. The most abundant thiosulfinates present in ramson extracts are allicin (diallylthiosulfinate) and methyl-allyl- or dimethyl thiosulfinates, regarded as unstable and reactive which could be easily decomposed to dithiins, sulfides, polysulfides, ajoenes and many other volatile or non-volatile compounds even at room temperature. Although the composition, stability, as well as bioavailability of thiosulfinates from fresh garlic and several garlic products have been already examined (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rahman, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lawson and Hunsaker, 2018</xref>), this type of study has never been undertaken on 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> fresh leaves. For that purpose, a standardized static 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion model described by 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Minekus et al. (2014)</xref> has been applied in this study to simulate the digestion of ramsons leaves in the presence of complex food matrix. Further, bioaccessible fraction was examined using two-dimensional gas chromatography to assess decomposition of thiosulfinates. In addition, antiproliferative and antioxidant activities were determined in the same fractions.
