 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (Gb) or maidenhair tree is commonly found in China and used for several medicinal purposes since time immemorial. It is one of the most used ancient seeds referred to as “living fossil,” tree that can survive for more than 1000 years and can reach a height of up to 40 m [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Leaf extract from this tree is traditionally used in Asia for centuries to treat circulatory disorders, asthma, tinnitus, vertigo, and cognitive problems [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several reports show that extracts from different parts of this plant are used as supplements or brain stimulant which has been standardized worldwide as safe and most recommended medicinal plant. Different parts of the tree have been commercialized and used in the treatment of several ailments in developed countries especially in the elderly and amongst people with dementia as nootropic agents due to its high activities [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cholinesterase inhibitory effect of the extract from this tree has been documented. Hence, 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> and memantine are classified as among antidementic agents since 2000 years ago [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phytochemical study of extracts from Gb tree revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds mainly terpenoids, flavonol glycosides, and proanthocyanidins. The most available bioactive compounds present in this plant are flavonol glycosides (quercetin and catechin) and terpenoids (ginkgolides and bilobalides), which are reported as unique bioactive components of this tree due to their high neurocurative effects. The pharmacological effects as well as medicinal properties of this plant are due to the presence of terpenoids, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins as reported by several scientists [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Experimental animal studies also discovered the mechanisms of action that have been postulated to reaffirm its pharmacological properties, ability to inhibit platelet-activating factor and enhance nitric oxide elimination from the body system. Subsequently, its effect on increased peripheral and cerebral blood flow was reported and believed to be one of its major mechanisms of action [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Modulations of different neurotransmitter systems by extract from different parts of this tree have also been documented. It acts as strong inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A and synaptosomal uptake of DA, 5-HT, and norepinephrine [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, extracts from different parts of this tree show high free radical scavenger activities, neuroprotective effects, and antiapoptotic properties. The plant has high potential to inhibit amyloid-
 <italic>β</italic> neurotoxicity, protect against hypoxic challenges, and neutralize oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several previous studies of this plant have mainly focused on the efficacy of this tree extract in the management of dementia. Although, inconsistent and controversial results have been documented, this may be due to the different types and concentrations of the available bioactive compounds [
