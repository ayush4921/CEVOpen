<p>Vitexin was the identified crude extract using HPLC method. Although there is no online literature that reported the identification or isolation of vitexin in any part of 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, several studies revealed the presence of various phenolic compounds in this plant. Hence this result is not in line with the work reported by [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] who identified several flavonoids in 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract such as ginkgolide (A, B, C, J), quercetin, and isorhamnetin but not vitexin. It has been reported that vitexin (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) was able to prevent the formation of ROS and NRS which are the markers of protein and lipid oxidation, carbonyl protein, and malondialdehyde [
