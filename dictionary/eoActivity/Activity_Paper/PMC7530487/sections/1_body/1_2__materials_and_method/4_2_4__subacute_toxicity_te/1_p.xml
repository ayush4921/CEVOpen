<p>Subacute toxicity test of arsenic was carried out on adult J. medaka (length of 1.9–2.7 cm, weight of 0.1–0.3 g, and age of 6 months) for 48 hours. Dechlorinized tap water was used in this study as reported by the OECD guideline for testing of chemicals. The fishes were grouped into 6 with five fishes of both sexes per group. The fishes were randomly selected and exposed to a particular dose of arsenic in a 3-liter capacity rectangular glass aquarium. Five different concentrations of arsenic (0.5–4 mM) with three replicates alongside the control group were used. Mortality was monitored continuously and the fishes were considered dead when operculum movement was no longer detected and the fishes could not respond by touched with a glass rod. The dead fishes were immediately removed from the tank. After 24 hours, the exposed experimental fishes were transferred to new tanks containing clean chlorine-free tap water. The fish were fed prior to but not during the experimental period. During the experiment, the behavior of the experimental fishes was monitored regularly by taking note of abnormal behavior manifested and/or death [

The experiments were conducted in compliance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animals use and care as well as ethical clearance by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Universiti Putra Malaysia (ref. no. UPM/IACUC/AUP-R005/2016).
