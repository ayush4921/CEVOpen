<p>A 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 was used as a buffer throughout the experiment. Cholinesterase (AChE) used in the assay was from the homogenized brain of experimental fishes. DTNB, ATC, BTC, and PTC were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl in 96-well plates I. A 210 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of Tris–HCl buffer (pH7.4), 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.1 mM DTNB, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of AChE from the brain (54 mg/mL) were transferred into another 96-well plate II and incubated for 15 min at 28°C. Then, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of ATC, BTC, or PTC (2.5 mM) was then added to the mixture in 96-well plate II and incubated for 10 minutes. Based on Ellman's method, anticholinesterase (ChE) activity was measured using a modified 96-well microplate assay. The hydrolysis of the substrate acetylthiocholine by cholinesterase enzyme results in the production of thiocholine. Thiocholine reacts with Ellman's reagent (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothiocholine which was measured at 405 nm with microplate reader. Reading was taken at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Multimode Microplate, UK) at fluorescent excitation of 485 nm and 535 nm emission [
