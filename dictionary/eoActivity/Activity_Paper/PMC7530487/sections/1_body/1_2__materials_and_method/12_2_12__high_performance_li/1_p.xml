<p>HPLC system (Waters, USA), consisting of a 600 pump, an autoinjector, 2998 photodiode array detector 200 to 500 nm, was set up and used to determine the presence of bioactive compound (vitexin and isovitexin) in the crude extract. Separation was carried out using 250 × 4.6 mm ODS 3.3 mm column (Inertsil, Japan) thermostated at 40°C. A gradient method with methanol and deionized water was used for the separation. At 0 min, the mobile phase was set at 10% methanol in deionized water and increased to 90% methanol in deionized water for duration of 45 min. The 90% methanol in deionized water was maintained for further 15 min. The peaks were integrated at the wavelength of 337 nm [
