<p>At the end of the experiment, the fishes were cryoanesthetized with ice for 20 seconds. The fish head was gently decapitated and the brain was dissected and gently removed out without any damage. Brain sample was then washed with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer. It was then weighed and homogenized in a scope bottle with tissue homogenizer (Polytron PT-6100, USA). Tris–HCl buffer (1% Triton X and 0.1% PMSF) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as homogenizing solvent. Sample was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 minutes with (Grace High Speed Refrigerated Centrifuge, India). The supernatant was transferred into separate tube and used as enzyme source.</p>
