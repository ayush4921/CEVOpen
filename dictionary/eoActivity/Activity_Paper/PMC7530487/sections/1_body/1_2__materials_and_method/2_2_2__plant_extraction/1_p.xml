 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> seed was cleaned and allowed to dry for two weeks at room temperature (26 ± 1°C) before crushing to semipowdered form (40–60 mesh). A total of 200 g of leaf sample was soaked for 3 days in 1000 mL of 80% methanol in flat bottom flasks (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The powdered seed methanol mixture was shaken daily for three days at 26°C to obtain high crude extract; this procedure was repeated three times to extract all bioactive components of the seed. The extract obtained was then filtered with Whatman filter paper (1.5 Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and then concentrated to semisolid form at 42°C with a rotary evaporator (IKA® RV 10, USA). The resultant crude extract obtained was then weighed and transferred into sample bottles and stored at 4°C until required for use [
