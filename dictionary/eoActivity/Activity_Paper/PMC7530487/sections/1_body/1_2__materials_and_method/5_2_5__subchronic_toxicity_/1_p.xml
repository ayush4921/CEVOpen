<p>Subchronic toxicity test of arsenic was conducted in adult J. medaka (length of 1.9–2.7 cm, weight of 0.1–0.3 g, and age of 6 months) for 7 days in chlorine-free tap water as reported by the OECD. Five fishes of both sexes were randomly chosen and exposed to prepared arsenic dose concentrations (0.05, 0.15, 0.75, 1.75, 2.75, and 3.75 mM/L) in a 3-liter capacity rectangular glass aquarium. Three replicates each along with control were used for the test. Mortality was monitored continuously and the fishes were considered dead when they fail to respond to touch with glass rod, and there was no evidence of respiration. Dead fishes were immediately removed from the tank. After 24 hours, exposed fishes were transferred to new tanks containing chlorine-free tap water. The fish were fed prior to and during the experimental period. During the experiment, the fish were closely monitored [
