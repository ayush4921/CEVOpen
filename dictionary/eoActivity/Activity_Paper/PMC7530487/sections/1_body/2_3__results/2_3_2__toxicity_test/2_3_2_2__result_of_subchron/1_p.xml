<p>The result of 7-day subchronic toxicity test of arsenic on adult J. medaka shows high mortality at concentration above 0.15 mM. All the fishes at 0.75 mM concentration died at day 4 while those at 1.75 mM concentration died at day 1. At 0.15 mM concentration, 40% of the fishes survived till day 7 of the experimental study (
