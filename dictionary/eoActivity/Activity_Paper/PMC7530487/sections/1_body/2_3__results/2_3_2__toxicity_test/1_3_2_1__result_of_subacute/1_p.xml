<p>The result of 2-day subacute toxicity test of arsenic on J. medaka shows high mortality at concentration above 0.5 mM. Only 20% of the fishes survived the second day of exposure at 0.5 mM. All fishes died at day 2 of the experiment at this concentration. All fishes at 1, 2, 3, and 4 mM concentrations died at day 1 of the experiment (
