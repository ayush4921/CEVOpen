The <italic>L. tigris</italic> cultivar sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) was found to contain numerous bioactive compounds with beneficial biomedicinal properties and the sclerotial extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity. However, the anticancer property of the Ligno TG-K including in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects as well as its anticancer active compounds and the mechanisms has yet to be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K against human breast (MCF7), prostate (PC3) and lung (A549) adenocarcinoma cell lines was evaluated using MTT cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxic mechanisms of the active high molecular weight proteins (HMWp) fraction were investigated through detection of caspases activity and apoptotic-related proteins expression by Western blotting. The in vivo antitumor activity of the isolated HMWp was examined using MCF7 mouse xenograft model. Shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify the proteins in the HMWp.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Cold water extract of the sclerotia inhibited proliferation of MCF7, A549 and PC3 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 28.9 to 95.0 &#x000b5;g/mL. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract revealed that HMWp exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells via induction of cellular apoptosis by the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. HMWp activated expression of caspase-8 and -9 enzymes, and pro-apoptotic Bax protein whilst inhibiting expression of tumor survivor protein, Bcl-2. HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis and suppressed growth of tumor in MCF-7 xenograft mice. Lectins, serine proteases, RNase Gf29 and a 230NA deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins that accounted for 55.93% of the HMWp.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer.

Based on world cancer statistics-GLOBOCAN 2018, an estimate of 18 million new cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths occurred globally in 2018 (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">World Health&#x000a0;Organization, 2018</xref>). Lung and breast cancers (&#x0003e;2 million cases) are the most common form of cancer with the highest mortality rate causing 25% of total cancer deaths (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">World Health&#x000a0;Organization, 2018</xref>). One of the reasons for the high mortality rate in cancer patients is the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapeutic drugs that lack target specificity, typically causing systemic toxicity and various side effects including fatigue, hair loss, infection and organ dysfunction, which leads to poor quality of life in patients. Therefore, there is a continual need to search for novel, effective and more specific therapeutic agents.</p><p>Mushrooms are popular natural products used not only to enhance the immune system but as a complementary and alternative medicine in cancer therapy due to its indicative anticancer effects (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan, Smith &#x00026; Rowan, 2006</xref>). The <italic>Lignosus</italic> spp., fungi of the Polyporaceae family, which consists of eight different species (<italic>L. dimiticus, L. ekombitii, L. goetzii, L. sacer, L. rhinocerus, L. hainanensis, L. tigris and L. cameronensis</italic>) have been known for its medicinal and functional properties for many centuries (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2015</xref>). The anticancer properties of the <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic> have been extensively investigated. <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Lai, Wong &#x00026; Cheung (2008)</xref> reported the antiproliferative activity of polysaccharide-protein complexes from <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic> on different leukemic cells. The cold water extract prepared from sclerotium of <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic> has also been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against of a panel of human adenocarcinoma and carcinoma cell lines including breast, lung, leukemic, liver, colorectal, prostate, oral squamous and nasopharyngeal cancers, and proteins and polysaccharide-protein complexes have been hypothesized as the active cytotoxic components (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2013</xref>). A subtilisin-like serine protease fraction purified from <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic> sclerotia was also shown to exhibit cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells via induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In 2013, a distinct, new species of <italic>Lignosus</italic> mushroom was discovered from the tropical forest in the state of Pahang, Malaysia (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Tan, Ng &#x00026; Tan, 2013</xref>). This mushroom had not been formerly distinguished from <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic> due to its similarities in gross morphologies and has often been mistakenly recognized as <italic>L.&#x000a0;rhinocerus</italic>. The identity of the new species has since been verified using DNA barcode marker targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and was named <italic>Lignosus tigris Chon S. Tan</italic> (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Tan, Ng &#x00026; Tan, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2014c</xref>). The wild type of <italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris</italic> sclerotia is reported to contain good nutritive value and the sclerotial extracts possess potent antioxidant capacity (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2014a</xref>). The <italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris</italic> mushroom has recently been successfully cultivated and we have evaluated the toxicity profile of the cultivated <italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris</italic> sclerotium (also known as Ligno TG-K). The Ligno TG-K was shown to be safe for consumption and contained bioactive components that exhibit immunomodulatory and anticancer properties (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>). The local Malaysian natives have claimed the medicinal benefits from <italic>Lignosus</italic> sclerotia consumption in treating various illnesses including breast cancer. To date, there has been no study conducted to evaluate the anticancer properties of the <italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris</italic> sclerotia. In this study, we aim to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity of Ligno TG-K as well as to look into the protein component(s) responsible for these bioactivities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec><title>Mushroom sample</title><p><italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris Chon S.

The sclerotium specimen was deposited (K(M) 177826) at Mycological Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Richmond, London, UK). <italic>L.&#x000a0;tigris</italic> sclerotium (Ligno TG-K) was cultivated by Ligno Biotech. Sdn. Bhd. (Selangor, Malaysia) and each batch of Ligno TG-K was verified by DNA barcode marker targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2014c</xref>). Freeze dried Ligno TG-K powder used in this study was provided by Ligno Biotech.</p></sec><sec><title>Cold water extraction, fractionation and determination of total protein, carbohydrates, glucan type and terpenoids</title><p>Cold water extraction was performed by dissolving the mushroom sclerotial powder in distilled water, in a ratio of 1:20 (g/mL) and stirred continuously at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24 h. The extract mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 g for 30 min and the supernatant was filtered through Whatman<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Grade 1 filter paper prior to freeze-drying. The Ligno TG-K cold water extract (CWE) was fractionated by Sephadex G-50 (fine) gel filtration chromatography with 0.05 M ammonium acetate as eluent. Elution was carried out by gravity with a flow rate of two mL/min. Three pooled fractions of high (HMW), medium (MMW) and low (LMW) molecular weights were collected based on the distribution of the protein and carbohydrate in each fraction. The initial protein and carbohydrate contents in each fraction were estimated by Bradford (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bradford, 1976</xref>) and phenol sulfuric acid assays (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 1956</xref>), respectively. Collected pooled fractions were freeze dried and kept at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for further analysis. Total protein and carbohydrate contents of the pooled fractions were determined using 2D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare) and phenol sulfuric acid assay (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 1956</xref>), respectively. The glucan content in the fractions were determined using Megazyme Mushroom and Yeast Beta-Glucan Assay Kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd, Wicklow, UK) (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>). Total terpenoid content was estimated by using linalool as the standard as described previously (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Ghorai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ammonium sulfate precipitation of CWE-HMW proteins</title><p>Proteins in the CWE-HMW fraction were precipitated by using 100% saturation ammonium sulfate (stirring at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1 h). Precipitated proteins were then collected by centrifugation followed by desalting using Vivaspin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Centrifugal Concentrator 15R (MWCO-5 kDa) (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany). The non-protein component (supernatant) was recovered using Sephadex G-25 (fine) gel filtration chromatography by desalting.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxicity assay</title><p>Human breast (MCF7), lung (A549) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines and non-tumorigenic breast (184B5) cell line were purchased from ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Virginia, USA). MCF7, PC3 and A549 cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI-1640, Biowest, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 184B5 cells were maintained in MEBM medium supplemented with MEGM bullet kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and 10% FBS.

Two microliters of sample were injected into the microfluidic nanospray chip containing a 160-nl enrichment column packed with C18 (300 &#x000c5;) at 4 &#x000b5;L/min. Analytical separation of the peptides was completed through the pre-column in-line with a 75&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m &#x000d7; 150&#x000a0;mm analytical column at 0.4 &#x000b5;L/min in a linear gradient from Solution A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 95% Solution B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) in 47 min including post-run of 8 min. MS/MS data acquisition parameters were as previously described in <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al. (2015b)</xref> with minor adjustments. For subsequent MS (rate: 20 spectra/s, time: 50 ms/spectrum) and MS/MS (rate: 8 spectra/s, time: 125 ms/spectrum) analyses, spectra were acquired in a MSMS mode with scan range from 200 to 3,000 m/z and 50 to 3,200 m/z, respectively. Capillary and fragmentor voltage were 1,800 V and 175 V, respectively, with drying gas flow rate of 11.0 L/min at 290&#x000a0;&#x000b0; C.

In this study, we demonstrated that the cold water extract from <italic>L. tigris</italic> mushroom sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) exerted potent cytotoxic effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells. The CWE exhibited less cytotoxicity to non-tumorigenic breast 184B5 cells indicating that the extract is selectively cytotoxic. This result provided scientific evidence to support the traditional usage of this mushroom for treatment of breast conditions such as swollen breast and cancer (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ismail, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Mohammad, Milow &#x00026; Ong, 2012</xref>). The CWE also showed significant cytotoxicity against lung and prostate cancer cells; however, it was also cytotoxic to the respective non-tumorigenic cells, indicating lack of the cytotoxic selectivity against these cancer cells.</p><p>Previous studies from our group reported that the cold water extract from the sclerotia of <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 exhibited selective antiproliferative activity against MCF7 cells (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we found that Ligno TG-K CWE has stronger cytotoxic effect (IC<sub>50</sub> at least 3-fold lower) than TM02 CWE. The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K CWE is attributed to high molecular weight components. The HMW fraction isolated from Ligno TG-K CWE exerted selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of at least 3-fold lower compared to 184B5 cells. The HMW of Ligno TG-K CWE also showed stronger cytotoxic effect against MCF7 cells (4.23 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to that of TM02 (70.0&#x02013;106.7 &#x000b5;g/mL) (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2015b</xref>). HMW was found to contain mostly protein and a low amount of beta-glucan and terpenoids. Beta-glucan and terpenoids have been reported to possess potent anticancer activity (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Duru &#x00026; &#x000c7;ayan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Although beta-glucan and terpenoids were found abundantly in MMW and LMW, yet the MMW and LMW were less cytotoxic and not active against MCF7 cells, respectively. Thus, we postulated that proteins which were found abundantly in the HMW could be responsible for the cytotoxicity observed.</p><p>To further explore the mechanism of cytotoxicity of the proteins in HMW, the protein components were isolated by precipitation using 100% saturated ammonium sulfate. HMWp was found to effectively inhibit the proliferation of MCF7 cells and was selective against MCF7 cells as shown by its 3-fold lower IC<sub>50</sub> compared to 184B5 cells. In addition, its cytotoxic selectivity was greater than doxorubicin, a standard chemotherapy drug used for breast cancer. Doxorubicin was more cytotoxic to 184B5 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.12&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.04 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to MCF7 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.76&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.19 &#x000b5;g/mL) (determined using the same protocol in this study). The HMWp has the potential to be considered as a therapeutic cytotoxic agent against MCF7 cells as it fits into the criteria established by National Cancer Institute (USA), where crude extracts and pure compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> of less than 20 &#x000b5;g/mL and 4 &#x000b5;g/mL at 72 h post incubation, respectively, are regarded as potentially active cytotoxic agents (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Boik, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of HMWp was associated with induction of apoptosis in MCF7 cells. Cell morphology changes including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and apoptotic bodies indicated the occurrence of apoptotic events in MCF7 cells upon treatment with HMWp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S2</xref>). This is supported by the elevation of caspase-3/7 activity in the cells treated with HMWp. The ability of HMWp to induce apoptosis in MCF7 cells is hypothesized to be mediated by caspase activation including caspase-8 and -9. Experimental results showed that the activities of caspase-8 and -9 were up-regulated following treatment with HMWp, suggesting that induction of apoptosis is mediated via the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Despite the absence of caspase-3 in MCF7 cells, both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways eventually activated caspase-7 and led to subsequent cell death.</p><p>The Bcl-2 family proteins play a key role in activation of intrinsic (mitochondrial mediated) apoptotic pathway and are divided into three subclasses including pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins and the effector proteins Bax and Bak (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Martinou &#x00026; Youle, 2011</xref>). In this study, data obtained from Western blot analysis showed the HMWp induced apoptosis was accompanied by decreased expression level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and increased expression levels of effector protein Bax and pro-apoptotic Bid, without the presence of truncated Bid (tBid). Elevation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio proved that HMWp treatment increased the susceptibility of MCF7 cells to undergo apoptosis. Bax presents in excessive levels trigger the permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane and releases cytochrome c which in turn activates the caspase cascade resulting in apoptosis (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Tait &#x00026; Green, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Youle &#x00026; Strasser, 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism of Bax activation in regulating the permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane in MCF7 cells following treatment with HMWp remains unknown and requires more investigations. The absence of the tBid suggests that there is no crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Our results suggest that HMWp activates extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways independently to induce apoptosis in MCF7 cells.</p><p>In vivo studies are crucial to the drug discovery and development of novel cancer therapies. In vivo animal models allow preclinical testing of potential anticancer agents and provide useful information on toxicological and therapeutic effects, as well as pharmacokinetic properties of the drug candidates, prior to clinical trials to ensure the efficacy and safety of the drugs. Our in vivo antitumor study using MCF7 tumor xenograft model demonstrated that HMWp is effective in suppressing the growth of solid breast tumors. The HMWp induced DNA damage and apoptotic cell death in tumor cells and subsequently reducing the tumor mass in the treated mice. The dosage of HMWp (5 &#x000b5;g/g BW) administered to the animals was decided based on the estimation of the amount of drug that could be delivered to the tumor sites. By assuming the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume of a mouse to be &#x0223c;20% of body weight (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2010</xref>), the injected dose of 5 &#x000b5;g/g BW is estimated to deliver about 25 &#x000b5;g/mL of HMWp into the ECF (assuming complete absorption) of a mouse weighing 20 g. This selected dosage of HMWp (5 &#x000b5;g/g BW or 25 &#x000b5;g/mL ECF) is approximately 20 times higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> (1.17 &#x000b5;g/mL) of MCF7 cells in vitro. Nonetheless, in the in vitro cytotoxicity assay, HMWp was administered directly onto the monolayer MCF7 cells having direct contact with the cells. In this in vivo antitumor study, the quantity of HMWp that tumor cells are exposed to is likely to be less than amount administered (<italic>i.p.</italic> at 25 &#x000b5;g/mL ECF) as not all the administered amount of HMWp can be absorbed and delivered to the target tumor site, considering the characteristics of the solid tumor structure which includes cells distant from blood vessels, high interstitial fluid pressure and extracellular matrix (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Minchinton &#x00026; Tannock, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Sriraman, Aryasomayajula &#x00026; Torchilin, 2014</xref>) which will restrict the penetration of HMWp into the tumor cells. Hence, the amount of HMWp that the tumor cells are exposed to is far less than 25 &#x000b5;g/mL. In addition, this dosage was not toxic to the mice as no adverse effects was observed in the vital organs. Observation of the mice did, however revealed possible momentary pain in the treated mice. Acidic condition of HMWp due to high composition of acidic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) in Ligno TG-K protein (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>) or presence of irritant compounds in HMWp could have induced abdominal discomfort in the mice. This condition was followed by a decrease in locomotor activity and thus reduction in food intake which subsequently led to weight loss in the mice. This is the first study demonstrating the antitumor effects of proteins isolated from a newly discovered species of Tiger Milk mushroom, <italic>L. tigris</italic> and warrants more investigations, including using a lower dosage and longer treatment duration.</p><p>Our previous studies have reported that the TM02 sclerotium contains lectins, serine proteases and immunomodulatory proteins which possess bio-pharmacological activities including antiproliferative, antitumor and immunomodulatory (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2015b</xref>). Our current study shows that Ligno TG-K has a distinct cytotoxic and antitumor potency on breast cancer cells compared to <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the protein components in HMWp. Using 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled with shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis, lectins and serine proteases are the two most abundant proteins detected in HMWp. Mushroom lectins and serine proteases have been reported to exert antiproliferative, antitumor, immunomodulatory, mitogenic and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory effects (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Ditamo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Majumder, Banik &#x00026; Khowala, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Study by <italic><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al. (2015b)</xref></italic> also demonstrated a partially purified serine protease protein fraction (designated as F5) isolated from <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 sclerotium exhibited potent cytotoxic selectivity toward MCF7 cells. Our results showed 74.6% of the serine proteases in HMWp is encoded by the same gene as F5 serine proteases (97.3% encoded by GME4347_g).</p><p>T2 family ribonucleases play a role in a variety of biological functions including degradation of extra- or intracellular RNAs and acting as cytotoxic agents and immunomodulatory (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Luhtala &#x00026; Parker, 2010</xref>). ACTIBIND, a fungal T2-RNase isolated from <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, has been reported to exert active antiangiogenic and anticarcinogenic activities (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Roiz et al., 2006</xref>). ACTIBIND inhibited the growth of HT-29 colon tumor xenograft and exerted preventive and therapeutic effects on dimethylhydrazine-induced colonic tumor in rats (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Roiz et al., 2006</xref>). The RNase Gf29 belonging to RNAse T2 family was found in moderate amount in HMWp and it has not been reported in <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a deoxyribonuclease-like protein in mushrooms, specifically Tiger Milk mushroom. This 230NA deoxyribonuclease-like protein encoded by GME1230_g contains a conserved domain of DNase_NucA_NucB is highly abundance in Ligno TG-K HMWp. The current knowledge on the function of this protein is scarce but the presence of the DNase_NucA_NucB domain suggests that it might act as a deoxyribonuclease. This is also supported by recent studies where fungal antitumor proteins with deoxyribonuclease activity were reported. Antitumor proteins from <italic>Agrocybe aegerita, Pholiota nameko</italic> and <italic>Ramaria botrytis</italic> mushrooms which possessed deoxyribonuclease activity have been reported to exhibit potent antiproliferative activity and apoptosis-inducing effect on several human cancer cells such as neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), HeLa, breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the 230NA protein may have similar cytotoxic properties as with the other reported deoxyribonucleases which may also play a role in cytotoxicity of HMWp. Our data suggests that the lectins, serine proteases, RNase Gf29 and the novel 230NA deoxyribonuclease that constituting 55.93% of the HMWp, may contribute to the cytotoxicity of HMWp. Furthermore, <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Trejo-Becerril et al. (2016)</xref> has demonstrated a combination of proteases and DNaseI inhibited the growth of tumors in colon tumor-bearing mice. Thus, the high content of serine protease and deoxyribonuclease in HMWp could have contributed to the major antitumor activity in this study. Though other proteins which were found in low amounts in HMWp such as agmatinase, thioredoxin reductase, alpha-galactosidase and chain A of a novel pore-forming lectin have not been reported to exhibit antiproliferative activity, these proteins remain as bioactive proteins of interest for future investigations of this species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer. We demonstrated that a high molecular weight protein fraction isolated from Ligno TG-K selectively inhibited the growth of MCF7 cells through induction of apoptosis mediated by a mechanism involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This pioneering study has also shown the HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis in MCF7 solid tumor and suppressed tumor growth without causing significant toxicity to mice. Serine protease, lectin, RNase Gf29 and a novel deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins in the HMWp. The antitumor properties of HMWp support that HMWp has the potential to be developed into new anticancer agents or be used as adjunct therapy for breast cancer. Data from this study provide a new insight into the antitumor activity of Ligno TG-K and on-going studies are focused on the purification and characterization of the identified cytotoxic proteins for further exploration on the exact mechanism involved in their cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells with the aim of drug discovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title> Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.9650/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Sephadex G-50 fractionation of Ligno TG-K CWE</title><p>A total of 150 fractions (2 mL of fraction/tube) were collected.
