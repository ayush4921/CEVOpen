  <title>Caspase-3/7, -8 and -9 activities of the HMWp-treated MCF7 cells.</title>
  <p>(A–C) Cells were treated with 1.2 µg/mL of HMWp and caspase activities were measured at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error (S.E.M) from two independent experiments performed in triplicate.
   <sup>∗</sup> indicates significant difference in the fold change between the treated and untreated control cells (SPSS, independent samples
