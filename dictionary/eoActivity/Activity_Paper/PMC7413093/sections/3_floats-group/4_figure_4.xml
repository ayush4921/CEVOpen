  <title>Apoptotic effect of HMWp treatment on MCF7 tumors.</title>
  <p>Tumor tissue sections from mice treated with (A) PBS (control) and (B) HMWp were stained with TUNEL (representative images at 100 × magnification). Dark arrows indicate the apoptotic cells (stained in dark brown). (C) Percentage of TUNEL-positive cells detected in tumor sections from PBS control and HMWp-treated mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). 
   <sup>∗</sup> indicates significant difference in the average percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in control and treatment groups (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
