<p>The cytotoxic effect of extract and fractions was examined using the MTT assay as described in 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann (1983)</xref> with some modifications. Cells with optimal density was seeded into a 96-well microplate and incubated overnight prior to treatment with various concentrations of samples for 72 h. At the end of the incubation time, 20 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added and cells were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 4 h. All the solution was removed by aspiration and 200 µL of DMSO was added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. Absorbance readings were measured using a microplate reader at 570 nm. A plot showing percentage of cell viability against the tested sample concentration was used to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>).
