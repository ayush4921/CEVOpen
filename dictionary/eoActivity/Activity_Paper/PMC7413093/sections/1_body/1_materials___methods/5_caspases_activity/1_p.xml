<p>Caspases activation was evaluated using Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> kits (Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, MCF7 cells were seeded into 96-well white plate and treated with HMWp (at IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. After treatment, Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> reagent was added in 1:1 ratio into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The luminescent signal was measured using monochromator microplate reader, Tecan
 <sup>®</sup> Infinite M1000 Pro (Tecan Austria GmbH).
