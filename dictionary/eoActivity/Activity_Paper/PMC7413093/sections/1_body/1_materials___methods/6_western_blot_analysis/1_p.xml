<p>MCF7 cells were treated with HMWp at IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Total protein was extracted from the treated cells by using RIPA lysis buffer as described by 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al. (2018)</xref>. Thirty micrograms of protein were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% w/v skim milk in TBST (1X TBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h, and incubated at 4 °C with the corresponding primary antibodies: a β-actin rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1000), a Bax rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1000), a Bcl-2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:200) and a BID polyclonal antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., MA, USA), prepared in 5% w/v BSA in TBST. After incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and followed by incubation with HRP-anti rabbit IgG (diluted 1:2000 in 5% skim milk, TBST solution) for 1 h at room temperature. HRP enzyme activity was detected using enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific, USA) and chemiluminescent signal was captured using a CCD-based imaging system (BioSpectrum
