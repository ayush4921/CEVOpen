<p>The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the 
 <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer. We demonstrated that a high molecular weight protein fraction isolated from Ligno TG-K selectively inhibited the growth of MCF7 cells through induction of apoptosis mediated by a mechanism involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This pioneering study has also shown the HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis in MCF7 solid tumor and suppressed tumor growth without causing significant toxicity to mice. Serine protease, lectin, RNase Gf29 and a novel deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins in the HMWp. The antitumor properties of HMWp support that HMWp has the potential to be developed into new anticancer agents or be used as adjunct therapy for breast cancer. Data from this study provide a new insight into the antitumor activity of Ligno TG-K and on-going studies are focused on the purification and characterization of the identified cytotoxic proteins for further exploration on the exact mechanism involved in their cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells with the aim of drug discovery.
