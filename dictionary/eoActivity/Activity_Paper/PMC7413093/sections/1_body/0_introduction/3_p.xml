<p>In 2013, a distinct, new species of 
 <italic>Lignosus</italic> mushroom was discovered from the tropical forest in the state of Pahang, Malaysia (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Tan, Ng &amp; Tan, 2013</xref>). This mushroom had not been formerly distinguished from 
 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> due to its similarities in gross morphologies and has often been mistakenly recognized as 
 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic>. The identity of the new species has since been verified using DNA barcode marker targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and was named 
 <italic>Lignosus tigris Chon S. Tan</italic> (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2014c</xref>). The wild type of 
 <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotia is reported to contain good nutritive value and the sclerotial extracts possess potent antioxidant capacity (

 <italic>L. tigris</italic> mushroom has recently been successfully cultivated and we have evaluated the toxicity profile of the cultivated 
 <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotium (also known as Ligno TG-K). The Ligno TG-K was shown to be safe for consumption and contained bioactive components that exhibit immunomodulatory and anticancer properties (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>). The local Malaysian natives have claimed the medicinal benefits from 
 <italic>Lignosus</italic> sclerotia consumption in treating various illnesses including breast cancer. To date, there has been no study conducted to evaluate the anticancer properties of the 
 <italic>L. tigris</italic> sclerotia. In this study, we aim to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity of Ligno TG-K as well as to look into the protein component(s) responsible for these bioactivities.
