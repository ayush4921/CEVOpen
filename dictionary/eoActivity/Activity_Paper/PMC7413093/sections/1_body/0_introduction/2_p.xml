 <italic>Lignosus</italic> spp., fungi of the Polyporaceae family, which consists of eight different species (
 <italic>L. dimiticus, L. ekombitii, L. goetzii, L. sacer, L. rhinocerus, L. hainanensis, L. tigris and L. cameronensis</italic>) have been known for its medicinal and functional properties for many centuries (

 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> have been extensively investigated.

 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> on different leukemic cells. The cold water extract prepared from sclerotium of 
 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> has also been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against of a panel of human adenocarcinoma and carcinoma cell lines including breast, lung, leukemic, liver, colorectal, prostate, oral squamous and nasopharyngeal cancers, and proteins and polysaccharide-protein complexes have been hypothesized as the active cytotoxic components (
