<p>Previous studies from our group reported that the cold water extract from the sclerotia of 
 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 exhibited selective antiproliferative activity against MCF7 cells (

 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we found that Ligno TG-K CWE has stronger cytotoxic effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> at least 3-fold lower) than TM02 CWE. The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K CWE is attributed to high molecular weight components. The HMW fraction isolated from Ligno TG-K CWE exerted selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of at least 3-fold lower compared to 184B5 cells. The HMW of Ligno TG-K CWE also showed stronger cytotoxic effect against MCF7 cells (4.23 µg/mL) compared to that of TM02 (70.0–106.7 µg/mL) (

 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2015b</xref>). HMW was found to contain mostly protein and a low amount of beta-glucan and terpenoids. Beta-glucan and terpenoids have been reported to possess potent anticancer activity (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Duru &amp; Çayan, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Although beta-glucan and terpenoids were found abundantly in MMW and LMW, yet the MMW and LMW were less cytotoxic and not active against MCF7 cells, respectively. Thus, we postulated that proteins which were found abundantly in the HMW could be responsible for the cytotoxicity observed.
