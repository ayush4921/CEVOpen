<p>The Bcl-2 family proteins play a key role in activation of intrinsic (mitochondrial mediated) apoptotic pathway and are divided into three subclasses including pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins and the effector proteins Bax and Bak (

In this study, data obtained from Western blot analysis showed the HMWp induced apoptosis was accompanied by decreased expression level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and increased expression levels of effector protein Bax and pro-apoptotic Bid, without the presence of truncated Bid (tBid). Elevation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio proved that HMWp treatment increased the susceptibility of MCF7 cells to undergo apoptosis. Bax presents in excessive levels trigger the permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane and releases cytochrome c which in turn activates the caspase cascade resulting in apoptosis (

However, the mechanism of Bax activation in regulating the permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane in MCF7 cells following treatment with HMWp remains unknown and requires more investigations. The absence of the tBid suggests that there is no crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Our results suggest that HMWp activates extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways independently to induce apoptosis in MCF7 cells.
