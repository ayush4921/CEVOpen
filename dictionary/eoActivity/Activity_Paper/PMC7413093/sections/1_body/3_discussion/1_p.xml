<p>Medicinal fungi are a rich source of biologically active compound with potent pharmacological activities and its popularity as a complementary and alternative medicine has been increasing in cancer therapies of late. In this study, we demonstrated that the cold water extract from 
 <italic>L. tigris</italic> mushroom sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) exerted potent cytotoxic effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells. The CWE exhibited less cytotoxicity to non-tumorigenic breast 184B5 cells indicating that the extract is selectively cytotoxic.

The CWE also showed significant cytotoxicity against lung and prostate cancer cells; however, it was also cytotoxic to the respective non-tumorigenic cells, indicating lack of the cytotoxic selectivity against these cancer cells.
