<p>Further analysis demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of HMWp was associated with induction of apoptosis in MCF7 cells. Cell morphology changes including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and apoptotic bodies indicated the occurrence of apoptotic events in MCF7 cells upon treatment with HMWp (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S2</xref>). This is supported by the elevation of caspase-3/7 activity in the cells treated with HMWp. The ability of HMWp to induce apoptosis in MCF7 cells is hypothesized to be mediated by caspase activation including caspase-8 and -9. Experimental results showed that the activities of caspase-8 and -9 were up-regulated following treatment with HMWp, suggesting that induction of apoptosis is mediated via the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Despite the absence of caspase-3 in MCF7 cells, both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways eventually activated caspase-7 and led to subsequent cell death.
