<p>To further explore the mechanism of cytotoxicity of the proteins in HMW, the protein components were isolated by precipitation using 100% saturated ammonium sulfate. HMWp was found to effectively inhibit the proliferation of MCF7 cells and was selective against MCF7 cells as shown by its 3-fold lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> compared to 184B5 cells. In addition, its cytotoxic selectivity was greater than doxorubicin, a standard chemotherapy drug used for breast cancer. Doxorubicin was more cytotoxic to 184B5 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.12 ± 0.04 µg/mL) compared to MCF7 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.76 ± 0.19 µg/mL) (determined using the same protocol in this study). The HMWp has the potential to be considered as a therapeutic cytotoxic agent against MCF7 cells as it fits into the criteria established by National Cancer Institute (USA), where crude extracts and pure compounds with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of less than 20 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL at 72 h post incubation, respectively, are regarded as potentially active cytotoxic agents (
