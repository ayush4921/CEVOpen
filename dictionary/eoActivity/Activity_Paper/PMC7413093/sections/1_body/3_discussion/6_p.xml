<p>In vivo studies are crucial to the drug discovery and development of novel cancer therapies. In vivo animal models allow preclinical testing of potential anticancer agents and provide useful information on toxicological and therapeutic effects, as well as pharmacokinetic properties of the drug candidates, prior to clinical trials to ensure the efficacy and safety of the drugs. Our in vivo antitumor study using MCF7 tumor xenograft model demonstrated that HMWp is effective in suppressing the growth of solid breast tumors. The HMWp induced DNA damage and apoptotic cell death in tumor cells and subsequently reducing the tumor mass in the treated mice. The dosage of HMWp (5 µg/g BW) administered to the animals was decided based on the estimation of the amount of drug that could be delivered to the tumor sites. By assuming the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume of a mouse to be ∼20% of body weight (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2010</xref>), the injected dose of 5 µg/g BW is estimated to deliver about 25 µg/mL of HMWp into the ECF (assuming complete absorption) of a mouse weighing 20 g. This selected dosage of HMWp (5 µg/g BW or 25 µg/mL ECF) is approximately 20 times higher than the IC
 <sub>50</sub> (1.17 µg/mL) of MCF7 cells in vitro. Nonetheless, in the in vitro cytotoxicity assay, HMWp was administered directly onto the monolayer MCF7 cells having direct contact with the cells. In this in vivo antitumor study, the quantity of HMWp that tumor cells are exposed to is likely to be less than amount administered (

 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Sriraman, Aryasomayajula &amp; Torchilin, 2014</xref>) which will restrict the penetration of HMWp into the tumor cells. Hence, the amount of HMWp that the tumor cells are exposed to is far less than 25 µg/mL. In addition, this dosage was not toxic to the mice as no adverse effects was observed in the vital organs. Observation of the mice did, however revealed possible momentary pain in the treated mice. Acidic condition of HMWp due to high composition of acidic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) in Ligno TG-K protein (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2016a</xref>) or presence of irritant compounds in HMWp could have induced abdominal discomfort in the mice. This condition was followed by a decrease in locomotor activity and thus reduction in food intake which subsequently led to weight loss in the mice. This is the first study demonstrating the antitumor effects of proteins isolated from a newly discovered species of Tiger Milk mushroom,
