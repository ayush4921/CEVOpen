<p>Using the 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled with shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis, a total 44 different types of proteins were identified in the HMWp. Similar proteins (protein redundancy) detected in different gel sections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Table S1</xref>), likely due to the possible protein degradation and/or fragmentation throughout the extraction, purification and separation processes were removed from the raw data using gene ID as reference. The relative percentage of each protein was calculated and summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6B</xref>. The non-informative proteins which include predicted, hypothetical and not annotated proteins constitute 54.75% of the total proteins. Lectin (17.55%) was the most abundant protein identified in HMWp, followed by serine protease (10.80%) and RNase Gf29 (5.75%). Proteins with less than 1.0% abundance were grouped as “Others” (3.92%).
