<p>It was interesting to note that protein 230NA with unknown function comprises about 40% of the total non-informative protein or 21.83% of the total protein in HMWp. The 230NA was mostly detected in gel section 4 (7.61%) and 5 (7.73%) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Table S1</xref>). The protein sequence GME1230_g of the 230NA obtained from TM02 database was blasted against the NCBInr database and it matched to a hypothetical protein TRAVEDRAFT_74601 (
