<p>Cold water extract (CWE) of the Ligno TG-K contains 41% and 7% carbohydrates and proteins, respectively. The CWE was fractionated into HMW, MMW and LMW fractions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). The LMW fraction has the highest yield (79.2%) amongst the CWE fractionated materials, followed by HMW (15.5%) and MMW (5.3%) fractions. The HMW fraction contained the highest protein content whilst MMW fraction contains the highest carbohydrate content (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). LMW consists of mainly carbohydrates with very low amounts of proteins (&lt;1%). Glucan content determination of the fractions revealed that alpha glucan (+ oligomers etc.) was the major glucan component in all the fractions tested (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Both MMW and LMW contain comparable Î²-glucan content. The terpenoid level in LMW was found to be at least 5 and 3 times higher than the HMW and MMW, respectively (
