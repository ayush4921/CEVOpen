<p>To investigate the involvement of caspases in HMWp-induced apoptosis, caspase-3/7, -8 and -9 activities of MCF7 cells treated with HMWp (1.2 µg/mL) for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were measured using the Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> kits. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>, caspase-3/7 activities were significantly higher after treatment with HMWp. Both the caspase-8 and -9 activities peaked at 12 h and 24 h to about 30-fold and 9-fold greater than the untreated cells, respectively, and gradually decreased over the 72 h incubation period.
