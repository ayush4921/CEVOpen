  <p>Principal coordinate analysis of 18 
   <italic>H. cordata</italic> populations, based on Neiâ€™s unbiased genetic distances. Horizontal and vertical scales represent the first and second principal axes of variation respectively (the two axes that explain the most variations among populations). Here the first principal axis represents a large 60.61% of variation, the second axis represents 23.59% of variation. Full name of the populations is given in Table
