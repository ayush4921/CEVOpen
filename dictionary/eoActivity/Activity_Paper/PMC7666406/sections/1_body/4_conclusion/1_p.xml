<p id="Par17">In conclusion, we observe that the total genetic diversity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. was high with higher genetic differentiation between populations of different regions compared to population of the same region in North-East India. The observed genetic structure may probably be due to genetic drift of small isolated populations promoting high genetic variation between population of different regions than between population of same region. Therefore, it is important for conservation planners to devise conservation strategies for conservation of maximum possible numbers of population from all the regions rather than focusing on a few targeted populations. We, therefore, suggest to target genotypes from as many populations possible rather than few selected populations for ex situ or in situ conservation of wild populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. in the North-Eastern region of India.
