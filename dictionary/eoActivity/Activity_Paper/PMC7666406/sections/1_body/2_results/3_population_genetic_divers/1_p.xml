<p id="Par13">For each population, the data for number of loci scored, number as well as proportion of polymorphic loci at 5% level, Nei’s gene diversity (Hj) etc. are given in supplementary information 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The Nei’s gene diversity (Hj) ranged from 0.07782 (PLP = 21.2%) in population MR to 0.13634 (PLP = 32.1%) in population BP. Thus, high variability was observed in all populations collected from South-West region whereas low variability was recorded in population from South-East region of Brahmaputra valley. The mean Nei’s gene diversity within population (or Nei Hs) was found to be 0.1081 (supplementary information 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Moreover, total gene diversity (Ht), i.e. gene diversity among population, was found to be 0.1769 (supplementary information 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The average gene diversity within population (Hw) and average gene diversity among population (Hb) or genetic differentiation among population were found to be 0.1081 and 0.0689 respectively. Furthermore, Wright fixation index (Fst) showing the proportion of the total gene diversity that occurs among as opposed to within population was found to be 0.3894. When the populations were divided into four clusters based on STRUCTURE analysis (supplementary information 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), Nei’s gene diversity (Hj) was found to be 0.0776, 0.1199, 0.1057 and 0.1257 respectively for South-Eastern, North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Western populations. Similarly, Shannon diversity index (
 <italic>I</italic> value) for the four clusters was found to be 0.1174, 0.1866, 0.1588 and 0.1829 respectively for South-Eastern, North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Western populations. When North-Western and North-Eastern populations were pooled together, Nei’ gene diversity (Hj) was found to be 0.1492 with the Shannon diversity index value of 0.2393. Furthermore, when South-Eastern and South-Western populations were pooled together, Nei’s gene diversity (Hj) was found to be 0.1296 with the Shannon diversity index value of 0.2049.
