<p id="Par4">There is no record of organized cultivation of this medicinal plant, and therefore, it is mostly harvested from its wild habitat. With the growth of commercial demand in the recent years, the plant is being indiscriminately harvested from wild resulting in habitat destruction, population decrease and reduction in its genetic diversity (Zhong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>). Many studies from China have reported genetic diversity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. based on morphological features, isozyme, chromosome number and ISSR markers (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2002</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>; Wei and Wu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>; Zhong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>). But until now, no study has targeted the genetic diversity and population structure of this important medicinal plant in North-East India, although this information is essential for the formulation of any effective conservation strategies. In the present work, 18 populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. from different regions of North-East India were analysed using ISSR marker to study their genetic diversity, differentiation and structure. We then used these results to describe genetic diversity and population structure and to infer whether any gene flow among these populations occurs. The information generated in the present study on population genetics of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. could be used to plan adequate conservation actions.
