  <italic>Breynia fruticosa</italic> (L.) Müll.Arg. is a well-known folk medicinal plant and found abundantly in South China. The complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> reported firstly here was 155,630 bp in length, including a large single-copy region with 85,065 bp (LSC), a small single-copy region with 19,441 bp (SSC) and a pair of inverted repeats with 25, 562 bp (IRa and IRb). The plastome was comprised of 112 distinct genes, with 78 protein coding genes, four ribosomal RNA genes and 30 transfer RNA genes. The overall GC content of 
  <italic>B. fruticose</italic> chloroplast genome was 36.7%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
  <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> was closely related to 
  <italic>Glochidion fruticosa</italic>.
