<p>β-glucans are β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose polysaccharides. The main criterion for the classification of these compounds is their structure. For example, the type of glycosidic bond connecting glucose monomers, the degree of chain branching, and the length of side chains [

 <sc>d</sc>-glucose molecules are connected by β-1,3 bonds and have short and numerous side chains with β-1,6-link coming off the β-1,3-backbone [
