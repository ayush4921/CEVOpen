<p>In recent years some new methods were developed for the determination of β-glucans, among others, the enzymatic method (Megazyme, Ireland) for the determination of β-glucans in mushrooms and yeast [

Therefore, the main objective of this study was the quantitative evaluation of β-glucans in wild and commercial mushrooms used for comparison purposes, with the two analytical methods. According to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the content of β-glucans by two methods the Megazyme method and the Congo red by Nitschke et al. [
