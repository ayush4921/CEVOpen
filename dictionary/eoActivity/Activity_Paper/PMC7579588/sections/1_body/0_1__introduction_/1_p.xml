<p>Glucans are polysaccharides composed of glucose monomers, present in the cell walls of bacteria, algae, plants, as well as yeasts, micro- and macrofungi. Despite many differences between the composition and organization of mushroom cell walls, there are some solid elements that form the core scaffold. The main saccharide components of mushroom cell walls are chitin; α-glucans; and β-glucans, mainly 1,3–1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans and others like linear 1,3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans and linear and branched 1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans [

 <sc>d</sc>-glucans, show a number of proven therapeutic properties, including immunomodulatory, anticancer and antioxidant features [

Besides glucans, more complex polysaccharides occurring in mushrooms are heteropolysaccharides such as heterogalactans, heteroglucans and heteromannans. Heteropolysaccharides are characterized by extra variability on their monosaccharide composition, anomeric configuration, branching and linkage type [
