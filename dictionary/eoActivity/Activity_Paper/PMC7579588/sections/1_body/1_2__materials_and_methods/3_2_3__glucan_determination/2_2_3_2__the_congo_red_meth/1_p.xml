<p>According to Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the Congo red method is suitable for the determination of triple helical structures of 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans. The lyophilizates were subject to a three-stage extraction in hot hydrochloric acid (0.6 mol/L HCl), as well as sodium (1 mol/L NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (1 mol/L KOH). Five hundred mg of each sample was used for extraction. The extraction was carried out in accordance with Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After neutralizing the obtained fractions, β-glucan content was determined spectrophotometrically using their ability to form colored complexes with Congo red. The absorbance values were referred to the schizophyllan standard curve and converted into g/100 g dry mass. Absorbance measurements for the tested samples were performed using UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A detailed description of β-glucan determination was published previously in [
