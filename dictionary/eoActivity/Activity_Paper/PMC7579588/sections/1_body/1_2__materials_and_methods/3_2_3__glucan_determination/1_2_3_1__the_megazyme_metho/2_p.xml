<p>The assay involved an initial hydrolysis of the glucans in concentrated hydrochloric acid, followed by quantitative hydrolysis using enzymes and spectrophotometric determination of unbound 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose. 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose content is a measure of total glucan (α-glucan + β-glucan + 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose from oligosaccharides, sucrose + free 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose content. Determination of total glucan content was described previously in [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The α-glucan solubilization, hydrolysis and measurement were performed as described in [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The β-glucan content of the studied mushrooms was calculated from the difference of total glucans (α-glucan + β-glucan + 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose from oligosaccharides and sucrose + free 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose) and α-glucans + 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose from sucrose and free 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose.
