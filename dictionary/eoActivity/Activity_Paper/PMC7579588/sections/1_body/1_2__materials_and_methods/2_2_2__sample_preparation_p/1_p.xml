<p>After cutting, prepared fruiting bodies were weighted for about 100 g per sample of the edible parts (stem and pileus). Then, they were stored frozen (−70 °C) in grip seal bags until freeze-drying. Next, the samples were freeze-dried at −50 °C under reduced pressure of 0.027 mBar using the FreeZone FreezeDry System (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) to a solid dry mass (approx. 36 h). Mushroom samples were weighed before and after the drying process on an analytical scale with an accuracy up to 0.01 g. The freeze-dried mushrooms were ground in a ceramic mortar and stored in a desiccator until analysis in sealed grip bags without air. Next, the samples were extracted for further determination of β-glucans with the Megazyme method and the Congo red method, as described in [
