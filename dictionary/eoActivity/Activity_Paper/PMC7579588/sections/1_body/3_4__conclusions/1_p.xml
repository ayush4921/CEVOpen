<p>In this paper, we report on the content of β-glucans determined with two methods, the Megazyme method and the Congo red method, which allows to determine β-glucans with triple-helix chain conformation [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. β -glucans were studied in 18 species of wild edible Polish fungi, with the aim of comparing them with commercial mushrooms and making comparisons between the species. Furthermore, the percentage difference in β-glucans assayed by the Congo red method and the Megazyme method was determined, as well as quantitative evaluation of β-glucans in acidic and alkaline pH extracts in Congo red method was performed.
