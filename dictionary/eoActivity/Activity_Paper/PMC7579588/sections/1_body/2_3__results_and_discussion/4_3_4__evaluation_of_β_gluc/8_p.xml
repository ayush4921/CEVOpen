<p>Some of the examined mushrooms species were characterized by a significantly lower content of β-glucans determined with the Congo red method. These were mainly 
 <italic>Cantharellus cibarius</italic> (1.946 g/100 g DM), 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> (3.117 g/100 g DM), 
 <italic>Xerocomellus chrysenteron</italic> (5.095 g/100 g DM), 
 <italic>Boletus subtomentosus</italic> (5.138 g/100 g DM), 
 <italic>Macrolepiota procera</italic> (5.461 g/100 g DM) and 
 <italic>Boletus edulis</italic> (5.801 g/100 g DM). Similar results for 
 <italic>Boletus edulis</italic> were obtained by Boonyanuphap et al. [

 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Similar relationships between β-glucans determined with the Congo red in the mycelium and fruiting bodies of mushrooms were observed by Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, the low content of β-glucans in Boletus edulis does not diminish its health promoting values, which result from the favorable proportions of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and biologically active compounds other than β-glucans, such as polyphenols, ergosterol, indole compounds or microelements [
