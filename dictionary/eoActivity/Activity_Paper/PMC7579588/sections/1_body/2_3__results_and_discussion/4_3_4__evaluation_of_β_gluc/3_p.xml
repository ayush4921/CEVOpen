<p>Basic research, which determines the amount of biologically active components in different mushrooms species allows for the selection of species that have a significant content of β-glucans, thus indicating mushrooms whose cultivation for commercial purposes (food and pharmaceutical industries) can be important. Although there are many reports on the biological activity and structure of β-glucans of fungal origin [
