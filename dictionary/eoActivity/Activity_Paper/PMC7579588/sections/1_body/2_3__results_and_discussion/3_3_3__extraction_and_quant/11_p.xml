<p>Toledo et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a spectrophotometric method to compare both quantitative methods for the determination of β-glucans, finding no statistically significant differences between the methods used [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It can therefore be concluded that the spectrophotometric method is as precise as the HPLC method, but cheaper, faster and easier. Considering these features, the spectrophotometric method can be selected as the first-choice method in the evaluation of β-glucan content in mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The content of β-glucans in our research was determined using the spectrophotometric method, and the values of β-glucans obtained were of the same order of magnitude (
