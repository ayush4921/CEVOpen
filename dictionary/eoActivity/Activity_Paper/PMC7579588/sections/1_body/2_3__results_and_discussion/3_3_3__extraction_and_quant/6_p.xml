<p>The immunoenzymatic method (ELISA) is based on the use of antibodies specifically reacting with antigens. In the case of Mizuno et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], solutions of 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans—lentinate and grifolate—were used to produce antibodies. The obtained antibodies were used to determine these β-glucans in several species of mushrooms. The immunoenzymatic method is characterized by high limitations resulting from the specificity of the antibodies, which show high specificity for binding the antigens used for immunization. Some 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans are not recognized by such antibodies produced in this way, which may result in underestimation [
