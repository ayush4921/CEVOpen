<p>The lower values found in the Congo red method may be related to the fact that triple helical structure of β-glucans can be detected with this method [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is known that mushroom β-glucans can have various conformations [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which may not be detected using Congo red. On the other hand, the extraction method might not extract all triple helical β-glucans. Moreover β-glucans can adopt triple helical chain conformation in water solutions and form other structures in polar solutions for example [
