Molecular weight is one of the factors influencing their solubility. Therefore, to isolate β-glucans with a triple-helical structure, three-stage extraction was applied. According to the literature, β-glucan molecules with a high molecular weight show better solubility at an alkaline pH, whereas molecules with a low molecular weight at an acidic pH [
