<p>β-glucan triple extraction method using sodium and potassium hydroxide solutions as well as hydrochloric acid solution was used. This method of extraction and colorimetric determination of β-glucans was validated by Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Semedo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that this method indicates triple helix 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans, and alkaline solvents are more effective to extract highly branched triple helical β-glucans, what was also confirmed by Ogawa et al. [
