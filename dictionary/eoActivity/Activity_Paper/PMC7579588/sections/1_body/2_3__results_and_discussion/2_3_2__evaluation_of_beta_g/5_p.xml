<p>The triple helical structure of β-glucns depends on the degree of their branching. β-glucans with few or without β-1,6-linkages usually have a single helix structure, but 1,3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans with multiple β-1,6-linkages can form triple helical structure [

 <sc>d</sc>-glucans and does not react with other polysaccharides as chitin, chitosan or glycoproteins [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that Congo red binds only Congo red positive β-glucans with the triple-helix structures. However, it should be stressed that the triple helical structures of β-glucans are susceptible for conformation transition in some solvents and under some chemical and physical conditions like very high temperature [
