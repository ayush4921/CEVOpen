<p>The triple-helix β-glucans with high molecular weight show stronger anticancer properties [

Mushroom glucans often form intermolecular interactions yielding complex polymers that are difficult to isolate, but recent studies suggest a simple and effective procedure that allows to separate different glucan structures. de Jesus et al. found that, linear 1-3-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans are insoluble in diluted aqueous NaOH solutions, whereas 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans are soluble [
