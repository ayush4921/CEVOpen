<p id="p0015">Phytochemicals isolated from different natural sources have been observed to be equally potent as compared to different synthetic active pharmaceutical ingredients with superior safety profile and efficacy when evaluated in different disease models. Polyphenols are a class of compounds that have multiple phenolic groups. Polyphenols have been isolated from numerous natural sources like different plants, fruits and vegetables. Their beneficial effects in ameliorating heavy metal toxicity have been demonstrated in many disease models. The polyphenols have been reported to detoxify different organs including kidney via removal of toxic heavy metals like lead [

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and similar free radicals are primarily responsible for development of toxicity mediated by lead and other heavy metals in different organs [
