<p id="p0135">The mechanism of lead-induced renal damage is due to interaction of lead with mitochondrial structures. It causes increased oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. This in turn causes elevation of renal parameters like urea and creatinine. Lead exposure is associated with increase in production of superoxide anion and lipid peroxidation. Lead-induced toxicity may also be responsible for decreased tissue-specific functions of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH). The expression level of these antioxidants may indicate extent of cytotoxic tissue damage to the kidney [
