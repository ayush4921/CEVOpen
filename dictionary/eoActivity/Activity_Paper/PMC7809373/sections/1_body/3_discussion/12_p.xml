<p id="p0180">It was also observed that EA treatment with both high and low doses causes a significant reduction in NF-κB, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, TNF-α, and iNOS activities in kidney tissues this observation is in agreement with results reported in literature. The exact mechanism by which EA causes lower expression level of IL-1β and TNF-α has not been elucidated and needs further investigation. However it has been reported that EA suppress synthesis of IL-1β and TNF-α by inhibition of NF-kB pathway. Furthermore, it has been observed that pomegranate extract containing EA regulates transcriptional activation of many inflammatory biomarkers by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases and NK-kB. EA also downregulates inflammatory genes of molecules like IL-1β, MCP1, iNOS, TNF-α, COX-2, PGE2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). All these observations suggest that EA ameliorates lead-induced pathogenesis in renal cells by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines [
