<p id="p0150">The rise in creatinine and urea levels associated with exposure to lead acetate is an indicator of impaired renal function due to nephrotoxicity. Serum creatinine and urea are specific and sensitive indicators of kidney damage which are considered for assessment of renal injury. Kidney is a major organ in clearance and biotransformation of metals, so it is a primary target organ for metal-induced toxicity. The present study showed a significant increase in creatinine and urea levels in rats receiving lead acetate compared to negative controls. It may be because of degeneration of kidney tissues by necrosis. EA exhibited significant improvement in this aspect. It indicates that EA may possess nephroprotective activity against lead acetate-induced nephrotoxicity. This might be because of its action on generated free radicals, thus maintaining membrane integrity of kidney and protecting kidney from cellular damage [
