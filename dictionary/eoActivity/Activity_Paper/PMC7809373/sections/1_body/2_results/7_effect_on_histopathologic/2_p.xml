<p id="p0125">The negative control group exhibited typical renal structure, composed of an inner medulla with thin fibrous capsule, outer cortex and glomeruli (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a). The positive control group demonstrated structural distortion due to severe necrosis of tubules, separation of tubules, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, distinct areas of hemorrhage (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b). Stroma exhibited a mild to moderate level of oedema in EA50. Glomerular congestion and mild peritubular were observed. Pyramids composed of straight tubules were present in medulla. There was mild to moderate congestion with no evidence of oedema, haemorrhage, inflammation or tubular necrosis (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c). EA25 treatment was responsible for inflammation of cells composed of small lymphocytes. Histological features suggested mild to moderate tubular damage (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>d). The EA treatment was responsible for a significant reduction in histological score.
