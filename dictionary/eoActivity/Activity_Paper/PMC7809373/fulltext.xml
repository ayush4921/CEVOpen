This report aims to address this debilitating issue. A natural polyphenolic compound, Ellagic acid (EA) is having numerous potential medicinal properties. In this present study nephroprotective effects of EA has been evaluated in a rodent model with lead-induced toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Rats were treated with EA doses of 50 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg and simultaneously co-administered with lead acetate (60 mg/kg) for 2 months through oral route. The extent to which EA treatment provides nephroprotective effect was estimated by measurement of serum biomarkers, tissue antioxidants, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, autophagy pathway and histological examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>EA treatment caused significant restoration in the level of serum biomarkers, tissue antioxidants and histological architecture of renal tissue. Treatment with either of the doses of EA causes restoration of pro-inflammatory mediators to approximately pre-exposure concentration. This phenomena is caused by suppression of expression levels of inflammatory molecules like tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), as well as functional expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Moreover, it was also observed that EA suppressed apoptotic and autophagic pathway by reduction of expression of light chain 3B (LC3B) level which are the oxidative DNA damage markers of renal tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be safely concluded that EA provides protection against lead-induced nephrotoxicity to a significant degree.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Apoptosis, Autophagy, Lead, Inflammation, Nephrotoxicity, Ellagic acid.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Autophagy</kwd><kwd>Lead</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Nephrotoxicity</kwd><kwd>Ellagic acid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Acute and chronic exposure to lead is often associated with a deficit of tubular transport mechanisms and corresponding appearance of degenerative perturbation in tubular epithelium responsible for debilitating pathological changes. Persistent inflammation has been reported to be an important characteristic of chronic renal disease and it plays an important role in pathophysiology of renal disorders. This toxic pathway is responsible for a significant percentage of all-cause mortality [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lead exposure causes initiation and development of inflammatory pathways in the body, acting as modulator on multiple levels of expression from genomic to proteomic profile. It affects, among others, expression and activity of enzymes involved in inflammation (such as COX-2) and expression of cytokines (IL8, TNF, IFN&#x003b3;). Lead induced toxicity is associated with impairment of cellular constituents of the human immune system. Altered cellular and humoral immune response as a consequence of lead exposure is mediated by reduction of immunoglobulin production, which predisposes affected population to enhanced inflammatory disorders [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Phytochemicals isolated from different natural sources have been observed to be equally potent as compared to different synthetic active pharmaceutical ingredients with superior safety profile and efficacy when evaluated in different disease models. Polyphenols are a class of compounds that have multiple phenolic groups. Polyphenols have been isolated from numerous natural sources like different plants, fruits and vegetables. Their beneficial effects in ameliorating heavy metal toxicity have been demonstrated in many disease models. The polyphenols have been reported to detoxify different organs including kidney via removal of toxic heavy metals like lead [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Possible mechanism of action of polyphenolic compounds in scavenging of free radicals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and similar free radicals are primarily responsible for development of toxicity mediated by lead and other heavy metals in different organs [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Polyphenols have been reported to demonstrate ameliorative effect against lead-induced inflammatory reactions by attenuating ROS induced secretion of inflammatory cytokine through ERK/JNK/p38 pathways [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">EA is a common polyphenolic phytoconstituent with well documented medicinal properties [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Different studies reported that medicinal properties attributed to EA is possibly due to reduced expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and MCP-1, and down-regulation of MCP-1 mRNA and TNF-&#x003b1; expression [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">As of writing this report, no study has been performed to assess protective effect of EA against lead-induced nephrotoxicity.

The present study was designed to find out protective effect of EA against lead acetate induced nephrotoxicity. Observed results suggest there is a definite dose-dependent ameliorative effect of EA against lead acetate induced nephrotoxicity.</p><p id="p0135">The mechanism of lead-induced renal damage is due to interaction of lead with mitochondrial structures. It causes increased oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. This in turn causes elevation of renal parameters like urea and creatinine. Lead exposure is associated with increase in production of superoxide anion and lipid peroxidation. Lead-induced toxicity may also be responsible for decreased tissue-specific functions of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH). The expression level of these antioxidants may indicate extent of cytotoxic tissue damage to the kidney [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidases (GPx) are important antioxidant enzymes. These enzymes provide protection against ROS. SOD decomposes superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub>-) to produce H<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, these enzyme activities are used to determine extent of free radical generation and assess oxidative stress in cells. It has been observed that lead has a high affinity for SH groups in several enzymes such as SOD, responsible for inactivation of tissue antioxidants. In this present study CAT, SOD &#x00026; GSH activities were significantly decreased in renal tissue of lead-treated group as compared to the negative control group. This suggested that lead acetate exposure induces oxidative stress by inhibiting activity of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, co-treatment of lead-acetate with EA leads to considerably improved function of CAT and SOD in kidneys to a level similar to that of negative control group. A significant and dose-dependent recovery of kidney GSH content was also noticed in EA50, EA25 treated groups in comparison with positive control group. These changes signify ability of EA to reduce accumulation of free radicals and protection it provides from cellular damage [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0145">Lead toxicity causes free radical damage by formation of hydroperoxides, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxides. It can be evaluated by Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as it is the final product of lipid peroxidation. In the present study, a significant increase of MDA level has been observed in kidney of rodents that were treated with lead acetate compared to negative control, which signifies increased oxidative stress in the lead acetate treated group. It was observed that in the tissues of rodents treated with EA50, EA25, MDA levels are significantly lower compared with rodents group which did not receive the EA doses but were dosed with lead acetate. This indicates attenuation of lipid peroxidation by EA. Intense lipid peroxidation caused by lead exposure may be responsible for damage to the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic membranes causing severe oxidative damage in tissues. As a consequence, tissues release lipid hydroperoxides into circulation which reflects induction of oxidative stress. It is known that lead acetate-induced oxidative stress tissue damage could be caused by two mechanisms: increased generation of ROS and by causing direct depletion of antioxidant reserves. As observed in this study, EA decreased MDA level in kidney tissue homogenate caused by lead acetate which signifies powerful antioxidant and free radical scavenging property [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0150">The rise in creatinine and urea levels associated with exposure to lead acetate is an indicator of impaired renal function due to nephrotoxicity. Serum creatinine and urea are specific and sensitive indicators of kidney damage which are considered for assessment of renal injury. Kidney is a major organ in clearance and biotransformation of metals, so it is a primary target organ for metal-induced toxicity. The present study showed a significant increase in creatinine and urea levels in rats receiving lead acetate compared to negative controls. It may be because of degeneration of kidney tissues by necrosis. EA exhibited significant improvement in this aspect. It indicates that EA may possess nephroprotective activity against lead acetate-induced nephrotoxicity. This might be because of its action on generated free radicals, thus maintaining membrane integrity of kidney and protecting kidney from cellular damage [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0155">The hyperuricemia induced by lead acetate is possibly due to over-production and reduced renal excretion of uric acid, and also elevation of endogenous ROS levels. Treatment with EA demonstrated inhibition of lead-induced nephrotoxicity, by restoration of serum uric acid [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p id="p0160">In the lead acetate treated group, the increase in kidney relative weight reflected renal hypertrophy following previous studies. Another possible explanation for relative increase in kidney weight in the lead acetate treated group may be initial DNA replication and proximal tubular proliferation induced by lead acetate. Treatment of rats with EA possibly prevented these events from taking place. These observations suggest that EA may protect kidney tissue from lead acetate induced hypertrophy [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="p0165">Exposure to lead is responsible for stimulation of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages, which lead to synthesis and release of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1b and IL-6. Lead induced toxicity is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells in interstitial space, which stimulate inflammation-mediated apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0170">In our present study positive control group of animals exhibited a significant increase in expression NF-&#x003ba;B, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, COX-2 and iNOS activities.</p><p id="p0175">Activation of JNK-MAPK pathway is responsible for ROS-mediated inflammation in the lead intoxicated rat. Generation of ROS act as a signalling molecule to activate NF-kB, which translocate to the nucleus to regulate the gene encoding inflammation by the release of mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1;, COX-2, and iNOS [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0180">It was also observed that EA treatment with both high and low doses causes a significant reduction in NF-&#x003ba;B, IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, COX-2, TNF-&#x003b1;, and iNOS activities in kidney tissues this observation is in agreement with results reported in literature. The exact mechanism by which EA causes lower expression level of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; has not been elucidated and needs further investigation. However it has been reported that EA suppress synthesis of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; by inhibition of NF-kB pathway. Furthermore, it has been observed that pomegranate extract containing EA regulates transcriptional activation of many inflammatory biomarkers by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases and NK-kB. EA also downregulates inflammatory genes of molecules like IL-1&#x003b2;, MCP1, iNOS, TNF-&#x003b1;, COX-2, PGE2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). All these observations suggest that EA ameliorates lead-induced pathogenesis in renal cells by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0185">Autophagy is a process responsible for degradation of lysosomes by cytosolic components of cytoplasmic organelles. Cellular stress causing events like nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, ROS, protein aggregates, DNA damage, intracellular pathogens, or damaged organelles may stimulate this pathway. Microtubule-associated protein light chains 3 (LC3) which is a mammalian autophagy protein acts as a marker of autophagosomes. Among the four LC3 isoforms, LC3B is the most widely used marker. In this current study, lead exposure was responsible for a significant increase in expression level of LC3B in renal tissues when compared to control group. EA treatment caused reduction in LC3B level and demonstrated an anti-autophagic effect [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p id="p0190">The results obtained from histopathological study supported other findings where only lead acetate treated group was responsible for structural changes in renal tissues such as necrosis of tubules, separation of tubules, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and areas of haemorrhage compared to negative control group. In EA50 treated animals, there was a mild to moderate congestion with no occurrence of oedema, haemorrhage, tubular necrosis or inflammation. In EA25, sparsely inflammatory cells along with mild to moderate tubular damage were observed.</p><p id="p0195">The results of this study indicates lead acetate induced nephrotoxicity might be due to oxidative damage. EA administration along with lead acetate reduced effect of lead acetate induced nephrotoxicity, probably due to the defence mechanism against ROS.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0200">From the current study, it may be concluded that EA may confer significant protection against lead-induced nephrotoxicity through their antioxidant mechanisms from oxygen-derived free radicals. This study will be potentially beneficial for segments of population who are chronically exposed to high-level lead pollution. Presence of EA in diet or its consumption as a supplement may keep kidney of affected people healthy and safe. Future studies need to be performed to establish the hypothesis with clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0205">A.
