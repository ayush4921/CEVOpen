<p>Our finding that an ethanolic extract bark of 
 <italic>C. americana</italic> inhibited 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth with an MIC of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml agreed with the results of Pavan et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], who found that a methanolic extract of the bark inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv with the same MIC (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), thus confirming the presence of compounds with antituberculosis activity in this species. We also tested extracts of young leaves, leaves, flowers, and branches of 
 <italic>C. Americana,</italic> but these had MICs that were higher than 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (data not shown), suggesting a differential distribution of the active metabolites throughout the plant. All 
 <italic>C. americana</italic> extracts also showed activity against DQPknB, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> lower than 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. However, while the lowest MIC for growth inhibition was in the bark extract, the extract with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> for inhibiting PknB activity was from young leaves, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 39.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, while that of the bark was 124.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.
