<p>The search for new antituberculosis drugs continues to be a challenge, but the high incidence of this disease makes it an important priority. In this study, we documented the antimycobacterial potential of some Venezuelan plants for which antibacterial activity has not been previously reported and demonstrated the importance of ethnopharmacological knowledge in the search for botanical sources with biological activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of natural extracts on the activity of the catalytic domain of the 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> protein PknB. Serine/threonine kinases are important targets for anticancer agents [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and have been proposed as targets for antituberculosis drugs. PknB is essential for 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but no drug targeting it has yet been identified. In the extracts, we identified that plant extracts inhibit both 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and the kinase, and it is tempting to believe the same molecules contain both inhibitory activities, but this must be proven when the active compounds are successfully isolated and identified.
