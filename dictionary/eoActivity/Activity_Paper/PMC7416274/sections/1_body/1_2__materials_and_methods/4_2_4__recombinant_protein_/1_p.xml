<p>The 279-residue kinase domain of PknB (DQPknB) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and full-length GarA [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], natural substrates for the PknB protein, were expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3 pLys). Cultures were grown until an OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> of 0.6 and induced by the addition of IPTG (final conc. 1 mM), incubated at 37°C for an additional eight hours and then centrifuged at 1,503 g. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM of Tris-HCl, 500 mM of NaCl, and 20 mM of imidazole, at a pH of 7.5) in the presence of lysozyme and DNase I from bovine pancreas (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The bacteria were sonicated, and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 18,407 g for 15 min. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m syringe filter and then loaded onto a Ni Sepharose™ high-performance column (Amersham) using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. The elution was performed with an imidazole gradient (0.0–0.5 M), and the fractions containing the protein of interest were visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
