<p>The antituberculosis activity of the extracts was determined using the agar dilution method. For this, 35 × 10 mm Petri dishes were prepared with medium supplemented with a plant extract at a final concentration of 500

The extract containing plates on which no growth was seen was taken to indicate growth inhibition, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was established by repeating the above procedure with medium containing 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500
