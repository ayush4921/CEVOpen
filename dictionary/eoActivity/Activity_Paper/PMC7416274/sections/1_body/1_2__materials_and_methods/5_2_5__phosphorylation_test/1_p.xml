<p>Phosphorylation assays were carried out using the commercial Kinase Glo kit (Promega) in a final volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l in 96-well solid white polystyrene microplates. The concentrations of ATP (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), DQPknB (0.056 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and GarA (0.48 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) were standardized using the manufacturer's recommendations. All reactions were carried out at room temperature and were started with reaction buffer mixture (200 mM of Tris, 8 mM of MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM of KF, and 1 mM of DTT), GarA, DQPknB, and the extract (10, 30, 65, 125, 250, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). A negative control was elaborated by replacing the volume of the extract with DMSO. After 10 min, ATP was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min. At the end of this period, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the Kinase Glo reagent, and after another 10 min, the luminescent signal was measured on a SpectraMax Gemini XS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 software.
