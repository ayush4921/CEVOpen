<p id="Par26">Gallic acid, ethyl gallate, scopoletin and maniladiol were isolated from the 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> stem bark extract. These compounds were reported for the first time in this plant species. The four isolated compounds showed in vitro anti-salmonellal activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> serotypes and particularly scopoletin was the most active and highly selective against both non-typhoidal 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and typhoidal 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> with MIC of 16 or 32 μg/mL. The anti-salmonellal activity of the compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> justifies the use of this plant in traditional medicine and confirms the anti-salmonellal effect of the hydroethanolic extract thus adding credence to its use in the treatment of avian salmonellosis. Further studies will be necessary to verify the in vivo activity of these compounds and to elucidate their mechanisms of action.
