<p id="Par23">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> shows the inhibition parameters (MIC, MBC, MBC/MIC ratio) of the crude extract, partition fractions and isolated compounds of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> against pathogenic 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The isolated compounds have variable activity (16 ≤ MIC≤1024 μg/mL) on the tested 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> serotypes. It appears that the activity of isolated compounds is greater than those of the crude extract and partitions. Among the partition fractions, chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions showed the best anti-salmonellal activity while among the isolated compounds, scopoletin showed the highest inhibitory activity with a MIC of 16 μg/mL against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis. MIC values of other compounds and extract ranged between 128 and 1024 μg/mL, while hexane and residual fractions are the less active substances with MICs of 512 or 1024 μg/mL.
