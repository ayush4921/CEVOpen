 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> stem bark was harvested in West region of Cameroon and identified at the National Herbarium at Yaoundé-Cameroon, where a voucher specimen was deposited under the reference Number 16929/SRF/Cam. The air-dried plant material (3 Kg) was powdered and macerated at room temperature with 12 L of ethanol-water system (50/50, v/v). After 48 h, the mixture was filtrated using Whatman №1 filter paper. The filtrate was evaporated using a Rotary evaporator (Büchi R200) at reduced pressure to afford the crude extract (265 g, 8.8%).
