<p id="Par15">The MIC values of the fractions obtained from partition and compounds from 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> were determined in 96-wells microplates using rapid INT colorimetric assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Briefly, each sample was dissolved in 5% Dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO)/MHB. The obtained solution was then added to 100 μL of MHB, and followed by two-fold serial dilution. Then 100 μL of inoculum (1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) prepared in MHB were added to each well except the negative control wells. The plates were covered with a sterile plate sealer and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The wells containing either MHB or MHB and 100 μL of inoculum served as control. After the incubation, 40 μL of INT (0.2 mg/mL) was added to each well and plates were re-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the MIC of each sample was recorded. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample that prevented change in colour and exhibited complete inhibition of microbial growth. The MBC was determined by adding 50 μL aliquots of the preparations, which did not show any growth after incubation during MIC assays, to 150 μL of MHB. These preparations were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The MBC was recorded as the lowest concentration of test sample which did not produce a colour change after addition of INT as previously described. The tests were performed in triplicates.
