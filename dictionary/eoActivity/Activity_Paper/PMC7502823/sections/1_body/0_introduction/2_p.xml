It is well known that biofilms are formed by different species of sessile microorganisms; biofilm bacteria differ in their cellular physiology and their genes when compared to planktonic bacteria. This biofilm forms synergistic micro consortia and enables quorum sensing within the cells enclosed in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) layer, which in turn empowers horizontal gene transfer. These formed biofilms reduce the penetration of antibacterial agents and antibiotics, eventually leading to develop antibacterial/antibiotic resistance up to 500â€“5000 times greater than usual concentrations and host immune defenses [
