<p id="par0075">Cefoxitin disk diffusion (30 μg) method was used to detect the methicillin resistant S. aureus. At the concentration of 0.5 McFarland standard suspension of the isolate was prepared and created lawn culture on Mueller-Hinton agar plate (MHA). Then the cefoxitin disc was kept on the lawn culture and allowed to dry for 5 min. This agar plate was aerobically incubated at 35ᵒ C for 18 h to allow the grow of bacteria and measured the zone diameters. The zone of inhibition diameter is ≤21 mm were considered as methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) whereas the diameter ≥22 mm indicates methicillin susceptible 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) [
