 <italic>In vitro</italic> hemolytic activity was performed by the spectrophotometer method. About 5 mL of human blood (from healthy volunteers with informed concern) was taken for this study. The blood was washed 4 times with PBS by centrifugation. About 500 μL of erythrocytes were mixed with 500 μL of 4 mg/mL concentration of plant extracts; such that the final concentration of the extracts will be 2 mg/mL. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in an incubator. After incubation, the mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant having free hemoglobin was collected and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. As tap water is hypotonic, it can cause the lysis of cells. Hence tap water was served as a positive control; (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>) maximum hemolysis. PBS was used as the negative control; (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>) minimal hemolysis. The extracts were investigated for its hemolytic activity by comparing them with positive and negative controls [
