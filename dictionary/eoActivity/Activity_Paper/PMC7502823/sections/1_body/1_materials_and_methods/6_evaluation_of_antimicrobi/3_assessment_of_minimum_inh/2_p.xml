<p id="par0085">Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the extract was determined by the micro broth dilution method. Different concentrations of plant extract from 2 mg/mL to 125 μg/mL (2000 μg, 1000 μg, 500 μg, 250 μg and 125 μg) were prepared and transferred into test tubes. Then 100 μL of MRSA culture (10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) was added to each test tube and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the samples were analyzed in a UV spectrophotometer at 595 nm to determine the MIC. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that completely inhibits the growth of microorganisms.
