<p id="par0160">The anti-biofilm effect of the extracts was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively by light microscopy and crystal violet staining method at two different concentrations such as 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Light microscopy was used as a qualitative method. In the control, most of the areas were covered with a biofilm comprising clusters of bacteria. Non-aggregation of the cell was observed with the extracts. This qualitative finding was further investigated with the crystal violet staining method by comparing the absorbance between the controls and the extracts. The basic principle of this assay is based on the penetration of the dye into the cell membranes which eventually binds with the extracellular molecule having a negative charge. It also affects the cell surface molecules and bacteria’s extracellular polysaccharides. A significant (P &lt; 0.001) reduction in inhibition of biofilm formation by pet. ether extract of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> (83.8 ± 1.02 %) and ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> (80.0 %±0.86 %) were observed, which is comparatively higher than that of the other extracts. The other extracts showed an inhibition percentage of around 30–60 %. The biofilm inhibition results are shown in
