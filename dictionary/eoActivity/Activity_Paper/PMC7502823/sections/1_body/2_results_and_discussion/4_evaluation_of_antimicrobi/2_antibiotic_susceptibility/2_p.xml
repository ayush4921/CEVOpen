<p id="par0135">Susceptibility testing is performed to assess whether the antibiotics can inhibit the growth of the isolate. The disk diffusion method is the simplest, cost effective and most frequently used technique and it has been considered as gold standard for confirming the susceptibility of bacteria against the antibiotics [
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Presently, vancomycin remains the most important ﬁrst-line therapy for severe MRSA infection; whereas ciprofloxacin is used to treat Gram + ve bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) infections. Therefore, antibiotics such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were choosen and performed the antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion method aginst this MRSA isolate. Vancomycin showed inhibition at 4 μg/disc, whereas ciprofloxacin showed inhibtion at 5 μg/disc. The MRSA isolate was susceptible with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and the observed findings for antibiotic susceptibility testing are shown in
