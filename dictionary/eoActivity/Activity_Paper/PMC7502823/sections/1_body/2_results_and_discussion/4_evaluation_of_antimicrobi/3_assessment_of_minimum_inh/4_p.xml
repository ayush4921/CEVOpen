<p id="par0150">Plant extracts usually have a large array of phytoconstituents. Among the different phytoconstituents, terpenoids and flavonoids are the major groups of phytoconstituents present naturally in plants that possess good antimicrobial properties. The phytochemical investigation of these extracts reveals that these two phytoconstituents such as terpenoids and flavonoids are present in the pet. ether extract of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>. The mechanism of action of terpenoids for its antibacterial effect is predominantly based on disruption of lipophilic compounds in the cell wall membrane which eventually leads to the inhibition of respiration, followed by the blockade in the ion transport process [
