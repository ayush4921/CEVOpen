<p id="par0180">The hemolytic activity of the extracts was evaluated using human erythrocytes, by comparing the optical density of the extracts (Extract + human erythrocytes suspended in PBS) with the maximal hemolytic control (Tap water+Human erythrocytes suspended in PBS) and minimal hemolytic control (PBS+Human erythrocytes). The plant extracts hemolytic activity is expressed in percentage of hemolysis and reported as mean Â± standard deviation of three replicates. The findings revealed that the extracts were non-toxic and have minimal hemolytic activity. This minimal hemolytic activity could be due to the presence of saponins and phenols in the extracts. Besides, saponins alter the erythrocyte membrane and promote the formation of methemoglobin through the oxidation of hemoglobin, which occurs due to the hemolysis by phenols [
