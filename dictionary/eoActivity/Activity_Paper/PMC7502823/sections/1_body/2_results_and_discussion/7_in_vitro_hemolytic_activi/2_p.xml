<p id="par0175">The hemolytic activity provides primary information on the cytotoxicity of the bioactive molecules on the healthy cells. Assessment of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> hemolytic activity by UV spectrophotometric method is an easy and effective technique to assess the cytotoxicity of the bioactive molecules [
