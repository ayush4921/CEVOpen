 <p>Biofilms are multi-species bacterial communities with complex structures that create antibiotic resistance, cause life-threatening infections, thereby considerable economic loss; needed new approaches. Medicinal plants are focused as new alternatives for their therapeutic and antimicrobial effects. Our present study, 
  <italic>Azadirachta indica, Moringa oleifera, Murraya koenigii,</italic> and 
  <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> extracts were investigated against MRSA. The preliminary antimicrobial study showed pet. ether extract of 
  <italic>A. indica</italic> and ethanolic extract of 
  <italic>P. guajava</italic> showed a MIC value of 125 μg/mL and MBC value of 500 μg/mL. These extracts showed biofilm inhibition in the range of 60.0–83.9 % and did not possess any hemolytic activity to the human erythrocytes. The plant species investigated in this study had different degrees of antibiofilm activity against MRSA. However, we suggest that 
  <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
  <italic>P. guajava</italic> are promising candidates and further investigation is needed to isolate the antimicrobial compounds for the management of MRSA and its mechanism of activity.
