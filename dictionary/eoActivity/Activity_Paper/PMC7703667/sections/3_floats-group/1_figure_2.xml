  <p>Growth performance of 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression (OE3) plants. Protocorms 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and seedlings 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were imaged when they were cultivated on MS medium for 3, 30, and 60 days, respectively. For weight 
   <bold>(C)</bold> measurement, during 60 days, weight increment of protocorms from three independent culture flasks were investigated. For height 
   <bold>(D)</bold> measurement, seedlings from three independent culture flasks were investigated after 60 days. Results are presented as mean Â± standard error calculated from three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences.
