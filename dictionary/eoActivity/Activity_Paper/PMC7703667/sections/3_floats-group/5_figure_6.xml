  <p>Resistance of 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression plants to freezing and osmotic stress treatments. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Wild-type (WT) and 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression (OE) seedlings cultured without stress. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Wild-type (WT) and 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression seedlings treated at -20°C for 1 h and cultured for another 10 days. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Wild-type (WT) and 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression seedlings treated with 500 mM mannitol for 20 days. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Chlorophyll contents of wild-type (gray bar) and 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression (black bar) seedlings after freezing or osmotic stress treatments. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Proline contents of wild-type and 
   <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression seedlings after freezing or osmotic stress treatments. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> SOD activities after freezing or osmotic stress treatments. Chlorophyll, proline, and SOD contents were determined by using mixed materials from three independent transgenic seedlings. Results are presented as mean ± standard error calculated from three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate the statistically significant differences (Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
