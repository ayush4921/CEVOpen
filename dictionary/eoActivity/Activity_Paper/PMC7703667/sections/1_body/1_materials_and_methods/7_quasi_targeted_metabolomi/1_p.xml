<p>Metabolite extraction, HPLC-MS/MS analysis, metabolite identification and quantification, and data analysis were performed according to the protocol of the laboratory (Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd.). Briefly, 100 mg stems were collected and ground with liquid nitrogen. Then the homogenate was resuspended with prechilled 500 μl of 80% ethanol and 0.1% formic acid by well vortexing. After being centrifugated at 15,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted to the final concentration containing 53% methanol and injected into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis. HPLC-MS/MS analyses were carried out using an ExionLC AD system (SCIEX) coupled with a QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer (SCIEX) in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Metabolite identification was based on Q1, Q3, retention time, decluttering potential, and collision energy, and Q3 was used for metabolite quantification. The original data files were processed using the SCIEX OS Version 1.4 to integrate and correct the peak. These metabolites were annotated using the KEGG database
