<p>Cellulose contents were measured, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Mature leaf samples (&gt;0.3 g) from 6-month-old wild type and three independent transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seedlings were homogenized with 80% (v/v) ethanol with a mortar at room temperature followed by centrifugation. Then the crude extraction was digested with sulfuric acid. Cellulose contents were determined by using a cellulose detection kit (Suzhou Comin biotechnology, Suzhou, China). Results are presented as mean Â± standard error calculated from three biological replicates.
