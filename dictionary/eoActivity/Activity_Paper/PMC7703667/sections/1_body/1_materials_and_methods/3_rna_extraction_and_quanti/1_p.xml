<p>Total RNA from the wild-type and three independent overexpression lines was extracted using 100 μg of 12-month-old plants by using an EASYspin Plus RNA extraction kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China), and cDNA was synthesized using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, United States). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix and CFX96 (TaKara, Dalian, China) to evaluate the expression levels of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> and its metabolic upstream and downstream genes in the wild-type and transgenic plants. Transcript levels were normalized against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The cDNA was amplified under the following cycling conditions: (1) one cycle of 95°C for 30 s; (2) 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 15 s; and (3) melt-curve from 65°C to 95°C by 5 s per step with a 0.5°C increment. The sequences of gene-specific primers used for the amplifications are listed in
