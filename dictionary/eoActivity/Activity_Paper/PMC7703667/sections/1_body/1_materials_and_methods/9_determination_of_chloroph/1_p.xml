<p>To test the chlorophyll content, fully expanded leaf samples from fresh wild-type and three independent transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seedlings were homogenized with 95% (v/v) ethanol with a mortar at room temperature followed by centrifugation. The absorbance was measured at 665 and 649 nm for chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic>, respectively, using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV765, Shanghai, China). Proline content was determined by using the acid-ninhydrin method, as described previously, with modifications (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tavakoli et al., 2016</xref>). SOD activity was assayed by measuring the inhibition of the photochemical reduction of NBT. Chlorophyll, proline, and SOD contents were determined by using materials from three independent transgenic seedlings. Results are presented as mean Â± standard error calculated from three biological replicates.
