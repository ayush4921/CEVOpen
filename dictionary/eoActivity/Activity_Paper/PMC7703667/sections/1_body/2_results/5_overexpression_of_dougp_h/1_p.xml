<p>It has been proven that mannose is a major component of polysaccharides in 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2013</xref>), and eight cellulose synthase-like A genes (CSLAs), which are likely related to the biosynthesis of bioactive mannan polysaccharides, have been identified in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). As the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> disturbed the expression of genes in starch and sucrose pathways, we wonder if these eight genes would be affected by the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> as well. Therefore, expression patterns of these eight 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> genes in 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression plants were determined by qRT-PCR. Expression of all 
 <italic>DoCSLA</italic> genes except 
 <italic>DoCSLA8</italic> significantly increased in the stem of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A–I</xref>). However, to our surprise, the expression of all 
 <italic>DoCSLA</italic> genes except 
 <italic>DoCSLA8</italic> were decreased expression in the leaves of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5J–R</xref>). These results suggest that by affecting the expression of 
 <italic>DoCSLA</italic> genes, DoUGPase or DoUGPase-mediated metabolism may play important roles in the mannan polysaccharide synthesis network.
