<p>High polysaccharide content may enhance plant stress tolerance (

 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression may confer increased stress tolerance to plants, we performed stress treatments using wild-type and transgenic plants. Freezing or osmotic stress treatment were conducted by treating the wild-type and transgenic plants with -20°C or 500 mM mannitol. Chlorophyll and proline contents and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were determined. Compared to the chlorophyll content of wild-type plants, after freezing treatment, the chlorophyll content of transgenic plants was 0.67-fold higher (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Besides, proline content decreased 0.63-fold, and there was a 0.34-fold decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities detected in the transgenic plants after freezing treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E,F</xref>). After osmotic stress, a 0.59-fold reduced proline content was also detected in the transgenic plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results suggest that the overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> may enhance plant stress tolerance by increasing the polysaccharide content (
