 <italic>D. officinale</italic> has a long history of being used as a traditional Chinese medicine (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2013</xref>). Modern medicinal research has proven that 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> contains a number of bioactive substances, such as polysaccharides, phenols, alkaloids, and amino acids that have been widely used to alleviate rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and many other diseases (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Among these substances, polysaccharides, which are the most important medicinal substances of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, attract many researchersâ€™ attention. Recently, polysaccharides have been proven to have positive effects on the improvement of antioxidant activity and alleviation of colitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and apoptosis (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2018a</xref>). What is more, the bioactivities, composition, structure, and physicochemical properties of polysaccharides from

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>), and a number of critical genes related to polysaccharide synthesis have been characterized as well, such as uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylases (UGPases), sucrose-phosphate synthases (SPSs), sucrose synthases (SuSys), and glycosyltransferases (GTs) including cellulose synthase like A (
