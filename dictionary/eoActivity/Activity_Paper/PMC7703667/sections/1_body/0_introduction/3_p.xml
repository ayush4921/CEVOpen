<p>UGPases catalyze reversible production of UDP-Glc and Glc-1-P and uridine triphosphate (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kleczkowski, 1994</xref>). Studies have shown that UGPases are key enzymes in the synthesis of structural or storage polysaccharides including some active ones such as pullulan (

 <italic>UGPs</italic>) in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> are still limited. It has been known that 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> is universally expressed in almost all organs especially in the stems of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). However, does 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> influence the polysaccharide content or growth of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> like 
 <italic>UGP</italic> genes in other plants? If so, are other genes involved in the process? Are there any other functions, such as stress tolerance, related with 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>? These questions remain to be unanswered.
