<p>In this study, to know more about the function of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>, 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was overexpressed in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, and then, the polysaccharide content, biomass, and stress tolerance were investigated. Polysaccharide content assays indicated that the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> has a positive effect on 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> biomass accumulation and stress tolerance. Our study may provide solutions for quality improvement of the important medicinal plant 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> and contribute to further understanding of the function of the key gene, 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>, in polysaccharide synthesis.
