 <italic>D. officinale</italic> is a traditional but endangered Chinese orchid. As an important component of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, polysaccharide has significant positive effects such as antioxidation, acute colitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and apoptosis (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2018b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In order to improve the polysaccharide yield of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, agricultural and polysaccharide processing approaches such as fertilizer application and optimized polysaccharide extraction and dehydration methods have been applied (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). However, so far, no satisfactory results have been achieved. Since some genes, such as 
 <italic>UGP</italic>, 
 <italic>SPS</italic>, 
 <italic>SuSy</italic>, 
 <italic>GTs</italic>, and 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>), related to polysaccharide synthesis have been characterized, enhancing the expression of these genes may be a direct and efficient solution for polysaccharide yield and quality improvement in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>. Therefore, in this study, we overexpressed the 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> gene of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> aiming to obtain a higher polysaccharide content in transgenic plants. To our surprise, besides the expected polysaccharide content increase, the transgenic plants exhibited improved biomass and stress tolerance, as well, which are important agricultural traits. These phenotypes have not been found in transgenic plants only containing a vector (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>). Therefore, we are confident that the increased biomass and enhanced stress tolerance, along with the increased polysaccharide contents, were due to the 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression. We suppose these improvements were due to the accumulated polysaccharide, which promotes plant growth and enhances osmotic pressure tolerance.
