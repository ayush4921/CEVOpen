 <p>Uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UGPase), as one of the key enzymes in polysaccharide synthesis, plays important roles in the growth and development of plants. In this study, the 
  <italic>DoUGP</italic> gene of 
  <italic>Dendrobium officinale</italic> was overexpressed. The expression of 
  <italic>DoUGP</italic> and genes playing roles in the same and other saccharide synthesis pathways was determined, and the total soluble polysaccharide was also tested in wild-type and transgenic seedlings. We also performed freezing and osmotic stress treatments to determine whether overexpression of 
  <italic>DoUGP</italic> could influence stress resistance in transgenic seedlings. Results showed that mRNA expression levels of 
  <italic>DoUGP</italic> and its metabolic upstream and downstream genes in the transgenic seedlings were increased compared to the expression of these genes in wild-type seedlings. Additionally, most 
  <italic>CSLA</italic> genes involved in the biosynthesis of mannan polysaccharides were significantly upregulated. The total polysaccharide and mannose content of transgenic seedlings were increased compared to the content of wild type, and enhanced stress tolerance was found in the overexpressed seedlings compared to the wild type.
