 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> flower ethanol extract (CFEE) was purified by macroporous resin HPD600, and the polyphenol content in the extract was determined. Total polyphenol content of the crude ethanol extract from 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> was 247.66 mg GA/g, and that of the CFEE prepared in this study was 480.4 mg GA/g. After purification by macroporous resin, the polyphenols content of CFEE was nearly doubled. This result was likely to be the same as 
 <italic>Rosa rugosa</italic> polyphenols in previous report of Zhang et al. [
