<p>Twelve of the 38 flower extracts, including those from 
 <italic>Campsis grandiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Sanchi</italic> flower, 
 <italic>Ple butterflybush</italic> flower, and 
 <italic>Flos Sophorae</italic>, could inhibit violacein production of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04727-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Antibacterial activities of these 12 flower extracts were also analyzed. 
 <italic>Sophora japonica Linn</italic> flower, 
 <italic>Chimonanthus praecox</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dendranthema morifolium (Ramat.) Tzvel</italic> displayed antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026. The purple suppressor ring around the filter paper for these three Chinese herb extracts may therefore be due to a bacteriostatic effect of these herbs on 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026. The other nine flower extracts that inhibited violacein production were considered to be potential QSIs. The crude ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> demonstrated the strongest anti-QS activity and was selected for further experiments.
