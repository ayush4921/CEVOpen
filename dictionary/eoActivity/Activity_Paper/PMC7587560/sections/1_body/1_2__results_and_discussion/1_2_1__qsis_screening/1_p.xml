<p>Thirty-eight flowers from plants used for Chinese herbs were screened using 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> 026. This reporter strain is a Tnâ€²5 mutant of wild-type 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12,472 and cannot synthesize signal molecules itself but can sense exogenous signal molecules. 
 <italic>N</italic>-hexanoyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-homoserine lactone (C
 <sub>6</sub>-HSL) on the surface of the agar plates induces the violacein production of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 in the agar. If QSIs spotted on the filter paper, violacein production will be inhibited, and a transparent, white or opaque ring around the filter paper will appear. The antibacterial activity of the Chinese herb flower extract samples was also detected.
