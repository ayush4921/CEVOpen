<p>QSI activity was checked in the purified CFEE using the agar plate method. When C
 <sub>6</sub>-HSL is dotted on the filter paper, 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 produces violacein to form a purple circle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). While C
 <sub>6</sub>-HSL was coated on the plate inoculated with 026, the entire plate will appear purple (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), and filter papers (Diameter of 6 mm) were placed on the plate to screen QSI. If QSIs are present in the testing sample which were dotted on the filter papers, white or opaque circles will appear around the filter paper on the 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 plate. If a sample induces bacteriostasis, the reporter strain cannot grow, and the filter paper will be surrounded by a transparent ring.
