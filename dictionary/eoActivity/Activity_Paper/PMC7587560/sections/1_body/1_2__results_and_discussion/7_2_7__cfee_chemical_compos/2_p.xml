 <sup>1−</sup> and the fragment ion composition of MS
 <sup>2−</sup>). Organic acids are one of the principal components of CFEE, with four typical organic acids—quinic acid, glyceric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid corresponding to peaks 4, 6, 7, and 9, respectively. The relative content of these four acids comprise 46.503% of the total of 23 peaks. Additionally, CFEE contains citric acid and a small amount of salicylic acid. Verbascoside (Peak 14), the relative content of which reaches up to 26.438%, is the main polyphenol in CFEE. Further investigation on the QSI activity of this component is recommended for future studies. CFEE also contains many phenolic acid compounds, including caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, coumaric acid, and isophthalic acid. Caffeic acid is one of the principal CFEE components, and has previously been reported to be a QSI [
