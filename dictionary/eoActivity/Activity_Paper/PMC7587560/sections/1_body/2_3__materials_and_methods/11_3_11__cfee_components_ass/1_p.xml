<p>Individual phenolic composition analyses were carried out by UHPLC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MN, USA) coupled with the vanquish-flex with a Hypersil GOLD column (2.1 × 100 mm, with 1.9 µm coating layer) (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MN, USA). One microliter of sample was loaded, and the temperature of the column box was set to 30 °C. According to our previous report [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the mobile phase was A: HPLC grade H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.1% formic acid); B: HPLC grade acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation program was: 10% acetonitrile elution for 2 min, then was increased to 50% within 5 min and maintained for 3 min, then was increased to 80% within 10 min, and finally increased to 100% within 5 min. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.
