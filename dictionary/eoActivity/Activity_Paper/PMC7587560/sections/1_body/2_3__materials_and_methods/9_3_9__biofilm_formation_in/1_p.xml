<p>Biofilm formation of the studied strains was determined as described previously [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], with some modifications. A total of 600 μL LB medium containing different concentrations of CFEE (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) was added into a small glass tube, inoculated with 6 μL bacterial strain, and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. After incubation, the medium in each tube was gently removed with a pipette, and each tube was washed three times with 1 mL distilled water to remove unattached bacteria. Biofilm cells were then stained with crystal violet for 30 min. Excess dye was removed with deionized water and the crystal violet adsorbed by biofilm cells was eluted with a mixture of ethanol and acetone (2:1), and the OD590 of the eluant was measured. Differences in biofilm formation were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey′s pairwise post-hoc comparisons.
