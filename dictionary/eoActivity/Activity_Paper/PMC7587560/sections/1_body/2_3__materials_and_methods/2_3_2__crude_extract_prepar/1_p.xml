<p>Dried samples were pulverized with a mortar. Dry powder (5 g) was dissolved in 80% ethanol and treated by an assistant of intermittent ultrasound. The samples were treated by ultrasound intermittently for 60 min, and the supernatant was placed in a 10 mL centrifuge tube and was centrifuged at 4 °C, 4024×
