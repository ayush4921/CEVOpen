 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 was used as a reporter strain to measure the QSI activity of CFEE as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 was inoculated into 4 mL LB medium and incubated for 18 h at 28 °C. The culture was diluted 1:50 into 4 mL fresh LB medium containing 40 nM C6-HSL and CFEE (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) and was incubated for 48 h at 28 °C. A sample without CFEE was used as a control. Cultures were vortexed to resuspend any adherent cells, and 300 μL was placed in a 1.5 mL microtube. Cells were lysed by adding 150 μL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), followed by vortexing for 10 s. Violacein was extracted from the cell lysate by adding 600 μL water-saturated butanol, vortexing for 5 s, and centrifuging at 1611× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The butanol phase (upper layer) containing violacein was transferred into 96-well microtiter plates, with 150 μL per well. The absorbance of the extract was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Bio Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The effects of CFEE were evaluated based on relative violacein production levels, with the control value set to 100%. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as means ± standard deviation.
