 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 is a kanamycin resistant double mini-Tn5 mutant of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472, it can’t synthesize its own C6-HSL, but can respond to C
 <sub>4</sub>-AHL or C
 <sub>6</sub>-AHL to produce violacein. It was kindly provided by Professor Robert J. C. (Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA). 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 was routinely cultured aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 20 μg/mL kanamycin in a shaking incubator (120 rpm) at 28 °C. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 test organism was purchased from Fisheries Research Institute (Shanghai, China). 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 was supplied by Nanjing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Nanjing, China). 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 were used to determine the biofilm formation and were cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C without shaking.
