<p>Bacteria can perform coordinated activities, including biofilm formation, swarming motility, and virulence, and this coordination was previously thought to be restricted to multicellular organisms [

QS is defined as environmental signal sensing system to monitor population density of bacterial, and regulate a set of bacterial behaviors including bioluminescence, biofilm formation, virulence, swarming motility, competence, antibiotic production, conjugation, and sporulation [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157: H7, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> can produce a kind of signal molecule, Acyl hyperserine lactone (AHL), which was named autoinducer type 1 (AI-1), and many phenotypes of them are controlled by this type 1 QS. These phenotypes include the expression of virulence factors, pigment synthesis, and production of degradation enzymes [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, biofilms allow bacteria to resist a variety of extreme environments, including antibacterial substances, high temperature, high salt, and drying [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Biofilms are therefore novel targets for certain antimicrobial agents [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to their anti-QS activities, quorum-sensing inhibitors (QSIs) can eliminate bacterial pathogenicity or enhance their sensitivity to antibiotics without killing microorganisms, and do not lead to bacteria resistance [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, it presents a new strategy for the development of new therapeutics against pathogenic bacteria.
