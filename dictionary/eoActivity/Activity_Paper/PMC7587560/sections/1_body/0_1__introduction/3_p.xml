<p>AHL is a signal molecule (AI-1) that mediates the QS system of Gram-negative bacteria. Recent researches have focused on the development of AHL analogues as QSIs [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and many types of QSIs have been reported. Small molecule compounds extracted from plants have attracted significant interest because of their safety and non-toxicity [

Medicinal plants can provide accessible and relatively cheap herbal drugs, and thus, form an integral part of global healthcare worldwide. The broad acceptability of medicinal plants has generated interest in them as a potential source of new, affordable, and efficacious drugs to treat microbial diseases [
