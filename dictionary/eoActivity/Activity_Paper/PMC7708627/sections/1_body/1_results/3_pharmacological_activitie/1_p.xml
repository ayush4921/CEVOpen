<p id="Par22">Antioxidant activity in the studied genotypes were measured using DPPH and FRAP assays (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the DPPH assay, the antioxidant properties ranged between 1.68 (A6) to 15.55 (A15) μmol TE/g DW. DPPH value of A15 showed not significantly different with A1 (15.43 μmol TE/g DW) at p &lt; 0.05. In FRAP assay, the genotype A1 and A7 showed maximum antioxidant properties with the same value of 1.60 mmol TE/g DW. In comparison, genotype A6 exhibited the lowest activity with a value of 0.07 mmol TE/g DW.
