<p id="Par23">Cytotoxic activities against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines of 15 genotypes of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> extracts are exhibited in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes against the HeLa cell line ranged from 7.33 to 66.25%. In the MCF-7 cell line, the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes ranged from 21.96 to 61.79%. For both cell lines studied, genotype A8 showed the highest cytotoxic activity. The antiproliferative activity of genotype A8 against the HeLa cell line presented not significantly different from genotype A7 (60.37%). Meanwhile, in MCF-7 cell lines, cytotoxic activity of genotype A8 showed no difference with A2 (57.02%), A5 (58.56%), A14 (56.41%), and A15 (56.57%).
