 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibition is used to select the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> varieties with the most antidiabetic potential. The 15 extracts of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves from different genotypes had a different activity to inhibit 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The inhibition activity was varied from 6.28% to 62.84%. The highest inhibition found in genotypes of A2, whereas the lowest detected in A5.
