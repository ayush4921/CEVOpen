<p id="Par21">The results of the phytochemical analysis in ethanol extract of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes leaves are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), rosmarinic acid content (RAC), and sinensetin content (SC) have been evaluated in ethanol extract of 15 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes leaves. TPC varied significantly and ranged from 1.48 mg GAE/g DW to 36.08 mg GAE/g DW. The genotype A15 had the highest TPC, and the genotype A6 had lowest. TFC were observed statistically significant difference at p &lt; 0.05, ranged from 0.10 mg QE/g DW to 3.07 mg QE/g DW among the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes. In this study, the maximum TFC was recorded with A15 and minimum was in A6. The highest RAC (7.25 mg/g DW) was found in genotype A7, meanwhile the lowest (0.06 mg/g DW) was observed in genotype A6. The SC ranged from 0.20 (A13) to 4.02 (A11) mg/g DW.
