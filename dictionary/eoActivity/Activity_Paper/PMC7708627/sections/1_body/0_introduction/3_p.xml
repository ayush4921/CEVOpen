<p id="Par19">The present study was aimed to investigate the leaves phytochemical content and biological activities in ethanol extract of fifteen 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes. Phytochemical analyses included the evaluation of phenolics, flavonoids, sinensetin, and rosmarinic acid, whereas the antioxidant, cytotoxicity and Î±-glucosidase inhibitory activities were performed for pharmacological activities. 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes were grown under the same soil conditions and environment; therefore, the diversity of results was genetically reflected in the various genotypes which studied. 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes were classified based on their phytochemical content and biological activities using correlation and principal component analysis (PCA). This result is significant in the identification of the elite genotypes for developing 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> varieties at a commercial scale.
