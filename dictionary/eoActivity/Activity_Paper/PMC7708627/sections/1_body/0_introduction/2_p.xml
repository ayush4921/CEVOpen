 </sup>. Therefore, in terms of the genotype selected under the particular environmental situation, the most appropriate varieties' development has become essential, which can increase their phytochemical and pharmacological activities. Plant varieties from a breeding program must have stability yield under various growing environmental conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. The assessment of genetic variability among various genotypes is the key requirement in the plant breeding program. Recently, breeders still use genetic and phenotypic performance to select important characters in the breeding program. Microsatellite markers have been used in genetic diversity analyses of twenty-eight samples of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> from Malaysia

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. The diversity of morphological characters were identified in eighteen 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> accessions from Indonesia
