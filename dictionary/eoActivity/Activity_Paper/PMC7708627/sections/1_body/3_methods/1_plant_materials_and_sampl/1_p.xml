<p id="Par36">Plant materials consisted of 15 different 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes, belonging to dissimilar plant height (short, medium and tall), anthocyanin coloration on stem (absent or very weak, weak, medium and strong), leaf shape (narrow elliptic, medium elliptic, and medium ovate), flower colour (white and purple), and maturity group (early and late) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Fifteen types of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> were cultivated in the experimental fields of Tropical Biopharmaca Research Center, Bogor Agricultural University, West Java, Indonesia (6°32′25.47″ N, 106°42′53.22″ E, 142.60 m above the sea level) with the randomized complete block design in three replications. For the evaluation of phytochemicals and biological activities, leaves were harvested at three months after planting. After harvesting, the leaves of each genotype were dried in the oven (50 °C). The powder (100 mesh) samples were extracted in 70% ethanol using the maceration method described by Abdullah et al.

 </sup>, with slight modification. Briefly, 15 g leaves samples were taken and their extraction was performed in 150 ml ethanol for 24 h at 150 rpm rotation speed (Eyela multi shaker MMS-Germany) and room temperature. The solution was filtered with Whatman no. 4. Then, rotary evaporator was applied to evaporate the extracts. To calculate the extraction yield, the extracts were gathered and weighed. Resulted extracts were kept at 4 °C until further usage.
