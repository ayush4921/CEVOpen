 <italic>in-vitro</italic> methods were applied to analyse antioxidant activities. DPPH and FRAP methods were used to evaluate the free radical scavenging and reducing power activities, respectively. Antioxidant activity was expressed as Trolox Equivalent with Trolox (vitamin E analogues) as an antioxidant standard. Trolox was frequently used as an Î±-tocopherol model compound
