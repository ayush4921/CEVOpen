 </sup> with modification. FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 300 mM acetate buffer pH 3.6, 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mmol HCl, and 20 mmol FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> in the ratio of 10:1:1 (v/v/v). One hundred µl 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> ethanol extract was added to 300 µl of FRAP reagent in the 96-well microplate (Costar-USA). After incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured using the microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) at 593 nm. Antioxidant activity was expressed as µmol Trolox Equivalent (TE/g DW).
