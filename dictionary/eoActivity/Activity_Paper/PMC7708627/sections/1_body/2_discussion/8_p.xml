<p id="Par35">Fifteen 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes had phytochemical and biological activities diversity. Genotypes of A11 and A15 produced high total phenolic and flavonoid contents, genotype A7 produced high rosmarinic acid content, and genotype A11 produced high sinensetin content. The genotype A1 and A7 had the best antioxidant activity against FRAP, while genotype A15 had the highest antioxidant activity against DPPH assay. The genotype of A2 had the best cytotoxic and 
 <italic>Î±-</italic>glucosidase inhibition activities. The selected genotypes with different purposes could be developed in plant breeding.
