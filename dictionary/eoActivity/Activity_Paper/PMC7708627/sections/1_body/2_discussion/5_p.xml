<p id="Par32">Cytotoxic activity of 15 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In this work, the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes studied showed cytotoxic variation for HeLa (7.33 to 66.25%) and MCF-7 (21.96 to 61.79%). In both cell lines, genotype A8 recorded the highest in cytotoxic activity. The previous report on the cytotoxic study of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves extracts concludes that this extract is toxic against breast cancer (MCF-7, 53.4% inhibition) and colon cancer (HCT116, 43.7% inhibition) cell lines

 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> extract has also been reported to have cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer (DU145) with no harmful effect against normal fibroblast cell of HSFF 1184

 </sup> conclude that the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> extract had a positive correlation with TPC and TFC. This phenomenon is not found in our results. There is no correlation between TPC and TFC with cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and HeLa. However, MCF-7 presented weakly positive correlation with TFC and SC (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These indicate that the flavonoid and sinensetin compounds are responsible for cytotoxic activity in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> extract. Previous work has shown that methoxylated flavonoids (eupatorine and sinensetin) have contributed greatly to the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> extract

 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> varieties.
