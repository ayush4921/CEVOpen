    "Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. of the Lamiaceae family, called as kumis kucing in Indonesia, is a valuable medicinal plant for their pharmacological properties. The present study comprised of fifteen genotypes of O. aristatus was undertaken to evaluate the genotypes based on phytochemical content and pharmacological activities of leaves ethanol extract. Chemometric analysis (correlation and principal component analysis) was also used to investigate the genetic variability based on phytochemical content and pharmacological activities of O. aristatus genotypes. Results of phytochemical characterization showed that total phenolic ranged from 1.48 to 36.08 (maximum in A15) mg GAE/g DW, total flavonoid ranged from 0.10 to 3.07 (maximum in A15) mg QE/g DW, sinensetin ranged from 0.36 to 4.02 (maximum in A11) mg/g DW, and rosmarinic acid ranged 0.06 to 7.25 (maximum in A7) mg/g DW. Antioxidant activity was tested using DPPH and FRAP assay. Antioxidant results showed that DPPH ranged from 1.68 to 15.55 (maximum in A15) μmol TE/g DW and FRAP ranged from 0.07 to 1.60 (maximum in A1 and A7) μmol TE/g DW. The genotype A8 showed the highest cytotoxic activities against HeLa (66.25%) and MCF-7 (61.79%) cell lines. Maximum α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was recorded in genotype A2 with the value of 62.84%. The genotypes A1, A2, A7, A11, and A15 were identified as superior based on their phytochemicals content and pharmacological activities coupled with chemometric analysis. This finding is important for breeding studies and also the pharmaceutical perspective of O. aristatus."
