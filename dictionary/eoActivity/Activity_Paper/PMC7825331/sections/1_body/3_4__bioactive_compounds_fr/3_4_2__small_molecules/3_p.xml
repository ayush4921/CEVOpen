<p>Many small molecules were isolated from 
 <italic>Hericium</italic> sp. which included two new compounds, an erinacerin V alkaloid with molar mass of 257 g/mol and an aldehyde derivative of 4-hydroxychroman, 4-chloro-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde with molar mass of 206 g/mol [

 <italic>Hericium</italic> sp. which included 2-chloro-1,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzene, (4-chloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) methanol, 3,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4
 <italic>H</italic>-pyran-4-one, 4-chloro-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-(1-hydroxyethyl)isobenzofuran-1(3

 <italic>E</italic>-octadecadienoic acid, and octadecanoic acid from 
 <italic>Pleurotus djamor</italic> [

 <italic>Cortinarius armillatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Most of these compounds have not been assessed for bioactivity and toxicity except orenalline. There were many studies on evaluating the toxicity of orenalline which is considered a nephrotoxin [

 <italic>Ramaria cystidiophora</italic> collected in southwestern British Columbia (Canada) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Ramariolides A was found to have antimicrobial activity against
