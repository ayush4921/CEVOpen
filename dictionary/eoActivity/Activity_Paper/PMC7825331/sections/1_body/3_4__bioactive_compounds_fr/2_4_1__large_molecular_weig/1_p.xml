 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the bioactive large molecules that have been isolated from North American wild mushrooms. A 229 kDa growth-inhibitory heteroglycan GIPinv was isolated from the 5% NaOH extract of 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. GIPinv is made up predominantly of glucose (65.9%), galactose (20.8%) and mannose (7.8%) with traces of fucose (3.2%) and xylose (2.3%) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has mixed linkages in the backbone containing (1→6)-Gal, (1→4)-Glc, (1→6)-Glc, (1→3)-Glc, and (1→2)-Xyl, with branching points at (1→2,6)-Man and (1→3,6)-Man. Another growth-inhibitory polysaccharide, an exopolysaccharide called EPS, was isolated from 
 <italic>P. tuber-regium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. EPS is 3,180 kDa and consisted mainly of mannose (57.5%) and glucose (42.5%). Another study showed anti-proliferative effect of a 12 kDa 130-amino acid containing glycan binding protein (Y3). Y3 is a tertiary protein isolated from 
 <italic>Coprinus comatus</italic> and exhibited selective anti-proliferative effects in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells [
