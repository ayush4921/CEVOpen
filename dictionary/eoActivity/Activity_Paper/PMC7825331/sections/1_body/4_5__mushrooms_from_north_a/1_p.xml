<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, to date 79 species of mushrooms native to North America had been investigated and exhibited medicinal properties. Out of these, 48 species (60%) have bioactivities that have not been previously reported (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These include 
 <italic>A. augusta</italic> with strong anti-proliferative activity, 
 <italic>G. dryophilus</italic> with anti-inflammatory activity, 
 <italic>G. esculenta</italic> with strong immunostimulatory activity, and 
 <italic>H. coralloides</italic> with strong immuno-stimulatory activity [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This also includes 
 <italic>C. tomentosus, G. helvelloides, L. conifericola, L. connata, T. abietinum</italic> with strong activity in antiproliferation, immunostimulation and anti-inflammation [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There were specimens that could only be identified to the genus level, 
 <italic>Inocybe</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Hydnellum</italic> sp., suggesting that they are new species. 
 <italic>Inocybe</italic> sp. showed strong anti-proliferative, immuno-stimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, while 
 <italic>Hydnellum</italic> sp. exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There were 13 species that had been studied elsewhere, but their new bioactivities were discovered in the species collected in North America (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This includes 
 <italic>Haploporus odorus</italic> with antimicrobial activity; 
 <italic>C. cinerea, H. repandum, H. aurantiaca, H. fasciculare, P. nigricans,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> with anti-inflammatory activity; 
 <italic>R. cystidiophora, R. paludosa, T. rutilans,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. chioneus</italic> with anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities.
