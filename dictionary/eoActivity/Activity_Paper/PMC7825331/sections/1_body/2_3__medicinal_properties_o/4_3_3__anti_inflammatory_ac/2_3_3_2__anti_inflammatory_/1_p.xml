<p>Currently, there are very limited studies examining the anti-inflammatory potential of North American mushrooms using animal models. In one study, the polysaccharide AIPetinc isolated from 
 <italic>E. tinctorium</italic> showed anti-inflammatory activity on histamine-induced inflammatory mouse microcirculation model (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 mice) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An intra-vital mouse model was used to determine acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, which is one of the events in inflammation. AIPetinc was able to induce nitric oxide production, reversed the response to histamine and restored the vascular integrity, thereby resulting in anti-inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To determine the significance of the anti-inflammatory activity of AIPetinc, it should be further evaluated in other animal models. In another study, the methanol extracts of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> was found to attenuate histamine-induced inflammation conducted vasodilation in arterioles in the gluteus muscle of mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 41) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory compounds ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide and trametenolic acid had been isolated from the sclerotia of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> available from Haerbin, China [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It is unknown whether these compounds are present in the wild 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> from B.C. and were responsible for attenuating histamine-induced inflammation in the gluteus muscle mouse model [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
