<p>Mushrooms native to North America have also been explored for anti-inflammatory activity. Out of 29 species examined from north-central BC [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Haida Gwaii [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], 26 species (69%) had their anti-inflammatory activity reported for the first time. These species include 
 <italic>A. augusta, C. tomentosus, Clavulina cinerea, G. helvelloides, G. esculenta, Hydnellum repandum, Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, Hypholoma fasciculare, Inocybe sp., L. conifericola, L. connate, Phellinus nigricans, P. atratus, P. ostreatus, R. cystidiophora, R. paludosa, T. abietinum, T. rutilans,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. chioneus</italic>. Extracts from 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> collected in BC, like those found in other parts of the world, showed strong anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. Polymyxin B was used as positive control to assess anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In another study conducted on North American mushrooms, 95% ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>Elaphomyces granulatus, Rhizopogon nigrescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scleroderma laeve</italic> possessed strong anti-inflammatory activity whereas 
 <italic>E. muricatus, Hymenogaster subalpinus, Melanogaster tuberiformis, Rhizopogon couchii, R. subaustralis,</italic> and 
 <italic>R. subgelatinosus</italic> were also active against inflammation. COX-2 activity was assessed to determine the anti-inflammatory potential and NS-0398 was used as a positive control [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A limited number of anti-inflammatory compounds have been isolated from mushrooms native to North America. A 5 kDa polysaccharide isolated from the NaOH extract of North American mushroom 
 <italic>E. tinctorium</italic> was able to induce anti-inflammatory response in Raw264.7 macrophage cells [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A polysaccharide called CDP from 
 <italic>Gymnopus dryophilus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and CDP-like polysaccharides from 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> and 
 <italic>Marasmius oreades</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], can inhibit nitric oxide production in Raw264.7 macrophage cells. Elsewhere, the ethanolic extract as well as two small molecules, syringaldehyde and syringic acid, isolated from 
 <italic>E. granulatus</italic> inhibited COX-2 enzyme in Raw264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The extract caused 68% inhibition of COX-2 at 50 μg/mL, whereas syringaldehyde and syringic acid were effective with IC50 of 3.5 μg/mL and 0.4 μg/mL respectively. The COX-2 inhibition of small molecules was compared with a positive control, NS-398, a known COX-2 inhibitor with IC50 of 0.2 μg/mL (0.64 μM) [
