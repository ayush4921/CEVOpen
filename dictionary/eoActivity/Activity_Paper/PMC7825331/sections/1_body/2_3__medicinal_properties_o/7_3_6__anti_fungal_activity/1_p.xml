<p>Many mushrooms are known to possess antifungal activity [

 <italic>Hericium</italic> sp. collected in Minnesota (USA), showed inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida neoformans</italic>, suggesting its role as an antifungal agent [

 <italic>Hericium sp</italic>. is an edible mushroom containing multiple small molecules, making it an attractive option for further screening.
