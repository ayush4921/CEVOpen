<p>To date, there has been no clinical studies evaluating the anti-cancer potential of mushrooms native to North America. However, there are 600 published papers and reports of clinical therapeutic effects of medicinal mushrooms collected from different parts of the world. Here, we highlight some of the key clinical studies. Perhaps, the most clinically-relevant anti-cancer compounds from mushroom are PSP and polysaccharide-K (PSK). These immunotherapeutic anti-cancer compounds had been extensively studied clinically and have been in use in Japan since 1977 and in China since 1987 [

 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>. A randomized controlled double blinded clinical trial on 68 patients with advanced lung cancer was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganopoly. Patients were evaluated after 12 weeks of administration of Ganopoly. Ganopoly was found to enhance the host immune function by increasing the activity of macrophages, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, suggesting its role as an adjunct [
