<p>A phase I/II dose escalation trial has been carried out using polysaccharide extract from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, also known as Maitake mushroom. The efficacy of the polysaccharide extract was evaluated at multiple doses ranging from 0.1–6 mg/kg two times daily for 3 weeks. Thirty postmenopausal breast cancer patients were enrolled and were sub-divided into 5 cohorts with 6 patients in each cohort. The polysaccharide extract stimulated the immune response at a dose of 6mg/kg [

The study showed a reduced risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients due to high intake of 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> and green tea [

 <italic>Flammulina velutipes, Hypsizigus marmoreus, Corrinellus shiitake</italic> and 
 <italic>Pholiota nameko</italic> [

 <italic>L. edodes.</italic> Eighty patients with advanced colorectal cancer were administered with 15 mg dose per day of SDL for 12 weeks. The SDL formulation, found to be safe and efficacious, reduced the adverse effects of chemotherapy and was associated with increasing the quality of life of patients with advanced colorectal cancer [
