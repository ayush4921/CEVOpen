<p>In addition to the bioactivities described above, mushrooms from North America have also been investigated for antiparasitic, antimalarial and antituberculosis activities. A study conducted in Mexico showed antiparasitic effects of hydroalcoholic extracts from 
 <italic>Pleurotus djamor</italic> against 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> eggs [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], suggesting its metabolites can act as anthelmintics. In the same study, few small molecules with antiparasitic activity were also isolated [

 <italic>Rhizopogon subareolatus</italic> to have antimalarial activity [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They also found the following species to have antituberculosis activity: 
 <italic>Astraeus pteridis, Barssia oregonensis, Elaphomyces granulatus, Elaphomyces muricatus, Hymenogaster subalpinus, Melanogaster tuberiformis, Rhizopogon couchii, Rhizopogon pedicellus, Rhizopogon subareolatus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Scleroderma leave</italic> [
