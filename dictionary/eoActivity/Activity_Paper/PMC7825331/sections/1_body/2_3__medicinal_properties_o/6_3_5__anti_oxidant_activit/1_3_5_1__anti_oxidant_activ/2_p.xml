<p>The ethanolic extract as well as syringic acid isolated from the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>Elaphomyces granulatus</italic> showed potent antioxidant effect on myelomonocytic HL-60 cells with an IC50 of 41 μg/mL for the extract and 0.7 μg/mL for syringic acid. Vitamin C was used as a positive control with IC50 of 0.5 μg/mL (2.84 μM) to compare the anti-oxidant activity of syringic acid and ethanol extracts [

 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> from USA and 
 <italic>P. levis</italic> from Mexico, also showed antioxidant activity. The effective concentration (EC-50) was also determined via DPPH free radical scavenging assay, ABTS scavenging assay, and β-carotene linoleic acid assays where BHA, BHT, α-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid were used as standards [
