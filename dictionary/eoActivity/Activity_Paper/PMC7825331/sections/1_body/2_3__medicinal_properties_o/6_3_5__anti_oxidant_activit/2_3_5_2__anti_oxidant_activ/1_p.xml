<p>As with the immuno-stimulatory activity, there is currently no study on the evaluation of North American mushrooms for anti-oxidant activity in animal models. However, there were animal studies investigating the anti-oxidant effect of medicinal mushrooms collected elsewhere. For instance, since oxidative stress plays important role in the etiology of diabetes, the impact of mushrooms on antioxidant enzymes involved in streptozotocin-induced diabetes were investigated in mouse models [

 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The effect of administration of G. lucidum and Agaricus brasiliensis were studied in rat leukocytes. Streptozotocin was administered intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg body weight to induce diabetes whereas mushrooms were given orally at a dose of 1 g/kg every day for 2 weeks. Mushroom preparations were found to increase the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes [

 <italic>F. velutipes</italic> extracts was studied. Forty eight hamsters were divided into eight groups, six hamsters/group, where one group was given normal diet while others were given high fat diet. 1â€“3% of mushroom preparation was added to their diet for 8 weeks, which resulted in significant effect on lipid metabolism of hamsters with high fat diet [
