<p>North American mushrooms offer a wide variety of medicinal benefits and some have been appreciated for their exquisite flavors. While some are unique and edible, others are toxic for human consumption. Edible mushrooms are valuable as functional foods. Nonetheless, both edible and non-edible mushrooms offer great benefits against diseases. Edibility of mushrooms is an important attribute that allows them to be used as functional foods and potential phytomedicines. Like elsewhere, many edible mushrooms are found in North America.

 <italic>A flettii, I obliquus (Chaga), G. dryophilus, C. comatus, L. edodes</italic> (Shiitake)
 <italic>, Marasmius oreades</italic> (fairy ring mushroom)
 <italic>, Boletus curtisii,</italic> and 
 <italic>Amanita augusta</italic>. Most mushrooms that belong to the 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> genus are also edible and they include 
 <italic>P. tuberregium</italic>, 
 <italic>P. djamor, P. ostreatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. levis</italic>. 
 <italic>G. helvelloides</italic> is edible but it is rather bland and is therefore not much preferred in culinary. One of the most popular wild edible mushrooms in North America is chanterelle [

 <italic>Cantharellus</italic> spp.) described worldwide and the most sought-after in North America is the Pacific golden chanterelle (
 <italic>Cantharellus formosa</italic>) found from northern California to northern BC [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Another popular culinary mushroom in North America as well as in Europe is 
 <italic>Morchella</italic>, the true morels. At least 19 species of 
 <italic>Morchella</italic> had been identified in North America [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] with black morels (
 <italic>Morchella elata</italic> and related species) found in Washington State and BC being one of the most highly demand culinary mushrooms. Lastly, the wild edible lobster mushroom (
 <italic>Hypomyces lactifluorum/Russula brevipes</italic>), uniquely confined to North America, is not a species but the result from infection of 
 <italic>Russula</italic> (mostly 
 <italic>Russula brevipes</italic>) or 
 <italic>Lactarius</italic> genera by 
 <italic>Hypomyces lactifluorum</italic> parasite [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The lobster mushroom, widely distributed in northern parts of United States and in Canada, has a seafood-like flavor and is enjoyed by many locals.
