<p>North American medicinal mushrooms that are considered toxic or non-edible [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] for general human consumption can be tailored as drugs after sufficient toxicity testing and targeted dosage form development. Some of the features that make mushrooms inedible are the presence of toxic metabolites in the whole mushroom, its taste and toughness. 
 <italic>E. tinctorium</italic> is a hard, inedible conk. 
 <italic>P. atratus</italic> and 
 <italic>J. hirtus</italic> are also tough mushrooms and apparently 
 <italic>J. hirtus</italic> has bitter taste. 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic> is considered poisonous for human use. 
 <italic>E. granulatus</italic> is also non-edible. At high doses, 
 <italic>C. armillatus</italic> is considered toxic due to the presence of orenalline [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], a potent nephrotoxin originally isolated from 
 <italic>Cortinarius orellanus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that orenalline is present at low amount in 
 <italic>C. armillatus.</italic>
