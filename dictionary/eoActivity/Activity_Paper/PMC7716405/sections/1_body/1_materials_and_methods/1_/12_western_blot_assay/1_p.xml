<p>Myocardial tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (cat. no. P0013; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and protease inhibitor cocktail on ice and purified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method. A total of 40 µg protein was loaded onto 10–12% gels and resolved via SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane for 2 h. PVDF membranes were blocked for 1.5 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (cat. no. P0252; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature and washed three times with TBS+0.2% Tween-20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies (all from Affinity Biosciences): SIRT1 (1:2,000; cat. no. DF6033), GRP78 (1:800; cat. no. AF5366), eIF2α (1:1,000; cat. no. AF6087; Affinity Biosciences), phosphorylated (p)-eIF2α (Ser52) (1:1,500; cat. no. AF3087), PERK (1:1,000; cat. no. AF5304), p-PERK (Thr982) (1:1,500; cat. no. DF7576), CHOP (1:1,500; cat. no. DF6025), caspase-12 (1:1,500; cat. no. AF5199), pro-caspase-3 (1:1,500; cat. no. AF6311), pro-caspase-9 (1:1,500; cat. no. AF6348) or anti-β-actin (1:5,000; cat. no. AF7018). A goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5,000; cat. no. IH-0011; Beijing Dingguo Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was used to observe primary antibody binding, and then bands were visualized using an ECL western blotting substrate (cat. no. KF001; Affinity Biosciences). Densitometric analysis of the bands was conducted using ImageJ software (version 1.5.1k; National Institutes of Health).</p>
