<p>Total RNA was extracted from cardiac tissues using TRIzol
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), quantified with the T-6 Series UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd.) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Hifair
 <sup>®</sup> II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (cat. no. 11120ES60; Shanghai Yeasen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). RT was carried out at 42°C for 15 min, then 85°C for 15 sec. Subsequently, qPCR was performed with sequence-specific primers using the SYBR Green Master Mix kit (cat. no. 11202ES03; Shanghai Yeasen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). The thermocycling conditions consisted of 40–50 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 20 sec and 72°C, 20 sec. The following primer pairs were used for qPCR: 
 <italic>Caspase-12</italic> forward, 5′-CAGCACATTCCTGGTGTTTAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GACTCTGGCAGTTACGGTTGTT-3′ and 
 <italic>β-actin</italic> forward, 5′-GCACCGCAAATGCTTCTAGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGCTC-3′. Data were calculated using the 2
 <sup>−∆∆Cq</sup> method (
 <xref rid="b18-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) with the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>β-actin</italic> as an internal control.
