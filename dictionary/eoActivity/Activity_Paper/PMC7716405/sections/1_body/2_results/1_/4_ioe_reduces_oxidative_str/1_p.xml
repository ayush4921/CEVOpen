<p>MDA content and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-px and CAT) are key molecules for evaluating the degree of oxidative stress. After MI/R, the activities of these antioxidant enzymes were significantly reduced (

 <xref rid="f4-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). IOE pretreatment (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased MDA content compared with the MI/R group (P&lt;0.01). These values indicated that IOE pretreatment protected cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress.
