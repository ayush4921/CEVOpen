<p>Considering the role of SIRT1 in cardioprotection, SIRT1 expression in heart tissue was examined. MI/R injury could suppress SIRT1 expression compared with the Sham group, which was then activated by IOE (P&lt;0.01; 
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Furthermore, upregulation of ER chaperone GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, CHOP and caspase-12 was observed after MI/R injury in the heart (P&lt;0.01; 
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and C-G</xref>). Moreover, the changes in mRNA expression of 
 <italic>caspase-12</italic> were investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>, the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>caspase-12</italic> in the ischemic myocardium were also notably increased in the MI/R group compared with the Sham group (P&lt;0.01). As expected, IOE inhibited ER stress by downregulating the expression of ER stress-related markers (GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, CHOP and caspase-12) compared with the MI/R group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). IOE decreased the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>caspase-12</italic> in the MI/R-IOE groups (P&lt;0.01). Collectively, the aforementioned values suggested that IOE attenuated MI/R injury by suppressing ER stress, which may be associated with SIRT1 activation.
