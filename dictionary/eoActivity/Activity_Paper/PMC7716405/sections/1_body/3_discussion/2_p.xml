<p>Redox signaling is crucial in the regulation of cell function, including defense against invading microorganisms and gene expression for physiological activity. MI/R induces excessive generation of redox signaling of ROS to break redox homeostasis, which results in oxidative stress (

 <xref rid="b25-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the present study, MI/R injury induced downregulation of GSH-px, SOD and CAT activities and upregulation of MDA content, which were counteracted by IOE. These results indicated that IOE pretreatment protected cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress.
