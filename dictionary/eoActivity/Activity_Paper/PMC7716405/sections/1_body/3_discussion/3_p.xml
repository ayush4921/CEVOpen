<p>Ischemia and reperfusion activate a variety of cell death programs, categorized as apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy-associated cell death (
 <xref rid="b26-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ER stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases and may be a therapeutic target to protect cardiomyocytes. In the MI/R process, ER stress occurs due to diverse stimuli, and then triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Overproduction of ROS disrupts protein folding and results in amplified UPR signaling (
 <xref rid="b27-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Previous evidence has suggested that UPR is initially activated by three endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors, serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (
 <xref rid="b28-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). GRP78, an immunoglobulin binding protein, physically binds to these proteins and inhibits their activities under a steady state (
 <xref rid="b29-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). PERK, also known as eukaryotic initiation factor 2α protein kinase 3, interacts with and phosphorylates eIF2α (
 <xref rid="b30-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Under ER stress, PERK dissociates from GRP78 and induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α. The PERK/eIF2α signaling pathway can limit protein translation and induce apoptosis by inducing CHOP expression (
 <xref rid="b31-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Caspase-12 localizes in the ER and is a critical mediator in ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating other caspases (
 <xref rid="b32-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Caspase-12 specifically clears pro-caspase-9 for activation and caspase-9 is active. Subsequently, caspase-9 ultimately activates caspase-3, the major effector caspase for apoptosis (
 <xref rid="b33-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the present study, MI/R injury induced ER stress in rat cardiomyocytes. It was found that IOE pretreatment significantly decreased the expression of GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, CHOP and caspase-12 and the mRNA levels of
