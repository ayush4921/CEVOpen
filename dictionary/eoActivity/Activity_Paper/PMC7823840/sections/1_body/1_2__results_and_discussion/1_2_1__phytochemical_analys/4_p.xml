<p>Our results showed a high polyphenols content, better extracted in methanol than in ethanol 70%. The results are comparable to previous screenings on chicory aerial parts methanol extracts by Jasim et al. with a TPC of 20.4 ± 0.11 mg GAE/g d.w. [

Another study of Shad et al. reported values of 20.90 ± 0.21 mg GAE/g for methanol stems extract and 25.20 ± 0.26 GAE/g for methanol leaves extract. Jancic et al. obtained lower results in ranges of 1.05 ± 0.02 to 3.73 ± 0.04 mg GAE/g for methanol/trifluoroacetic acid extract of leaves [
