<p>The antioxidant capacity was assessed by two in vitro methods: 2,2–diphenyl-picrylhydrazil (DPPH
 <sup>●</sup>) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> assay is based on the capacity of antioxidant to scavenge free radicals, whereas the FRAP assay is based upon ferric ion reducing activity. Although both assays evaluate the antioxidant activity, the comparison of results can give different outcomes based upon the choice of method [
