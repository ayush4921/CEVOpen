<p>Myocardial ischemia (MI) is characterized by the imbalance between the coronary blood supply and the quantities of oxygen required for the proper function of the heart [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The blood flow reduction leads to tissue hypoxia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death. For our experiment an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia model was used. ISO is a non-selective β1 and β2 adrenergic agonist, with a positive chronotrope and inotrope effect causing tachycardia and systolic blood pressure increase, predisposing the subject to cardiac arrhythmias. On myocardial β1 receptors it also has a pronounced positive effect. In the peripheral circulation ISO acts on arteriolar smooth muscle β2 receptors causing mild vasodilatation, with diastolic blood pressure decrease [

 <sup>++</sup> charge, and oxidative stress. The oxidative stress results from several metabolic products of isoproterenol, and free radicals from the injured tissue [
