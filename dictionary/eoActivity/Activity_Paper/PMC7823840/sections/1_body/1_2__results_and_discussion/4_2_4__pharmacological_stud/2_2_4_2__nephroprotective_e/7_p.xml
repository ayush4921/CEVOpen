<p>In AKI animals, oxidative stress was reduced by the 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> tincture by lowering TOS, OSI, and NOx, plus by increasing TAC, in a reversed concentration-dependent way, CHT 1:1 having the lowest antioxidant activity. The 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> tincture did not influence lipids peroxidation and thiols because the samples had no important effect on MDA and SH.
