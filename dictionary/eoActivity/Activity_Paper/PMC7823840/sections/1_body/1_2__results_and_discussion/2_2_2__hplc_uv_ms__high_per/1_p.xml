<p>In this study polyphenolic compounds were analyzed by HPLC-MS (High-performance liquid chromatography - Mass spectrophotometer) with the purpose of evaluating the qualitative and quantitative composition of the Cichorii herba methanolic extract and tincture. Two HPLC-MS methods were employed, the first for the general quantification of polyphenolic compounds and a more specific method for the quantification of cichoric acid.</p>
