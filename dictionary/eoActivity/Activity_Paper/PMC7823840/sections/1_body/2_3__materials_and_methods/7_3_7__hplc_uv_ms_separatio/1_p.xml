<p>The analysis was conducted using an Agilent Technologies 1100 HPLC Series system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with G1322A degasser, G13311A binary gradient pump, column thermostat, G1313A auto sampler and G1316A UV detector. The HPLC system was coupled to an Agilent 1100 mass spectrometer (LC/MSD Ion Trap SL). A reverse-phase analytical column (Zorbax SB-C18 100 × 3.0 mm i.d., 3.5 μm particles) was used for the separation at the work temperature of 48 °C. The detection of the compounds was performed in both UV and MS mode The MS system functioned using an electro spray ion source in negative mode. ChemStation and Data Analysis software from Agilent were used for the chromatographic data processing. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 5 µL. The MS traces/spectra of the analyzed samples obtained in the experiment were compared to spectra from library, which allowed positive identification of compounds. The UV trace was used for quantification of identified compounds from MS detection. The limit of quantification for the compounds was 0.5 μg/mL, and the limit of detection was 0.1 μg/mL. The detection limits were calculated as minimal concentration producing a reproductive peak with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. Quantitative determinations were performed using an external standard method. Calibration curves in the 0.5–50 μg/mL range with good linearity (R

 <italic>C. intybus</italic> extracts was performed using a newly developed procedure of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection. This method is characterized by rapid analysis (&lt;1 min per sample), and high specificity due to mass spectrometry detection. The stock solution of cichoric acid (1 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving the reference standard in methanol and was used to prepare calibration standards with concentrations of 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 7.5, and 15 μg/mL (three control standards 0.75, 3.0, and 15 μg/mL were used to assess the precision and accuracy of the method). Bidistilled water was used in order to prepare the calibration standards. The mobile phase consisted in 95/5 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) ammonium acetate, 1 mM in water and acetonitrile, isocratic elution, and mobile phase flow rate of 1 mL/min. The mass spectrometer operated in negative mode and nitrogen was used as a nebulizing and dry gas. The nebulizer was positioned at 65 psi with the dry gas flow at 12 L/min at 350 °C. The mass spectrometer recorded the specific transition of cichoric acid

 <italic>m/z</italic> 293 + 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 311. Cichoric acid had a time of retention of 0.51 min. The concentration of cichoric acid was determined automatically using peak area and the external standard method by the instrument data system (Quant Analysis 1.7 software, Brucker Daltonics, Darmstadt, Germany). Linear regression was used in order to obtain the calibration curve using a 1/Y2 weighting scheme. The lower limit of quantification was established at 0.75 μg/mL. At quantification limit, the method precision (expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) %) was 6.8%, and accuracy (expressed as relative difference between obtained and theoretical concentration, bias %) was 5.3%, respectively (R
