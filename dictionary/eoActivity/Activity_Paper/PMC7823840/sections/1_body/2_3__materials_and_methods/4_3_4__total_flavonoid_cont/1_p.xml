<p>The TFC of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> extracts was determined spectrophotometrically using AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> as a color reagent. In summary, 10 mL of each extract were diluted to 25 mL using methanol, 5 mL were mixed with sodium acetate (5.0 mL, 100 g/L), aluminium chloride (3.0 mL, 25 g/L), and further diluted with methanol up to 25 mL in a calibrated flask [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The absorbance was measured at 430 nm and the results were expressed as rutin equivalents (RE)/g dry plant material (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999). All experiments were realized in triplicate.
