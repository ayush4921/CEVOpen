<p>The TPC of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> extracts was spectrophotometrically determined by Folin-Ciocâlteu method with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Briefly, 2 mL of both methanol and ethanol extracts were diluted in a 25 mL calibrated flask with the same solvent. 2 mL of each solution were mixed with 1 mL Folin-Ciocâlteu reagent, 10 mL of distilled water and diluted to 25 mL with a solution of sodium carbonate (290 g/L). The samples were stored in darkness for 30 min., and then the absorbance was measured at 760 nm using a Cary 60 ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer from Agilent Technologies (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999). TPC was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry plant material [
