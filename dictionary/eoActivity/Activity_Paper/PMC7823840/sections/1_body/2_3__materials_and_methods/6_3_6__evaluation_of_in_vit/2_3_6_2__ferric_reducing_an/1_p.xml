<p>The FRAP method is a spectrophotometric method that evaluates the antioxidant capacity of the samples based on the reduction of the ferric complex2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine(Fe(II)-TPTZ) to ferrous complex (Fe(III)-TPTZ) determining a variation of the color that can be measured [

The FRAP reagent consists of a mixture between 2.5 mL of 10 mM TPTZ solution in 40 mM HCl mixed with 2.5 mL 20 mM ferric chloride solution and 25 mL of acetate buffer at a pH of 3.6. A volume of 4 mL of each ME and EE extract were diluted with water to 1.8 mL and mixed with 6 mL of FRAP reagent (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.992). Trolox was used as reference. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm [
