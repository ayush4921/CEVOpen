<p>TOS was assessed using a colorimetric method based on the oxidation of a ferrous ion to a ferric ion in the presence of various oxidant species [
 <xref rid="B94-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The results were expressed in µmol H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> equiv/L. TAC was measured using a colorimetric assay described by Erel and expressed as mmol Trolox equiv./L. [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. OSI was calculated representing the ratio between TOS and TAC [
