<p>The caffeic acid derivates content (CADC) of CHME and CHT was determined spectrophotometrically using Arnow reagent. Briefly, 10 mL of both extracts were diluted with methanol at 25 mL in a volumetric flask, from which 5 mL were taken and diluted with ethanol 50% at 10 mL. 1mL of this solution was mixed with 1 mL of HCl 0.5 N, 1 mL of Arnow reagent and 1 mL NaOH 1 N and further diluted to 10 mL [

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.994). All determinations were realized in triplicate.
