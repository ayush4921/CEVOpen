<p>The Romanian chicory, 
 <italic>C. intybus,</italic> was the subject of this research, offering data regarding the chemical composition and biological properties. Among the compounds identified by HPLC-UV-MS assay, the major polyphenol was cichoric acid, in both methanol extract and tincture The antioxidant capacity was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo with different outcomes related to polyphenols total content suggesting complex relationships between the compounds. The cardioprotective and nephroprotective properties were investigated through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms on rats, revealing promising results in treating acute myocardial ischemia and acute renal failure in rats. Our findings give new directions for further studies in order to extend the scientific basis for the therapeutic uses of an indigenous species.
