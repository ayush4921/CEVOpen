<p>In the medical literature, many experimental studies regarding the pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> extracts have been undertaken to asses pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial [

For example, compounds from ethyl acetate chicory roots extract were found to inhibit in vitro tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) that is linked to cyclooxygenase induction and suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory factor prostaglandin E2 in human colon carcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Low mass molecular compounds from methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> roots showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect against gingival inflammation at a cellular level by inhibition of pathogen bacteria development [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>C. radix</italic> ethanol extract were tested successfully on a carrageen-induced rat paw edema model showing a possible mechanism based upon the inhibition of cytokines [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Only a few clinical studies have been reported that include 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> extracts. Chicory was established as a hepatoprotective (whole plant extract, as an ingredient of a combined herbal-based drug, namely Liv-52), by reducing serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) and so the ascites and Child–Pugh scores [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The positive results of a pilot study showed that 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> roots extract has a potential role in the management of osteoarthritis [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Within 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> composition, cichoric acid stands out, being one of the polyphenol acids with highest concentration, especially in aerial parts [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cichoric acid represents a promising polyphenol that offers unexplored potential in various disorders because of its properties, such as, antimicrobial anti-inflammatory, lowering blood glucose, vasorelaxant, anti-tumor, anti-obesity etc. [
