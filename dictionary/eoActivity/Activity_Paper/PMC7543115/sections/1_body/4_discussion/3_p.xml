<p>Urinile is a polyherbal drug prepared from 4 different medicinal plants extract and all the individual plants extract exhibited significant antioxidant potentials and XO inhibitory activities. On preparing the polyherbal formulations of these plants extract, the synergistic effect of all the included plants extract have much better potential against gouty arthritis than the individual plants extract. It has been reported in the literature that all the plants extract have high content of flavonoids and phenolic compounds with significant potential to inhibit XO and lowers down the uric acid concentration in blood.

 </sup> Due to the presence of active metabolites in plants, urinile drug has the uric acid lowering effect in hyperuricemic gouty arthritis patients. Bilal et al. in their study prepared the polyherbal formulation of medicinal plants and evaluated their antihyperuricemic potential in rats. They found marked hypouricemic effect of polyherbal drug in potassium oxonate induced hyperuricemia.

 </sup> Similarly, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> and its main phytoconstituents have been reported in published literature. The main phytochemicals of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> are alkaloids, phenolic compounds, organic acids and flavonoids.
