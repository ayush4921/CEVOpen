 </sup> Presently there is new pattern to utilize natural drug on account of their capability to cure with less or no side effects. Therapeutic plants having calming, uricosuric and xanthine oxidase inhibitory effects are utilized in gouty joint inflammation.

 </sup> Despite the fact that allopurinol is most commonly used for the management of gouty joint inflammation however this resulted certain side reactions, for example, skin rashes, feelings of queasiness and regurgitation.

 </sup> Along these lines, herbal coded formulations have been formulated that contains ingredients whose synergistic calming, uricosuric effects and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity have been accounted.

 </sup> Randomized controlled clinical preliminary study was carried out to evaluate the comparative therapeutic potential of urinile and allopurinol in patients with gouty joint inflammation. The study results showed reduction in serum uric acid concentration from &gt;8 mg/dl to &lt;6 mg/dl in patients treated with urinile. This 18 weeksâ€™ investigation exhibited that treatment with Urinile essentially decreased the serum uric acid concentration to &lt;6.0 mg/dl in 91% patients. Conversely, the extent of patients reacting to allopurinol was 78%. The findings presented here demonstrate that Urinile has more potential to inhibit xanthine oxidase enzyme than Allopurinol for the management of gouty arthritis. Urate-lowering response to Urinile (300 mg) twice a day was stronger than the reaction to regularly utilized dosages of allopurinol. Keeping up a mean serum uric acid concentration of between 4.5 and 5.0 mg/dl is the ideal range to stay away from a flare of intense joint pain. In our study, when serum uric acid concentration was decreased to &lt;6 mg/ml, the side effects of gouty joint pain were significantly decreased. Our observations are in accordance with the published reports on the use of herbal products to treat gouty arthritis

 </sup> that hyperuricemia has a solid relationship with relative danger of death in coronary illness, hypertension, stroke, liver infection as well as kidney failure, showing that elevated serum uric acid is a significant hazard factor for decreased life expectancy.
