<p>Xanthine oxidase activity of individual plants extract and Urinile was evaluated through xanthine oxidase inhibition assay. Each plant extract was assayed for the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity at 25, 50, 100, 200 Âµg ethanolic plants extract, urinile and allopurinol dissolved per mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dose dependant inhibition of xanthine oxidase enzyme was observed. IC50 values were calculated through the linear regression analysis of the standard plot by percentage inhibition of enzyme against varying concentrations. Percentage xanthine oxidase inhibition and IC50 values of the tested samples were given in
