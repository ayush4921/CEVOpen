 </sup> Briefly the mixture of plants extract (0.5 mL), distilled water (2 mL) and 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> was incubated for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature followed by the addition of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.15 mL) and 4% NaOH making the total volume of the mixture upto 5 mL by adding methanol. The reaction absorbance was measured at 510 nm after 15 min incubation at room temperature. TPC was expressed as Âµg equivalent of catechin per g of plants extract.
