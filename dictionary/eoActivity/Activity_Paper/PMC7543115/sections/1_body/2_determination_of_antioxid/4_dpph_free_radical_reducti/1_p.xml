 </sup> Briefly, 1 mL DPPH solution (0.004%) was mixed with plants extract (3 mL) and the mixture was incubated in dark for 30 min. The optical density measured at 517 nm was inversely related to the free radical scavenging action. Ascorbic acid was used as standard and reagent blank as control. The percent inhibition of DPPH free radicals by the sample was calculated by formula:
