<p>Despite all these aforementioned uses of this plant, especially its anti-fertility effects, there is still insufficient data regarding its toxicological effects on vital organs of the body. Therefore, toxicity screening of the root extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> is of utmost importance (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Lipnick et al., 1995</xref>). The aim of this study is to determine the acute toxicity of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> (MEAA) on selected organs, via blood chemistry and histopathological analysis using female Sprague-Dawley rats.
