<p>In this study, root extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW, 300 mg/kg BW and 2,000 mg/kg BW according to OECD guideline 423 (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2001</xref>). Findings showed that there were no abnormal changes in the general appearance and no alteration in the behaviour of animals in all treated groups. In addition, zero mortality rate was also recorded even in rats treated with the higher dose of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> (2,000 mg/kg BW). The mean percentage weight gain of rats in untreated control group was 25.55%, which is higher than the reported weight gain in treated groups, this could explain the traditional uses of this plant as anti-diabetic and anti-obesity agent. This result is in line with reports of 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Okolie (2014)</xref>, in which 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> among many plants have been screened for the anti-diabetic property and has shown to be effective in blood sugar reduction to significant level (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Okolie, 2014</xref>). In our study, the effect of methanolic extracts on biochemical indices revealed a non-significant increase in ALP and decrease in uric acid. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that mainly released into blood circulation by the liver and bones and higher concentrations may be as a result of the mild liver damage caused by 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic>. Histopathology findings of the liver confirmed this result and showed only congestion with mildly swollen hepatocytes and occasional binucleation. On the other hand, uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides and an increase in the excretion of uric acid from the blood into the urine can lead to lower blood concentrations of uric acid. Nonetheless, further investigation is needed to study the exact mechanism on how root extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> can lead to hypouricemia. Other serum biochemical parameters such as ALT, AST, Cr, Urea and total protein were not affected.
