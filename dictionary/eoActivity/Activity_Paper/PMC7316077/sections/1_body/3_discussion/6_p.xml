<p>The effective doses of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> have been reported in the literature and varies from one study to another depends on the experimental model. As example, the antifertility of aqueous root extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> in Albino rats has been identified at 300 mg/kg BW (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Geremew, Yalemtsehay &amp; Eyasu, 2006</xref>), while the anti-conception dose in Wister rats has been reported at 300 mg/kg BW (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Okello, David &amp; Oloro, 2019</xref>). The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effective dose of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> in Swiss albino rat has been confirmed at doses less than 1,000 mg/kg BW (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Another study has suggested the anti-inflammatory dose of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> in Swiss albino rat is 1,264 mg/kg BW (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2012</xref>). All these pharmacological effective doses are still less than the maximum safe dose (2,000 mg/kg). Since 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> is commonly used in traditional medicine and can be investigated further as a potential source of useful bioactive compounds for several reproductive uses in human, therefore our study can be used as basis for the safety profile of this plant. The present study has some limitations such as the test was only carried out using crude extract and investigated in one animal species. The isolation of the active components in the extract will be the basis for future studies on the effect of this extract on uterine tissue and other organs.
