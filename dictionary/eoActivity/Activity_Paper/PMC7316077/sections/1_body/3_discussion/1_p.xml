<p>In this study, the laboratory processed dried form of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> was extracted using methanol, with the percentage yield of 9.6% of the initial weight. This resulting yield of extract was better than that previously reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Moshi et al. (2003)</xref> where it was observed that the dry product of extraction yielded only 1â€“2% of initial material. Acute toxicity study is invariably the first step at initial stage in almost all screening investigation of herbal medicine of unknown potential. Most acute toxicity data are then used to predict safe dose limit in clinical application because some herbs exert harmful effects even at very low doses to sensitive tissues and organs in the body. Hence, multiple dose studies are considered as one of the most valuable tools used in evaluating the biosafety profile of medicinal plants (
