 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2001</xref>). Fifteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into five groups of three rats each. The animals were selected and assigned with permanent marker to permit individual identification, kept in their cages for at least seven days with close observation prior to dosing to allow for acclimatization to the laboratory conditions and for detection of any noticeable abnormal behaviour. The rats were fasted for 4Â h before administration of extract, but water was allowed

Group I served as normal control, administered with distilled water; groups II, III, IV, and V were orally administered crude extract dissolved in distilled water at 5 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW, 300 mg/kg BW and 2000 mg/kg BW by intragastric route using a gavage method. The doses were selected according to OECD guideline No. 423 (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2001</xref>). Wellness parameters of animals were observed continuously during the first 30 min, 60 min, and periodically for the next twenty-four hours and then daily for fourteen days. All observations were systematically recorded.
