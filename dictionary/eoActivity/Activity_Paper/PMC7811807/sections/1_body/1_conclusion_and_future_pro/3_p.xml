<p>It has been reported in the literature that the plant possessed natural anti-oxidants such as flavonoids, which strengthened the muscles and delayed the aging in clinical trials. However, extensive research is still required for the standardization and validation of the plant as an anti-aging agent. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are usually used for the anti-nociceptive effect with side effects such as gastric ulcers. It has been discussed in the literature that plant extracts are beneficial in ulcers with anti-inflammatory potential. Further studies of the plant extracts will provide us the safer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with ulcer curing potential. The roots of the plant showed potential against obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the active phytochemicals responsible for this activity are still unknown. Thus, there is a dire need to isolate phytochemicals for the development of commercial formulations for the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The plant parts have also been appraised for clinical trials such as male infertility, antianxiety, bone and muscle strengthening potential, hypolipidemic, and antidiabetic. Further clinical trials of different extracts of the plant are required for the development of economical and safer drugs. </p>
