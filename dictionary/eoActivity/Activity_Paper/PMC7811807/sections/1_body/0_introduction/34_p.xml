<p>Withaferin A extracted and purified from 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by targeting cysteine-179 IKKβ and inhibiting NFκβ activation. The results were comparable to that of the standard drug, hydrocortisone sodium succinate (

The anti-inflammatory potential of the plant might also be due to lymphocyte proliferation and delayed hypersensitivity depending upon the inflammation model, such as adjuvant-induced arthritis, carrageenan-induced, and cotton pellet granuloma inflammation model (
