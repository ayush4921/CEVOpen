<p>Another investigation was focused on the anti-apoptotic activity of the plant in Wistar rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The mechanism behind the process involved the up-regulation of BCl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) and down-regulation of Bax, pro-apoptotic protein (

It was discovered that the extract had significant cardioprotective ability in ischemia and reperfusion injuries with reduced infarct size (
