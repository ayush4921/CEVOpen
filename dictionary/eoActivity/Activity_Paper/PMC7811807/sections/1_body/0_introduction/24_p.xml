<p>Snake venom consists of myo, neuro, cyto, and enzymatic-toxins (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). Recently, antidote properties of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> are reported against toxicity induced by arsenic (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Hyaluronidases enzyme present in snake venom helped the dispersal of toxins in the extracellular matrix of the tissues in victims. A glycoprotein extracted from 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> acted as a hyaluronidase inhibitor against the venom of 
 <italic>Naja naja </italic>(cobra) and 
 <italic>Daboia russelii </italic>(viper) when studied using the zymogram assay. The extracts also inhibited the activity of phospholipase A-2 (an enzymatic toxin) present in cobra venom (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). In another research, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (whole plant) neutralized the PLA-2 induced toxic effects from the venom of 
 <italic>Naja naja </italic>(
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>).
