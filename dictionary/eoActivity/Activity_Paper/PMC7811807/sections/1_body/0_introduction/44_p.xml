<p>Later on, in 2002, Davis and Kuttan noted the enhanced proliferation rate of lymphocyte, thymocyte, and bone marrow after administration of plant powder at a dose rate of 20 mg/dose/animal to splenocyte which was pre-treated with PHA and Con A mitogens (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> inhibited the growth of cancerous cells in the central nervous system, lungs, breasts, and colon cell lines. It was investigated that withaferin A significantly reduced the growth of breast and colon cancer cell lines more effectively than famous anticancer drug doxorubicin (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> showed exceptional antileukemic activity. The antileukemic activity of withanolide D was mediated by ceramide accumulation after activation of 
 <italic>N</italic>-SMase2 which in turn enhanced the apoptotic activity of neoplastic cells (
