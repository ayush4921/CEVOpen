<p>Chloroform and aqueous extracts of leaves were investigated for inhibition of cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle seizure at Go/G1 and G2/M phase and limiting the expression of regulatory proteins. Both extracts controlled the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin protein (IL-1β, IL-6) with a reduction in the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species by down-regulating the NFκβ and activator protein 1. Extracts also restricted the migration of active microglia with the down-regulatory expression of metalloproteinase. The extracts were also investigated effective in suppressing neuroinflammation and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (

Alcoholic extract of the roots displayed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting edema when administered at a dose of 12–25 g/kg of body weight in albino rats. It was concluded that a single dose of withaferin A showed prominent anti-inflammatory activity even after 4 hr of administration (

It was found that extract (1.0 g/kg of body weight) was as effective as phenylbutazone (50 mg/kg of body weight) and hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg of body weight) (

Fresh leaves of the plant were extracted with methanol and water to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity in adult zebrafish of equal size and weight using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The extracts inhibited TNFα channel in zebrafish due to phenolic acids and flavonoids (
