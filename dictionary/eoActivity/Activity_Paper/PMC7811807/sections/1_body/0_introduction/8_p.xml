<p>Methanolic extract consisted of steroidal lactones named as withanolides (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Withanolide D isolated from the alcoholic extract of leaves exhibited structural similarity to withaferin A except for the hydroxyl group at C-20 instead of C-27 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Withanolides forming 0.001-0.5% of the total dry weight of leaves and roots (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) are actually 22-hydroxyergostane-26-oic-26,22-olide with novel structural variants at a carboxylic skeleton or side chains (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Distinct chemotypes of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> consisted of different quantities of substituted steroidal lactones depending upon geographical distribution (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Presence of 4β,27-dihydroxy- 5β,6β-epoxy-1-oxowitha-2,24-dienolide skeleton in chemotype I was the result of chemo-genetic variations in 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> while chemotype II contained excessive concentrations of withanolide D (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Withanolide D was mainly observed in chemotype-II, which was featured by structural modification at C-20 containing a hydroxyl group at 4β and epoxy system at 5 and 6β positions. Structural characterization revealed that withanolides E and J contained an OH group at C-17, not at C-20, unlike other withanolides. Withanolides E and F showed α-orientation while withanolides G and J possessed normal β-orientation of side chains (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The substituted steroidal lactones were characteristics of each chemotype evolved from genetic variations (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and extensive study of the chemotypes showed variable steroidal contents (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).
