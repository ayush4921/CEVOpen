<p>Significant consideration was given to the diligent evaluation of cytotoxicity induced by phytochemicals extracted from 
 <italic>W. somnifera </italic>while investigating the therapeutic properties (
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>). Acute and subchronic toxic effects caused by the plant in Wistar rats were assessed by oral administration of whole plant extract at a dose of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. Histopathological parameters, serum analysis, hematology, and body weights were assessed at the end of the study. The results showed that acute toxicity was observed at a dose of 2000 mg/kg of body weight in Wistar rats (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> root powder (200 mg/kg of feed), when administered to the cockerels, lowers the severity of fenvalerate-induced toxicity with progressive improvement in red blood cell count, total leucocyte count, and total erythrocyte count (
