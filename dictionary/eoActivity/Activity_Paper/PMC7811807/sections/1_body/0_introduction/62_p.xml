<p>Sitoindosides (VII–X) and withaferin extracted from roots were investigated on brain cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced allergic and glutamatergic receptors in rats. Results showed a slight increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in lateral septum with relative lowering in the vertical diagonal band of lateral septum and globus pallidus (
