<p>Withaferin A suppressed the arthritic syndrome without any side effects when administered at 12–25 mg/kg of body weight to albino rats having adjuvant-induced arthritis.

Alcoholic extract of the plant leaves depicted significant anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting tumor necrosis induced activation of Iκβ kinase responsible for activation of NFκβ. It was disclosed that the extract contained withaferin A, the only withanolide which can inhibit Iκβ kinase activation (
