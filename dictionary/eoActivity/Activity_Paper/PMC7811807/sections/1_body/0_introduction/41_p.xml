<p>The root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> was investigated for analgesic effects in a plantar incision, mechanical withdrawal threshold, and spared nerve injury models in rats by quantifying the interleukin and interferon biomarkers in the dorsal root ganglia of rats by ELISA cytokine assay. Results showed that significant increase of mechanical withdrawal threshold, spared nerve injury-induced hyper-analgesia, and cytokine levels were observed in a dose-dependent manner after 6 and 24 hr administration of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> root extract at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg of body weight. Withaferin A, the main active compound of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> roots, seemed to be responsible for chemochine receptor family 2, which shows analgesic effect in the post-operative and neuropathic treatment of rats (
