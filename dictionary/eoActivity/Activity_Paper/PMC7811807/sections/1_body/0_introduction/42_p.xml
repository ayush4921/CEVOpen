<p>Analgesic effect of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> was attributed to the capability for reducing the level of serotonin, which was majorly responsible for the pain in the body. Ethanol (0.05855 g/ml), butanol (0.05135 g/ml), xylene (0.0628 g/ml), and methanolic (0.0541 g/ml) root extracts of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were administered to albino mice at 2 hr to 12 hr time intervals. Serotonin concentration was observed by UV-visible spectroscopy which clarifies the reduction of serotonin level. Results showed that ethanol-based extract showed more significant inhibition of serotonin production followed by methanol-based extract, while the other two didnâ€™t show significant results for the reduction of serotonin (
