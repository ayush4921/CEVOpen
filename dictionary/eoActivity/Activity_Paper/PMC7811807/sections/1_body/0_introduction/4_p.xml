<p>Phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> revealed the presence of pharmacologically active steroidal lactones named withanolides (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Withanine, a group of alkaloids isolated from the roots of the plant, forms 38% of the total weight of alkaloids (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The principal withanolides extracted from 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic>Â in India were withanolide D and withaferin A which exhibited antitumor and cytotoxic properties (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition to alkaloids, the plant also consisted of steroids, saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, phytophenols, and glycosides (
