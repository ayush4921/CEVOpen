<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder was treated with administration of root powder of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day to rats. Radial arm water maze and enzymatic markers assays were used to access spatial memory, learning, and oxidative stress biological markers in rats. Results showed that the administration of the root powder of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> prevented memory impairment in rats after post-traumatic stress disorder by affecting anti-oxidant mechanisms in the hippocampus part of the brain in rats. The study led to concluding that 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> can be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases induced by post-traumatic stress disorder (
