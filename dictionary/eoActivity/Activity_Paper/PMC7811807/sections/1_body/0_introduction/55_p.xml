<p>Aqueous extract of the roots was tested for the anti-oxidant effect in male albino rats against cypermethrin induced oxidation. Extract, when administered at a dose of 5 ml (10% rootâ€™s extract) for 60 days to male albino rats, showed the complete restoration of all biochemical and hematological parameters (

 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>, and rhizome of 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale </italic>reduced tenuous physical exercise and swimming-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats. The stresses significantly elevated the number of free radicals which lowered the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase in secondary sex organs. Co-administration of the aforesaid extracts at a dose of 0.5 ml/100 g of body weight helped to increase anti-oxidant activity with regaining a reasonable level of enzymes (
