<p>Methanolic extract of the fruits was explored and possessed withanamides A-I (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). In a similar study, methanolic extract of fresh berries showed the presence of 6,7α-epoxy-1α,3β,5α-trihydroxy-witha-24-enolide (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Another study disclosed the roots of the plant were composed of novel dimeric thiowithanolide, ashwagandhanolide. A novel dimeric withanolide with unusual thioether linkage from methanolic extract of roots displayed activity against human gastric, colon (HCT-116), and lung (NCI H460) cancer, central nervous system (SF-268), and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) with IC

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Diaion HP-20 column chromatography was used to quantify different glycosidic fractions in the methanolic extract of plant roots. Results showed the presence of withanosides I (0.0020%), withanosides II (0.012%), withanosides III (0.0024%), withanosides IV (0.048%), withanosides V (0.017%), withanosides VI (0.024%), and withanosides VII (0.0011%) with withaferin A, 5,20α(R)-dihydroxy-6
 <italic>,</italic>7α -epoxy-1-oxowitha-2,24-dienolide, physagulin D, and coagulin Q (
