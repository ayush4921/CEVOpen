<p>The plant was also evaluated for the anti-carcinogenic activity against urethane-induced lung cancer in adult male albino mice. Results showed that the simultaneous intake of the powdered plant (200 mg/kg, daily) and urethane (125 mg/kg, biweekly) for seven months significantly lessened the incidence of tumors (
