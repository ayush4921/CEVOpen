<p>Anti-cancerous protein fraction was extracted from 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> roots, which showed activity against the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The action of protein fraction was mediated by reactive oxygen species dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis mechanism in the breast cancer cell line. The shade-dried roots (100 g) of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were suspended in 400 ml of 0.1M trisphosphate buffer at 4 Â°C with continuous stirring at 12000 rpm for 20 min. The extracted protein was purified and concentrated at 3.0 mg/ml concentration, and anti-cancerous activity was studied by MTT assay against MDA-MB-231 cell line showed that the arrest of the G2 phase was observed in dose-dependent manner results the stalling of mitotic progress (
