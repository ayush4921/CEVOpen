<p>Antitumor activity of the ethanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera </italic>was evaluated against Dalton’s ascitic lymphoma in Swiss albino rats. It was discovered that extract decreased tumor size, weight, and the number of cancer cells significantly (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). Anti-proliferative activity in reference to structure-activity relationship for withanolides confirmed the presence of 2,1-oxo-functionality in ring A, 5, and 6β-epoxy or 5α-chloro-6β hydroxy groups in ring B against the human head, breast, and neck squamous carcinomas cell lines (

 <italic>In vitro </italic>cytotoxic evaluation of 50% ethanolic extract of root, stem, and leaves against different human cancer cell lines, e.g., prostate, lungs, colon, and neuroblastoma was appraised. It was revealed that ethanolic leaf extract exhibited morte potent antitumor activity against prostate and colon cancer than roots and stem extracts (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>). The mechanism involved behind the antitumor activity is retardation of cyclooxygenase enzymes, the proliferation of tumor cells, and lipid peroxidation by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ) at the genetic level (
