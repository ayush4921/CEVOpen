<p>Cognitive dysfunction along with spatial learning defects induced by bisphenol A was improved by administration of ethanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight per day to white albino mice. Neurodegeneration and spatial learning defects were measured by Y maze and Morris water maze assays. Results showed that impairment caused by bisphenol A was reduced by the administration of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> extract after recovering the NMDA receptor in the hippocampus region of albino mice (
