<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rising threat to global health [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The AMR crisis leads to prolonged hospital stays, inflated medical costs, and a higher rate of death [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is estimated that more than 700,000 people die of resistant infections every year. If no active solution to the problem is found now, the estimate says millions of people will die due to AMR in the coming years [

The scarcity of new, less toxic antibiotic molecules with a novel mode of action that are less prone to drug resistance propels the development of alternative medicine. Plants have been used since ancient times for the prevention and/or treatment of several disorders. The acquaintance of the plant healing properties has been inherited over the centuries within and among human communities [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Medicinal plants have important antibiotic biochemistry to protect themselves against various infections and these properties can be transferred to humans [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Indeed, plants produced active secondary metabolites that account for the pharmacological properties including the treatment of infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The data generated from the anti-infective efficacy of several herbals medicine used in traditional medicine have been scientifically confirmed [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Edible plants are of growing interest nowadays [

The scientific validation and creation of research data on the quality, safety, and efficacy of folk medicine have become a pressing issue. Such scientific knowledge can help create an evidence-based traditional medicine that is increasingly respected by other public health professionals. The presence of phytochemicals (nutraceuticals), in addition to nutrients, in dietary fruits, spices, condiments, and other vegetables, is considered of crucial nutritional importance in the prevention of chronic diseases, including bacterial infections [
