<p>PH-n-Hex depicted strong inhibition of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> biofilm formation (up to 80%) at inhibitory concentrations (MIC, 2MIC, 4MIC, 8MIC) and between 50% and 70% at sub-inhibitory concentrations (MIC/2, MIC/4, MIC/8, MIC/16) (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) has been found between the values. The inhibition of the biofilm formation recorded at sub-inhibitory doses indicates the anti-biofilm activity of PH-n-Hex phytoconstituents. The molecular mechanism of plant extract on biofilm structure consists of targeting peptidoglycan synthesis and modulating the quorum sensing (QS), a whole gene involving in the regulation of biofilm formation [

Indeed, the QS regulates various functions in bacteria, including biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, as well as the ability of bacteria to induce disease. The inhibition of biofilm formation by PH-n-Hex may be assigned to the presence of pharmacologically active phytoconstituents that act specifically on QS signaling pathways. Thereby, plant extract and its active compounds could inhibit signaling pathways of the QS that are involved in biofilm formation [
