<p>The GC–MS analysis of PH-n-Hex led to the identification of 11 phytoconstituents (

 <xref rid="plants-09-01111-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only compounds that showed the significance of similarity percentage ≥ 85% were considered. Above this value, there is a high probability to get a correct identification [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Major components identified were monounsaturated (oleic acid, octadeca-11-enoic acid, and methyl oleate,) and saturated (palmitic acid, methyl palmitate) fatty acids and beta-sitosterol. Other identified compounds with an area percentage &lt; 2% included methyl linoleate, phytol, methyl stearate, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, and diisobutyl phthalate. Oleic acid [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was identified as the main component (46.55%). Our results were consistent with previous findings, since some studies displayed similar phytochemicals constituents from

 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, the investigations carried out by Ramos-Escudero et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported the presence of oleic acid, palmitic acid, and triterpene alcohol in 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic>. Chirinos et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] previously identified β-sitosterol as the most important and representative phytosterol (as in most plants) found in 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic>. The chemical structures of the major phytoconstituents identified were shown in
