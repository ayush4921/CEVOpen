<p>The upsurge of bacterial drug-resistant infections is a permanent public health concern. The resistance crisis urges the scientific community to seek for effective alternative therapeutic compounds with unusual modes of action [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This accounts for the rush for natural substances comprising medicinal plants. Indeed, medicinal plants produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites with a wide range of biological properties [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, we examined the antibacterial efficacy of the methanol extract (PH-MeOH) and subsequent partition fractions (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) from 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> fruits. The recorded minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values are summarized in

 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae)</italic> are among those prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the research for novel antibacterial agents [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Preliminary investigations on the antibiotic resistance profile confirmed the resistance features of studied bacteria (data not shown). The studied Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were found to be sensitive to the test solvent fractions. The latter were selectively active, with MIC values ranging from 0.125â€“1 mg/mL (

 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> fruits dissolve in varying degrees in solvents used. PH-MeOH, PH-n-Hex, and the ethyl acetate fraction (PH-EA) displayed noteworthy inhibitory effects, preventing the growth of all tested bacterial strains (100%).
