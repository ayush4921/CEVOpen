<p>The antimicrobial activities of the major compounds identified were widely documented. The possibility of the therapeutic use of fatty acids (both saturated and unsaturated) as antimicrobial agents is worthy of note [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the main ones identified in the present study could explain the antibacterial potential exerted by PH-n-Hex. Octadeca-11-enoic acid, an omega-7 fatty acid, is well known for its antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous investigations also reported the antimicrobial activity of linoleic acid (and derivatives) and oleic acid against Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Likewise, palmitic acid, a long-chain saturated fatty acid, has been reported to exert notable antimicrobial activities against oral pathogens (bacteria and fungi) [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, Sharma [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] underscored the antimicrobial activities of plant sterols including the one identified in the present study (beta-sitosterol). In addition, Sen and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have reported significant antimicrobial activities of beta-sitosterol against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, some of the bacteria species used in this work. A diterpene alcohol phytol identified has been also reported to act as an antimicrobial agent [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The presence of these compounds in 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> makes it a plant of pharmaceutical value. The identified compounds could act alone, or in interactions with other constituents of the mixture. The present work provided evidence of the traditional use of 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> as an anti-infective plant. Most of the bacteria species examined in the present study are implicated in gastrointestinal troubles. Therefore, various solvent extracts from 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> fruits, particularly PH-n-Hex, can be considered as promising candidates in the control of gastrointestinal diseases.
