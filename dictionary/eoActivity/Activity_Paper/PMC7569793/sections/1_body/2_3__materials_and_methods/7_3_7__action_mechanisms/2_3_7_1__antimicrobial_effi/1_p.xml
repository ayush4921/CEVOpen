<p>The antimicrobial efficacy assay (time-kill kinetic assay) is applied to evaluate the activity of an antimicrobial agent against a bacterial strain and can establish the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of a compound over time. The assay was conducted based on the protocol earlier described by Appiah et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], with slight modifications (final concentrations of test extract were equal to 4MIC, 2MIC, and MIC, whilst the time intervals for the kinetic study was as follows: 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h). The inoculum concentration was equivalent to 1.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL.
