<p>The ability of PH-n-Hex to inhibit the

 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping was assessed by monitoring the acidification of the external medium through pH measurement using a pH-meter equipped with E-201-C combined electrode (PHSJ-3F pH Meter, INESA Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), based on previously described protocol [

 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min). The pellet was washed twice with distilled water and then with 50 mM KCl and re-suspended in 50 mL of 50 mM KCl. The cell suspension (1.5–2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was incubated overnight (18 h, 4 °C) for glucose starvation and then centrifuged. In 4 mL of the reaction medium, 0.5 mL of PH-n-Hex corresponding to MIC/2, MIC, and 2MIC was added and the pH adjusted to 6.4. Upon 10 min pre-incubation under agitation at 37 °C, the acidification of the medium was initiated following the addition of 0.5 mL of glucose 20% (

 <italic>v</italic>). The pH measurement was recorded every 20 min for 160 min. The experiment was conducted in the presence of DMSO (control) at a final concentration of 2.5%, to measure the extent of acidification of the external medium in the absence of the plant extract. The experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. The measured pH values were used to plot the pH evolution curve as a function of time [pH = f (time)]. Any inhibition of the acidification of the medium in the presence of the extract has been ascribed to an inhibitory effect of the H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps.
