<p>The release of UV-absorbing material concentrations was measured by UV–VIS spectrophotometer following the study conducted by Devi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, overnight cultures of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> in TSB were adjusted to achieve the OD600 of 2.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (400× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice (using sterile deionized water) and then suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Different concentrations of extract corresponding to MIC and 4MIC were added to the cell suspension. Methicillin was used as a positive control and cells without extract treatment were used as negative controls. The experiment was done in triplicate. All the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min under agitation. After treatment, the cell suspension was centrifuged (13,400× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and the OD260 value of the supernatant was taken as a percentage of the extracellular UV-absorbing materials released by cells. All the measurements were done in triplicates in MAPADA UV–VIS 1100 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Mapada Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
