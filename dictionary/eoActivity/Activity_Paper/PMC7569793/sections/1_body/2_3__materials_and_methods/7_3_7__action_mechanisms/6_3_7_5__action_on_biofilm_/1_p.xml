<p>Biofilm assay was assessed using crystal violet assay (96-well microtitre plate assay for biofilm quantification), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The first phase of the assay was similar to that of MIC determination, mentioned above. The serial twofold dilution led to the concentration ranging from 1/16 MIC to 8 MIC. However, the incubation time was 24 h at 37 °C. The next step consisted of gentle removal of each well content by tapping the plates. Subsequently, the wells were washed with 200 µL sterile saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) to remove free-floating bacteria and then dried and fixed at 65 °C for 1 h. Biofilms formed by adherent cells in plates were stained with 0.8% (

Optical densities (OD) of stained adherent bacteria were measured at 590 nm using a microplate reader (Infinite M200 PRO, Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). All tests were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. The percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated using the following formula (Equation (2)):
 <disp-formula>% of biofilm inhibition = [OD growth control − OD sample/OD growth control] × 100
