<p>Crystal violet assay was applied to investigate the alteration in membrane permeability according to the protocol described by Devi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, suspensions of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> were prepared in TSB. Cells were harvested after centrifugation (4500× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4 °C) and were washed twice and suspended in PBS (pH 7.4). The bacteria cell suspension in buffer was treated with PH-n-Hex (at MIC and 4MIC) and methicillin (at MIC) followed by incubation (37 °C, 30 min). Likewise, control samples were prepared similarly without treatment. Another centrifugation (9300× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min) allowed the harvesting of cells, followed by the re-suspension in PBS containing 10 µg/mL of crystal violet. Afterward, the solution was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation (13,400× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min), and the OD590 of the supernatant was measured using MAPADA UV–VIS 1100 spectrophotometer. The OD value of the crystal violet solution, which was originally used in the assay, was taken and it was considered as 100%. The percentage of crystal violet (CV) uptake of tested samples was calculated using the following formula (Equation (1)): 
 <disp-formula>% of CV uptake = [OD value of the sample/OD value of crystal violet solution] × 100
