<p>The anti-infective efficacy of the methanolic extract and subsequent partition fractions from 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> fruits have been established as evident in the results obtained from the antibacterial assays. The GCâ€“MS analysis of the n-hexane fraction led to the identification of 11 potentially bioactive components. These phytoconstituents (individually or in interactions with other components) probably act by interfering with bacterial biofilm formation, H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping, and cell membrane integrity. The findings provided a baseline to consider the extracts from 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> fruits, in particular the n-hexane fraction, in the control of drug-resistant infectious diseases. More investigations are required to isolate, characterize, and evaluate the biological properties of the identified bioactive components.
