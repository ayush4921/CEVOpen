    "<i>Plukenetia huayllabambana</i> is an edible plant traditionally used to cure wounds and various infections. The present work assessed, for the first time, the antibacterial efficacy of solvent fractions from <i>P. huayllabambana</i> fruits. The crude methanol extract was obtained applying ultrasound-assisted extraction, followed by partitioning through successive depletion among solvents of increasing polarity to yield fractions (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined following antibacterial testing, using the broth microdilution technique against a panel of drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Possible modes of action of the most active fraction were also investigated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify phytocompounds that may account for the recorded activities. Methanol, n-hexane (PH-n-Hex), and ethyl acetate extracts inhibited 100% of studied bacteria, with the recorded MIC ranging from 0.125-1 mg/mL. PH-n-Hex appeared as the most active partition, exerting a bacteriostatic effect. PH-n-Hex probably acts by interfering with bacterial biofilm formation, proton pumps, and bacterial cell membrane integrity. The GC-MS analysis of PH-n-Hex led to the identification of 11 potentially bioactive components, including fatty acids, phytosterol, and diterpene alcohol as major ones. <i>P. huayllabambana</i> can be considered as a plant of pharmacological value-a source of potent anti-infective drug entities."
