<p>The chemosuppressive effect of the plant extract is summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All dose levels of the crude fruit extract evaluated in the study exhibited a statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) difference in reducing the parasite load compared to the negative control, in a dose-dependent fashion. The 400â€‰mg/kg/day dose of the extract exhibited the highest parasitemia inhibition (93.28%) compared to other doses. Nevertheless, the effect produced by the crude extract was inferior to the standard drug, which cleared the parasite to an undetectable level. In addition, the longest mean survival time (27.42 days) was exhibited at the highest dose administered. CQ-treated groups, on the other hand, survived throughout the monitoring period (&gt;30 days).
