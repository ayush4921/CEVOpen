<p>At the end of the maceration, the flask was removed out of the shaker, put on a table, and left for 30 minutes to form a layer of distillate and marc. Then, separation of the marc from the resulting distillate containing the 80% methanol crude extract was done first using muslin cloth, followed by filtration with the aid of a Whatman filter paper number 1 (Whatman®, England) under suction filtration. This cold maceration procedure, in the same solvent system, was repeated twice using the marc left. The filtrate was then transferred to a round bottom flask and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-200, Switzerland) under reduced pressure. Then, the resulting extract was frozen in a deep freezer overnight and freeze dried with a lyophilizer (Operon, Korea Vacuum Limited, Korea) to remove water at -50°C and vacuum pressure of 200 mbar. The concentrated extract was transferred into an amber glass bottle and kept at -20°C until use. The percentage yield was calculated using the following formula:
