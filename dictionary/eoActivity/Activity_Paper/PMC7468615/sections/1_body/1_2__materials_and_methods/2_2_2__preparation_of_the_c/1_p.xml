<p>In order to remove dust from the fruits, the fruits were first properly washed with distilled water and cleaned with a muslin cloth. To make a coarse powder and facilitate an extraction process, the plant fruits were air dried under shade at room temperature and pulverized with the aid of a mortar and pestle. The cold maceration technique as per the method described by Bello et al. [

Accordingly, 500 g of coarse powder was soaked in 750 ml of 80% methanol solution using an Erlenmeyer flask. A mechanical shaker (Bibby Scientific Limited, Stone, Staffordshire, UK) operating at 120 rpm for 72 hours was used to facilitate the extraction process.
