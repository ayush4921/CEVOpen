 <sub>4</sub>, the blood was collected from the tail of each mouse using clean and nongreasy slides to prepare thin blood films. The slides were stained with freshly prepared 10% Giemsa for 15 minutes. The stain was then washed off with distilled water. After allowing the slides to air-dry, the slides were viewed microscopically using the ×100 objective. By counting the number of PRBCs out of erythrocytes in random fields of the microscope, the percentage parasitemia (PP) was obtained. For each mouse, two stained slides were examined. Three fields with approximately 200-500 cells were counted for each slide, and PP for each mouse was determined as described below [
