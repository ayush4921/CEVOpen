<p>As mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.3">Section 2.3</xref>, Swiss albino mice were utilized for evaluating the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiplasmodial effect of the 80% methanolic crude fruit extract of 
 <italic>C. frutescens</italic>. Thirty male mice were intraperitoneally infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> and randomly divided into five groups of six mice each, in separate cages. The negative control received 10 ml/kg dose of solvent for reconstitution (Tween 80 2% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). Three of the groups received different dose levels of the extract (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg). Mice in the last group (positive control) were treated with 10 mg/kg dose of chloroquine (CQ) base. Dose selection for the extract was determined based on the result of acute toxicity, and preliminary screening test done on the plant extract.
