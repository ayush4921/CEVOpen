<p>The three doses of methanolic crude extract significantly prevented rectal temperature drop due to parasitemia as compared to the vehicle. These activities probably indicate that the extract ameliorates some pathological processes that cause reduction in internal body temperature and metabolic rates. In a 4-day suppressive test, a candidate antimalarial agent should prolong survival time to be an active antimalarial agent. The extract significantly prolonged the survival time of mice as compared to the control. However, unlike CQ, the mice were not cured. This might be due to the incomplete clearance of the parasite or short half-life profile of active constituents [
