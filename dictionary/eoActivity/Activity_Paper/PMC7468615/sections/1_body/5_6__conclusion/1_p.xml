<p>The findings of the present study indicated that the fruits of 
 <italic>C. frutescens</italic> have a promising 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity that can serve as a potential source to develop effective and safer antimalarial drugs. The highest chemosuppressive effect was exhibited by the upper dose of the tested extract indicating the presence of high concentration of bioactive principles in this dose. Moreover, the data would provide evidence to endorse the traditional use of the plant by the local communities for the treatment of malaria in Ethiopia and Uganda.
