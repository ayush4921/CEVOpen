<p>The biosynthesis of nanoparticles has gained significant interest the field of biotechnology and nanotechnology with focused attention due to its proliferating need in the material synthesis. Prominent efforts have been made in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plants and microorganisms. Silver nanoparticles are profoundly important, and used as antimicrobial agents [
