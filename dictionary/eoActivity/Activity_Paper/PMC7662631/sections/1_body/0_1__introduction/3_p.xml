<p>AgNPs on the other hand are promising anticancer agents, which have an influence on the cell cycle and proliferation by the means of oxidative stress generation and apoptosis induction. Furthermore, they are antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal [

 <italic>T. chebula</italic>, in this report, we have synthesized the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> fruit extract, and characterized using XRD, TEM and HRTEM techniques, and studied its antimicrobial efficacy against
