<p>TCE was found to be cytotoxic to the MCF-7 in a dose-dependent fashion. Notwithstanding this, high concentrations of TCE were required to show a significance in the observed anti-proliferative effect, compared to the AgNPs. However, the TCE-mediated preparation of AgNPs drastically enhanced the tumoricidal potential of the constituents even at very low concentrations. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.53 and 14.25 µg/mL were recorded for the separated treatments of MCF-7 with TCE and AgNPs (

 <sub>50</sub> to 6.484 µg/mL, which is almost one third of TCE and half of AgNPs treatments, was observed in the TCE + AgNPs treatment of MCF-7 cells. Suggesting that the preparation of AgNPs using TCE enhanced the cytotoxic behavior. Similar observations were made by Satpathy et al. (2018), where the green synthesis of AgNPs using 
 <italic>P. tuberosa</italic> extracts enhanced the cytotoxicity against breast, ovarian, multidrug resistant and brain cancer cell lines [

 <italic>Saraca asoca</italic> not just improved the anticancer, but also the antibacterial, antidiabetic as well as catalytic activities of the plant extract [
