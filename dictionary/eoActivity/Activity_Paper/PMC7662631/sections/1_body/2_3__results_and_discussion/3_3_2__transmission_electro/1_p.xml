<p>The morphology and the size of the green synthesized AgNPs was investigated by High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis. Although, previous reports mention the different morphology of AgNPs synthesized using a similar method [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05042" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in our synthetic strategy, the as-prepared AgNPs is typically spherical in shape (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05042">Figure S1</xref>). The as-obtained AgNPs exhibited well-defined structures in nanoscale dimensions with typical spherical morphologies as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05042-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, with an average particle size of 22 nm. As manifested in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05042-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, the lattice fringes having inter planar distance of 0.31 nm, which is assigned to (111) plane. Furthermore, the crystallographic features of the as-prepared AgNPs was analyzed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) studies. It is evident from SAED image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05042-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) that few spots of diffraction are spread in concentric circles, when the electron diffraction was performed on a limited number of crystals. The ring patterns observed for as-prepared AgNPs having plane distances of 2.39 Å, 2.07 Å, 1.45 Å, 1.25 Å, and 0.97 Å are in good agreement with the planes those could be indexed to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (331) of pristine face centered cubic silver structure (JCPDS file No. 4-0787). Moreover, these results are in consistent with the XRD pattern also.
