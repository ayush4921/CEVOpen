<p>In order to prepare 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> fruit extract, 80 g of finely powdered sample is loaded into the thimble, a porous bag made from a strong filter paper or cellulose, which is placed on the thimble chamber of the Soxhlet apparatus. The extraction solvent, methanol is heated in the round bottom flask, which is attached to a Soxhlet extractor and condenser. Methanol vaporizes into the sample thimble, condenses in the condenser and drip back. Once the level of solvent reaches the siphon it pours back into the flask and the cycle begins again. This process continued for 48 h and finally the obtained methanolic extract was reduced under pressure.
