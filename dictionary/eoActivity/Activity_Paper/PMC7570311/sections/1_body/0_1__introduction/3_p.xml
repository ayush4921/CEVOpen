 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> (Zygophyllaceae) is a medicinal and ornamental plant naturally growing in the southern eastern parts of Asia and Northern Africa [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In traditional medicine, 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seeds are used as decoctions, powder and infusion for diarrhea, abortion, asthma, lumbago and other ailments [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most previous investigations on 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> studied seed composition and reported high antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Little attention was given to the chemical composition of the leaves, which showed antioxidant and antibacterial activities [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, no specific polyphenols were identified. Other compounds were identified in the seeds such as vasicinone, harmine, peganine and harmalacidine, which have antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects against Med-mek carcinoma, UCP-med sarcoma and Jurkat [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Chinese origin 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed high amounts of 4-hydroxyisoleucine, asparagine, proline, lysine, vasicine and sucrose in methanolic extracts of leaves [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> grows in Saudi Arabia as natural populations and no antioxidant, cytotoxic or antimicrobial studies were conducted on these populations. Previous investigation on Algerian 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed that environmental conditions may influence the distribution of this species in salted areas [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, these conditions may affect the chemical composition of this species.
