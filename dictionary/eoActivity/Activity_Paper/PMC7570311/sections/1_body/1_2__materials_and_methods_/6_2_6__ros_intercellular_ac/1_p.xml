<p>This assay determined the ability of the obtained leaf extracts to reduce the intracellular levels of ROS in HeLa, Jurkat, T24, and MCF-7 cancer cells. The assay employs the fluorogenic dye (H
 <sub>2</sub>DCF-DA) [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The cancer cells were exposed to leaf extracts or polyphenols IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (determined by DPPH). DCF fluorescence was determined after 90 min of treatment at 485 nm. Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was used as a positive control.
