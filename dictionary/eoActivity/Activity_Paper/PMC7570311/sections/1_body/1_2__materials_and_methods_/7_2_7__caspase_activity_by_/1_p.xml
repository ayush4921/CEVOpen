<p>The effect of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extracts on caspase activity in cancer cells was determined using the Protease Sampler Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were cultured for 1 d in RPMI growth medium containing the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extracts/polyphenols, then harvested and tested for caspase activity according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, control and treated cells were resuspended in chilled cell lysis buffer (50 mL) then incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g). The concentration of the protein was calculated using Bradford’s method. The reaction buffer was added to the protein and incubated 2 h at 37°C. The reaction buffer contained 200 mM substrate VEID (caspase-6), IETD-pNA (caspase-8), LEHD-pNA (caspase-9), and VDVAD-pNA (caspase-2). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The relative caspase activity (expressed as % of untreated control) was determined by the comparison of the absorbance of pNA from an apoptotic sample with the control.
