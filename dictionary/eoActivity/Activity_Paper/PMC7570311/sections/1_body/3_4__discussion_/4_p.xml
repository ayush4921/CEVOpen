<p>Most of the previous investigations on 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> focused on the bark, which is commonly used as laxative in herbal and alternative medicines. For example, the bark extract of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> (Croatian origin) showed antioxidant effects attributed to emodin content [

 <italic>F. alnus</italic>. The seed extracts of Indian-origin 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed high antioxidant properties in a previous investigation [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previous investigation on Tunisian-origin 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, no polyphenols were identified. Algerian-origin 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed bactericidal activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> but no polyphenols were associated with this activity [
