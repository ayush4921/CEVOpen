<p>The caspase family proteases play an essential role in the apoptosis mechanism by controlling the pathway of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We found strong evidence that these caspase enzymes are activated in cells when treated with 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts. Caspases-8 and 9 are considered as large prodomains and initiator caspases, while caspase 6 is small prodomain [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In caspase-3 deficient cancer cells such as MCF-7, caspase 6, 8 and 9 could be involved in apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Caspase 2 is not classified yet as an initiator or as an effector. However, it is involved in the cell death by activation within the p-53 protein with death domain PIDDosome [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. From our knowledge, the effects of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts on caspases activities have not been studied before.
