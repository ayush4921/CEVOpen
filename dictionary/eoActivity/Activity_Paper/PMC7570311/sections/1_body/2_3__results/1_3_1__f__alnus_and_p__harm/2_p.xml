<p>In 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> methanolic leaf extracts, four phenolic acids (protocatehuic (11), hydrocaffeic (12), caffeic (2), rosmarinic (8) acids) and one flavonoid, cynaroside (15) were identifed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01086-f002">Figure 2</xref>). A significant amount of hydrocaffeic acid (199.4 mg/100 g DW) and protocatechiuc acid (51.6 mg/100 g DW) were detected (

 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extract, UV spectra indicated that two more abundant flavonoid derivatives were found (compounds 13 and 14) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01086-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. Their amounts were 503.8 and 254.0 mg/100 g DW, respectively, as cynaroside equivalent (
