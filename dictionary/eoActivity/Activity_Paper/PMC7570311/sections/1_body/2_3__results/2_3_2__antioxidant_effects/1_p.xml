 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P harmala</italic> extracts showed strong antioxidant effects comparable to selected polyphenols as shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01086-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> showed significantly higher antioxidant effects than 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> as detected by different assays including 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carotene bleaching DPPH and FRAP. 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> polyphenols such as trifolin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and rosmarinic acid showed strong antioxidant effects (low IC
 <sub>50</sub>). 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> polyphenols including hydrocaffeic acid, cynaroside and protocatechuic acid showed strong antioxidant effects. Rosmarinic acid antioxidant activities were comparable to antioxidant standards.
