<p>The antiproliferative effects of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extracts against selected cancer cells were evaluated using the MTT test (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01086-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were antiproliferative effects of 
 <italic>F. alnus and P. harmala</italic> extracts, as well as selected polyphenols, against all cancer cells. The normal cells of HEK-293 were not affected by the extracts. 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> showed higher antiproliferative activities than 
 <italic>P. harmala.</italic> Noticeable antiproliferative effects were found when applying polyphenols such as quercitrin, cynaroside, trifolin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and rutoside against cancer cells.
