  <p>The effect of 
   <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
   <italic>P. harmala</italic> methanolic extracts, quercitrin, trifolin, and cynaroside DPPH IC
   <sub>50</sub> on the DCF fluorescence in HeLa, Jurkat, T24, MCF-7, and HEK-293 cells. Medium with 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>) was used as a positive control. The highest reduction of ROS was achieved using trifolin and cynaroside in all cancer cells following 90 min of incubation. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three experiments (four replicates per treatment). Different letters among columns in specific cells indicate significant differences at 
   <italic>p ≤ 0.05</italic>.
