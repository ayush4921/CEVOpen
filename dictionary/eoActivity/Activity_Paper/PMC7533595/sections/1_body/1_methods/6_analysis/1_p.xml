<p>A directed content analysis approach (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) was used during the iterative transcript coding process. The codebook followed the building block categories of BCM (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The attributes within the building blocks were refined during the analysis process to reflect emerging findings. The final coding scheme included eight building blocks (two building blocks were merged). A dual-coder process was used: two independent interviewers/researchers (SvD, HV) coded the transcripts separately and coding discrepancies between the two researchers were discussed and reconciled. The final attributes were re-analyzed and consolidated by two of the authors (AvR, HV).
