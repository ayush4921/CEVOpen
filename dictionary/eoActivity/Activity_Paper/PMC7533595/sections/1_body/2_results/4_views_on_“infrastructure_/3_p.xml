<p>Concerning the organizational structure of the network around EUPATI: the stakeholders agreed that PGOsupport—an independent foundation with an established training facility for patient representatives in the Netherlands since 2008—would be the designated organization to lead the Dutch EUPATI course. In that way, neutrality, patient-centeredness, and independence, as well as optimal utilization of existing knowledge about patient expert training, can be guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperation in the network of stakeholders should be based on “equality.” This is despite the fact that “
 <italic>all stakeholders do have a specific contribution to and role in the process of medicine development</italic>,” and should therefore contribute from their specific backgrounds and expertise. Working on long-term commitment is an important prerequisite for long-term cooperation, with transparency about financial flows. Values considered by the stakeholders to be important for the collaboration in the partner network were neutrality, patient-centeredness, equality, independence, transparency, understanding, trust, respect, and having a shared objective with long-term commitment. Finally, stakeholders recommended that the network should find a “lean” and efficient way of working—preferably with a small steering group, representative of the main stakeholder groups and within existing national and other structures.
