For example, we need to know which outcomes are relevant: what do patients consider as relevant subjects for research, what are the needs of patients? Patient representatives are therefore needed for experiential panels, for assessment of research projects.</td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In doing so, we could avoid the development of pharmaceutical products that are not really interesting to patients. It is important to know patients' experiences with medicines; is it comfortable for patients to use them or do they experience it as an excessive burden? Do the medicines fit with patients' needs and preferences? Patient participation is needed to accelerate and improve important solutions.</td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of drug development is quite complex. Patient representatives who are trained in this topic and who have knowledge of the process of drug development are better equipped to provide good advice. EUPATI makes sure that patient representation is as professional as possible and that more patient representatives are trained. Usually, the same patient representatives—often with a medical background—are involved in working groups. Small patient groups can be better represented too.</td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trained patient representatives are better equipped and probably less intimidated by other professional experts in the world of pharmaceuticals. That lets them represent the interests of patients better. Patient representatives need to cooperate wisely with the pharmaceutical industry and soft skills—for example conversation techniques—are needed in addition to knowledge. Patient representatives should be able to make sure that other parties see their interests.</td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A variation in professionalism among patient representatives exists. We are in need of proper representation for different patient groups. EUPATI should be accessible for patient representatives of different patient groups. Not only somatic disorders. Some patient representatives are dealing with sudden disease progression. That makes it sometimes hard to stay involved. More representatives of these patient groups should be trained probably.</td>
