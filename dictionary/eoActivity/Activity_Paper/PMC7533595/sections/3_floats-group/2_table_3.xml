    <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PGOsupport—an organization for training and supporting patient organizations and patient representatives in the Netherlands—is the designated organization for leading EUPATI NL (neutrality, patients' interest). Cooperation in the network of stakeholders should be based on “equality and independence.” All stakeholders do have a specific contribution to and role in the process of drug development. While some individual interests could oppose each other—for example those of the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders—stakeholders should make their interests in cooperation transparent immediately and discuss how to deal with potential differences, with an openness or willingness to understand divergent values. All stakeholders are ethically obliged to cooperate in order to improve the value of medicines for patients. Although there are some reservations on working with the pharmaceutical industry, stakeholders should all work together, with mutual trust and respect. A public private partnership needs to be built with the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders—with a well-thought governance structure. The network should work together practically, with a small steering group who have “lean” meetings with each other. Working on long-term commitment is an important prerequisite for continued cooperation in the network, with transparency about financing flows.</td>
