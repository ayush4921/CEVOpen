<p>H1299 human lung cancer cells and HCT116 human colon cancer cells (Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea) were cultured in RPMI and Macoy's 5A media, respectively, at 37°C with 95% humidity and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Each medium was premixed with 10% FBS, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. DMSO was used as a vehicle to deliver SFE, and its final concentration was less than 0.2% (v/v) in all experiments. Serum‐free media were used to treat SFE unless indicated otherwise.
