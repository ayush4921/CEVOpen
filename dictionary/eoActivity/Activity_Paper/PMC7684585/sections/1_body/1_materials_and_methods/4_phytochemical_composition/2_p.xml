<p>The total polyphenol content was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu method (Margraf et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Briefly, SFE reconstituted in ethanol (4 mg/ml), 8% sodium carbonate, distilled water, and Folin–Ciocalteu's reagent were mixed in a ratio of 6:20:10:3 (v/v) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting absorbance was read at the wavelength of 650 nm using a microplate reader (Bio‐Rad Laboratories). Total polyphenol content was calculated as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of dried extract.
