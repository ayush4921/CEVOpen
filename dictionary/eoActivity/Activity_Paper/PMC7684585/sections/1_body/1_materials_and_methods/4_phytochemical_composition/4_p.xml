<p>Proanthocyanidin content was determined according to previous report (Aastrup, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>) with minor modification. Briefly, SE reconstituted in ethanol (4 mg/ml), 2% vanillin, and 8 N HCL was mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio (v/v). After incubation for 20 min at 37°C, the absorbance was read at the wavelength of 495 nm in a microplate reader (Bio‐Rad Laboratories). Proanthocyanidin content was calculated as mg (+)‐catechin equivalent (CE) per g of dried extract.
