<p>The total flavonoid content was determined according to previous report (Csepregi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) with minor modification. Briefly, SFE reconstituted in ethanol (4 mg/ml), diethylene glycol, and 1 N sodium hydroxide were mixed in a ratio of 3:10:5 (v/v) and then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The resulting absorbance was read at the wavelength of 415 nm using a microplate reader (Bio‐Rad Laboratories). Total flavonoid content was calculated as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per g of dried extract.
