<p>Apoptotic cells were quantified by Annexin V/PI double staining assay using apoptotic detection kit (BioVision). H1299 cells were seeded in 6‐well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with SFE at 0 or 500 μg/ml in serum‐complete media for 72 hr. Cells were then gently detached by brief trypsinization, washed, and stained with annexin V‐FITC and PI for 10 min in the dark. The stained cells were analyzed using flow cytometer (FACS Calibur‐S System, BD Biosciences). Annexin V‐positive/PI‐negative cells and annexin V‐positive/PI‐positive cells were identified as early and late apoptotic cells, respectively.
