<p>H1299 and HCT116 cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with SFE at 0, 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml for 72 hr. In another experiment, H1299 cells were pretreated with 2 mM NAC for 2 hr and then cotreated with 500 μg/ml SFE and 2 mM NAC for 72 hr. After aspiration of medium, cells were washed with PBS twice and then incubated with MTT at 0.5 μg/ml for 4 hr. The formazan dye formed by viable cells was solubilized by DMSO, and the absorbance was monitored at 540 nm using a microplate reader (Bio‐Rad Laboratories).
