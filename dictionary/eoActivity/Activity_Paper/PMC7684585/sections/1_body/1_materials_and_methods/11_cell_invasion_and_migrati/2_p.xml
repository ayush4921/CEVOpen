<p>Invasion and migration assays were performed using a transwell insert with 8 µm pore size (Sigma‐Aldrich). H1299 and HCT116 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) containing SFE at 0–500 µg/ml in serum‐free media were loaded on the insert. For the invasion assay, the insert was precoated with Matrigel (20 µg/well) to simulate a human basement membrane. After 24 hr, invasive or migratory cells moving through the insert toward the outer well containing serum‐complete media were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. After gentle wash, the dye was dissolved by adding 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and quantified spectrophotometrically using a plate reader (Bio‐Rad Laboratories) at the wavelength of 540 nm.
