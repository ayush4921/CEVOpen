<p>Migration of cancer cells through extracellular matrix to reach blood or lymph vessels and alteration in adhesion of cell‐extracellular matrix are inevitable events during cancer metastasis (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In both H1299 and HCT116 cells, SFE substantially alleviated migration (to 45%–68% of the control, at 100–500 μg/ml) and adhesion to gelatin (to 37%–63% of the control, at 1,000 μg/ml) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). YSFE is slightly more effective than RSFE in inhibiting migration consistently in both H1299 and HCT116 cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>). Since lutein, a major carotenoid found in Snapdragon flowers (Gonzalez‐Barrio et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), is presumably present in the extract used in our study (Craft &amp; Soares, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>) and has been reported to inhibit migration of breast cancer cells ( Li, Zhang, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), the greater activities of YSFE than HSFE may be ascribed to lutein contained in YSFE; further study is needed.
