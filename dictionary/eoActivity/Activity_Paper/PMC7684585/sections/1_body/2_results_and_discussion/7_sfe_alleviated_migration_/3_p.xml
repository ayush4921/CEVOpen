<p>The inhibitory activities of SFE against invasion (at 24 hr time point, Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), migration (at 24 hr time point, Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>), and adhesion (at 2 hr time point, Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref>) were observed at noncytotoxic conditions where significant changes in cell viability were not found in SFE‐treated cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, these activities are likely independent of the growth‐inhibitory activity of SFE. Our results (Figures 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) collectively suggest the antimetastatic activities of SFE against lung and colon cancer cells.
