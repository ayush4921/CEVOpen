<p>A recent study has reported that the snapdragon flowers are rich in diverse phytochemicals (Gonzalez‐Barrio et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). To confirm the richness of phytochemicals, we first determined the content of major classes of phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and carotenoids, in SFE used in our study. Polyphenols, secondary metabolites widely distributed in higher plants, are a large class of compounds containing multiples of phenol units. Flavonoids, belonging to polyphenols, are characterized by two phenyl and one heterocyclic ring structure. Proanthocyanidins are an oligomeric flavonoid. Carotenoids are a class of naturally occurring pigments and structurally characterized by the presence of tetraterpenoids containing 8 isoprenes. These classes of phytochemicals are ubiquitously found in plants, and their wide range of health benefits, including cancer‐inhibitory activities, have been extensively studied (Krzyzanowska et al.,
