<p>To further investigate the role of SFE‐induced intracellular ROS in the inhibition of H1299 cell growth, cells were treated with SFE at 500 μg/ml in the presence of NAC, a cell‐permeable ROS scavenger. NAC completely prevented the SFE‐induced elevation of intracellular ROS and inhibition of cell growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3d,e</xref>). These results suggest that SFE‐induced intracellular ROS is responsible for the SFE‐induced inhibition of H1299 cell growth. Cancer cells are not capable of adapting to oxidative stress due to decreased capacity for ROS metabolism, and therefore, pro‐oxidants exacerbating oxidative stress in cancer cells often exert cytotoxic effects or enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents (Schumacker, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Many phytochemicals have been shown to exhibit both antioxidant and pro‐oxidant activities. The mode of action may depend on the extent of oxidative stress, the concentrations of compounds, and the types of cancers (Chikara et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Further studies are needed to verify whether such pro‐oxidant effects of SFE found in H1299 cells are still responsible for the growth‐inhibitory effects of SFE against lung carcinogenesis in vivo.
