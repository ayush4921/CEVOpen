<p>Diet has been recognized as a major determinant in the cancer etiology (Grosso et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The most consistent finding on diet and cancer is an association between adequate consumption of plant‐based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and reduced risk of several cancers, including cancers of digestive and respiratory tracts (Grosso et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The benefits from consuming plant‐based foods have been attributed to different phytochemicals (Johnson, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). However, evidence that an isolated compound can entirely explain the cancer‐preventive activity of a particular plant‐based food has been insufficient (Liu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Therefore, it would be still important to investigate anticancer activities of plant‐based foods as a mixture containing a large number of different classes of phytochemicals.
