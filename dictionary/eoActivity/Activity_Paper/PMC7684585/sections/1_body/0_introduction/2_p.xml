<p>Cancer is a major disease burden around the world. Among cancers at different organ sites, lung cancer is the most prevalent and leading cause of death in most countries, while colorectal cancer ranks second in both incidence and mortality in more developed countries (Siegel et al.,

Carcinogenesis is a multi‐stage process of cancer development, whereby normal cells evolve progressively to a tumorigenic and ultimately malignant state. Sustaining stimulated growth and activating metastasis are the most distinctive properties that cancer cells must acquire during the multi‐stage carcinogenesis (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg,

Stimulated growth is the fundamental characteristics of cancer cells, which is achieved by dysregulated cell cycle and resisted programmed cell death, called apoptosis. Metastasis, the major cause of treatment failure and the death of cancer patients, is the ultimate step of the multi‐stage carcinogenesis where secondary tumors are formed at the sites distant from the site of primary lesion (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg,
