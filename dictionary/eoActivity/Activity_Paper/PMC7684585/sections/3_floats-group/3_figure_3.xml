  <p>SFE enhanced intracellular ROS generation and reduced MMP in H1299 cells. H1299 (a, c) and HCT116 cells (b) were treated with SFE (0–1,000 μg/ml) for 72 hr, and intracellular ROS levels (a, b) and MMP (c) were present as % of control. H1299 cells were pretreated with NAC (2 mM) and then treated with SFE (500 μg/ml) in the presence of NAC for another 72 hr. Intracellular ROS levels (d) and cell viability (e) were present as % of control. Different letters (a‐e) indicate significance (
