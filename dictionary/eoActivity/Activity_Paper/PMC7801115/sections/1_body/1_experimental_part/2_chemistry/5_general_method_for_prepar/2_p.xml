 <bold>4a</bold>–
 <bold>4i</bold> (0.5 mmol) was added under nitrogen atmosphere and heated to reflux for 4 h. The reaction mixture was poured onto ice and made alkaline with 20% NaOH. The resulting free base was filtered off, washed with water, and dried. The free base was suspended in 2-propanole and concd HCl (84 µl, 1.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1–2 h and cooled in refrigerator overnight. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with diethyl-ether, and dried at 75 °C.
