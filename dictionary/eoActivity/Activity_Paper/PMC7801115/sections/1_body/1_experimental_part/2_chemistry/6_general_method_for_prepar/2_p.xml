<p>Solution of equimolar amounts of aldehydes 
 <bold>4a</bold>–
 <bold>4i</bold>, 2–(3,4-diaminophenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-1-ium chloride 
 <bold>3</bold>, and sodium metabisulfite as oxidising reagents in dimethyl sulfoxide, was heated for 15 min at 160 °C. After the reaction mixture was cooled, water was added and reaction mixture was made alkaline with 20% NaOH. The resulting free base was filtered off, washed with water and dried. The free base was suspended in absolute ethanol and concd HCl was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and the resulting precipitate was filtered off.
