<p>Cells were prepared for transport studies by seeding on 96-well cell culture inserts (Millipore, MA, USA) in a concentration of 0.25 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per ml. The cells were fed with fresh medium 24 h post seeding and cultured to confluence for 3 days before use. On the day of experiment, the cell monolayers were washed and equilibrated with transport medium (DPBS, pH 7.4 containing 1% DMSO) with or without P-gp specific inhibitor, elacridar (2 µM) for 45 min (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 95% humidity). Test compound solution consisted of test substance (10 μM) in D-PBS medium containing lucifer yellow (100 μM) and 1% DMSO. Transport assays were conducted in apical to basolateral (A2B) and basolateral to apical (B2A) directions, respectively. Monolayers were incubated with the compound solution for 60 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Apical and basolateral compartments were sampled at the end of the transport experiment, while donor solutions were also sampled at the beginning of the experiment in order to determine initial concentration. Test substance concentrations in both compartments were determined by LC-MS/MS. There were several controls used in the assay: 1) amprenavir (0.5 μM) served as a low permeable control, being also a P-gp substrate; 2) diclofenac (10 μM) was used as a high permeable control; 3) Lucifer yellow, a fluorescent marker for the paracellular membrane transport, was used as a control of cell monolayer integrity.
