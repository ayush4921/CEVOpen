<p>Cells were grown in 96 well Perfecta 3 D hanging drop plates 5000 cell/well for 4 days until spheres were formed (and checked under the microscope). After sphere formation cells were treated with compounds followed by 72 h incubation. Cell viability assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction, using CellTiter GLO 3 D for 3 D cell culture (Promega); cell incubation was 5 min on the shaker followed by 25 min incubation in the dark. Plates were read using PE EnVision luminescence. The results for each of tested compounds are reported as growth percentages from two independent concentrations curves compared with the untreated control cells after drug exposure.</p>
