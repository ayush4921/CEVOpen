<p>Mother plates (96-well-V plates, polypropylene, Greiner Bio-one, Cat. 651201) with serial dilutions of compounds in pure DMSO are prepared from 10 mM DMSO stock solutions on Janus automatic pipetting workstation (Perkin-Elmer). Compounds are diluted 1:3. 500 nL (for 2 D cell culture) or 400 nL (for 3 D cell culture) of compound were transferred from mother plate to test plate by using Mosquito (TTP labtech). DMSO percentage in test concentrations was 0.5 − 1.0%. Starting concentration of the test compounds and standard compound doxorubicin was 50 µM (2 D cell culture) or 100 µM (3 D cell culture).</p>
