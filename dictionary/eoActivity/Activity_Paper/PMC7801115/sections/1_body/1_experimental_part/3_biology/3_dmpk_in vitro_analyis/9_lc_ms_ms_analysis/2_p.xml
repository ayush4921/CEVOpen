<p>All ADME samples were analysed on a Sciex API 4000 or Sciex API4500 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) coupled to a UHPLC System (Shimadzu Nexera X2; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Samples were injected onto an UPLC column (HALO2 C18, 2.1 × 20 mm, 2 µm or Phenomenex Luna Omega Polar C18, 30 × 2.1 mm, 1.6 µm) and eluted with a gradient at temperature of 50 °C. The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid) and 0.1% formic acid in deionised water. A total run time was 1 or 1.5 min, with the flow rate of 0.7 ml/min (under gradient conditions). A positive ion mode with turbo spray, an ion source temperature of 500 °C and a dwell time of 150 ms were utilised for mass spectrometric detection. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used at the specific transitions for each compound/control tested: compound
