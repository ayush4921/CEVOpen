<p>The extent of binding to plasma proteins was assessed using equilibrium dialysis method. Plasma (human and mouse) was spiked with test compounds and three controls (nicardipine and verapamil in both species, acebutolol in human and caffeine in mouse plasma) to obtain final concentration of 5 µM (0.5%DMSO). Hydrated membranes were inserted into equilibrium dialysis unit (HT Dialysis) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The dialysate side was then loaded with appropriate volume of buffer, while the same volume of spiked plasma was added into sample side of the well. Incubation lasted 4 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Afterwards, protein precipitation was done by mixing matrix matched aliquot of plasma or buffer with 3 volumes of MeCN/MeOH (2:1) mixture, containing internal standard (diclofenac). After centrifugation (at 4500 rpm, at 4 °C, for 30 min) resulting supernatants were subjected to LC-MS/MS.</p>
