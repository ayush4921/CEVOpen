<p>In order to determine the lipophilicity range, Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index was measured by gradient reverse-phase HPLC at physiological pH. Sample working solutions were prepared from 10 mM DMSO stock solutions by dilution with acetonitrile to a final concentration of 1.25 mM and analysed on Agilent 1100 Series liquid chromatography system with HPLC diode-array detector (DAD) coupled with Micromass Quattro micro API mass spectrometer. Samples were injected onto an HPLC column (Phenomenex Luna C18, 50 × 3 mm, 5 µm) and eluted with a gradient at room temperature (sample temperature 15 °C). The mobile phase was composed of 50 mM Ammonium acetate, pH = 7.4 and acetonitrille. A total run time was 5 min, with the flow rate of 1 ml/min (under gradient conditions). The HPLC system was initially calibrated using the calibration set of 10 compounds with literature CHI values. The experimentally determined gradient retention times were plotted against the CHI
 <sub>7.4</sub> values published in the literature resulting in the equation obtained from linear regression analysis. This equation was further used for the calculation of CHI
 <sub>7.4</sub> for test compounds from determined retention times of the main chromatographic peak from UV chromatogram for each compound. The obtained CHI
 <sub>7.4</sub> values were further converted to Chrom log D
 <sub>7.4</sub> as follows: CHI
 <sub>7.4</sub> × 0.0857 − 2.
