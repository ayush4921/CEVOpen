<p>Proliferation assay was performed using Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, 48 h hours after compound addition, 10 µM of BrdU was added to each well and incubated for following 24 h. After incubation, single cell suspension was made for 3 D cell culture in the new 96 well plate. Plates were centrifuged and supernatants were removed from each plate (for 2 D and 3 D cell culture) followed by 60 min incubation at 60° C. The rest of the proliferation assay was performed according to the manufacturer instructions.</p>
