<p>Test compounds and assay controls (sulfaphenazole and α-naphtoflavone) were serially diluted in DMSO by factor 3.3x, 3x, 3.3x and 3x, resulting in a total of 5 different concentrations. Phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) was spiked with diluted test compounds and controls with final concentration range in the assay as follows: 100, 30, 10, 3 and 1 µM (1% DMSO). Plate was then incubated by gentle shaking (200–300 rpm) for 1 h and 45 min at 37 °C. After additional15 min on room temperature (without shaking), plate absorbance at 620 nm was measured with microplate reader Tecan, Infinite F500 (total incubation time = 2 h).</p>
