<p>Novel amidino substituted benzimidazole/benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>5i</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold>–
 <bold>6g</bold> were synthesised and tested for their antiproliferative activity using 2 D and 3 D assays. The compounds were prepared by using conventional synthetic methods. Obtained results revealed that in generaly, the benzothiazole derivatives were more active in comparison to their benzimidazole analogues with the exception of 2-phenyl substituted benzimidazole 
 <bold>6a</bold> which showed enhanced activity, especially for HCC827 cell lines. All active compounds showed strong activity in BrdU assay, in comparison with MTS assay especially for the NCI-H358 cell line.
