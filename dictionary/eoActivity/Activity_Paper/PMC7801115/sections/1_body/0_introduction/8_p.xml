<p>ADME properties are dependent of structural characteristics of newly synthesised molecules. Different modifications are undertaken and tested during early drug discovery in order to achieve better and improved drug-like properties

 </xref>. ADME characterisation represents an important step in the drug discovery process and it includes several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays covering physicochemical and biochemical properties such as solubility, lipophilicity, permeability, metabolic stability and binding to plasma proteins

 </xref>. Here, we have evaluated major ADME properties to see if compound’s activity, obtained in 3 D cell cultures, is the consequence of different physicochemical and biochemical properties in comparison with non-active compounds, as well as to see if compounds have drug-like properties and potential for further profiling in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models.
