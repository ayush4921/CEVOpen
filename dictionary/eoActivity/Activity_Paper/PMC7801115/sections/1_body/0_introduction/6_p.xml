<p>As we have describe previously

  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref>, two-dimensional (2 D) cell cultures are not able to imitate complex tumour structure as three-dimensional (3 D) cell cultures. Also, 3 D techniques have already great impact in screening of active new chemical entities (NCE) with potential antitumor activity. Among various 3 D methods we developed screening on 3 D spheroids because is more likely to tumour growth and physiology. Cytotoxicity and proliferation assays reads out give as two distinct characteristics of cells

 </xref>, therefore we tested compounds in MTS cytotoxicity assay and in BrdU proliferative assay performed on 2 D and 3 D assay format. For 2 D cell assay format, we used a classic two-dimensional
