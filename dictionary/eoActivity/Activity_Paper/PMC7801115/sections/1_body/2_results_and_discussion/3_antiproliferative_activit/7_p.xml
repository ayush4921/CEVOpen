<p>It is know that A49 cell line is less susceptible in comparison to other two cell lines and therefore IC
 <sub>50</sub>s values are higher. When compared to standard drugs, all derivatives were significantly less active except several compounds (
 <bold>5c–e, 5 g, 5 h</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold>) which were more active against A549 cell line in comparison to 
 <italic>vandetanib</italic>. Reagarding the obtained results of proliferation activity (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the smiliar results are obtained with the compounds 
 <bold>5c–e, 5 g, 5 h</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> being the most active ones.
