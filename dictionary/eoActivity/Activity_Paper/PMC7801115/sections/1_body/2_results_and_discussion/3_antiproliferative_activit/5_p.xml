<p>As presented in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, several compounds, mosty benzothiazole derivatives (
 <bold>5c–e, 5 g, 5 h</bold>) and one benzimidazole derivative 
 <bold>6a</bold>, displayed antitumor activity in 2 D as well as in 3 D assays against all three cancer cells. Benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> show same or slightly lower activity in 2 D MTS assay format in comparison to 3 D format. Benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5e</bold>, 
 <bold>5 g</bold>, 
 <bold>5 h</bold> activity was also same or lower in 2 D format in comparison with IC values on 3 D assay format with exception for A549 cell line (Tabel 1) where copmpounds showed higher activity in 3 D format. In proliferative (BrdU) assay, activity of benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, 
 <bold>5 g</bold> were same or lower on 2 D format in comparison to 3 D (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) while 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5 h</bold> showed same activity pattern prevous compounds with exception for A549 and NCI-H358 cell lines where activity were opposite: higher on 3 D assay format. The most potent compound was benzimidazole derivative 
 <bold>6a</bold> substituted with phenyl ring at position 2 with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values on both assays, MTS and BrdU, and in format assay, 2 D and 3 D.
