<p>To avoid that some prominent compounds can be discarded in early screening phase and to give a chance to further profiling only to compounds active on 2 D classical format assays, we tested compounds in both format assays 2 D and 3 D. Both assays were performed on 2 D and 3 D assay format. For 2 D cell assay format, we used a classic two-dimensional 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay and as 3 D assay, we used a hanging drop proliferation cell assay previously described.
