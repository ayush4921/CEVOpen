    "Newly synthesised benzimidazole/benzotiazole derivatives bearing amidino, namely 3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-1-ium chloride, substituents have been evaluated for their potential antitumor activity <i>in vitro</i>. Compounds and standard drugs (doxorubicin, staurosporine and vandetanib) were tested on three human lung cancer cell lines A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358. We tested compounds in MTS citotoxicity assay and in BrdU proliferative assay performed on 2 D and 3 D assay format. Because benzmidazole scaffold is similar to natural purines, we tested the most active compounds for ability to induce cell apoptosis of A549 by binding to DNA in comparison with doxorubicin and saturosporine. Additionally, the ADME properties of the most active benzothiazole/benzimidazole and non-active compounds were determined to see if the different ADME properties are the cause of different activity in 2 D and 3 D assays, as well as to see if the tested active compounds have drug like properties and potency for further profilation. ADME characterisation included solubility, lipophilicity, permeability, metabolic stability and binding to plasma proteins. In general, the benzothiazole derivatives were more active in comparison to their benzimidazole analogues. The exception was 2-phenyl substituted benzimidazole <b>6a</b> being active with very pronounced activity especially towards HCC827 cells. All active compounds have similar mode of action on A549 cell line as standard compound doxorubicin, which binds to nucleic acids with the DNA double helix. Tested active benzothiazole compounds were characterised by moderate to good solubility, good metabolic stability, low permeability and high binding to plasma proteins. One tested active benzimidazole derivative showed ADME properties, but lower lipophilicity resulted in low PPB and higher metabolic instability. In addition, no significant difference was observed in ADME profile between active and non-active compounds."
