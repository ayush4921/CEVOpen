<p id="par0010">Many natural product and traditional medicine databases such as TCMSP, TCMID, TCM-ID, SYMMAP, ETCM, NPASS and YATCM are now available as open-source. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , each of them is flooded with massive information including TCM formulas, herbs, ingredients, targets, diseases, and the details under the corresponding items. Of note, some of them were built by data mining and manually collection from TCM classics, research articles, and E-library, while others were even built by integrating different databases (both SYMMAP and TCMID integrate TCMSP and TCM-ID). So, the quality of collected information and the characteristics of each databases were worth considering. Moreover, the latest update time of TCMSP, TCMID, TM-MC, SYMMAP, CHEM-TCM, NPASS, ETCM, YATCM, and TCM-PTD was 2014, 2016, 2018, 2018, 2011, 2018, 2018, 2018, and 2012, respectively. It is questionable whether overly lagging knowledge can facilitate mechanistic investigations of TCM against COVID-19.
