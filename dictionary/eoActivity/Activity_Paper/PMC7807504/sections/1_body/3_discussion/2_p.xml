<p id="Par36">Many medicinal herbs have documented adverse effects on the male reproductive systems of experimental animals. It is known that aqueous or ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> L. (Indian bael), 
 <italic>Abrus precatorius</italic> L. (rosary pea), 
 <italic>Mimusops elengi</italic> L. (Spanish cherry) exhibit anti-spermatogenic and anti-fertility effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, L., a well-known and widely used herb, demonstrated anti-fertility effects in experimental animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Treatment of albino rats with aqueous rhizome extract of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> for 60 consecutive days decreased spermatozoon counts and their motility resulting in reduced fertility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Treatment of Wistar Albino rats with 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> L. preparation in doses 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg for 52 weeks induced azoospermia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L. extract treatment inhibited the Leydig cell activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. 
 <italic>Enicostemma axillare</italic> (Lam.) Raynal leaf and 
 <italic>Urena lobata</italic> L. (Caesarweed) root extracts inhibited spermatogenesis and steroidogenic activity of Leydig cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It should be noted that in most cases, these changes were reversible after 50–60 days after treatment withdrawal [
