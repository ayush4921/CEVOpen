<p id="Par38">PADE is a multi-constituent botanical drug. It comprises of catechins, gallic acid, coumaric acid, polysaccharides, phytosterols, and polymeric proanthocyanidins of unknown structure. It has been reported that treatment of mice with gallic acid prevents DNA fragmentation and testicular tissue atrophy induced by cyclophosphamide administration [

It is also possible that such components of PADE as gallic acid and catechins ameliorate effects of phytosterols on male reproductive system [
