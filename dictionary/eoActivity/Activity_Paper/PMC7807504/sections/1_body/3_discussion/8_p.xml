<p id="Par42">What are the clinical implications of the adverse effects observed in this study? Specifically, should PADE be prescribed to male patients with thyroid dysfunction? The reliability of studies investigating spermatotoxicity in animals was investigated by Elizabeth Rayburn and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. They examined 235 FDA-approved small molecule drugs with spermatotoxic effects, and only 49 had documented negative impact on men’s reproductive health. Notably, 155 medications were determined to be spermatotoxic in animals but had no human data. Authors concluded that current animal studies assessing drug spermatotoxic effects are not particularly good predictors of the drug effect on men’s reproductive health. Currently, we can only speculate whether dose escalation in clinical trials (e.g., median therapeutic dose and dose exceeding therapeutic dose by 5 times) will have similar effect on men’s reproductive system. Potentially, results from this animal study can be used to model the exposure-response relationship and adverse outcomes in humans.
