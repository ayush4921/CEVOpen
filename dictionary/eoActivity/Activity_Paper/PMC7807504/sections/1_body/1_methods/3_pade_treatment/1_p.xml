<p id="Par17">Both male and female rats were randomly assigned to either control or experiment groups. Freshly prepared 2.5% aqueous PADE solution was administered every morning to male rats by gavage at doses of 25 mg/kg and 125 mg/kg for 60 consecutive days prior to mating. The low PADE dose represented a dose approximately equal to median effective dose for rats (20 mg/kg, ED
 <sub>50</sub>) and 8 times higher than median therapeutic dose recommended for clinical trials (3.1 mg/kg). High dose administered to experimental animals was 40 times higher than therapeutic recommended for clinical trials. The dose of the extract was calculated based on body weight, which was determined when the animal was last weighted. The animals were weighed once a week. Male rats receiving water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O) were used as controls. Twenty to thirty male rats were used in each group. After completing the treatment, half of PADE-treated and control males were used to determine PADE gonadotoxicity, and the remaining half of PADE-treated and control males were mated with intact females. Two female rats were housed with one male for two estrus cycles. Vaginal smears were evaluated daily for the estrus cycle and the presence of sperm. At the time of insemination, females were separated from males. All experiments described in this study were repeated twice.
