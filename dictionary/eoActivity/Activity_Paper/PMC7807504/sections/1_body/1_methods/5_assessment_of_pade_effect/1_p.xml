<p id="Par19">Evaluation of the gonadotoxic effects of PADE was conducted the day after treatment completion. The functional conditions of spermatozoa were evaluated by assessing sperm motility and the percentage of pathologic forms. Sperm was obtained immediately after euthanizing rats by vortexing a longitudinally cut-open epididymis in 10â€‰ml of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) for 2 min. The sperm suspension was placed into the hemocytometer. Total and motile spermatozoon numbers were counted. A minimum of 200 spermatozoa per animal was counted. Sperm motility was presented as a percentage of motile sperm in a sample.</p>
