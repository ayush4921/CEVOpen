<p id="Par22">To evaluate the testicular morphology, a 10 mm testicular piece was fixed in 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Ten μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The index of spermatogenesis was used to evaluate the spermatogenic competence of the testes quantitatively. The number of spermatogenic epithelium layers was counted in 100 convoluted seminiferous tubules. The index of spermatogenesis was calculated as the following: IS = (a1*n + a2*n + a3*n + a4*n)/100, where a1*n is the number of convoluted seminiferous tubules containing one layer (spermatogonia), a2*n is the number of convoluted seminiferous tubules containing two layers (spermatogonia and spermatocytes); a3*n is the number of convoluted seminiferous tubules containing three layers (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids); and 4a*n is the number of convoluted seminiferous tubules containing four layers (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, spermatozoa).</p>
