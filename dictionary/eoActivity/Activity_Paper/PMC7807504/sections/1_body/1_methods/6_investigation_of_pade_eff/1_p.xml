<p id="Par24">Pregnant rats were divided into two cohorts. Cohort 1 was used to study PADE’s impact on fetal growth, and cohort 2 was used to research offspring development. Pregnant rats of cohort 1 (8–11 dams in each group) were sacrificed on day 20 of pregnancy by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The number of corpora lutea, the status of each implant site (live/dead embryo, early/late resorption), and embryo body weight were determined. Cohort 2 (8–11 dams in each group) was left to deliver their offspring naturally. Weight gain and survival of the born offspring were assessed and recorded on day 21 after birth. The development of motor-sensory reflexes of the progeny (open field test) was evaluated on day 30 after birth. The open field apparatus consisted of an unobstructed field with walls preventing animal escape. The field is marked with black and white squares. The corners of each square had round holes. Each test animal was placed into the field for 3 min. An investigator recorded the number of squares crossed by the rat, how many times animal was rearing, grooming, defecating and head dipping into the holes.</p>
