<p id="Par27">Repeated oral administration of PADE to male rats at a 25 mg/kg dose did not significantly affect the total number of spermatozoa compared to the control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Significantly reduced number of motile forms was observed (

A higher percent of spermatozoa pathological forms were found in the testis of male rats treated with 25 mg/kg compared with the testis of the control group. These differences were statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Also, a morphological study of the testis of rats treated with a low dose of PADE revealed a statistically significant decrease in the spermatogenesis index compared to controls (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), indicating a suppression of the spermatogenesis. The testicular weight was not affected by the treatment.
