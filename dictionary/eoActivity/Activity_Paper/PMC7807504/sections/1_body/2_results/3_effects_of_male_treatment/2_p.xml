<p id="Par31">Interestingly, the treatment of male rats with 125 mg/kg of PADE decreased the number of resorptions per dam and the percent of post-implantation fetal death but increased the percent of pre-implantation death compared to the control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, the reduction in the number of resorptions and percentages of post-implantation fetal death as well as the increase in pre-implantation death were not statistically significant.
