<p id="Par26">The results presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> demonstrate that oral treatment of male rats with 25 or 125 mg/kg (8 times and 40 times ED
 <sub>50</sub>, respectively) for 60 days before mating with intact female rats resulted in an approximately 5% decrease in fertility index. These changes, however, were not statistically significant when compared to the control group receiving H
 <sub>2</sub>O by the gavage. All fertilized female rats became pregnant.
