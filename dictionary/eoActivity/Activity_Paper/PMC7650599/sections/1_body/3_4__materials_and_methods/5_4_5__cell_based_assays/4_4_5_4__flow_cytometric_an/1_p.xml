<p>Apoptosis/necrosis analysis was performed on HepG2 cells after 48 hours’ treatment by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter’s CytoFLEX and Cytexpert software, version 2.4) using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining as described in a previous study [

 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The percentages of cells in different phases (G0/G1, S and G2M phases) were quantified from propidium iodide fluorescence intensity-area (PI-A) histograms corresponding to the DNA content of HepG2 cells.
