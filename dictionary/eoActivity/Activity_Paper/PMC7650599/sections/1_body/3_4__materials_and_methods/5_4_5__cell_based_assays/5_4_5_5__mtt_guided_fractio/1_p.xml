<p>The total extract of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> was solubilized in distilled water and sequentially partitioned with ethyl acetate, followed by n-butanol. Each fraction was dried and its cytotoxicity evaluated against SW872, A549 and HepG2 using the MTT cell viability assay. The butanol fraction selective towards HepG2 cells was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (30 × 2.1 cm internal diameter) and eluted with water, water/methanol (3:1 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 1:1 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> and 1:3 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, respectively), methanol and acetone. The flow rate was maintained at 1.5 mL/min. Guided by the cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells and purity profile, potent sub-fractions were further fractionated using a semi-preparative HPLC column. The crude extract and thereof-derived purified sub-fractions were analyzed by extensive spectroscopic methods including GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC, 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR (Supporting Information). For analytical HPLC, the concentration of standards in the crude extract was determined from the linear regression of the analytical standard curves, namely 
 <italic>y</italic> = 12.317 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9996: gallic acid; and 
 <italic>y</italic> = 16.066 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9992: methyl gallate.
