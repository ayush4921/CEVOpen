<p>Electrophoresis was conducted for 30 min at 30 volts and 350 mA. The gels were neutralized by immersing in pre-chilled neutralization buffer (0.4 Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4 °C) for 10 min in the dark. The slides were washed in distilled water, fixed with 4 % formalin solution for 20 min and allowed to air-dry overnight. The slides were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/mL), air-dried in the dark and visualized at 200× magnification in DAPI light cube (Ex: 357/44 nm; Em: 447/60 nm), using an EVOS fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies). Damaged DNA was measured for 100 randomly selected cells (for each independent experiment) using the Comet Assay IV 4.3.1 (Perceptive instrument, Suffolk, UK).</p>
