<p>The effect of the 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract on the cell reproductive death was assessed by clonogenic cell survival assay according to reported methods, with slight modifications [

 <xref rid="B77-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. HepG2 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (500/well) and allowed to attach overnight. Following a 48-h treatment period with plant extract/control, the media was replaced with fresh complete culture media and cells were grown under standard recommended culture conditions for an additional 7 days to allow large colonies’ formation. Colonies were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with 0.5% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) crystal violet. The individual wells were imaged using a digital camera and the colonies counted using ImageJ software, version 1.51 (the US, National Institute of Health). The cytotoxic effect was expressed as the percentage of surviving colonies relative to the untreated control.
