<p>The deoxyribose degradation inhibitory assay protocol was optimized to a 24-well microtiter plate format. Each well contained 50 µL of aqueous extract, 50 µL of 1 mM EDTA, 100 µL of 500 µM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 50 µL of 1 mM ascorbic acid, 50 µL of 10 mM hydrogen peroxide, 100 µL of 100 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) and 100 µL of 15 mM 2-deoxyribose. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. At the end of the incubation period, 500 µL of 10% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid followed by 500 µL of 1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) thiobarbituric acid were added to each well and the solutions were heated in a water bath at 80 °C for 20 min to develop the pink chromogen. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 532 nm, both before and after incubation. Results were given in mg lyophilized extract/mL.
