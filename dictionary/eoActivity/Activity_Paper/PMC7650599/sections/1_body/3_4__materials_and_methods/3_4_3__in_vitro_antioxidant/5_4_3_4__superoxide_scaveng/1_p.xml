<p>The final 250 µL reaction volume for the superoxide anion scavenging assay contained 25 µL of plant extract (concentrations between 0 and 300 µg/mL), 100 µL of 156 µM of nitroblue tetrazolium, 100 µL of 200 µM beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced disodium salt hydrate and 30 µL of phenazine methosulphate. The absorbance was read at 560 nm following 30 min incubation at 25 °C.</p>
