<p>To assess the antiproliferative properties of the 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract on cancer cells, first, the influence of the extracts on the cell viabilities of five cancer cell lines, notably human liposarcoma (SW872), human lung carcinoma (A549), human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-8 cells, was investigated using the methyl thiazolyl diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> suppressed the growth of all cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. However, the dose of extract required to reach the half-maximal inhibitory concentration differed considerably among the various cancer cell types. The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> was also evaluated against the non-malignant human ovarian epithelial (HOE) cells and the 
 <italic>IC
  <sub>50</sub>

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). HepG2 cells were more sensitive to 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> treatment (selective index value 2.4 compared to HOE cells) (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At 48 h of exposure, the highest concentration of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> extract (100 µg/mL) reduced HepG2 cell viability to 20% as compared to the untreated control cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Subsequently, the effect of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> extract on the replicative ability of HepG2 cells was evaluated using the clonogenic cell survival assay. 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> treatment significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) reduced the number of surviving HepG2 colonies as compared to untreated control cells (
