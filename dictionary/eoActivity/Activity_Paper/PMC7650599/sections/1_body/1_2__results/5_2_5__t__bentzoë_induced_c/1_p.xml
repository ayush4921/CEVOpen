<p>The proportion and distribution of HepG2 cells stained by annexin V- fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) after 48 h of exposure to 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> extract are illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. The results indicated that, at a concentration equivalent to 10 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL, the distribution pattern of the cell populations in the different quadrants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) is similar to that of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. However, the exposure of HepG2 cells for 48 h at 40 µg/mL stimulated a significant increase in annexin V (1.41-fold, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and PI (1.52-fold, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) fluorescence compared to the control. This increase is notably reflected in a higher percentage of necrotic cells (11.7%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared to the DMSO control (4.33%), indicating apoptotic/necrotic cell death at this test concentration. Etoposide significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis (between 10% and 12%)/necrosis (between 16% and 21%) at all three test doses, relative to DMSO control.
