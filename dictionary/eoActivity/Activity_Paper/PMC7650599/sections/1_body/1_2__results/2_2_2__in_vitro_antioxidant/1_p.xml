<p>An array of five analytical models was used to benchmark the antioxidant potential of the investigated leaf extracts. The Mascarene endemic plant leaf extracts exhibited a varying degree of activities in the different antioxidant assays. All extracts showed a dose-dependent metal chelating and free radical scavenging activity (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In terms of iron chelation, all the extracts were weak chelators compared to EDTA, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.01 ± 0.00 mg/mL (23.6 ± 0.22 µM) (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). As depicted in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, among the seven accessions of plants, 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> showed the most effective antioxidant potential in all the five antioxidant assays. Thus, the free radical quenching activity of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> was further evaluated in a hydroxyl radical scavenging assay. 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25 ± 0.03 mg/mL) exhibited a significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) greater degree of protection against Fenton-mediated oxidative damage to 2-deoxyribose sugar moiety as compared to gallic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.65 ± 0.09 mg/mL).
