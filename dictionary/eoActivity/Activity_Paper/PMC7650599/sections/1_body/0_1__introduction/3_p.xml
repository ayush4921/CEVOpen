<p>Phytogeography investigations revealed that the Mascarene endemic plants have their ancestral lineages tracing back to Madagascar [

As such, the unique floral biodiversity of Mauritius is expected to possess similar medicinal and therapeutic prolificacy as the Madagascan rain forest. However, instead of conserving such valuable biodiversity, human activities are pushing endemic taxa towards an unprecedented extinction crisis. In less than 400 years of human settlement, Mauritius has witnessed the shrinking of its native forest to around 5% of the original cover, leading to the permanent loss of 30 (10.9%) of its endemic plant species and driving 81.7% of the remnant endemic taxa to the brink of extinction [

Nevertheless, the remnant areas of the pristine forest are still home to a plethora of endemic flora rich in high genetic diversity, representing interesting sources for complementary and alternative medicine, nutraceuticals, as well as pharmaceutical leads [
