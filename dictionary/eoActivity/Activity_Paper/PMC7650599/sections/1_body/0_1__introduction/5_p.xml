<p>The tropical island of Mauritius is known for its endemic biodiversity richness [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, human activities on the island have provoked the irreversible loss of a considerable fraction of this genetic resource. For instance, in less than four centuries, Mauritius has lost 95% of its pristine forest cover, accounting for the extinction of 10.9% of the island’s endemic flora [
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The scarcity of rigorous scientific data on the surviving endemic taxa renders the bioprospecting of this untapped resource of utmost importance. With this in mind, and in view of providing solid foundations to enforce stringent conservation policies, the in vitro antioxidant propensities of leaf extracts from seven plants endemic to Mascarene islands were investigated, in relation to their polyphenolic content. The plants under study have documented traditional uses against ailments ranging from dermatological conditions, to asthma, to infectious diseases (

 <italic>Terminalia bentzoë</italic>, on a panel of cancer cell lines, and its ability to impede the cell cycle progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were determined. The bioactive constituents in 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract were characterized following bioassay-guided fractionation.
