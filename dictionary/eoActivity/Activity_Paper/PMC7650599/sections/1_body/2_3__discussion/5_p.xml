<p>The cytotoxicity of different 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species against multiple cancerous cell lines is documented. The investigation of the cytotoxic activity of methanolic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> against human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells led to the isolation of bioactive ursolic acid (triterpenoid) [

 <italic>T. chebula</italic> suppressed the growth of human breast and lung cancer cell lines [

 <italic>T. catappa</italic> significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) suppressed the proliferation of the human colorectal (SW480) cell line in a dose-dependent manner by downregulating the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) gene expression while upregulating the levels of Caspase 9 and Caspase 3, indicative of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in SW480 cells [
