<p>LC-MS analysis in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy allowed the identification of eight phenolic compounds from the most bioactive subfraction F6. Punicalagin, isoterchebulin and ellagic acid have been previously reported from the bark extract of the same species collected in Réunion Island [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the other identified compounds are being reported for the first time, to the best of our current knowledge, in 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf, some were reported in the leaf extracts of other 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species. For instance, 2”-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylvitexin and gallic acid were identified from 
 <italic>T. brachystemma</italic> Welw. ex Hiern and 
 <italic>T. mollis</italic> M. Laws leaves, respectively [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Likewise, terflavin A was found in the 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> L. leaf [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
