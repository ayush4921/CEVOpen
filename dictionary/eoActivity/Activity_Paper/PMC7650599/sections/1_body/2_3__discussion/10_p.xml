<p>It is noteworthy that the cytotoxicity of the extract may arise from the complex interplay of the cocktails of secondary metabolites present, which may act either synergistically or antagonistically to produce the overall results. Furthermore, crude extracts often comprised a pool of inactive phytoconstituents that dilute the efficacy of the active components [

 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is therefore of paramount importance to purify and identify the principal bioactive components to conduct further mechanistic studies to establish their molecular mode of action [
