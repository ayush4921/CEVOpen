<p>This study also attempted to delineate the mode of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic>-induced HepG2 cell death. The flow cytometric analysis of annexin V-FITC and PI dual stained HepG2 cells treated with 40 µg/mL revealed a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increase in both Annexin V-FITC and PI fluorescence levels, compared to the untreated control, thus indicating the putative activation of both apoptotic and necrotic pathways in HepG2 cells. Cells grown as monoculture are known to initiate apoptosis, which is terminated by necrosis-like events, also termed as secondary necrosis, due to the absence of phagocytic scavenger cells [
