<p>Punicalagin and ellagic acid were reported to induce S Phase arrest and G0/G1 phase arrest in HepG2 cells, respectively [
 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, punicalagin induced G0/G1 phase arrest in papillary human thyroid carcinoma (BCPAP) cells via the NF-κB signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In human ovarian cancer (A2780) cells, punicalagin treatment was associated with an increase in the number of cells arrested at the G1/S phase, as well as the downregulation of the β-catenin signaling pathway [

 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract may be a synergistic effect of the identified compounds. Gallic acid was reported to induce S phase arrest in HepG2 cells [
 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and be cytotoxic to ovarian cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B72-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Furthermore, gallic acid was also shown to impair centrosomal clustering in human cervical cancer (Hela) cells, thus causing a mitotic catastrophe and ultimate cell G2/M phase cell cycle arrest.
