<p>Given the ubiquitous involvement of oxidative damage in carcinogenesis, antioxidant-rich secondary metabolites, notably polyphenolics, have attracted much interest in the search of novel and alternative treatment modalities for cancer [

 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this vein, in vitro antioxidant activities often correlated strongly with growth inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines [

However, it is crucial to note that both ROS and antioxidants have a “Janus-faced” effect in cancer management, as their effects differ in the early events of cancer initiation from those seen in the survival and propagation of established tumors [

 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On one hand, where a moderate ROS level promotes the transformation of normal cells to malignant cells, elevating the ROS level in cancer cells beyond the cell tolerance threshold may promote oxidative stress-induced cell cytotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It should be noted that many standard chemotherapies cause cancer cell death via the generation of ROS and excessive oxidation [
