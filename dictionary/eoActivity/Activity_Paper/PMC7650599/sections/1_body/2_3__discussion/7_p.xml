 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> crude extract with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 22.8 ± 1.3 µg/mL can be considered as a potent candidate for further investigation with regards to its anticancer potential. It is known that, following exposure to toxicants, a subpopulation of cells enters a dormant state. These dormant viable cells further retain their ability to replicate into stem-like progeny cells, which might lead to the development of drug-resistance and cancer relapse [

 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, while investigating the potential anticancer effect of extracts, it is warranted to also evaluate their long-term effect on the replicative ability of the cancer cell line. The colony formation assay is a simple and useful in vitro model, considered as the gold standard to predict the long-term sensitivity of cancer cell response to therapeutics treatment [

 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> to impede the replicative potential of HepG2 cells (
