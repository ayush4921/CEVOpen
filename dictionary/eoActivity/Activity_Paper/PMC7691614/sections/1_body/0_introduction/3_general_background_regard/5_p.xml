 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> L. (Annonacea), known as graviola (Portuguese), guanabana (Spanish), Stachelannone (German) or soursop (English), grows as a tree and is endemic to the warmest areas of the tropics of South and Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, it has been distributed very early to eastern and western Africa, Asia and to south‐east China (Wahab et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Various preparations from fruits and other plant parts of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> are marketed worldwide as over‐the‐counter food supplements that are purported to support general health or to treat a wide range of health conditions, particularly cancer and parasitic infections (Badrie and Schauss,

 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, open questions remain regarding their safety since Annonaceae have been reported to contain potentially neurotoxic compounds, i.e. acetogenins. 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> is also listed in the
