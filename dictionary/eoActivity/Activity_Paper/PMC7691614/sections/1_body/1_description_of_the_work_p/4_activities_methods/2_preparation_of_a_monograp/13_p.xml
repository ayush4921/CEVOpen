<p>In cases where relevant information from safety testing is lacking for certain botanicals and thus the data situation does not provide a sufficient basis for a comprehensive risk assessment, it has been suggested by EFSA to follow a presumption of safety approach. This approach implies that for botanicals traditionally consumed as food, it is assumed that intake, i.e. via supplements or fortified foods, that corresponds to the intake via traditional or normal diet does not pose a risk (EFSA, 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, due to the lack of information on traditional or background exposure to 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> or constituents thereof via food, the application of the presumption of safety approach for the use of 
 <italic>A.Â muricata</italic> and derived preparations, including preparations marketed as herbal food supplements, is currently not feasible.
