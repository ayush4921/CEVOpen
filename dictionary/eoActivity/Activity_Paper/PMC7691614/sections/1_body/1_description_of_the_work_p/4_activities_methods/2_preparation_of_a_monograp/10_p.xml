<p>Among retrieved animal studies, some ‘classical’ toxicological 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed that the exposure to annonacin (whether in the form of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> extracts or as purified phytochemical), induced serious neuropathologies in rodents (Champy et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Lannuzel et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Yamada et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). For instance, after i.v. application of annonacin over 28 days to rats, annonacin accumulated in the brain parenchyma, decreased brain ATP levels, induced neuropathological abnormalities in the basal ganglia and loss of nigral and striatal neurons in exposed animals (Champy et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Moreover, following 1‐year oral exposure to 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> fruit juice, increased numbers of neurons with phosphorylated tau proteins in several brain regions were observed in wild‐type and human tau protein transgenic mice (Rottscholl et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). No further toxicological long‐term animal studies with 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> preparations were identified.
