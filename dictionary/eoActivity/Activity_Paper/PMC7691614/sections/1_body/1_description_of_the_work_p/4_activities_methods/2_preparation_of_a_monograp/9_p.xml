<p>Regarding the use of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> in food supplements, scientific information from human intervention studies, which might be used for safety evaluation of 
 <italic>A. muricata,</italic> is currently lacking. This represents a major data gap that impedes risk assessment, especially in the case when long‚Äêterm use of high supplemental 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> doses is intended. Along these lines, the importance to include a detailed documentation regarding the incidence of adverse effects and measurements of clinical safety parameters in any future intervention studies is underlined.
