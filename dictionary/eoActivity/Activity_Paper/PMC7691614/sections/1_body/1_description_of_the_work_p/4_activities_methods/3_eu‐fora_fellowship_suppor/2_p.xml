<p>During the introductory phase of the fellowship, the fellow obtained general information on risk assessment activities performed within the BfR Department of Food Safety, as well as in the hosting Unit Nutritional Risks, Allergies and Novel Foods. Furthermore, the fellow was supported by appropriate supervision to obtain experience in risk assessment of ‘other substances’ used in food supplements or fortified foods, with a focus on substances of plant origin (‘botanicals’, i.e. plant preparations and secondary plant compounds) and regular consultations in this regard with the supervisor as well as with other colleagues. At the BfR, the fellow participated in regular short seminars organised by the Department of Food Safety, with presentations on food safety‐related (
