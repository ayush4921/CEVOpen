<p>Since the green revolution and the introduction of fertilizer-consuming cultivars, the consumption of chemical fertilizers has been widely increased. Soil fertility improvement is mainly achieved through the use of chemical fertilizers, which their high consumption is a threat to environment and human health (Kordi, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In this regard, some issues concerning soil like erosion, salinity, acidification, and decline in qualitative and quantitative properties of surface-area soils as well as other issues such as contaminating surface and groundwater, devastating biodiversity, reduced soil biological activities, and finally increasing cost of crop production are consequences of illogical using of chemical fertilizers (Kordi et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Some conditions, such as climatic and nutrient factors suitable for plant growth, are the most important factors affecting growth of medicinal plants and their active components quantitatively and qualitatively (Street, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, alternative sources of fertilizer and the use of organic fertilizers (e.g., N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria) are considered as sustainable agriculture options to improve soil quality in modern agriculture (Chen et al.,
