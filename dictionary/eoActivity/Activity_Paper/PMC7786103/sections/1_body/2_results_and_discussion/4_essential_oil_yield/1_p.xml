<p>The result revealed that highest yield of EO of sweet basil was achieved by sole cropping with application of N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer in second harvest of second year (30.8 kg ha
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>) (

Sole cropping yielded more EO than did other cropping practices due to lack of interspecific competition, lack of shade, and having sufficient space for extending vegetative organs in order to take advantage of available resources. These beneficial factors allowed plants to expand their height and lateral branches. In keeping with the direct relationship between light irradiation and EO production reported by Amaki et al. (
