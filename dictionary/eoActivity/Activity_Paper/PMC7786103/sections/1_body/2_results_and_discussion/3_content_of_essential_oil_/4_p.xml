<p>The mean comparisons of cropping pattern × harvest showed that sole cropping of sweet basil in second harvest produced the highest content of EO (0.79%) while the lowest was recorded by intercropping forage maize + 100% basil at first harvest (0.56%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Although all harvests were performed at identical growth stage, plants of second and third harvests generated more secondary metabolite due to abundant light and more photosynthesis activities. Jahan et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) stated that among all harvests, the first harvest of sweet basil produced lowest EO content. The mean comparisons of year of experiment × harvest showed that highest EO content (0.73%) was found in second harvest of second year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As the number of leaf and inflorescence in second year were higher than those of first year (unpublished data), and as well as more EO content of sweet basil is found in leaf and flower, it was expected that rate of EO content in second year to be higher than that of first one
