<p>According to the results of this research, it seems that there is an inverse relationship between EO content of sweet basil and using nitrogen chemical fertilizer. The superiority of controls over other treatments, i.e., nitrogen chemical fertilizer and an integration of N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer with high biological yield, is attributed to an increase in secondary metabolite under environmental stress and nutritional deficiency conditions. Nitrogen chemical fertilizer and an integration of N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer adequately paved the way for plants to grow adequately through supplying nutritional resources. Khalediyan et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) stated that EO yield of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum and Satureja hortensis</italic> was significantly increased due to N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria treatments compared to control plants.
