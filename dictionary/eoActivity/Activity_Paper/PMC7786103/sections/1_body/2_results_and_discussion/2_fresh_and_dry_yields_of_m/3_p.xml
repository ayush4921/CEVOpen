<p>The highest and lowest fresh and dry yields of maize have shown by nitrogen chemical fertilizer and control (without-fertilizer) treatments, respectively (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Application of 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> resulted in 12% extra dry yield of maize, compared with the control. It seems that application nitrogen fertilizer plays a significant role in increasing plant's vegetative growth and consequently paves the way for increasing the yield of forage corn. An increase in the rate of applied nitrogen and also its effect on physiological processes resulted in more photosynthesis, assimilation, dry matter and yield. In other words, due to nitrogen-fixing and the effects of nitrogen-fixing bacteria on secreting growth regulator as well as stimulating plant's growth, the forage corn's yield was increased through application of nitroxin biofertilizer as compared to control. The positive role of nitrogen on qualitative and quantitative traits of corn such as dry weight has been proved (Cox et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). In this respect, Nanda et al. (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) also showed that inoculating corn's seeds with nitrogen-fixing bacteria under field conditions caused to increase the yield compared with different levels of nitrogen fertilizer. By 2-year planting two types of corn seeds in the field (i.e., the inoculated seeds with free living N-fixing bacteria and non-inoculated seeds as control group) under different treatments of consumption and non-consumption of nitrogen, Rohitashav et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) found that the yield of dry matter of forage was higher due to inoculation benefits. Hernandez et al. (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) also reported that inoculating seeds with nitrogen-fixing bacteria enhanced the fresh weight of aerial parts of plant and the number of leaves per plant.
