<p>As can be seen, in all treatments the LER values were higher than 1 (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), which indicates advantage of intercropping relative to sole cropping. Meanwhile, N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria application significantly enhanced LER in both 2018 and 2019. The maximum LER (1.56) was achieved from maize + 100% sweet basil + N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria in 2018 and the minimum (1.17) in maize + 25% sweet basil + without fertilizer in 2019 (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The great efficiency of the intercropping systems found in the present research as supported by higher total LER is consistent with Baumann et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) findings, who attributed this phenomenon to the supplementary use of resources in plant production allowing an interspecific facilitation. Based on the findings of Hauggaard-Nielsen et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), the calculated LER demonstrated that plant growth resources were used from 27 to 31% more efficiently by intercrop than the sole crop. Khalediyan et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) indicated that LER, land utilization efficiency (LUE), relative value total (RVT) and time equivalent ratio (ATER) in intercropping were more than sole cropping.
