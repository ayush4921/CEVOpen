<p>The result showed that the highest fresh and dry yields of sweet basil were obtained by sole cropping of sweet basil and using integration of 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer in second year of experiment (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Both years did not have the same effect on the mentioned traits, due to difference between climatic conditions in those periods, such that appropriate climate in early of second year caused plants to have a better establishment and growth consequently, led to more photosynthesis activities and yield. The higher fresh and dry yields in sole cropping of sweet basil can be attributed to the homogeneous environment in monoculture system (Amani-Machiani et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This demonstrated that the interspecific competition in the sweet basil + forage maize intercropping system was higher than the intraspecific competition in sole cropping system (Xie and Kristensen, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Amani-Machiani et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). On the other hand, the high competitive ability of forage maize compared to sweet basil in different intercropping patterns led to a significant decrement in sweet basil yield, likely due to shade from the maize. In a study, it was found that among different cropping patterns, higher fresh and dry yields of sweet basil were gained by its sole cropping relative to its intercropping with maize (Bagheri et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Amani-Machiani et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) indicated that the peppermint biomass in intercropping with faba bean (
 <italic>Vicia faba</italic> L.) was significantly less than sole crop of peppermint. As nitrogen enhances plant's vegetative growth and consequently improves its yield, accordingly the more nitrogen is used by plants, by impacting on physiological processes, increases photosynthesis activities and produces more assimilate, biomass, and eventually yield. Due to effects of 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> on nitrogen fixing and secreting growth activator in comparison to control, the yield of sweet basil was significantly increased by application 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> (Ghilavizadeh et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Pe≈°akovic et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
