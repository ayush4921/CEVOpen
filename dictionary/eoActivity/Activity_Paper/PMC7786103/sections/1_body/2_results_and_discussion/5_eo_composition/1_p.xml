<p>In addition to quantity, the quality (in terms of type and number of constituents) of EO is also received great attentions while cultivation medicinal plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The analysis of EO carried out on aerial organs of sweet basil in different treatments revealed the presence of 23–32 constituents (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). As some of detected constituents such as 1,8-cineol, terpinolene, α-cubebene, eugenol, β-cubebene, β-elemen, and α-zingiberene were not observed in all treatments but found in small quantities in some treatments, they were not presented in tables. In current research, the results revealed that the types of EO components of in both years of experiments could remarkably vary depending on type of treatment. In both years, eight constituents including methyl chavicol (17.24–51.28%), Z-citral (neral) (8.33–24.3%), geranial (10.2–31.3%), (E)-caryophyllene (1.05–5.64%), α-
 <italic>trans</italic>-bergamotene (0.53–1.7%), α-humulene (0.4–1.69%), germacrene-D (0.2–1.88%), and (Z)-α-bisabolene (1.16–3.86%) were the main constituents of EO. In order to monitor the change occurred in type and amount of EO's constituents, their relative contents in different treatments were carefully assayed. The highest amount of methyl chavicol in first (51.03%) and second (51.28%) years were achieved by sole cropping of sweet basil with nitrogen chemical fertilizer (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), while the lowest were obtained in first and second years (17.24 and 38.2%, respectively) by sole cropping of sweet basil without-fertilizer. In both years, the highest content of methyl chavicol was found through sole cropping of sweet basil with nitrogen chemical fertilizer followed by sole cropping of sweet basil with an integration of 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer. The availability of nitrogen in chemical fertilizer and also the lack of competition among plants of sweet basil under sole cropping seemingly increased methyl chavicol concentration compared to other treatments. Zheljazkov et al. (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) stated that nitrogen markably changed the amount of linalool, eugenol, bornil acetate and eucalyptol of EO of sweet basil. They continued that application of more nitrogen increased methyl chavicol while it decreased linalool of EO. The highest content of Z-citral (neral) (24.3 and 16.6%), geranial (31.3 and 21.94%), and (E)-caryophyllene (5.64 and 3.27%) were observed by an intercropping of forage maize + 25% basil and without–fertilizer in first and second years of experiment, respectively. Likewise, the highest levels of α-humulene (1.69 and 1.4%), germacrene-D (1.88 and 0.65%) were found in intercropped forage maize + 100% basil without-fertilizer in first and second years of experiment, respectively (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). It appears that some factors like nutrient deficiency (especially nitrogen deficiency in the control without fertilizer) and level of plants competition over light and nutrient resources under intercropping pattern could be considered as factors stimulating more production of these constituents. Main constituents of EO are affected by diverse factors: water stress, salt stress, and nutrition deficiencies resulting in change in EO constituents (Barbieri et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ekren et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).
