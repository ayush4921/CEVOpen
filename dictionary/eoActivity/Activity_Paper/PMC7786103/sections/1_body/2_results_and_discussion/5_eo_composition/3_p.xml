<p>Compared to first year of experiment, all treatments gained markedly higher methyl chavicol in second year of experiment. By contrast, the rate of Z-citral (neral), geranial, germacrene-D and (E)-caryophyllene were higher in the first year of experiment. Although (E)-Î²-ocimene was observed in all treatments in the first year, it was not observed in second year. As the relative percentage of EO constituents usually changed (even) daily and it also was affected by a great deal of factors, it is expected that compositions fluctuated during both years of experiments, however the main constituents were identical in both years. The lowest content of main constituents in EO, except methyl chavicol, was observed in a cropping pattern in which nitrogen chemical fertilizer was employed. Thus, application of

 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer is advisable to enhance the quality of EO. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), as a growth stimulator, is able to change environmental conditions and constituents of EO with different mechanisms such as increasing nitrogen fixation and available nitrate, producing auxin and gibberellin, secreting antibiotics, and enhancing root growth and development as well as promoting water and nutrients uptake (Prasad et al.,
