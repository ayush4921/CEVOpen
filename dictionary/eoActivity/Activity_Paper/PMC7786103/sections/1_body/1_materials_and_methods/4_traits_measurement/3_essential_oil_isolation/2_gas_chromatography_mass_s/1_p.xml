<p>The EO samples were analyzed in a gas chromatograph Agilent model 7890 using HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm in thickness). The oven temperature was programmed from 50°C (held for 2 min) and increased to 240°C at a rate of 3°C/min then 240–300°C at a rate of 15°C/min. The constant flow rate of helium as carrier gas was 1 mL/min. The mass spectra were recorded on electron ionization (EI) mode, with ionization energy of 70 eV. The temperature at the injection site was 290°C. The identification of chemical constituents was done based on the retention indices (calculated using from C8 to C20 alkanes) and through analyzing the mass spectra compared to a computer databank (Wiley 7 and Nist 62) (Adams,
