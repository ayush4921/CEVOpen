<p>The sweet basil was harvested three times each season in early flowering stage in July, August, and September. Samples of 1 m length were taken from the center of two rows located in middle of each plot. Plants were cut above ground and transferred into a lab to measure fresh weight. To measure dry weight, the samples were dried in an oven at 75Â°C for 72 h and then weighed. For determination of EO content, the aerial parts of sweet basil plants were dried naturally in the shade.</p>
