  <p>Representations of compounds 
   <bold>4c</bold> (A, B), 
   <bold>8a</bold> (C, D), and 
   <bold>8e</bold> (E, F) in complex with human AChE (PDB ID: 4EY7). (A, C, and E) 3D representations of the binding pose. The hydrophobic surfaces of the interacting residues are shown in blue relief. Hydrogen bonds and π–cation interactions are depicted with green and orange dotted lines, respectively; (B, D, and F) Schematic representations of the binding interactions. Hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions are depicted with black and green dotted lines, respectively. The green curve represents other non-polar interactions.
