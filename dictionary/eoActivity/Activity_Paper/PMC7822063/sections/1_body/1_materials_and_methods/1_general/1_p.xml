<p>The chemicals and solvents used for synthesis were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck precoated aluminium silica gel sheets (Kieselgel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>). Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh) from Merck. UV/fluorescence was measured using Infinite
 <sup>®</sup> M200 PRO multimode reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). Melting points were taken on a Stuart melting point apparatus SMP30 (Staffordshire, UK) which has been certified for accuracy of ± 0.5 at 50 °C, ± 1.0 at 100 °C, ± 2.5 at 360 °C by the manufacturer. NMR spectra were obtained using Jeol ECA 400 (400 MHz) (Jeol Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) or Bruker Avance III HD (600 MHz) (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA). HRMS (ESI) analyses were performed using Agilent 1200 Series or Agilent 6530 Q-TOF (ESI) spectrometer with Agilent Zorbax C-18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Human recombinant AChE and equine BChE were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
