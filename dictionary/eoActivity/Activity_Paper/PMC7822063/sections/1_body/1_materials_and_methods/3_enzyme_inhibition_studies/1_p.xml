<p>To determine the inhibitory activity of the target compounds towards cholinesterases, the AChE and BuChE inhibition assays were performed in 96 well plates by the method of Ellman with slight modifications

 </xref>. First, sodium phosphate buffer (110 μL; pH 8.0) was added into each well followed by 20 μL of each test compound, 50 μL of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (0.126 mM) and 20 μL of AChE or BuChE (0.15 units per mL). Then, the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μL (0.120 mM) of the substrate, acetylthiocholine (ATC) iodide or butyrylthiocholine (BTC) iodide (depending on the enzyme). The hydrolysis of ATC or BTC was monitored with an Infinite
 <sup>®</sup> M200 PRO multimode reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) by measuring the absorbance of the yellow 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion at 412 nm, every 30 s for 25 min. Donepezil, propidium iodide and tacrine were used as standard inhibitors. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the following expression:
