<p>In conclusion, novel 2′-hydroxychalcone derivatives with modified C4-substituents were designed, synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of human AChE. Compounds with methoxy substituents on the A ring and piperidinyl ethyl ether substituent on B ring were generally found to be more potent. Molecular docking studies have suggested that these compounds interact with both the PAS and CAS regions of AChE. The most active 2′-hydroxychalcones showed high AChE selectivity over BuChE, suggesting that these compounds may be suitable to be developed into clinically useful drug candidates.</p>
