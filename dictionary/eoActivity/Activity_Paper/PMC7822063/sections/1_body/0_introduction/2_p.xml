<p>In our previous study, we have identified several 2′-hydroxychalcones that inhibited human AChE in the micromolar range and showed some selectivity for BuChE

 </xref>. Kinetic studies indicated that these compounds were mixed-type inhibitors. Hence, the present study was undertaken to design and synthesise more potent 2′-hydroxychalcone derivatives. The synthesised derivatives were evaluated for their

In addition, molecular modelling studies were carried out on the active compounds to gain further insight of the protein-ligand interactions.
