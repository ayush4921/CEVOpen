 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. The amide coupling between 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenylacetic acid 
 <bold>1</bold> and the corresponding amine was conducted under the standard carbodiimide chemistry afforded compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, which was further oxidised to benzaldehyde 
 <bold>3</bold> with periodinane. The 2′-hydroxychalcone derivatives 
 <bold>4a–h</bold> were obtained from the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of different substituted 2′-hydroxyacetophenones and benzaldehyde

 <bold>7</bold> was synthesised in a similar fashion by using different substituted 2′-hydroxyacetophenones and methoxymethyl ether (MOM) protected benzaldehyde 
 <bold>6</bold>. Finally, compounds 
 <bold>8a–f</bold> were generated from compound
