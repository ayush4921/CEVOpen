 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. According to the ADMET analysis, all the compounds follow Lipinski’s rule by causing no violation

 <bold>4g</bold> and

 </xref>. Despite the designed compounds are moderately soluble in water, they have a high degree of gastrointestinal absorption. This may be due to the presence of tertiary nitrogen atom in these compounds that allow the formation of salt, resulting in improved solubility and gastrointestinal adsorption.
