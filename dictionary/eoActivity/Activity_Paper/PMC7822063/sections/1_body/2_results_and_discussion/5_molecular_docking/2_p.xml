<p>All docked compounds were found to exhibit binding poses similar to those of donepezil occupying both the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic anionic site (CAS) of the AChE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2)</xref>. It was observed that the aromatic ring A of compounds 
 <bold>4c</bold> and 
 <bold>8e</bold> formed π–π stacking interactions with the PAS residue, Trp286, whereas aromatic ring B of compound 
 <bold>8a</bold> formed π–π stacking interactions with Tyr341 (at the entrance to the gorge leading to that CAS). In the case of compounds 
 <bold>4c</bold> and 
 <bold>8a</bold>, the carbonyl oxygen atom and the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-hydroxyl group on the A ring were observed to form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms from acyl pocket residues, Phe295 and Arg296, respectively. This may be one of the reasons to account for the greater activity of these two compounds, as compound 
 <bold>8e</bold> only interacted with Arg296. The positively-charged nitrogen atom of the piperidine ring in compound 
 <bold>8a</bold> formed π–cation interaction with CAS site aromatic residue, Trp86. This interaction is particularly important as several studies have reported its implication for biological recognition of human AChE

 </xref>. In the case of compound 
 <bold>8e</bold>, an extra hydrogen bonding interaction was formed between the ether oxygen atom and residue Tyr337. Taken together, these interactions have contributed to the enhanced potency of 2′-hydroxychalcone with modified C4-substituents. The docking findings are in agreement with the experimental results and provide reasons for improved cholinesterase inhibitory activity of the designed derivatives.
