 <bold>8d–f</bold> against human AChE and equine BuChE. The latter is considered a good model for human BuChE due to its high sequence similarity to the human form (90% sequence identity)

 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Generally, these compounds showed higher activity towards AChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 3–19 µM. Among the target derivatives, compound 
 <bold>4c</bold> was the most active towards AChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.3 µM. Moreover, compound 
 <bold>4c</bold> exhibited the highest selectivity for AChE over BuChE (SI &gt;30). High AChE selectivity over BuChE (SI &gt;24) was also observed for compound 
 <bold>8a</bold>, which possesses a piperidinyl ethyl ether substituted at the C4 position. Studies have shown that high AChE selectivity over BuChE may reduce the associated side effects of AD treatment

 </xref>. Hence, compounds with high AChE selectivity over BuChE may be clinically useful. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the designed compounds generally showed lower BuChE inhibitory activity as compared to that of AChE. Compound 
 <bold>8e</bold> was the most active towards BuChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.3 μM. In comparison, compound 
 <bold>8a</bold> which lack of a 6′-methoxy substituent in the A ring was inactive, indicating that the 6′-methoxy group is important for interaction.
