<p>Docking of the corresponding 2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethoxy-4-bromochalcone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) described in our previous work to the crystal structure of the human AChE (PDB ID: 4EY7) reveals room for a possible side-chain extension from the C4 position to engage extra binding interactions

 </xref>. The docking structure suggests that the indole ring of Trp86 at the bottom of the active site gorge is a perspective binding site by π-cation interaction. Thus, we focussed on a well-established chain extension strategy which involves the incorporation of a tertiary nitrogen functional group linked into the C4 position of 2′-hydroxychalcone via a short alkyl chain
