<p>To evaluate effects on the formation of biofilms, reconstituted formulations were added to bacterial cultures of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PAO1-pUCP18 (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Irie et al., 2012</xref>)) or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Strain AH 133 (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2009</xref>)), which were then allowed to grow under static conditions. Briefly, overnight cultures of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were diluted to a concentration of 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/ml in fresh LB broth (dilutions based on optical density measured at A
 <sub>595</sub>). From this diluted culture, 10 µl was added to a clear, U-bottom non-treated 96-well plate (Corning) to give a final count of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells in each well (in triplicates). Following this, 90 µl of SO (sesame oil only), KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO (plant extracts in oil), were added individually into wells containing bacterial culture. Controls were set up for each set of assays that included uninoculated LB broth (sterility control), and bacterial cultures in LB without the addition of the formulations (untreated control). After 24 h, total biomass (crystal violet assay) and metabolic activity (XTT assay) was measured according to previously published protocols (
