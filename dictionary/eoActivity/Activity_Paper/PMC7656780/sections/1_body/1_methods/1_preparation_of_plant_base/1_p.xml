<p>The medicinal plants were obtained from a private garden in Pune, India (Latitude 18.591,934, Longitude 73.793,037) belonging to Dr. Anuradha. The entire procedure was carried out with freshly-picked plant parts (plants were directly made into a paste and not stored). The leaves of 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>, or grass of 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (no other plant parts such as roots, shoots, stem or flowers were used), were made into a paste using a mechanized grinder (Kenstar multi-processor, Model No: MF0204) till a thick paste was obtained. For every one part of plant paste (100 ml), 16 parts of distilled water (1,600 ml) and four parts of sesame oil (400 ml) were used, resulting in a 1:16:4 ratio (by volume) of plant, water, and oil respectively. The plant paste, water and oil were mixed together in a wide-mouthed steel vessel to allow for evaporation of water. The mixture was boiled under low heat with stirring till the water completely evaporated (5–6 h), leaving the extracts from the plant paste in the sesame oil. The extract-containing oils were filtered in a single-fold cotton cloth, to remove any remaining chunks of the leaf paste, and stored at room temperature. These remedies were prepared in a single batch, and all testing was performed with the same batch. This boiling procedure was also carried out for a control of sesame oil alone, where one part of plant paste in the original ratio was replaced with water. Whole-pressed plant specimens were deposited in the herbarium (indexed with NYBG Steere Herbarium) at the Department of Botany, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). The retention vouchers for the plant specimens are 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers. SPPU 0125, 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic> (Lam.) Pers. SPPU 0124 and 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> L. SPPU 0123.
