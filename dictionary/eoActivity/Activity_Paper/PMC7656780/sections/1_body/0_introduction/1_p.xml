<p>Biofilms are multicellular aggregates of bacteria, attached to each other or a surface, via a self-produced extracellular matrix (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>). Implicated in a range of infection states from non-healing wounds to life-threatening burn-related sepsis (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Wen, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Høiby et al., 2011</xref>), biofilms are notoriously tolerant to conventional antibiotics, resulting in persistent infections and limited therapeutic options (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ciofu et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, there is a concerted push to develop novel anti-biofilm agents, that will expand therapeutic options, and prolong the lifetime of current antibiotics. Traditional medical practices have been recognized as valuable sources of potential new antimicrobial agents (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). These practices employ natural products, often from plant sources, thereby providing a huge diversity of active ingredients and biological targets. Further, traditional remedies are formulated using rudimentary processes that retain the crude and combined nature of the ingredients, which is possibly important for antimicrobial activity. As evident, principles that guide historical medical approaches differ from that of conventional antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Leekha et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, prospecting historical antimicrobial remedies as potential anti-biofilm agents could provide a paradigm shift in the treatment of biofilms.
