<p>Typically, ethnopharmacological studies have focused on isolating and testing the antimicrobial effects of single compounds (

The remedies reconstituted and tested in this work are complex plant formulations, and as part of the next steps, it would be important to identify and investigate interactions between the biologically active compounds in the formulations. For this, approaches such as mass spectrometry-based metabolomics that are capable of identifying biologically active compounds in plant extracts (
