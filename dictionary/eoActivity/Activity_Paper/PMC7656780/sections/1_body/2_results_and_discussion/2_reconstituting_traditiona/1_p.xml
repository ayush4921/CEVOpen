<p>Based on gleanings across compendia, the traditional formulations were prepared by “extracting” ingredients from the medicinal plants into sesame oil. In doing so, we proceeded to reconstitute the “whole” remedy. This is important given that plant-based formulations have been shown to possess varied biofilm activity, depending on whether they are prepared via traditional methods or chemical extractions (

 <italic>Tulsi</italic>”), and 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers. (Bermuda grass or “
 <italic>Durva</italic>”), were prepared using a mixture of plant paste, distilled water (Alliance Industries, Pune, India) and sesame oil (cold-pressed, Prabhat teel oil, Hanuman Trading Company, India), referred to as KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO, respectively. The plants were obtained from a private, cultivated botanical garden in Pune, India (belonging to Dr. Anuradha, Ayurvedic practitioner and author in this work). All medicinal plant names were validated from the Kew Medicinal Plant Names Services. The names of 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> were validated as is and the service repository stated non-scientific names as “Holy basil” or “tulsi” for 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> and “Bermuda grass” or “durva” for 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon.</italic> When the Kew Medicinal Plant Names Services was searched for 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic>, it found one plant termed as ‘Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers. The preparation practices to reconstitute these plant ingredients in sesame oil were determined from “
 <italic>Sharangdhar Samhita</italic>” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), which recommends that to prepare decoctions of plant-based medicinal oil, the oil component should be four times that of the plant paste, and the “liquid” component (referring to water or milk) should be four times that of the oil component, resulting in a ratio of 1:16:4 for plant paste, water and oil respectively. It is unclear if this refers to measurement by weight or volume, and we decided to use volume. The recipe also calls for boiling the components together to extract the plant ingredients into the sesame oil. Since the water is allowed to evaporate, the final drug extract ratio (DER), based on four parts of sesame oil for one part of plant paste is 1:4.
