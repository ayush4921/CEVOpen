<p>In summary, we prepared a library containing 500 prefractionated TCM extracts from 100 herbs with potent antiviral activity. As a pilot, a phenotypic screening was carried out against the library using a recombinant influenza A virus expressing 
 <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase, and 10 fractions possessing anti-influenza potencies were identified, including fractions of 
 <italic>Areca catechu L</italic>., 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizin</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamon</italic>, 
 <italic>Tripterygium wilfordii</italic>, 
 <italic>Spatholobus suberectus</italic>, 
 <italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Magnolia officinalis</italic>. It is of great interest to investigate the bioactive components of these extracts and the mechanism of action in future.
