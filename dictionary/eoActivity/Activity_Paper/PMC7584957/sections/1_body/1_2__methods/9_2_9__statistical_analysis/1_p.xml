<p>In order to quantify the robustness of the screen, Z′ factor was calculated from the normalized signals from positive and negative control wells on each plate with the following equation: Z′ = 1–3 × (SD of positive control + SD of negative control)/(mean of negative control - mean of positive control). SD represents the standard deviation. Z′ value between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered robust enough for an HTS assay [
