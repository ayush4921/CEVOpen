<p>Each dry powder (200 g) of TCMs was extracted with 1000 mL cyclohexane (CYH) firstly, and then the leftover solution was sequentially extracted using dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EAC), 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol (NBA), and distilled water (W), according to the method described by Liu et al [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The five extracted solutions of 100 TCMs were harvested separately by ultrasonic extraction at 40°C for 30 min and repeated twice followed by filtration and evaporation under vacuum. The organic fractions were dried in 45°C vacuum, and the water fractions were freeze-dried. All 500 samples were sealed in vessels and refrigerated separately.
