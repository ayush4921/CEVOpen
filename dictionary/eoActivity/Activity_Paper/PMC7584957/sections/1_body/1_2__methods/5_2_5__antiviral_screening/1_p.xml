 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In brief, MDCK cells growing in white, flat-bottom, 96-well culture plates (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) were infected with PR8-PB2-Gluc virus at 0.01 multiplicities of infection (MOI) in the presence of test samples of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. After 36-hr incubation, Gluc assay was performed using Pierce Gaussia luciferase glow assay kit (Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mock infected cells were used as blank control. DMSO and baloxavir acid (BXA) were set as negative and positive control, respectively [
