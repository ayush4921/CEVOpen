<p>In this study, 100 TCM plants were selected as compositions of antiviral prescriptions by literature review [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and each plant was prepared into 5 simplified extracts, generating a library consisting of 500 TCM fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Table S1). Prefractionation can partially remove compounds that are likely to cause artefacts, greatly reducing the complexity of each extract, and as a consequence, increase the hit rate when subjected to an antiviral screening. In addition, since the fractions were prepared by a chromatographic method, subsequent chromatography on a target fraction can be achieved easily, in contrast to the risk that one may fail to find a responsible constituent in active crude extracts [
