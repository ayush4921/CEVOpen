<p>Considering exogenous luciferase expression was used to indicate IAV replication when using reporter influenza PR8-PB2-Gluc virus, a Gluc inhibitor should probably be identified as false positive. To better address the antiviral activities of hit fractions against IAV, a conventional titer reduction assay were further performed using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, all 10 hit fractions suppressed the viral replication significantly at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, suggesting that all hit fractions comprise anti-influenza components by targeting influenza viral replication. Notably, NBA fraction of 
 <italic>Areca catechu L</italic>. and EAC fraction of 
 <italic>Magnilia officinalis</italic> almost completely inhibited IAV yielding.
