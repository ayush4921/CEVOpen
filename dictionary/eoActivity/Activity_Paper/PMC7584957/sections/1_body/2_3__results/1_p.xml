<p>TCMs have proven to possess valuable advantages in clinical practices, including the treatment of influenza virus which caused respiratory disease [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Novel anti-influenza actives from TCM samples are therefore anticipated. To this end, 100 medicinal plants which have been recorded as antiviral formula compositions were fractionated with cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and water sequentially, generating a library consisting of 500 prefractionated TCM extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Table S1). As a quality control, three fractions were randomly chosen for re-extraction and HPLC analysis. As Figure S1 shows, the chromatogram of the TCM fraction replicates displayed identical compositions, suggesting that our library is of high quality and reliable for bioactive screen.
