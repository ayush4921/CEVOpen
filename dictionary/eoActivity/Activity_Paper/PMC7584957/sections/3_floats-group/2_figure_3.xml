  <p>High-throughput phenotypic screening for anti-influenza actives of TCM fractions. (a) Primary screen: percentage inhibition of each fraction was plotted separately. Fractions exhibiting inhibition rate of &gt;80% were colored in red. (b) Secondary screening: preliminarily identified effective hits are tested for the second round of cytotoxicity and confirmation screen. The compounds that showed strong effect on cell viabilities (&lt;70%) were considered as toxic hits (golden dots). Blue dots and red ones represent the inactives and hit fractions, respectively.</p>
