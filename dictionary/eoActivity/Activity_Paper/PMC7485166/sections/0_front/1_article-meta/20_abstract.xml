 <p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity, 
  <italic>in vit</italic>ro and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity, cell viability and safety of Eastern Medicine coded medicinal formulation Eczegone comprising extracts of 
  <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> (Azin)
  <italic>, Fumaria indica</italic> (Fuin)
  <italic>, Sphaeranthus indicus</italic> (Spin) and 
  <italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic> (Lain). This work also evaluated antibacterial activity of Eczegone formulation having above mentioned plants ethanolic extracts against different bacteria’s by disk diffusion method. 
  <italic>In vitro</italic> toxicity of Eczegone formulation was investigated by using human skin keratinocytes HaCaT cell line, crystal violet stained cells, and methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay. 
  <italic>In vivo</italic> acute oral and dermal cytotoxicity was determined by using Swiss albino mice and albino rabbits, respectively. The Eczegone formulation showed antibacterial activity against 3 gram negative bacteria including 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
  <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> and a gram positive 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. We didn’t observe any toxic effect of Eczegone formulation on the skin keratinocytes. Furthermore, the Ezcegone formulation was non-irritant according to draize score (OECD TG404, 2002). After rigorous safety evaluation by 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> acute oral and dermal toxicity analysis, we concluded that Eczegone formualtion possessses antibacterial effects and is safe, non-toxic, non-irritant, and the drug would be subjected for further biochemical and clinical studies.
