<p>To further confirm the cytotoxicity of the eczegone, HaCaT cellswere treated with increasing concentrations of Eczegone (10 ng/mL-100 μg/mL) followed by incubation at 37°C for 24 h. Following the procedure the at the end the cells were stained with the crystal violet dye. Pictures taken through the digital scanner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1559325820956798">Figure 3</xref>) from the experiment demonstrated that the crystal violet stained cells showed no sign of cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells. Hence, our data provided evidence that Eczegone has no cytototoxic effect on skins cell at various concentrations.
