<p>Furthermore, to validate our results, we treated HaCaT cells with different indicated concentrations of Eczegone (10 ng/mL-100 Î¼g/mL) for 24 h and 48 h, and then we determined cell viability using Methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay (

The experiemental results revealed that Eczegone had almost no cell viability-reducing effects on the HaCaT cells, and therefore, it was considered to be safe for usage in further experimentation.Taken togather, the results from the experiments indicated the safety of the drug on skincells while using for the therapeutic purposes.
