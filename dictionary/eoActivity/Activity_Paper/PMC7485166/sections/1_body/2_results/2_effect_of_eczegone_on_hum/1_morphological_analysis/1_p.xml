<p>In order to investigate the effect of eczegone on human skin keratinocytes HaCaT cell line, we had performed morphological analysis by treating the HaCaT cells with various indicated concentrations (10 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) of Eczegone and observed the morphology under microscope to see any morphological changes in the HaCaT cells after the 24 h of the incubation. Under microscope it was clearly seen that there was no changes in the morphology of the eczegone treated HaCaT cells. Hence, from the experiment it was found that samples were non-toxic against skin cells revealing that the drug has no cytotoxic effects on the morphology of skin keratinocytes (
