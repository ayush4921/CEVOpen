 </sup> with minor modification. Succinctly, inoculum containing 10 CFU/mL was inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) petri plates for microbes. The sterile channel papers of 6 mm width having formulation Eczegone comprised of plant extracts of 50, 100 and 200 mg/mL in DMSO and DMSO as negative control were set on the outside of immunized agar plates with sterile forceps. Ciprofloxacin was utilized as reference anti-infection. The plates were placed into an incubator for 24 h at 37Â°C. The examples were tried in duplicates and the inhibitory zones were estimated in mili meter (mm) and average values were obtained.
