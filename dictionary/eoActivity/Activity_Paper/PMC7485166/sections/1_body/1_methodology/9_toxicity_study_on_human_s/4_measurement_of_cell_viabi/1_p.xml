<p>HaCaT cells (4000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plate along withdealt with increasing concentrations of Eczegone (10 ng/mL-100 μg/mL) pursued by incubation for 24 h and 48 h at 37°C. Following the aforementioned time period, 20 µL of Methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (5 mg/ml) mixture was added into every well of the 96-well plates followed by the incubation at 37°C for 4 h. Then, 150 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added into everyone well, and in accordance withthe manufacturers guidelines, the absorbance was determined on a microplate reader at 490 nm. Survival ratio was calculated via normalizing the control groups.</p>
