<p id="Par55">In our study, crude extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed considerable antioxidant activities against DPPH and ABTS in all solvent extracts with respect to standard Gallic acid (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The highest antioxidant was found in ethyl acetate extract against DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30.14 ± 0.41 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.38 ± 1.12 μg/mL) and least was found in hexane extract against DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 194.41 ± 0.62 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100.57 ± 0.40 μg/mL) whereas crude methanol and water extract showed satisfactory inhibitory potential against both DPPH and ABTS.
