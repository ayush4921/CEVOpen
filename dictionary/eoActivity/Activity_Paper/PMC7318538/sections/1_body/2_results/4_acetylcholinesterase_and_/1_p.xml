<p id="Par58">The examined plant extracts showed inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The highest AChE and BChE inhibition were observed in crude methanol extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 31.52 ± 0.58 μg/mL and 11.69 ± 0.14 μg/mL respectively followed by crude ethyl acetate and water extract (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The crude ethyl acetate and water extract also possessed the greater inhibitory potential of these enzymes compared with standard drug, Galantamine (Fig.
