<p id="Par59">The chromatogram of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed the different mass spectra of the compounds and we analyzed it further for the prediction of chemical formula including the exact mass calculation by Mass Hunter software version B.04.00 build 4.0.479.0 (Agilent Technology) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Detail of identified compounds with their theoretical and observed mass to charge ratio and errors in parts per million (ppm) in positive ion mode in ESI is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>s. The compounds were identified based on the observed MS spectra and also compared with the literature data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We observed the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compounds in the crude methanol extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> such as Bergenin (m/z = 327.072), Catechin (m/z = 289.071), Arbutin (m/z = 271.082), Gallic acid (m/z = 169.014), Protocatechuic acid (m/z = 153.019), Syringic acid (m/z = 197.045), Hyperoside (m/z = 463.088), Afzelechin (m/z = 273.076), Methyl gallate (m/z = 183.029), Paashaanolactone (m/z = 411.129), Astilbin (m/z = 449.108), Quercetin (m/z = 301.034), Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside (m/z = 447.093), Diosmetin (m/z = 299.056), Phloretin (m/z = 273.076), and Morin (m/z = 301.035) (Fig.
