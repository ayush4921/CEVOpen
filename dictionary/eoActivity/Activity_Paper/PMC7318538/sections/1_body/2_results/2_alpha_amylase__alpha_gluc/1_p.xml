<p id="Par56">Our results revealed that crude extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> in different extracting solvents are potent 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase and 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A&amp;B). The highest 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase inhibition was found in methanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.03 ± 0.04 μg/mL) and least in water extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.77 ± 0.54 μg/mL). Similarly, highest 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibition was found in methanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.29 ± 0.00 μg/mL) and least in water extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.54 ± 0.00 μg/mL) and there is no sign of 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase and 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase inhibitory potential of hexane extract (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These results indicate that inhibition of 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase and 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase by the crude methanol extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> is comparable to the standard drug Acarbose. Furthermore, all solvent extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> exhibited the lipase inhibitory potential (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> C, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The highest lipase inhibition was found in crude methanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 90.53 ± 0.31 μg/mL) and least in hexane extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 447.86 ± 19.58 μg/mL) which is compared with the standard drug, Orlistat that have an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 431.58 ± 13.82 μg/mL.
