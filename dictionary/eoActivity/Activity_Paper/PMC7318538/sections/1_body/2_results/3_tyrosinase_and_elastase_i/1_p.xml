<p id="Par57">Inhibitions of the tyrosinase enzyme somehow lower the excessive production of melanin and then prevent melanogenesis. Therefore, the control of melanogenesis is important to individuals with clinical or cosmetic needs to enhance dermatological protection. Plant-based natural antioxidants are now gaining much emphasis on modern cosmetics to encounter these skin-related complications. 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed higher inhibitory potential against the mushroom tyrosinase in crude methanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 58.25 ± 1.63 μg/mL) and crude water extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 168.81 ± 0.56 μg/mL) with compared to crude ethyl acetate and hexane extract (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> A). Kojic acid has greater inhibiting potential as compared to the plant extracts with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 18.39 ± 0.15 μg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, our results revealed the highest elastase inhibition in crude methanol extract followed ethyl acetate extract as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 74.00 ± 3.03 μg/mL and 174.34 ± 1.44 μg/mL respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Nevertheless, hexane and water extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> did not show any inhibition against elastase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> B).
