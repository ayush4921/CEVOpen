<p id="Par61">Obesity is linked with the abnormal accumulation of fat in the body and causes several health complications such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, osteoarthritis, hypertension and diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Scientific evidence supported that the person suffering from obesity and diabetes are more prone to the development of cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It has been proven that medicinal plant and its extract has tendencies to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes by inhibiting the enzymes such as lipase, 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase, and 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase that are involved in fat and carbohydrates metabolism in the human body. The 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase and 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase are the carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme that breakdown the glycosidic bond and releases glucose, which increases the concentration of glucose in the body and has a negative impact on diabetic patients. The pathogenesis of T2DM is currently accredited to genetics and metabolic abnormalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and its treatment with the currently available drugs is still not adequate to prevent long-term diabetic complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, human pancreatic lipase is the main enzyme that breaks down dietary fats in the human digestive system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The commercial anti-obesity drugs have some serious side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] which enforce plant-based remedies of natural choice for the treatment of obesity that considered to have wide variety of natural chemical compounds having diverse structural features to inhibit lipase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Plant extract had tendencies to inhibit the digestive enzyme such as 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase, 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, and lipase which made medicinal plant and herbal remedies as alternative source of inhibitor of major enzymes and gaining public interest across the world. Different species of 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> and their secondary metabolites are already reported as potent anti-diabetic sources in-vitro and in-vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Our results revealed that crude extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> are the inhibitor of these digestive enzymes. The root extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed inhibitory activities towards 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase, 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, and lipase. Results revealed that among four analyzed solvent extracts, the crude methanol extract has greater inhibitory activities compared to Acarbose and Orlistat. These results are consistent with the investigation of the different fractions of 
 <italic>B. ciliata</italic> by Bhandari et al., 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, hexane extract does not reveal any inhibition against these enzymes. Our finding opens up the possibility of finding potential inhibitors in the methanol extract.
