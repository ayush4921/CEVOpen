<p id="Par63">In recent years, enzyme inhibitory strategies are considered as one of the most effective strategies in combating global health problems including Alzheimerâ€™s diseases (AD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The natural inhibitors of cholinesterases (ChEs) from the plant origin for the management of cognitive/mental disorders have gained interest due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds such as quercetin, catechin, bergenin, and rutin which have several health benefits [
