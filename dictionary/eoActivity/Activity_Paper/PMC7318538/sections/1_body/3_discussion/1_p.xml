<p id="Par60">Plants has been used for medicine from ancient times for the treatment of different human ailments. Antioxidant compounds act as a preventive agent against oxidation process. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and protect humans against various diseases. Nowadays lots of synthetic molecules with potential enzyme inhibitory tendencies are being used as a food supplement. Although synthetic antioxidants are in use, it might have adverse health effects due to their several side effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In this study, 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> root was extracted with four different solvent hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. Antioxidant capacities of the solvent extract were analyzed using DPPH and ABTS assay. Results revealed that crude ethyl acetate and methanol extract have the highest antioxidant capacities with the least IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as depicted in results. Furthermore, crude hexane extract showed the lowest antioxidant tendencies as compared to the crude water extract. The results are comparable with reported 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Based on this finding we suggested that different crude extracts of roots of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> are the considerable source of antioxidant molecules and can be extracted and analyzed further in-vivo for the several health benefits. The different phenolics and flavonoids molecules present in the plant extract might be the source of antioxidant activities [

 <italic>α-</italic>amylase, 
 <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase.
