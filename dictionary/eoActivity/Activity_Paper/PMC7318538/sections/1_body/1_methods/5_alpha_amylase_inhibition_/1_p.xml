<p id="Par47">The DNSA method was used to determine 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase inhibition activity with a slight modified procedure of Wickramaratne et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Briefly, 200 μL plant extract of varying concentrations and 200 μL 3 unit/mL α- amylase were mixed and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Two hundred microliter of 1% starch solution was added on it and further incubated for the next 5 min at 37 °C, then 200 μL of DNSA solution was added on it and heated for 10 min at 90–95 °C in order to terminate the reaction and the final volume was adjusted to 5 mL by the addition of distilled water. The absorbance was measured at λ = 540 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. 1% DMSO and Acarbose were used as positive control and reference respectively. The following formula was used to calculate the percentage of 
 <italic>α-</italic>amylase inhibition.
