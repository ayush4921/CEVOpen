<p id="Par44">The collected plant sample was dried at room temperature and made powdered by grinding in an electrical grinder. The crude extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> was extracted in hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water system where extracts dependent on the polarity of the solvent, the chemical nature of the extracted compound, the plant matrix, and presence of interfering substances. Ten-gram powder sample was macerated in 100 mL of hexane and kept overnight on a shaker at 150 rpm at room temperature. On the next day, the entire mixture was filtrated and collected. The residue was further sequentially extracted with ethyl acetate, methanol, and water successively. The filtrated of each fraction were concentrated to dryness by evaporating on vacuum evaporator (hanil Modul 4080C). The extracted crude samples were kept in an airtight glass vial and stored at 4 °C until use.
