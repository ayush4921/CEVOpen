<p id="Par50">L-DOPA substrate was used to determine tyrosinase ihibition activity, accordingly with the procedure followed by Petrillo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] with slide modifications. In brief, plant extract of different concentrations in potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5) were mixed with 20 μL of mushroom tyrosinase (1000 U/mL) and incubated at 27 °C for 10 min. Then, 200 μL of L-DOPA (5 mM) was added to the mixture and the reaction value was maintained to 2 mL by the addition of phosphate buffer and incubated further for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at λ = 492 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The phosphate buffer and Kojic acid were used as positive control and reference respectively. The percentage of tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows.
