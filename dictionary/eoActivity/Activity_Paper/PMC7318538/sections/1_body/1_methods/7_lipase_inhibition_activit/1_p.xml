<p id="Par49">The inhibitory potential against lipase was determined by using p-NPB as a substrate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The lipase enzyme was prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline, pH 8.0 and p-NPB was prepared in 0.1 mM in ethanol. In brief, different concentrations of plant extracts were mixed with 50 μg/mL of the lipase enzyme and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 10 μL of p-NPB was added and the reaction volume was maintained to 2 mL with the addition of phosphate buffer and proceeded for 15 min of additional incubation at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at λ = 405 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. 1% DMSO and Orlistat were used as positive control and reference respectively. The percentage inhibition of lipase was calculated as follows.
