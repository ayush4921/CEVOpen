<p id="Par40">Although, melanin can protect tissues from oxidative and chemical stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the excessive production of melanin causes various skin related problems. Melanin biosynthesis occurs in the melanocytes through a series of enzymatic and chemical reactions. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase that is widely distributed in microorganisms, animals, and plants which contribute to the melanin synthesis pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Tyrosinase is frequently used in cosmetic and food industries as an anti-browning agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, a high amount of tyrosinase might leads to hyper melanogenesis. Elastase is a primary enzyme responsible for the breakdown of elastin, which has unique elastic recoil properties and vital for giving elasticity to the skin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Finding inhibitors of tyrosinase and elastase enzymes can be useful to prevent skin pigmentation and loss of skin elasticity which works as skin whitening and anti-aging agents correspondingly.
