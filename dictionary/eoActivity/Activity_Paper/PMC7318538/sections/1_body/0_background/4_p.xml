<p id="Par41">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of cholinergic neurons that alters the brain activity and cause cognitive impairment which is mainly caused by the progressive reduction of acetylcholine. Thus, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase has been considered as a potential target in the treatment of AD [
