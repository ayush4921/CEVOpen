<p>Two types of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extracts were prepared, one with callus samples, i.e., the four callus samples with three types of treatments for elicitation (control, salicylic acid, and chitosan), with BA at 2.0 mg/L, and another sample of dried plants from the aerial parts of plants grown in a greenhouse.
