<p>A third experiment was carried out with a part of the calli resulting from the previous experiment (2,4-D at 0.5 mg/L) transplanted to the MS ½ medium plus 3% sucrose and 0.1 g/L inositol. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 and the medium was solidified with 6.4 g/L agar, with the treatments given by different concentrations of BA at 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mg/L. The media were poured into 265 mL glass vials containing 35 mL of medium inoculated with five clusters of calli of 0.5 ± 0.2 cm each (repletion) and 0.16 g/callus. Calli were maintained in a 16 h photoperiod (25–30 μmol·m
