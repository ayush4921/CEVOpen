<p>Our study provided the establishment of an efficient protocol for the proliferation of calli of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> using 2,4-D in the dark or BA in the presence of light. Calli cultured in vitro also provided the production of new molecules not observed in differentiated tissues of greenhouse-grown plants of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>, and this technique can be used for the production of molecules of interest for application as medicines, such as betulone. Some molecules, such as squalene and betulone, were not previously identified in the genus, while some phytosterols were previously identified in other species of 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with this being the first report for 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>. One of the biggest challenges in the production of secondary metabolites in vitro has been the high costs of the technique, compared to the conventional field production system of plant-derived medicinal compounds (PDMCs). However, the present study demonstrated the in vitro callus technique for the production of completely different PDMCs in 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> not produced by plants or parts of plants grown in the field, being of great potential for the discovery of new molecules, as well as for better comprehension of secondary metabolism routes aimed at the application of in vitro techniques for production and prospection of molecules of interest for medicinal purposes.
