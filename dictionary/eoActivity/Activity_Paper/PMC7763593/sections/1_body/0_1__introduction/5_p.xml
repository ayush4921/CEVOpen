<p>In the process of induction and proliferation of calli, plant development regulators (PDRs) are used, where auxins and cytokinins are responsible for cell division and dedifferentiation [

Auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is one of the most used for in vitro callus production, being highly efficient for the induction and proliferation of these calli, while its action can be intensified by the combination with 6-benzyladenine (BA) [
