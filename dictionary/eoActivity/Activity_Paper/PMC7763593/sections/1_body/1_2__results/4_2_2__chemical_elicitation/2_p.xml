<p>Plants micropropagated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05895-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), acclimatized, and grown in pots in a greenhouse developed vigorously (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05895-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), and the leaves were harvested for analysis at 60 days of cultivation. In these aerial samples from plants grown in a greenhouse, it was possible to observe eight different biosynthesized lignans, including 5-demethoxy-niranthin (402 g/mol), phyllanthin (418 g/mol), 5-demethoxy-nirtetralin (400 g/mol), nirtetralin (430 g/mol), niranthin (432 g/mol), and phyltetralin (416 g/mol). However, none of these lignans in plants were observed in the calli obtained in vitro, regardless of the culture conditions, light with BA or dark with 2,4-D, and the addition of chemical elicitors (
