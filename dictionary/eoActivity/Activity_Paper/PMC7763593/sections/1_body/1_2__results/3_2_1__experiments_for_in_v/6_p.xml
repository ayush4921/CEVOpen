<p>Furthermore, calli of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> successfully proliferated in vitro under light conditions using only BA as a phytoregulator (culture medium without 2,4-D). In these treatments, chlorophyll synthesis was observed in calli after the 15th day of cultivation, according to the acquisition of the green color and rigid consistency (
