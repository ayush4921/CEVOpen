<p>Callus formation was observed firstly at the base of nodal segments (wound region) from the 14th day of cultivation, and the treatments with 2,4-D at 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L and without addition of BA presented 100% nodal segments containing calli. At the end of 60 days of cultivation, all nodal segments containing calli were also obtained in treatments with 0.25 mg/L and 0.50 mg/L 2,4-D, combined with 1.0 mg/L BA (
