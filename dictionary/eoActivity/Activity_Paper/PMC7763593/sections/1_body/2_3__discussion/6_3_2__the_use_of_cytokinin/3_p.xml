<p>Despite these observed changes, callus proliferation remained high in these conditions (BA + light), with the largest gain in callus fresh weight at 2.0 mg/L (1.92 g/callus) (

Compared with previous studies on the proliferation of calli under similar conditions, the fresh weight obtained in the present experiment was 2.8× and 8.5× the fresh weight of calli obtained under similar conditions by Unander [
