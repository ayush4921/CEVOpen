<p>The fresh weight gains reported herein are essential to make the technique of in vitro production of secondary metabolites viable from an economic point of view, with the advantages of in vitro cultivation and production of secondary metabolites from calli, such as the greater control of the production process, carrying out periodic harvests in shorter cycles independent of the time of the year in order to extract the plant-derived medicinal compounds (PDMC), the uniformity of response, and the absence of microbiological and chemical contaminations that affect the quality of PDMC produced and extracted under these conditions, when compared with the production of plants in agricultural systems [
