<p>Under in vitro conditions, aiming at the production of secondary metabolites with greater control of the culture environment, a phase of tissue proliferation is established, which exponentially increases the number of cells to be used as bioreactors in the production of secondary metabolites, followed by an elicitation phase, in which some physical or chemical factor causing stress is applied directly to the cultivated tissues, aiming to concentrate these metabolites in the plants [
