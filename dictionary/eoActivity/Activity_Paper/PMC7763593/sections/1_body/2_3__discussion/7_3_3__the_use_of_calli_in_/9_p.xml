<p>Although Unander [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] did not quantify and characterize the secondary metabolites produced in vitro for different species of 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic>, including 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>, this author found that the activity of the calli produced in vitro on viral enzymes was significantly lower than those obtained from extracts of whole plants grown in field conditions. Since lignans are largely responsible for the antiviral effect of

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it is understandable that the lower antiviral activity is associated with the low production capacity of these lignans in calli grown in vitro, when compared with extracts from plants grown in field conditions [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or in a greenhouse (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05895-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), as demonstrated in the present study, comparing the production of lignans in plants ex vitro vs. calli in vitro.
