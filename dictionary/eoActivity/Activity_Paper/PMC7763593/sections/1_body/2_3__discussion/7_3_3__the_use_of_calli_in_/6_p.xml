<p>Considering that calli are almost entirely made up of cells in constant cell division and, therefore, undifferentiated, the non-detection of these lignans in calli in vitro may be a result of the stage of development of these cells. The friability of calli is an example of the presence of young cells. Friability is the capacity of plant cells to detach from each other; cells have meristematic characteristics, and friability is generally obtained in media with high concentrations of auxins [
