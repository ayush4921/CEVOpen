<p>Even so, the results obtained here are opposite to those reported by Muthusamy et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>, who observed phyllanthin lignan at very low concentrations (0.02–0.25 µg/g callus). These authors observed an increase in the concentration of phyllanthin in the calli in vitro with the addition of 30 µM of the amino acid phenylalanine. Elfahmi et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] observed the production of the lignans urinatetralin and cubebin dimethyl ether in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic>, not conventionally observed in plants, and the addition of 0.5 mM of ferulic acid or caffeic acid as precursors was beneficial to concentrate these compounds in the cells.
