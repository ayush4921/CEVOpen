<p>As demonstrated in the present experiment, the addition of BA to 2,4-D treatments did not prove beneficial for the fresh weight and diameter of calli in the induction phase, compared with 2,4-D treatments. In another study, with 
 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. urinaria</italic>, there was successful induced callus production in nodal segments using MS medium, along with 7 µM 2,4-D + 1 µM BA. In addition, it was observed that the addition of cinnamic acid (30 µM), phenylalanine (1 µM), and naphthaleneacetic acid (1 µM) to this medium resulted in increments in the fresh weight of calli (1.5 g/callus, 1.3 g/callus, and 0.8 g/callus, respectively) for 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> [
