<p>Unander [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] also obtained friable calli induced from stem tissues of 
 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic>. These authors observed that the largest fresh weight of calli was obtained using the MS medium with 1.0 mg/L 2,4-D + 1.0 mg/L BA (0.68 ± 0.14 g/callus). In our study, the largest fresh weight (2.58 g/callus) of friable calli was also obtained with the ½ MS medium plus 2,4-D, but at a concentration of 0.25 mg/L, this being 3.8× higher than that obtained by Unander [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The increase in 2,4-D concentration or the addition of BA at 1.0 or 2.0 mg/L resulted in a gradual reduction in the callus fresh weight in the induction phase. Another difference found between that study and the present one was the cultivation conditions, whereby the current study was carried out in dark conditions, while that conducted by Unander [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] occurred under continuous lighting conditions.
