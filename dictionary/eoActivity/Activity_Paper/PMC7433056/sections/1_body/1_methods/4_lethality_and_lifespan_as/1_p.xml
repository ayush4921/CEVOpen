<p id="Par23">We chose 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 mg/mL as the exposure concentration of PHS. These specific drug concentrations were based on previous experimental research, Tan Lab, unpublished data. Thirty 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> at L4 stage were added to NGM of PHS ethanol extract of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 mg/mL, and cultured at 22 °C. The number of deaths of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was observed and recorded every 24 h. In order to eliminate the mixture of the tested 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its newly produced larvae, the live 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> were picked out every 24 h on a new culture plate containing the same drug concentration until all the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> died. The mortality standard of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is that the worm itself is incapacitated and does not react to touching many times. Three groups of parallel tests were performed for each drug concentration.
