 <italic>C. elegans</italic> synchronized in the L4 stage was placed in NGM containing drugs of different mass concentrations, 3 NGM per group, 10 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> per NGM, and control group was set up. In the drug-administered group, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was treated with drug for 24 h and placed in a 35 °C incubator at the same time as the control group. The death number and survival number of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> were counted every 12 h until all the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> died. The death standard is described above [
