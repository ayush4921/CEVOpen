<p id="Par55">Our study indicates the potential adverse effects of PHS in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> after long-term exposure. These results lay the foundation for further study of the pharmacological mechanism of PHS, and contribute to the reasonable application of PHS on clinical practice. At least according to our data, the duration and dose should be carefully considered before using the drug. At the same time, it is also possible to design and consider strategies such as modulation of the process to reduce the possible adverse effects of PHS.
