<p id="Par52">We proposed a hypothesis to explain the underlying mechanism of PHS toxicity: the toxicity of PHS may be attributed to its combinational effects on nervous system and Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Our data showed that prolonged exposure to PHS could be toxic to the lifespan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b), development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), reproduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) and locomotion behavior (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, f) of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This may be closely related to the neurotoxicity of PHS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The changes in the behavior of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> are mainly controlled by a variety of neurons and their mutual nerve conduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Acetylcholine is closely related to many behaviors of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and locomotion behavior is the most important acetylcholine-related behavior [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Metrifonate and haloxon can lead to the loss of kinetism by inhibiting the activity of AChE in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Harmaline and harmol showed good inhibitory activities against AChE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The AChE activity of control 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was 30.61 U/mg pro and exposure to 1.00 mg/mL of PHS was 12.36 U/mg pro. Our data showed PHS could obviously decrease the AChE activity of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
