 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a model animal with simple central nervous system, which is similar to vertebrates in neurophysiology. 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be used to estimate the harmful effects of toxic substances on the biological nervous system. AChE activity is a classic indicator of neurotoxicity. AChE plays an important role in the process of biological nerve conduction. In cholinergic synapses, AChE can degrade acetylcholine and stop the excitatory effect of neurotransmitters on the post-synaptic membrane, thus ensuring the normal transmission of nerve signals in the body. Prolonged exposure to 0.25 mg/mL of PHS did not significantly influence the AChE activity of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. But prolonged exposure to 0.50, 1.00 mg/mL of PHS significantly decreased the AChE activity of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This result implied that prolonged exposure to PHS may damage the nervous system of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
