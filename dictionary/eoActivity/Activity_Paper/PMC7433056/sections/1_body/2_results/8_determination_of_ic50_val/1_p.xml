<p id="Par47">The DPPH method is a commonly used method to evaluate and screen the antioxidant activity of substances in vitro. It has the advantages of simple operation, high sensitivity and good reproducibility. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is the antioxidant concentration when the DPPH concentration drops to 50%. The lower the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the stronger the free radical scavenging ability of the antioxidant; the higher the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the weaker the scavenging activity.
