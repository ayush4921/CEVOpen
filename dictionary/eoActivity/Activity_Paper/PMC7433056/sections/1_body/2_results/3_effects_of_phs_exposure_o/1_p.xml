<p id="Par39">Evaluation indexes of locomotion behavior of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> include four aspects: head thrash, body bend, basic movement and locomotion rate. Locomotion behavior, as an index reflecting the basic function of the nervous system, has been widely used in the analysis of neurotoxicity. In this study, we chose head thrash and body bend as locomotion behaviors evaluation indicator. Prolonged exposure to all the examined concentrations of PHS significantly decreased head thrash of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Prolonged exposure to 0.25 mg/mL of PHS did not significantly influence the body bend of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but prolonged exposure to 0.50, 1.00 g/mL of PHS significantly decreased the body bend of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f)
