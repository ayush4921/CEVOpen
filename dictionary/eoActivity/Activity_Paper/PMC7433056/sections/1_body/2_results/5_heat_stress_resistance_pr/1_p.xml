<p id="Par41">Heat stress is the sum of non-specific responses produced by an animal when it is stimulated by high temperatures that exceed its body’s ability to regulate temperature. Too high temperature disrupts the normal heat balance of the organism, and the body will produce a series of complex physiological and psychological changes to deal with this change. Heat stress is a commonly used experiment in aging research. To investigate whether PHS has a stress resistance property,
