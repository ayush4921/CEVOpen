<p>Compounds 
 <bold>66</bold> and 
 <bold>116</bold> were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against three human pathogenic strains (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10231) by microbroth dilution method in 96-well culture plates. Bioassay results indicated that compound 
 <bold>116</bold> displayed potent activity against 
 <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic> with an MIC value of 6.25 µM, which was equal to that of ampicillin sodium as a positive control, and compound 
 <bold>66</bold> had a moderate inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with an MIC value of 25.0 µM [
