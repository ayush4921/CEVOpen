<p>Anti-enterovirus 71 (EV71) was assayed on Vero cells with the CCK-8 (DOjinDo, Kumamoto, Japan) method. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the testing compound was calculated using the GraphPad Prism software. Ribavirin was used as the positive control with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 177.0 µM. Vaccinol J 
 <bold>125</bold> exhibited in vitro anti-EV71 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30.7 µM, and the inhibition effect was stronger than positive control ribavirin [
