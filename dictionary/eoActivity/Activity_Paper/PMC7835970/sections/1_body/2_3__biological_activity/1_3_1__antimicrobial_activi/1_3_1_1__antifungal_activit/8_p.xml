<p>The methylated dihydropyrone 
 <bold>189</bold> and compound 
 <bold>274</bold> were tested for in vitro antifungal activity using the Oxford diffusion assay against 
 <italic>M. violaceum</italic> (
 <italic>Microbotryum violaceum</italic>) and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), 
 <bold>189</bold> and 
 <bold>274</bold> exhibited moderate antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. violaceum</italic> at 25 μg/mL. Nystatin was the positive control for antifungal assays, previous studies had shown the MIC values of nystatin in the 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> culture used was 4 µg/mL and for 
 <italic>M. violaceum</italic> was 2 µg/mL [
