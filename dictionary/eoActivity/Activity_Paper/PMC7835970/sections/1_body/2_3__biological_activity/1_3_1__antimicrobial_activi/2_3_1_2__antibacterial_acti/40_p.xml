<p>The antimicrobial activities of compounds were tested against six microorganisms by the microdilution method, including 
 <italic>Mycobacterium phlei</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio parahemolyticus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. Among them, compound 
 <bold>416</bold> showed promising activity against 
 <italic>M. phlei</italic> with the same MIC values as positive control ciprofloxacin of 12.5 µM, which indicated the antituberculosis potential. Compound 
 <bold>415</bold> showed activities against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with MIC value of 100 µM. Compound 
 <bold>416</bold> showed activities against 
 <italic>M. phlei</italic> with MIC value of 6.25 µM. Ciprofloxacin was positive control shared same MIC values of 1.56 µM against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium phlei</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [
