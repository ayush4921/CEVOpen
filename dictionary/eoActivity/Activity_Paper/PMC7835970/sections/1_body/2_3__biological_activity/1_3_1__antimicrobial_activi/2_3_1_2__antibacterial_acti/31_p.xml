<p>Antibacterial efficacies of the metabolite 
 <bold>339</bold> were determined by serial dilution assay. Compound 
 <bold>339</bold> showed strong activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> with MIC values of 8.33 µg/mL and 16.66 µg/mL, respectively, while the MIC values of Oxytetracyclin used as the positive control against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> were 4.16 µg/mL and 0.40 µg/mL, respectively. While the MIC value of compound 
 <bold>C</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00959-f013">Figure 13</xref>) against 
 <italic>Mucor hiemalis</italic> (16.66 µg/mL) was the same as that of nystatin used as positive control. The two active metabolites are anthranilic acid derivatives with a phenylethyl core. Since metabolite 
 <bold>340</bold>, which contains a phenylmethyl group instead of a phenylethyl residue, was not active, it was concluded that the phenylethyl moiety in compounds 
 <bold>339</bold> and 
 <bold>C</bold> is essential for their antimicrobial activity [
