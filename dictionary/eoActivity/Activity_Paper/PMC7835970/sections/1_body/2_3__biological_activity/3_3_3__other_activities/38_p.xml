<p>All new compounds were tested for in vitro anti-inflammatory activities against nitric oxide production in liposaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells, and dexamethasone was used as the positive control. Compound 
 <bold>436</bold> showed significant inhibitory activity against NO production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.9 μM. They were also evaluated for in vitro antidiabetic activities based on the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, PTP1b, and XOD. Compounds 
 <bold>437</bold> and 
 <bold>441</bold> showed moderate inhibitory activities toward XOD and PTP1b, respectively, at 10 μM with inhibition rates of 67% and 76% [
