<p>The inhibitory effects on human carboxylesterases (hCE1, hCE2) of compound 
 <bold>386</bold> were evaluated. The results demonstrated that bysspectin A 
 <bold>386</bold> was a novel and highly selective inhibitor against hCE2 with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.01 ÂµM. Docking simulation also demonstrated that active compound 
 <bold>386</bold> created interaction with the Ser-288 (the catalytic amino-acid in the catalytic cavity) of hCE2 via hydrogen bonding, revealing its highly selective inhibition toward hCE2 [
