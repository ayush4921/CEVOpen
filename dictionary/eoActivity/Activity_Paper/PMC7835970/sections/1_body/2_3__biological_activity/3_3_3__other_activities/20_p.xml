<p>Compounds 
 <bold>256</bold>–
 <bold>257</bold> were investigated for their inhibitory activities against the LPS-activated production of NO in RAW264.7 cells using the Griess assay with indomethacin as a positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37.5 ± 1.6 μM). The effects of compounds on cell proliferation/viability were determined using MTT method, and none of the test compounds exhibited cytotoxicity at their effective concentrations. Compounds 
 <bold>256</bold> and 
 <bold>257</bold> showed strong inhibitory effects on the production of NO, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.78 ± 0.06 and 1.26 ± 0.11 μM, respectively [
