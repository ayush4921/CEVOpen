<p>The artificial insect mixed drug method was used to determine the insecticidal activities of compound 
 <bold>228</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>228</bold> displayed remarkable insecticidal activities against first instar larvae of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera with mortality rates of 70.2%. Commercially-available matrine was used as positive control, causing 87.4% mortality rate under the same conditions. Acute cytotoxicity towards hatching rate, malformation and mortality of zebrafish embryos or larvae were also performed. Compounds 
 <bold>227</bold> and 
 <bold>228</bold> significantly decreased the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos, compound 
 <bold>228</bold>, used at concentrations of 5–100 μg/L, decreased the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos to below 20% [
