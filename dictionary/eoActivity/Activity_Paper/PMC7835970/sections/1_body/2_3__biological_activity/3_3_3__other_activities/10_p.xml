<p>Compounds 
 <bold>135</bold>–
 <bold>146</bold> were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 microglial cells using Griess assay. Meanwhile, the effects of compounds 
 <bold>135</bold>–
 <bold>146</bold> on cell proliferation/viability were measured using the MTT method. As a result, compounds 
 <bold>138</bold>, 
 <bold>139</bold>, 
 <bold>142</bold>, 
 <bold>143</bold>, 
 <bold>145</bold> and 
 <bold>146</bold> exhibited inhibitory activity against NO production with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 56.3–98.4 μM (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds on LPS-stimulated NO production in RAW264.7 macrophage cells 
 <bold>138</bold>: 85.2 ± 4.3 µM, 
 <bold>139</bold>: 98.4 ± 5.6 µM, 
 <bold>142</bold>: 95.9 ± 3.4 µM,

 <bold>145</bold>: 60.0 ± 3.1 µM, 
 <bold>146</bold>: 56.3 ± 1.1 µM). Indomethacin was used as a positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 33.6 ± 1.4 μM) [
