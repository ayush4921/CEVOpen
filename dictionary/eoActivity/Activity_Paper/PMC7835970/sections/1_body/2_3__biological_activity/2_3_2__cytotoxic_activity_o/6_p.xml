<p>The in vitro cytotoxicity assay was performed with some cancer cells including the mouse fibroblast cell line L929, cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1, human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7, human prostate cancer PC-3, squamous carcinoma A431, human lung carcinoma A549 and ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3. Compounds 
 <bold>169</bold>, 
 <bold>170</bold> showed significant cytotoxicity against the mouse fibroblast cell line L929 and the cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6.3 to 23 µg/mL (
 <bold>169</bold>: 23 µg/mL against the mouse fibroblast cell line L929, 22 µg/mL against cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1 
 <bold>170</bold>: 6.3 µg/mL against the mouse fibroblast cell line L929, 11 µg/mL against cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1). Compound 
 <bold>170</bold> showed the strongest cytotoxicity among the metabolites tested against human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.5 µg/mL. Besides, compound 
 <bold>170</bold> showed cytotoxicity against squamous carcinoma A431, human lung carcinoma A549 and ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.5 µg/mL, 16 µg/mL and 6.5 µg/mL. Epothilon B was used as positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against 7 cancer cells mentioned above were 0. 8 ng/mL, 0. 06 ng/mL, 0.04 ng/mL, 1.1 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL and 0.12 ng/mL) [
