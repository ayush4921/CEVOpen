<p>Compounds 
 <bold>262</bold>,
 <bold>426</bold>–
 <bold>427</bold> were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against a human leukemia cell line (K562), a colon adenocarcinoma cell line (SW480), and a human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2). Compounds 
 <bold>262</bold> and 
 <bold>427</bold> showed moderate cytotoxic activity against all the tested cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 12.0 to 28.3 µM (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against K562, SW480, and HepG2 cells: 
 <bold>262</bold>: 15.9 (13.1–19.3) µM, 12.0 (8.8–16.4) µM, 28.3 (23.2–34.6) µM 
 <bold>427</bold>: 20.6 (14.0–30.3) µM, 20.3 (16.8–24.4) µM, 20.4 (16.4–25.4) µM). In addition, compound 
 <bold>426</bold> showed moderate cytotoxicity towards K562 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 18.7 µg/mL. Cisplatin was used as the positive control with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.8, 5.5, and 6.8 µM toward K562, SW480, and HepG2 cells, respectively [
