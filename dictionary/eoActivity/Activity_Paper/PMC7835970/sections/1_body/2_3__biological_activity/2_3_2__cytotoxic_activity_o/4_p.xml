<p>Since many triterpenoids isolated from plants of the family Schisandraceae are reported to reduce the risk of liver diseases and cancer, compounds 
 <bold>93</bold>–
 <bold>100</bold> were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity against human hepaticellular liver carcinoma cell (HepG2), according to the MTT method, with cisplatin as the positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 9.8 ± 0.21 µM). Compounds 
 <bold>93</bold>–
 <bold>100</bold>, showed moderate cytotoxic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 14.3 to 21.3 µM (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds 
 <bold>93</bold>: 15.6 µM, 
 <bold>94</bold>: 16.1 µM, 
 <bold>95</bold>: 16.4 µM, 
 <bold>96</bold>: 15.4 µM, 
 <bold>97</bold>: 17.9 µM, 
 <bold>98</bold>: 18.8 µM, 
 <bold>99</bold>: 14.3 µM, 
 <bold>100</bold>: 21.3 µM). It should be noted that those metabolites 
 <bold>93</bold>–
 <bold>100</bold> produced during fermentation showed stronger cytotoxicity to HepG2 cell line than that of nigranoic acid, the main component of non-fermented
