<p>All isolated new compounds 
 <bold>190</bold>–
 <bold>194</bold> were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against various cancer cell lines, which include A549, Raji, HepG2, MCF-7, HL-60 and K562. Compounds 
 <bold>190</bold>–
 <bold>194</bold> displayed in vitro inhibitory activities against the six tumor cell lines to various degrees. Among them, compound 
 <bold>192</bold> showed the most potent cytotoxicity against all evaluated cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.2, 2.0, 1.6, 2.2, 1.0 and 1.2 μg/mL, respectively, which were even stronger than an anti-tumor agent DDP used as positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against six cell lines: 2.8 μg/mL, 2.1 μg/mL, 2.6 μg/mL, 2.4 μg/mL, 2.1 μg/mL and 2.2 μg/mL). Compounds 
 <bold>193</bold> and 
 <bold>194</bold> also exhibited moderate growth inhibition against six tested cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 6.3–26.8 μg/mL for 
 <bold>193</bold> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.1–24.4 μg/mL for 
 <bold>194</bold>. However, compounds 
 <bold>190</bold> and 
 <bold>191</bold> were effective only against HL-60 and K562 cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value: 
 <bold>190</bold>: 24.1 μg/mL, 10.7 μg/mL 
 <bold>191</bold>: 24.2 μg/mL, 23.1 μg/mL). These results indicated that the keto or hemiketal functionality (e.g., 
 <bold>192</bold>–
 <bold>195</bold>) would play an important role in cytotoxic activity. Additionally, the activity profile reflected that the hydroxyl-substituted position had a different impact on cytotoxic activity. 2-Pyrones were more active as cytotoxic agents if the alkyl chain at C-6 was oxygenated but the addition of the hydroxyl subunit to C-8 and C-9 significantly decreased the activity [
