<p>Compound 
 <bold>221</bold> was assessed for its antiproliferative activities against the mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) cell line using the in vitro cytotoxicity (MTT) assay and kahalalide F as a standard antiproliferative agent (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.30 µM). Results revealed the new compound, aflaquinolone H (
 <bold>221</bold>), exhibited moderate antiproliferative activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.3 µM) which highlights the role of the hydroxyl group at C-21 for the antiproliferative activity [
