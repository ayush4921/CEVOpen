<p>According to genome sequencing, a lot of microorganisms have the potential to produce secondary metabolites with novel structures. However, many fungal gene clusters may be silent under standard laboratory growth conditions. As a result, some pathways to yield secondary metabolites cannot be expressed. Therefore, activating these pathways means that we can get more novel compounds. The approach of microorganism co-culture, involving the cultivation of two or more microorganisms in the same lab environment can do a favour for us. Interestingly, 29 new compounds summarized above were obtained through co-culture of bacteria and fungi or two fungi. Besides, by adding CuCl
 <sub>2</sub> into fermentation medium of an endophytic fungus 
 <italic>P. citrinum</italic> 46, two compounds were isolated. The results showed that adding Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> into medium to activate silent fungal metabolic pathways can increase the discovery of new compounds.
