<p>Combining the three successive fractionation steps allowed us to obtain fraction 10.3.3 that was re-analyzed by analytical HPLC revealing a single peak with &gt;99% UV-purity. Starting from 20 g of litchi dry roots, we obtained around 9 mg of fraction 10.3.3 (protocol yield of 0.045 g/Kg DM).</p>
