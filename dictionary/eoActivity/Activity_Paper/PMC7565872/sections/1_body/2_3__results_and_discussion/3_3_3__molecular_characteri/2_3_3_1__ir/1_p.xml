<p>The most striking feature of the infrared spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f005">Figure 5</xref>) is the intense and relatively broad band around 1600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Such an intense band is not expected from double bond stretching vibration but has been observed in molecules with 1,3-diketone moiety. The band is thought to result from the resonance and the formation of a strong hydrogen bond when one of the ketones enolizes. Carbonyl stretching bands are sometimes observed in 1,3-diketones infrared spectrum but the intensity of the bands is highly variable according to the molecular structure. 1,3-dihydroxy aromatic structures such as resorcinol and phloroglucinol also show an intense band around 1600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and no intense band in the carbonyl region of the spectrum. This could suggest that the isolated molecule is a phenolic compound possessing −OH moieties in 1,3 positions. The occurrence of a small node at 3543 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> suggests an intermolecular bonded −OH. The strong band at 1065 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be explained by C-O stretching from ether bond.
