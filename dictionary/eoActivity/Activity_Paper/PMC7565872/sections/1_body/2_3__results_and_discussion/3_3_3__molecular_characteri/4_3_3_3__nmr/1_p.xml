<p>Based on its 2D 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f007">Figure 7</xref>), the isolated substance possesses at least eight unsaturated or aromatic C-H (green circle, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The HSQC and HMBC spectra (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-01347">Figures S1â€“S5</xref>) comparison revealed that the molecule also contains several unsaturated quaternary carbon atoms (154, 144, 131, 108, 106, 99 ppm). The quaternary C around 154 and 144 ppm are supposed to be linked to O in opposition to the 99 ppm and 130 ppm ones. The molecule does not seem to possess ketone, aldehyde or carboxylic acid moieties but includes an aliphatic part as suggested by several HSQC C-H signals (yellow, blue and red circles in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f007">Figure 7</xref>) and a CH
 <sub>2</sub> signal (grey circle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f007">Figure 7</xref>). From HSQC and HMBC data, this saturated structure is likely a heterocycle containing one oxygen atom. Several signals support the connection of the heterocycle to two aromatic structures: 
 <sup>1</sup>H at 5.55 ppm coupled to 
 <sup>13</sup>C at 115, 119 and 130 ppm; 
 <sup>1</sup>H at 2.8 and 2.7 ppm coupled to 
 <sup>13</sup>C at 154 and 100 ppm. A more detailed allocation of HMBC signals is provided in
