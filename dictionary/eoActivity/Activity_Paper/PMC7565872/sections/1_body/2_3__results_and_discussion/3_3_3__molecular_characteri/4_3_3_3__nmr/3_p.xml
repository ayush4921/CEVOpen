<p>If the catechin structure seems relevant, there are still too many signals corresponding to aromatic C-H, non-aromatic hydroxylated C-H and non-aromatic C-H. As suggested by mass spectrometry, several elements of NMR spectra support that the molecule is an oligomer, probably a tetramer from the repetitive patterns observed in HSQC and HMBC experiments:

   <p>In HSQC, four signals are observed for non-aromatic hydroxylated C-H (red circle,

   <p>In HMBC, four aromatic 
    <sup>1</sup>H (two around 6.9 ppm and two around 6.8 ppm) are also coupled to 
    <sup>13</sup>C with a common pattern (131; 144 ppm).

   <p>In HSQC, the presence of signals at 4.2; 27 and 4.3; 36 ppm (
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f007">Figure 7</xref>, yellow circle) can be explained if several catechin units are linked together since unpolymerized catechin should only display CH
    <sub>2</sub> signals in this area of the spectrum.

   <p>In HMBC, the B-type bond between units is confirmed by the coupling of 
    <sup>1</sup>H at 4.3 ppm with 
    <sup>13</sup>C at 154, 153, 151, 108, 106, 77 and 71 ppm. Signals at 4.3; 154,153 and 151 ppm correspond to H5 coupled to C1’, C3 and C3′. The coupling of H5 with C4 and C4′ are also expected and probably correspond to signals at 4.3; 108 and 106 ppm, respectively (HMBC spectrum in
