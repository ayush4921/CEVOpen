<p>The bio-guided successive fractionation steps are illustrated in the different chromatograms shown below (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In each chromatogram, the peak that was selected after each fractionation and biological activities evaluation (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) has been pointed out. In the first, fraction F10 was selected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f002">Figure 2</xref>) because of its biological activities (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); in the second one, F10.3 was selected because of its biological activities (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The identification work took place on peak F10.3.3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f004">Figure 4</xref>), and its biological activities can be found in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, obtained after the third fractionation/purification step.
