 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the fraction 10 is highlighted for its high anti-tyrosinase and antioxidant activities and was further fractionated into sub-fractions (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) where fraction 10.3 was selected for the third fractionation step (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01347-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The molecular characterization took place on fraction 10.3.3.
