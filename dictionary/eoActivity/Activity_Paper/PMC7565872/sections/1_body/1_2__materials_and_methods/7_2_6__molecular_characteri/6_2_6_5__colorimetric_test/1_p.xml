<p>In order to confirm the properties of the component, a colorimetric test based according to Prior et al., 2010 [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was performed. The DMAC (4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) test has proven to be effective when trying to quantify proanthocyanidins in plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A 0.1 mg/mL sample solution was prepared in pure ethanol. The DMAC solution was done following Prior’s protocol: 0.01 g of DMAC was placed in a 10 mL volumetric flask and a solution of 36% hydrochloric acid, distilled water and pure ethanol (1:1:6) was added to the mark. The reaction was performed at room temperature: 100 µL of sample solution was placed in a spectrophotometric cell added with 500 µL of DMAC solution and read immediately at 640 nm.
