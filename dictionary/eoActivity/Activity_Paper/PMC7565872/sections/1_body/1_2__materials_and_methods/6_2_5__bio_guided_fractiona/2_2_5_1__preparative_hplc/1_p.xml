<p>A first preparative HPLC step was conducted as follows: the column was a 150 × 21.2 mm–5 µm RP C8 column (Strategy, Interchrom, Interchim, Montluçon, France). Two mL solution (100 mg/mL) of the samples was injected at a 20 mL/min flow. The mobile phase was composed of solvent A: acetonitrile (CAN)–0.1% formic acid and solvent B: H
 <sub>2</sub>O–0.1% formic acid, and the optimized gradient was from 100% B to 20% (A)–80% (B) in 50 min, and then a final hold for 5 min. The mobile phase reached 60% (A)–40% (B) at 65:00 min and was then reset to 100% (B) in 10 min. From this first cycle, 17 fractions were collected and tested for the two biological activities. The most potent fraction went through a second preparative HPLC purification process.
