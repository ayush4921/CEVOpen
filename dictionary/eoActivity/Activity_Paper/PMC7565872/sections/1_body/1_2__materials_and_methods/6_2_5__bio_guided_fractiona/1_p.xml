<p>Throughout the purification process, the anti-tyrosinase inhibition test and the antioxidant test were conducted for all fractions. Based on preliminary observation, the chromatograms were systematically recorded at 280 nm as it gave the best contrast; however, in order to control potential left out compounds, other wavelengths were also registered (254 nm, 310 nm and 360 nm) with the cut-off for eluants being at 190 nm.</p>
