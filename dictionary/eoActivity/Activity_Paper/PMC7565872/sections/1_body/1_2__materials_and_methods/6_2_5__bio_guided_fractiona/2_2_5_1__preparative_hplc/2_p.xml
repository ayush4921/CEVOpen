<p>The second preparative HPLC was conducted on this fraction with the same apparatus; the detector was set at 280 nm; 2 mL of sample at a 100 mg/mL were injected at a 16 mL/min flow rate. The instrument was fitted with a 250 × 22 mm–10 µm RP C4 column (Protein from Vydac, Hicrom, Lutterworth, UK). The same solvents were used for this fractionation. The gradient started with a steady step with 0% (A)–100% (B) between the 00:00 min mark and the 05:00 min mark. At the 10:00 min mark, it had reached 5% (A)–95% (B). At the 55:00 min mark, it had gone down to 30% (A)–70% (B); from that point it went back up to 0% (A)–100% (B) at the 57:00 min mark. From this second cycle, 5 fractions were collected and tested for the two biological activities. The most potent fraction was once again fractionated using an analytical HPLC setup mounted with a fraction collector.</p>
