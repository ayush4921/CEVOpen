<p>In order to determine the antioxidant potency of the plant samples, a protocol based on the DPPH method and adapted from M. S. Blois 1965 [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was used. A 2.10
 <sup>−4</sup> M DPPH solution was prepared using methanol and was then added to different dilution of the plant extracts. The solution was left to react for 30 min and then observed at 517 nm by UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 7000 from Biochrom, Cambridge, UK). The polar plant extract was diluted using HPLC grade methanol and the non-polar extract was diluted using HPLC grade ethyl acetate. The 10
 <sup>−2</sup> and 10
 <sup>−3</sup> dilutions were applied to the plant extracts. A 1:1 (v/v) ratio was applied with the reagent and the plant samples. The positive control both kind of samples was TROLOX (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) 2.10
 <sup>−3</sup> M in methanol and blank was 100% methanol.
