<p>Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a key enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway. In this work, the polyphenol oxidase activity was exploited based on the adaptation of the work of Rangkadilok et al., 2007 [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Through the consumption of L-DOPA, it produces dopachromes that are detected/measured at 475 nm. In order to evaluate the impact of the plant extract on the synthesis of these dopachromes, inhibitions were compared with the inhibitory action of 1 mM kojic acid in phosphate buffer (0.05 M–pH 6.5). Dilution factors of 10
 <sup>−1</sup>, 10
 <sup>−2</sup> and 10
 <sup>−3</sup> were applied to the samples using the same phosphate buffer. The substrate solution was made of a 1 mM solution of L-DOPA in distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O and the enzymatic suspension was made at a 625 U/mL concentration in phosphate buffer. As oxygen is also part of the enzymatic reaction as a co-substrate, the phosphate buffer used in the reactive mix was saturated with pure oxygen for 30 min at room temperature prior to the analysis.
