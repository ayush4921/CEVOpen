<p>Mushrooms possess medicinal properties due to the presence of different types of secondary metabolites such as polysaccharides, lectins, lactones, terpenoids, alkaloids, antibiotics, and metal-chelating agents [
 <xref rid="B39-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These secondary metabolites are bioactive compounds with a great potential to be applied as therapeutic agents. Traditionally, the bioactive components were mostly obtained from field-cultivated mushrooms. This production system was and still is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process with a very low control of the product quality and the productivity of desired metabolites [

While all parts of a mushroom can be used for medicinal purposes, the bioactivity is much higher in mycelia than in fruiting bodies and spores. Therefore, submerged cultivation of mushroom mycelia is a promising technology for the efficient large-scale production of mycelia biomass and value-added secondary metabolites in a compact space, shorter times, and reduced contamination [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Bioactive metabolites are influenced by different culture conditions such as physical conditions (temperature, pH, oxygen level, incubation time, etc.), medium composition (carbon source, nitrogen source, different salts, special additives like vegetative oils, vitamin), mode and methods of fermentation (agitated culture, static culture) [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The principle aim for optimization of culturing conditions is to accelerate mycelia growth and enhance productions of secondary metabolites, especially polysaccharides and triterpenoids as the most active ingredients of mushrooms [

 <xref rid="B44-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This technology is feasible for actual application, because by acting on the main factors affecting the fermentation process and the purification systems, highly efficient production of various secondary metabolites can be developed. Analyzing the published results related to the use of isolated compounds and extracts derived from various mushroom species with an anti-hyperglycemic effect, it can be concluded that two groups of compounds are most important: Polysaccharides and terpenoids.
