<p>One of the oldest classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs, introduced in the 1950s, is represented by the insulin secretagogues, sulfonylureas [
 <xref rid="B25-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sulfonylureas act directly on the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans to stimulate insulin secretion. They enter the β-cell and bind to the cytosolic surface of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), causing closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), depolarizing the plasma membrane, opening calcium channels, and activating calcium-dependent signaling proteins that control the contractility of micotubules and mictrofilaments that mediate the exocytotic release of insulin granules [

The most common adverse effects of sulfonylureas are hypoglycemia, mainly because of insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production. Other common limitations of these drugs are weight gain and severe cardiovascular risk due to binding of sulfonylureas to KATP channels in the cardiomyocytes, leading to ischemic preconditioning and further to myocardial infarction [
 <xref rid="B27-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to the association of sulfonylureas with serious life-threatening events, the current 2019 ADA guidelines conserve using these drugs as last-line therapy if all other classes of antidiabetic medications fail.
