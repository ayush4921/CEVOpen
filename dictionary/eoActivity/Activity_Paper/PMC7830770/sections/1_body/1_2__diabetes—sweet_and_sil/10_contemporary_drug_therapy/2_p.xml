<p>In the case of type 1 diabetes the insulin replacement therapy is necessary and involves multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The main adverse reaction of insulin treatment is hypoglycemia, especially in intensified treatment where insufficient calorie uptake or physical exertion could be possible triggers. Additional medications also may be prescribed for people with type 1 diabetes, including medications for high blood pressure, aspirin, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Besides taking insulin on a daily basis, patients with type 1 diabetes should be disciplined in carbohydrate, fat, and protein counting, persistent in eating healthy foods, and exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
