<p>First-line therapy drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes are the biguanides, of which metformin is the most prescribed antidiabetic agent in most countries [

Because of its main glucose-lowering effect, which appears to be a reduction of hepatic glucose production, metformin is not sufficient to cause hypoglycemia when used as mono-therapy. The main adverse effect of metformin is abdominal discomfort and other gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea, which can be ameliorated by taking the drug with meals. The most serious but rare adverse effect of metformin therapy is lactic acidosis [
