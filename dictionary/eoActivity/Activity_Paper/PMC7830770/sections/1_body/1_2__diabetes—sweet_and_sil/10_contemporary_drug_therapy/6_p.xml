<p>A third class of oral hypoglycemic agents is thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also known as glitazones. They modulate the expression of several genes involved in differentiation of adipocytes and enzymes involved in lipid homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B28-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] by targeting the key adipogenic transcription factor, the nuclear receptor/transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ) in white adipose tissue. In experimental and clinical settings, TZDs decrease insulin resistance, promote lipogenesis in peripheral adipocytes, decrease hepatic and peripheral triglycerides, decrease activity of visceral adipocytes, and decrease the ratio of leptin to adiponectin, which are two important adipokines involved in appetite control and insulin sensitivity, respectively [

Less dramatic is the weight gain/water retention and edema that TZDs may induce. New data about TZD-mediated adverse effects improve the clinician’s ability to select patients that will have minimal significant side-effects [
