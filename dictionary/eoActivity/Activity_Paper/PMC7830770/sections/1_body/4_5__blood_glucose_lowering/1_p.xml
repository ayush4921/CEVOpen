<p>Terpenes are known as an important bioactive metabolite produced by many higher fungi. They consist of multiple isoprene units (containing five carbon atoms) and are usually grouped according to the number of isoprene (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>) units in the monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes, and politerpenes [

Diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and sesquiterpenoid are the typical representatives of terpenes with interesting biological activities. Triterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids are mainly common among mushroom metabolites and some of them have homologies with plant terpenoid compounds. Due to their lipophilic nature, triterpenes can bind to cell membranes, thereby affecting their fluidity, which in turn may limit their bioavailability. While they are large molecules, experiments revealed that triterpenoids penetrate both cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the liver, circulatory system, and other tissues [
