<p>Triterpenoids are the main bioactive constituents among the compounds present in the genus 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic>, with over 140 isolated triterpenoids from fungi of this genus. Interestingly, as many as 15 triterpenoids have been identified in 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and these isolated triterpenoids are a class of naturally occurring compounds and structurally highly oxidized lanostanes [
 <xref rid="B77-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These lanostane-type triterpenes have attracted considerable attention due to their potentially significant pharmacological activities and structural diversity. These compounds showed inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase enzyme activity (

 <xref rid="B78-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Moreover, methanol extract of 
 <italic>G. resinaceum</italic> showed inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B79-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Analysis of forty-eight triterpenes isolated from ethanol extract of the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>G. resinaceum</italic> showed that Resinacein C, ganoderic acid Y, lucialdehyde C, 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z3, 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z, and lucidadiol have strong inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase compared with the positive control drug acarbose, commonly used to lower blood glucose levels after a meal. The structure–activity relationships of 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> triterpenes on α-glucosidase inhibition showed that the C-24/C-25 double bond is necessary for α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the carboxylic acid group at C-26 and the hydroxy group at C-15 play important roles in enhancing inhibitory effects of these triterpenes [
