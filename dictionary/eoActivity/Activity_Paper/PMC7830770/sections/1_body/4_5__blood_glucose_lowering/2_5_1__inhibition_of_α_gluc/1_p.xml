<p>Managing postprandial hyperglycemia is a main beneficial strategy for the management of diabetes. Dietary carbohydrates are naturally digested into monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine and transferred into the blood circulation. One of the main carbohydrate-digestive enzymes located in the small intestine epithelium, α-glucosidase, is vital for conversion of disaccharides and oligosaccharides into glucose. Hence, restraint of α-glucosidase notably inhibits the conversion of polysaccharides into blood glucose, which serves as an effective step to control postprandial blood glucose levels [
