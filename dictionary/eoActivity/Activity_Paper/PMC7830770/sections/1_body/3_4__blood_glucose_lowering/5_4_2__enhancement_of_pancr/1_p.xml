<p>Endocrine pancreas has a significant capacity to adjust to changes in insulin demand [
 <xref rid="B57-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and it contains quiescent cells that can proliferate and replace dysfunctional/dead cells [
 <xref rid="B58-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, investigation of different mushrooms with stimulatory effect on pancreatic β-cell regeneration represents a vital goal in the development of effective nutrient-based treatments for diabetes [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. One of the reported mechanisms responsible for the increase in the number of functional insulin-positive β-cells is linked with the increased expression of the chemokine CXCL12 protein that mediates the restoration of β-cell population through the activation of the serine/threonine-specific Akt protein kinase prosurvival pathway [
 <xref rid="B60-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This mechanism is particularly important during the initial stage of diabetes development when it is potentially possible to expand still existing β-cell mass through regeneration.
