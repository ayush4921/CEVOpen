<p>Moreover, decreased β-cell mass along with elevated β-cell apoptosis is a relatively common feature of type 2 diabetes and is directly linked to the elevated expression of Bax and decreased level of Bcl-2. Several animal studies reported that these changes, observed in the pancreas of diabetic animals, were effectively reversed after polysaccharide supplementation, and were accompanied by an elevated ratio of Bcl-2/Bax [
