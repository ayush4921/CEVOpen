<p>Under physiological conditions, insulin secreted immediately after a meal activates the IRS/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Akt is a main mediator that activates the most biochemical mechanism in the glucose metabolism via activation of phosphofructokinase and deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) by an increase in glucose utilization and reduction of gluconeogenesis in liver and muscle [

Moreover, the IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway increases body lipid deposition, increases insulin production in the pancreas, and regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. However, in type 2 diabetes the PI3K/Akt pathway is damaged in various tissues as the result of insulin resistance, and in turn insulin resistance exacerbates the PI3K/Akt pathway, forming a vicious circle. GSK-3 protein expression and kinase activity are elevated in diabetes, while selective GSK-3 inhibitors have shown promise as modulators of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Administration of polysaccharides triggers insulin signaling pathways through insulin receptors, and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway by elevating the expressions of the insulin receptor (IRS1), PI3K, and Akt in type 2 diabetic animal models [
