<p>Oral administration of 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysaccharides in a high fat diet and STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels and up-regulated protein expressions of PI3K-p85, p-Akt (ser473) in liver, and GLUT4 in adipose tissue. These results indicated that the anti-hyperglycemic mechanism of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> polysaccharides involved the activation of insulin signaling through PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and the improvement of the glucose transportation by elevating the expression of GLUT4 in adipose tissues in diabetic mice [
