 </italic> was also used to evaluate the anti-diabetic properties of Cinnamon extracts. Various concentrations (12.5 µg/mL - 400 µg/mL) of the extract (100 µL) and 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9 (100 µL), amylase enzyme solution (0.5 mg/mL, 10 µL) were incubated at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C) for 10 min in a test tube. After pre-incubation, 100 µL of 1% starch in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9 was added to each tube. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C) for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by adding Dinitrosalicylic acid color reagent (100 µL). The test tubes were boiled in a water bath until the yellowish orange color was developed and then the tubes were allowed to cool. The reaction mixture was diluted with distilled water (5.00 mL), and a 250 µL aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred into a 96 well micro titer plate. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a micro plate reader (Spectra Max M5, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Acarbose was used as the positive control (12.5 µg/mL – 400 µg/mL).
