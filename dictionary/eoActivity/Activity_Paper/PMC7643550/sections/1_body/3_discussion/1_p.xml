<p>Cinnamon incorporated foods and nutraceuticals are popular choice in Sri Lanka due to the belief of its anti-diabetic properties. However, the anti-diabetic effect of two selected cinnamon accessions, 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> Sri Wijaya and 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> Sri Gemunu have not been scientifically verified and not well understood. In the current study, water extracts were prepared from selected Ceylon Cinnamon accessions to determine the anti-diabetic activity. The α-glucosidase/α-amylase inhibitory activities, total phenolic content, and proanthocyanidin content were evaluated in aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and the chemical profiles were identified using GC-MS.
