<p>The yield of extracts prepared using different methods from variety of Cinnamon quill samples are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>. The yield of the bark essential oil of novel Cinnamon accessions prepared using hydro distillation have been reported previously for SW (1.25%), SG (1.49%) (

 </italic>. Color of the bark, peeling ability, texture of the bark, odor and the morphology of the leaves have been examined in SW and SG varieties (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Ariyarathne, Weerasuriya &amp; Senarath, 2018</xref>). However, scientific evidences on the bark thickness, density of the oil cells of SW and SG have not been explored. Hence further investigations need to be done to evaluate the properties of the bark of these accessions.
