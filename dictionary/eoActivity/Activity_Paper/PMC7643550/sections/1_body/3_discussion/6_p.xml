 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Hafizur et al. (2015)</xref> findings. Benzoic acid, Cinnamyl alcohol, Trans-Cinnamic acid and 4-Allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol were the major compounds present in SW and SG aqueous extracts. According to the findings of 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Hafizur et al. (2015)</xref>, it is desirable to have high concentrations of Cinnamic acid as it has the potential to decrease the blood glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance and stimulate insulin secretion in diabetic rats in a time and dose dependent manner. Hence, it is favorable to have extracts with high concentrations of Cinnamic acid for better diabetic control. Cinnamaldehyde is identified as the major compound present in Cinnamon extracted using hydro distillation in several studies (

 <italic>E</italic>)-Cinnamyl acetate has shown better potency than Cinnamaldehyde alone (

 <italic>E</italic>)-Cinnamyl acetate seems to be important for potent enzyme inhibition. Therefore, poor enzyme inhibition observed in SD and SE are consistent with the absence of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Cinnamyl acetate. Higher amount of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Cinnamaldehyde alone does not improve the enzyme inhibitory potential. The inhibition by PWE of SW accession was higher due to the synergistic effect of the compounds present in the extract.
