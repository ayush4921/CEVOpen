<p>The multigene and ITS phylogenetic analyses were carried out using two datasets comprising 46 taxa and 3,160 characters, and 19 taxa and 1,698 characters including gaps, which were treated as missing data. The phylogenetic tree topology of the concatenated ITS-LSU-
 <italic>tef1</italic>-
 <italic>rpb2</italic> dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) is largely congruent with previously published phylogenies (e.g., Ortiz-Santana et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Justo et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Hussein et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic>) clustered in the Laetiporaceae Jülich (syn. Phaeolaceae Jülich) within the antrodia clade. At the species level, the neotype of 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> (Dong 897, HMAS 248370) and other studied specimens from East Asia (incl. Dong 750, which is the widely cultivated strain now in China) represent a well-supported (ML/BA 100/1.00), relatively homogeneous clade. Analysis of ITS sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) also shows that all newly sequenced strains from East Asia are nested in a strongly supported clade (ML/BA 100/1.00). This clade is clearly separated from the other clades in the phylogeny where 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> strains from North America and the holotype of

 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KX354451" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KX354451</ext-link>) are nested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the ITS phylogenetic tree, the 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic> and 
 <italic>Macrohyporia cocos</italic> samples from the United States separated into three distinct clades and they are not closely related to 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> in phylogeny. Our phylogenetic reconstruction of the ITS sequences indicates that the North American samples identified as 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> and deposited in GenBank cover more than one species. The newly sequenced 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> isolate (CBS 279.55), originating from South Carolina (Southeastern United States), forms a well-supported (ML/BA 100/1.00) lineage with two sequences originating from the United States (GenBank no.

 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> specimen collected from hardwood species (
 <italic>Alnus</italic>) from the United States (Lindner and Banik, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) formed a separate lineage within a moderately supported clade (ML/BA 63/0.91) and grouped with the type of 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudococos</italic> and two unpublished sequences of 
 <italic>Macrohyporia cocos</italic> (GenBank no.

 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic>, which is widely cultivated in China and Japan, is not conspecific with the North American
