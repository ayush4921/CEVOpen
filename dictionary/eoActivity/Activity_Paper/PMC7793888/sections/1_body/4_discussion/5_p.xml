<p>The primary fungal barcoding marker, ITS, is quite useful to separate most fungal species (Xu, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but it is not enough for some groups if we only use ITS in their phylogeny (LÃ¼cking et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Unusually, the ITS sequence of 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> is at least twice as long as the sequences for most taxa in the antrodia clade, which is presumably due to the insertions in the ITS1 and ITS2 regions (Lindner and Banik, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Although, in general the thresholds ranging from 97.0 to 99.5% sequence similarity were the most optimal values for delimiting species in the Agaricomycetes (Blaalid et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Garnica et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nilsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), Raja et al. (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) believed that a larger threshold value (&lt;97%) is acceptable in the case of

 <italic>cocos</italic> secondary barcoding markers (incl. protein-coding genes) we found moderate, but significant differences between the two species: 
 <italic>tef1</italic> (97.8%), 
 <italic>rpb2</italic> (98%). Therefore, both nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (ITS) and protein-coding genes (
 <italic>tef1, rpb2</italic>) showed remarkable differences between 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> with low intragroup heterogeneity in the later. This confirms the separation of the two species and suggests that the inclusion of additional markers (i.e., protein-coding genes) should be necessary for further studies on the genus 
 <italic>Pachmya</italic>.
