<p>The teleomorphic genus 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> contains eight legitimate names (Index Fungorum 2020), from which six species are accepted (He et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Wijayawardene et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, amongst these, only two species (
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pseudococos</italic>) are confirmed in 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> by phylogenetic data so far (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Therefore, further phylogenetic and type studies are needed to clarify the systematic position of those 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> species, which are currently not accepted in 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia castanopsis</italic> Y.C. Dai was described by Dai et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) from Southwest China (Yunnan Province, Zixishan Nature Reserve), based on a specimen growing on the wood of 
 <italic>Castanopsis orthacantha</italic> Franch. Morphologically, this species is closely related to 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic>, the type species of the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>. The two species have similar poroid and resupinate basidiocarps, but 
 <italic>Wolfiporia castanopsis</italic> has broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.6–10 × 5–7 μm, Dai et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 
 <italic>Wolfiporia curvispora</italic> Y. C. Dai was described from Northeast China (Jilin Province), based on a single collection growing on 
 <italic>Pinus koraiensis</italic> Siebold &amp; Zucc. Morphologically, 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>curvispora</italic> differs from other species in 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> by its biennial habit, small pores (4–5 per mm), small, curved and cylindrical basidiospores (3.3–4.1 × 1.2–1.8 μm, Dai, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cartilaginea</italic> Ryvarden was described from Northeast China (Jilin Province, Changbaishan National Nature Reserve) (Ryvarden et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) and phylogenetically found to be closely related to 
 <italic>W. dilatohypha</italic> Ryvarden &amp; Gilb. (syn. 
 <italic>Poria inflata</italic> Overh.); these two species formed a separate lineage that is closely related to, but distinct from the core 
 <italic>Laetiporus</italic> clade (Banik et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hussein et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Wolfiporia sulphurea</italic> (Burt) Ginns (syn. 
 <italic>Merulius sulphureus</italic> Burt) has similar morphological characteristics to 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic>, but it causes a white rot (Ginns, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Ginns and Lowe, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).
