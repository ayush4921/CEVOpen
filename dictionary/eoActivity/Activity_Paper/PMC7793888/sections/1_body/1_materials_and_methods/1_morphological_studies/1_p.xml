<p>Specimens and isolates of 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> “
 <italic>cocos</italic>” originating from East Asia (China, Japan) and North America were examined, including wild collections and commercially cultivated strains. Voucher specimens are deposited at the herbarium of the Institute of Microbiology, Beijing Forestry University (BJFC) and Herbarium Mycologium, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (HMAS). The designated neotype of 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> (Dong 897, HMAS 248370) is registered in MycoBank (Robert et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Macro-morphological descriptions are based on field notes and dry herbarium specimens. Microscopic measurements and drawings were made from slide preparations of dried specimens stained with Cotton Blue and Melzer's reagent following Dai (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In presenting spore size variation, 5% of measurements were excluded from each end of the range and this value is given in parentheses. The following abbreviations were used: KOH = 2% potassium hydroxide, CB– = acyanophilous, IKI– = neither amyloid nor dextrinoid in Melzer's reagent, L = mean spore length (arithmetic average of all spores), W = mean spore width (arithmetic average of all spores), Q = variation in the L/W ratios between specimens studied, n (a/b) = number of spores (a) measured from given number of specimens (b).
