<p>In the subkingdom Dikarya, many fungi can produce dense aggregations called sclerotia to survive challenging environmental conditions and to provide reserves for fungi to germinate (Coley-Smith and Cooke, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Willets and Bullock, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Sclerotia, as persistent fungal structures commonly contain biologically active secondary metabolites, are used as a functional food (Wong and Cheung, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Lau and Abdullah, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Large subterranean sclerotia of different mushroom species are traditionally consumed by indigenous people around the world (Oso, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Aguiar and Sousa, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Bandara et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lau et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In North America, the hypogeous sclerotia of a mushroom species, know as “Tuckahoe” or “Indian bread,” are utilized as a traditional food by native Americans (Gore, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1881</xref>; Weber, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">1929</xref>). The first valid scientific description of this fungal sclerotia was given by Schweinitz (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>), who named it 
 <italic>Sclerotium cocos</italic> Schwein. This name was accepted by Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>), when he proposed the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> Fr. Subsequently, the name 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> (Schwein.) Fr. became the most popular binomial of the Tuckahoe mushroom (e.g., Currey and Hanbury, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1860</xref>; Gore, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1881</xref>; Prilleaux, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1889</xref>; Elliott, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1922</xref>). However, the sexual stage of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> had remained unknown for a 100 years, until its whitish resupinate poroid fruiting body was discovered by Wolf (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">1922</xref>). At that time, the generic name 
 <italic>Poria</italic> Pers. was widely used for all light-colored and resupinate polypores (Murrill, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1920</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1923</xref>), thus the sexual stage was named as 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> (Schwein.) F. A. Wolf by Wolf (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">1922</xref>). The classification of 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> was revised by Johansen and Ryvarden (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>), who transferred this species to their new genus 
 <italic>Macrohyporia</italic> I. Johans. &amp; Ryvarden, typified by 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>dictyopora</italic> (Cooke) I. Johans. &amp; Ryvarden. Later, Ryvarden and Gilbertson (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) established the genus 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> Ryvarden &amp; Gilb. typified by 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic>, based on its different spore morphology similar to 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>dictyopora</italic>. However, Ginns and Lowe (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) placed 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> in synonymy with the earlier teleomorphic name 
 <italic>Daedalea extensa</italic> Peck, and transferred this species to 
 <italic>Macrohyporia</italic>. Subsequently, Ginns (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) accepted the generic revision of Ryvarden and Gilbertson (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) and corrected the name of the species by publishing the binomial, 
 <italic>Wolfiporia extensa</italic> (Peck) Ginns. Nevertheless, because of the research and the preference of the traditional medical community to continue using the familiar name “cocos,” Redhead and Ginns (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) proposed to conserve the name 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic>) over 
 <italic>Daedalea extensa</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia extensa</italic>). Finally, the conservation of 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> was recommended by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (Norvell, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).
