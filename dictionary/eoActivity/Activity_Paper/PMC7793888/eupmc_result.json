    "The fungus \"Fuling\" has been used in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 2000 years, and its sclerotia have a wide range of biological activities including antitumour, immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anti-aging etc. This prized medicinal mushroom also known as \"Hoelen\" is resurrected from a piece of pre-Linnean scientific literature. Fries treated it as <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> Fr. and mentioned that it was cultivated on pine trees in China. However, this name had been almost forgotten, and <i>Poria cocos</i> (syn. <i>Wolfiporia cocos</i>), originally described from North America, and known as \"Tuckahoe\" has been applied to \"Fuling\" in most publications. Although Merrill mentioned a 100 years ago that Asian <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> and North American <i>P. cocos</i> are similar but different, no comprehensive taxonomical studies have been carried out on the East Asian <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> and its related species. Based on phylogenetic analyses and morphological examination on both the sclerotia and the basidiocarps which are very seldomly developed, the East Asian samples of <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> including sclerotia, commercial strains for cultivation and fruiting bodies, nested in a strongly supported, homogeneous lineage which clearly separated from the lineages of North American <i>Wolfiporia cocos</i> and other species. So we confirm that the widely cultivated \"Fuling\" <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> in East Asia is not conspecific with the North American <i>Wolfiporia cocos</i>. Based on the changes in Art. 59 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the generic name <i>Pachyma</i>, which was sanctioned by Fries, has nomenclatural priority (ICN, Art. F.3.1), and this name well represents the economically important stage of the generic type. So we propose to use <i>Pachyma</i> rather than <i>Wolfiporia</i>, and subsequently <i>Pachyma hoelen</i> and <i>Pachyma cocos</i> are the valid names for \"Fuling\" in East Asia and \"Tuckahoe\" in North America, respectively. In addition, a new combination, <i>Pachyma pseudococos</i>, is proposed. Furthermore, it seems that <i>Pachyma cocos</i> is a species complex, and that three species exist in North America."
