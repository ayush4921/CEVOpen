<p>A previous study [
 <xref rid="B3-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] stated that the chemical components in 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> spp. possess some biological activities, such as cycloartane glycosides, which are used for leukemia treatment. Curculigosides F was found to inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) and antigen (HBeAg) in the HepG2.2.15 cell line, while chlorophenolic glycoside groups, such as curculigine M, curculigine N, and curculigine O, were reported to induce the proliferation of osteoblasts, orcinol glycosides, and 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3′-methoxy flavone, which have antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The phenolic group of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> spp. is known as an antioxidant and has α-glucosidase inhibition activity (hydrolysis of α-1,6-glycosidic bonds) [

 <xref rid="B8-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The metabolites in complex biological samples of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species could be identified rapidly and accurately using a metabolomics analysis to figure out their bioactive compounds. In the metabolomics analysis, there are two approaches to identifying the metabolites: the targeted and non-targeted analysis [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the non-targeted analysis, metabolite fingerprinting and profiling could provide the complete identification of metabolites from a biological sample of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species. The analytical instrumentations used to study the metabolites of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species were Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS to obtain qualitative and quantitative data. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) platforms have been widely used in plant science for metabolomics applications to identify and quantify compounds [
 <xref rid="B10-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and this approach is more sensitive and accurate for detecting metabolites [
