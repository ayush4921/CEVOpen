 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species are found from Sumatera to Papua. 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> spp. have several therapeutic properties because of their bioactive metabolites content. The rhizome of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species is traditionally used as estrogenic, neuroprotective, antibacterial, diuretics, aphrodisiac, antiapoptosis, anticancer, antidiabetic, and it neutralizes free radicals that likely could trigger various diseases. The leaves and flowers of
