<p>Dried extracts (5 mg) of each sample were mixed with 95 mg of KBr and then compressed to form a tablet (3 mm) before the analysis by FTIR spectrophotometry. The FITR spectrophotometer (Tensor 37, Bruker Optik GmbH, Germany) was equipped with a DTGS (deuterated detectors triglycine sulfate). FTIR spectra were recorded in the region of 4000–400 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, in absorbance mode, 32 scans/min, and resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. The spectra were processed by OPUS ver. 4.2 software (Bruker, Germany) and Spectragryph v1.2.11. This analysis was used to obtain the spectrum pattern from the sample of plant parts, i.e., leaves, petiole, and rhizome. Then, the obtained spectrum was analyzed by chemometrics for the identification, discrimination, groupings, and detecting any functional groups that might contribute to the antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition.
