<p>In addition, a heatmap of hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to present the results of putatively identified compounds in plant parts extracts of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> spp. and can be used to discover clustering patterns in the datasets. Heatmap was constructed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0. (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.metaboanalyst.ca" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.metaboanalyst.ca</uri>) using peak areas data (*.csv format) from all compounds detected in the adduct type ([M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> and [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup>) of each organ of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species. For hierarchical clustering analysis, distance measures using Euclidean, clustering algorithms using complete, and standardization using autoscale were chosen [
