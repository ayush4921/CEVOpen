<p>A procedure from Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] was used for the determination of total flavonoids with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 µL of the sample extract was mixed with 60 µL ethanol, 10 µL AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (10% 
 <italic>b</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), 10 µL potassium acetate (1 M), and 120 µL distilled water. The mixture was added to a 96-well plate, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. The total flavonoid content was expressed as quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) by using the calibration curve of quercetin (y = 0.003x − 0.0157, with R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9935).
