<p>PLS, as a supervised pattern recognition method, is often used to correlate medicinal plants’ biological activities with chromatographic or spectroscopic data (peak area or peak and absorbance value) [

 <xref rid="B37-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The parameters used to create the PLS model are latent variables (LV), and its full cross-validation was applied for data validation and avoiding overfitting [

 <xref rid="B40-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], line loading plots (weighted regression coefficients) in the PLS model were used to evaluate functional groups and chemical compounds, and also for samples clustering having low or high activity (x-y relation outliers) from the FTIR spectrum and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS data. Based on the results from PLS analysis, O–H, C–H, C=O, C–O, and C–C functional groups in the chemical structure of unknown-185 and unknown-85 are highly observed in the LLSB of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> and LOBM samples of 
 <italic>C. orchioides.</italic> This is predicted to significantly contribute to the antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition, whereas the phenolics (curculigoside B, 2,4-dichloro-5-methoxy-3-methylphenol, orcinol glucoside, and orchioside B), cycloartane triterpene (curculigosaponin G, H, and I), and norlignan compounds (1,1-Bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(2-furan)-methane and (1S,2R)-O-Methylnyasicoside) have an only minor contribution to the biological activities.
