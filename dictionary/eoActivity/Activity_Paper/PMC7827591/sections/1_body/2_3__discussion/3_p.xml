<p>Some compounds are present in higher concentrations when certain exogenous effects are present. At higher altitudes, soil pH and soil micronutrient content decrease, which can be attributed to lower mineralization processes at lower pH. Some compounds (phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids) increase in response to different altitudes. The accumulation of secondary metabolites is reported to have a vital role in tolerance to environmental biotic and abiotic stresses. These secondary metabolite help in the adaptation of stressed plants to different environmental conditions, for example, the accumulation of phenols and flavonoids as antioxidants [
