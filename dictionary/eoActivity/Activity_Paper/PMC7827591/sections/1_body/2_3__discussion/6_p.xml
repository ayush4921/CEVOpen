<p>UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS can be operated with complete automatization with a short analysis time, and the extracted sample does not need further derivatization. The heatmap model was used to analyze each metabolite’s area from the 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species’ extract and compare it for a similar compound. The heatmap model’s color intensity was used to depict the relative abundance in the sample extract of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species, and its variation can tell us about the compounds diversity in the plant [
 <xref rid="B29-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We used the peak area from the detected metabolites because it is widely accepted that the peak area of an analyte in a chromatogram is directly proportional to its concentration [
