<p>In this study, PCA, as an unsupervised pattern recognition technique, has been used for obtaining the information of patterns of sample grouping, similarities, and differences among species and plant parts [

A PCA plot will consist of two principal components (PCs) because the first two PCs capture most of the variant of the data the closer the PC values of the samples. The cumulative percentages of total variance (PC-1 and PC-2) obtained from FTIR spectra and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS data were 98% and 95%, respectively. It can be concluded that the PCA analysis used for sample clustering shows good accuracy in both terms of species and plant parts.
