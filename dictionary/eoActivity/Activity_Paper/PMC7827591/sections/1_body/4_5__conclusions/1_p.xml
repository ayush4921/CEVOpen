 <italic>C. latifolia</italic>’s rhizome contains a more significant amount of total phenolics than all parts of 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic>, and the phenolic compounds are more active as an antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitor than flavonoids. FTIR, UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and assays for biological activities, combined with PCA, can be used as a comprehensive method to distinguish the two species, 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> and 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic>, and also their plant parts. Using PLS analysis, we can predict the functional groups and the chemical compounds contributing to antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. The chemical compounds that contribute to the antioxidant activity and the inhibition of α-glucosidase, unknown-185 and unknown-85, are accumulated the highest in LLSB and LOBM samples, and all are founded in leaves of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species. Based on FTIR and PLS analysis, –OH, C=O, C–O, –C–H, C–C, and C–OH groups from these compounds are the major groups that might contribute the most to the biological activities in 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> plant species.
