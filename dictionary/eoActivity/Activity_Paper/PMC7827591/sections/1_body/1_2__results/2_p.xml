<p>The concentrations of total flavonoid in 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00042-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. According to the plant parts and their origin location, the flavonoid concentrations in these two species are also varied. We found that the highest total flavonoid content was obtained in 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> leaves (LOGM) as 5.44 ± 0.01 mg QE/g, while the lowest content was from 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> rhizome (ROGM) as 0.82 ± 0.01 mg QE/g. Both samples were derived from the Gowa-Malakaji area in the southern part of Sulawesi island. The abundance of flavonoid compounds is more accumulated in the leaves than in the other plant parts (rhizome and/or petiole) of the two species.
