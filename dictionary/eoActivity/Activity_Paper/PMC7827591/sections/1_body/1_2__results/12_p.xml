<p>The FTIR and PLS analysis from 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> rhizome can be obtained qualitatively, the functional groups of –OH, C=O, C–O, –C–H, C–C, and C–OH belong to these two triterpene compounds. These triterpene compounds are the major groups that might contribute the most to the antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition. 
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00042-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> gives information about the retention times and BW values of these triterpene compounds. Their functional groups from the identified compounds may contribute to the antioxidant activity and the inhibition of α-glucosidase, which are summarized in
