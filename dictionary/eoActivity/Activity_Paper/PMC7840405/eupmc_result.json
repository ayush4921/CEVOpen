    "We present here a new selection criterion for prioritizing research on efficacious drugs for the fight against COVID-19: the relative toxicity versus safety of herbal medications, which were effective against SARS in the 2002/2003 epidemic. We rank these medicines according to their toxicity versus safety as basis for preferential rapid research on their potential in the treatment of COVID-19. The data demonstrate that from toxicological information nothing speaks against immediate investigation on, followed by rapid implementation of Lonicera japonica, Morus alba, Forsythia suspensa, and Codonopsis spec. for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Glycyrrhiza spec. and Panax ginseng are ranked in second priority and ephedrine-free Herba Ephedrae extract in third priority (followed by several drugs in lower preferences). Rapid research on their efficacy in the therapy - as well as safety under the specific circumstances of COVID-19 - followed by equally rapid implementation will provide substantial advantages to Public Health including immediate availability, enlargement of medicinal possibilities, in cases where other means are not successful (non-responders), not tolerated (sensitive individuals) or just not available (as is presently the case) and thus minimize sufferings and save lives. Moreover, their moderate costs and convenient oral application are especially advantageous for underprivileged populations in developing countries."
