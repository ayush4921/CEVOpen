<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that pretreatment with the PBWE alleviated TMT-induced seizures and neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo models, potentially through the antioxidative effect of the PBWE. In addition, we isolated and identified six major compounds from the PBWE for the first time and showed the possible involvement of them in the antioxidative activity. Our findings suggest the potential of the PBWE as a preventive and therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative diseases such as seizures or epilepsy.</p>
