<p>Trimethyltin (TMT), a neurotoxic organotin, induces severe neurodegeneration and neuronal death in the central nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Various mechanisms have been investigated to understand the etiopathology of TMT-induced neurodegeneration; the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proposed as one of the main underlying mechanisms [
