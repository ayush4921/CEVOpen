<p>TMT (2.6 mg/kg; Wako, Osaka, Japan), dissolved in 0.9% saline, was intraperitoneally administered to mice. The vehicle control mice were injected with 0.9% saline. To estimate the effects of the PBWE on TMT-induced neuronal injury, the PBWE (5 or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% saline) were perorally administered to mice daily for one week, before being administered TMT (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 mice per group). Seizure behavior tests were performed in a bright box (40 Ã— 40 cm, 250 lux) at about 8 AM daily for 4 days after TMT treatment. Behavioral changes were evaluated using a scoring system as follows: score 1 (aggression), score 2 (weak tremor), score 3 (systemic tremor), score 4 (tremor and spasmodic gait), and score 5 (death) [
