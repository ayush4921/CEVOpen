<p>Since medicinal insects are often sold in a mixture of various species, it is imperative to accurately identify the species of interest. Therefore, to identify the species of PB larvae, morphological characteristics were observed using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX16; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using a digital camera (Olympus DP21; Olympus) attached to the microscope and cellSens Standard software 2 (Olympus). Measurements and macroscopic observations about the shape, color and size of 20 randomly selected PB larvae were recorded.</p>
