<p>The PBWE (11.0 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 mL of distilled water, loaded onto a Diaion HP-20 column (10 × 35 mm), and washed out with 5 mL of water to remove non-ultraviolet-absorbing components. Thereafter, the remaining residue was washed with 5 mL of MeOH, and the extract was concentrated to finally obtain an analytical sample (1.11 mg). The sample was redissolved in water at a final concentration of 2 mg/mL and filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane filter (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) to obtain a sample solution for UPLC analysis. Analytical UPLC was carried out on Waters Acquity H-class plus system comprising PDA eλ detector, FTN-H sample manager, and a quaternary solvent manager with a Waters CSH

 <sub>18</sub> analytical column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, 100 Å) at 35 °C. The mobile phase was 0.05% formic acid in distilled water (A) and liquid chromatography-grade acetonitrile (B) (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) with the following elution gradient: 2% B (0–3 min), 2–20% B (3–5 min), 20–50% B (5–15 min), 50–100% B (15–15.5), and 100% B (15.5–18 min). The flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 0.3 mL/min, and the sample injection volume was set at 2 μL. The ultra-violet wavelength was monitored from 200 to 400 nm, and the chromatogram for chemical profile was detected at 254 nm.
