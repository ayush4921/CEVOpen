<p>The parameters for the assays except the seizure scoring were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SE) values. The data of seizure scoring were reported as median of score + interquartile. Significant difference tests were performed and comparative analytical graphs were obtained using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The data except the seizure scoring were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for post-hoc analysis. The values of seizure scoring were analyzed by non-parametric test followed by a post hoc Mann-Whitney test.
