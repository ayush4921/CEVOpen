<p>Dissected hippocampi were immediately immersed individually in a lysis buffer and sonicated for 10 s (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 mice per group). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (4×) was added to each homogenized sample, and the samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Briefly, the resolved proteins were separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto membrane by using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-Nrf2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing and incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, signals were developed using a chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal
 <sup>®</sup> West Pico PLUS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and read on a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). To quantify Nrf2 expression, the membrane was re-probed with an antibody for β-actin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). Several exposure times were used to obtain signals within the linear range, and the bands were quantified using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
