<p>To observe TMT-induced neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus, the brain hemisphere samples were embedded in paraffin wax after fixation with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The hemispheres were sectioned approximately 1.44–1.56 mm from the median border. Next, 4 μm thick sagittal sections were prepared and then subjected to FJC staining according to a previously described method (

 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In brief, sections were first transferred to a solution of 0.06% potassium permanganate, and then to a 0.0001% FJC staining solution (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). FJC is a highly anionic and acidic marker with an affinity for degenerating neurons. After FJC staining, sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·dihydrochloride (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to label nuclei, before being mounted onto microscope slides. FJC-stained sections were examined using immunofluorescence microscopy on a BX-40 apparatus (Olympus) with a mounted eXcope X3 digital camera (DIXI Optics, Daejeon, Korea).
