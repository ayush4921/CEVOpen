<p>The PBWE (50.0 g) was separated using a Diaion HP-20 gel (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) in two 340 g scale Biotage empty cartridges (water/MeOH, 100:0 to 0:100) to afford nine fractions (F01−F09) using a Selekt flash chromatography system (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Among the fractions obtained, F05 (1.55 g) was further fractionated employing a flash chromatography system using a 400 g Biotage Sfär C
 <sub>18</sub> D cartridge (water/MeOH, 60:40 to 0:100) to obtain compound 5 (122.0 mg) along with 14 subfractions (F0501−F0514). F0506 (56.1 mg) and F0512 (23.3 mg) were purified using a Waters preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisting of a 2545Q gradient module and a 2998 Photodiode array (PDA) detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with a YMC-Pack ODS-A semi-preparative column (21.2 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 120 Å, water/CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, 98:2 to 90:10, 6 mL/min, YMC, Kyoto, Japan) to yield compounds 2 (3.4 mg) and 3 (2.9 mg) from F0506 and compounds 1 (2.2 mg) and 4 (3.1 mg) from F0512. Compound 6 (7.4 mg) was also obtained after preparative HPLC using a YMC-Pack ODS-A semi-preparative column (water/CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, 75:25 to 60:40, 6 mL/min) from F08 (40.1 mg). NMR spectra of isolated compounds were acquired using the AVANCE III 600 MHz Cryo-NMR equipment (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany).
