<p>The ethyl acetate fraction (19.6 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography (200-300 mesh) and was eluted in a gradient manner with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH (from 50 : 1 to 3 : 1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) to yield three subfractions (Fr.1-Fr.3). Fr.2 was separated by Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to obtain two subfractions (Fr.2-1-Fr.2-2). Fr.2-1 was isolated by preparative TLC (EtOA
 <sub>C</sub>-MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 5 : 1 : 0.9) to obtain compound 
 <bold>14</bold> (2.1 mg). Fr.2-2 was further purified by semipreparative HPLC (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 35 : 65) to obtain 
 <bold>15</bold> (2.0 mg). Fr.3 was partly separated by Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to obtain some subfractions, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> (420.0 mg) and 
 <bold>5</bold> (10.2 mg). One of the subfractions was subjected to preparative TLC (EtOA
 <sub>C</sub>-MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 5 : 1 : 0.9) to obtain compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> (2.1 mg) and 
 <bold>12</bold> (2.2 mg). Another part of Fr.3 was chromatographed on a reversed-phase ODS by gradient elution with MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (10 ⟶ 70%, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) to obtain five subfractions (Fr.3.1-Fr.3.5). Fr.3.3 was separated repeatedly with Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to obtain two subfractions (Fr.3.3.1-Fr.3.3.2). Fr.3.3.1 was further purified through preparative TLC (EtOAc-MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 5 : 1 : 0.9) to obtain compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (8.3 mg). Fr.3.3.2 was chromatographed over semipreparative HPLC (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 35 : 65) to obtain compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (2.3 mg). Fr.3.4 was separated by semipreparative HPLC (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 40 : 60) to obtain compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (4.4 mg).
