<p>The GC-MS analysis of constitutes in the bioactive fraction (Petroleum ether fraction) of mango seed kernel was carried out on a Shimadzu (TQ-8040) series GC-MS system (n) equipped with an AOC-20i autosampler [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The operational process of GC-MS analysis was as follows: rising from 40°C to 130°C at a rate of 4°C/min and holding for 2 min, rising from 130°C to 150°C at a rate of 2°C/min and holding for 3 min, rising from 150°C to 180°C at a rate of 2°C/min and holding for 3 min, and finally enhanced to 210°C and held isothermally for 5 min. Chemical constituents were then pointed out based on the mass spectra and retention times with already known compounds in the NIST14 and NIST14s (National Institute of Standards and Technologies, Mass Spectra Libraries, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) [
