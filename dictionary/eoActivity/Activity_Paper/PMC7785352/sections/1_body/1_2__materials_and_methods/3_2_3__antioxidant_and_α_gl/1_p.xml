<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L. (1 kg) were removed from the shell, which homogenized with a homogenizer. Dried powders (600 g) of mango seed kernel were exhaustively extracted with 60% ethanol for 1 h (20 L × 2 times) at room temperature and were concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated solution was successively partitioned with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and
