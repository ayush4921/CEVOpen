<p>In order to understand how isolated compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> conjugate with 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, molecular docking was implemented. Because of the existence of the galloyl moiety, compound 
 <bold>2</bold> reached deeper the active pocket than acarbose (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the interaction of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> with 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, 
 <bold>2</bold> was encompassed by the residues VAL-232, PHE-303, PHE-178, VAL-216, GLN279, LYS-156, LEU-313, ASP-307, PHE-321, VAL-308, and ALA-329. In addition, some active hydroxyl groups were involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, such as the galloyl at the 3-OH of sugar moiety at the C-1 and C-6 with side chains of PRO-312 and SER-304, respectively, the galloyl at the 3-O on sugar moiety at the C-3 position and the galloyl at the 4-O on sugar moiety at the C-6 position with side chains of SER-240 and GLY-309, and the carbonyl group on the galloyl on sugar moiety at the C-2 and oxygen atom on the sugar moiety with HIS-280 and THR-310, respectively. Meanwhile, 
 <italic>π</italic>-
 <italic>π</italic> T-shaped, 
 <italic>π</italic>-alkyl, and electrostatic interactions facilitated the tight bonding between the enzyme and compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. By contrast, acarbose could only form seven hydrogen bonds.
