<p>To investigate the allosteric site of the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase bond with noncompetitive inhibitors (
 <bold>1</bold>), we implemented blind docking by establishing a grid involved in all enzymes. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was surrounded by a number of catalytic amino acid residues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), including PRO-467, PHE-469, GLU-408, MET-70, and ASP-68. Eight hydrogen bonds were present between the galloyl at the 1, 2, 3-OH and 1-O on sugar moiety at the C-1 position, the galloyl at the 1-OH on sugar moiety at the C-2 position, the galloyl at the 1-O on sugar moiety at the C-3 position, the galloyl at the 3, 4-OH on sugar moiety at the C-4 position and the galloyl at the 3, 4-OH, and 5-O on sugar moiety at the C-6 position of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> with GLN-67, PRO-66, ARG-413, LYS-406, LYS-466, THR-83, TRP-81, and SER-65, respectively. The aromatic rings of the galloyl on sugar moiety at the C-4 and C-2 positions of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> formed 
 <italic>π</italic>-
 <italic>π</italic> T-shaped and 
 <italic>π</italic>-
 <italic>π</italic> stacked interactions with TRP-36 and TYR-470, respectively.
