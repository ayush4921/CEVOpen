<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> both had strong inhibitory activities on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glycosidase, especially 
 <bold>2</bold>. Therefore, it was necessary to investigate the inhibition types and calculate the inhibition kinetics constants (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub>). Results of enzyme kinetics study were performed by using Dixon plots and Lineweaver-Burk plots. The results were displayed in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> values of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase in the existence of 
 <bold>1</bold> did not change but 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> values of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase with the compounds progressively reduced, pointing that 
 <bold>1</bold> was in a noncompetitive inhibitor manner with the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 732.95 ± 0.22 nM. In addition, 
 <bold>2</bold> restrained 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase in competitive manner as the 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> maintained constant and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> improved. Meanwhile, 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of this compound was calculated as 98.37 ± 0.31 nM. Competitive inhibitors were known to compete with substrates for the active sites of enzymes, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors primarily bind to allosteric sites of enzyme-substrate complexes [
