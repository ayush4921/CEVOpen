<p>Consequently, a bioassay-guided fractionation method was used by us to research the bioactive components in mango seed kernel. Its crude extract was successively partitioned with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, respectively. The ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions showed significant DPPH radical scavenging activity. Petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate fractions revealed moderate 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity. These finding prompted us to perform a detailed chemical evaluation, leading to the identification of 23 components from the petroleum ether fraction by LC-MS and the isolation and purification of 17 compounds from other active fractions of mango seed kernel. Antioxidant and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the identified components from the petroleum ether fraction had been reported in many references. Bioactivities of 13 isolated compounds from other active fractions were tested, and compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were found to be active. The enzyme kinetic parameters of active compounds were also determined. The results of the molecular docking were used to visualize how they bind to 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, providing insights into 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition mechanism of the active compounds.
