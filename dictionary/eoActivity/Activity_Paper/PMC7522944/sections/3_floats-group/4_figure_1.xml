  <p>Immunohistochemical staining of liver caspase-9. (a) control (non-diabetic non-treated) shows low expression of caspase-9, (b) diabetic non-treated shows higher expression of caspase-9 than control, (c) daily oral gavage shows lower expression of caspase-9 similar to control, (d) DTMC200 shows lower expression of caspase-9 similar to control, (e) DTMC400 shows lower expression of caspase-9 similar to control. The slides were counterstained with high definition hematoxylin and viewed 400Ã— objectives.</p>
