<p>There was a marked decrease in the content of hepatic non-enzymic antioxidants (PSH, NPSH, and GSH) and activities of enzymic antioxidant defense system (GPx, GST, and SOD) in alloxan-induced diabetic untreated rats. This is an indication of oxidative stress induced by alloxan. However, MLEMC administration significantly increased the levels and activities of these antioxidant systems (both enzymic and non-enzymic), indicating the antioxidant activities of this plant. Plants rich in triterpenes, flavonoids, or polyphenol are known to possess antihepatotoxic activities in the experimental liver-injury models [

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The plant, 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> is said to have many medicinal properties such as hepatoprotective, antidiabetes, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, anthelmintic, and antifertility activities [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, the ability of the plant extract to increase the antioxidant enzymes confirms this. Furthermore, the plant extract significantly reduced the blood glucose level on day 28, indicating its antidiabetic and hypoglycemic properties. The hepatoprotective property of this plant is also demonstrated in this study due to its ability to significantly reduce the activities of liver enzymes to near normal. The plant is able to demonstrate all these activities due to its rich bioactive phytochemicals such as polysaccharides, saponins, and phenolics [
