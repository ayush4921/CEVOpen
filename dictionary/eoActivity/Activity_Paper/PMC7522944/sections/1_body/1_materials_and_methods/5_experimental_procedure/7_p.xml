<p>The experiment lasted for 28 days. Evaluation of blood glucose status was performed on days 14 and 28. The assessment of liver damage in alloxan-induced diabetic rats and ameliorative activity of the extract were performed by measuring the activities of serum liver enzymes: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and oxidative stress markers. Lipid peroxidation assay, antioxidant status, histological examination of liver sections, and immunohistochemical staining of the liver were also carried out.</p>
