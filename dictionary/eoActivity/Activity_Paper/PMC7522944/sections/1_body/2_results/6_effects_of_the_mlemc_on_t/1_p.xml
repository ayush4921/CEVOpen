<p>The result of histological changes induced in the liver by alloxan administration and treatment with MLEMC and glibenclamide is presented in Figures-
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">e</xref>. Histological examination of tissue sections of the liver revealed that the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3a</xref>) showed normal histoarchitecture of the liver parenchyma with characteristic appearance of hepatic lobule. The hepatocytes are seen radiating from the central vein separated by sinusoids and portal tract/triad (hepatic portal vein, hepatic vein, and bile duct). The diabetic non-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3b</xref>) showed severe distortion of the histoarchitecture of the liver with congested central vein; necrosis; sinusoidal dilatation; and vacuolation. The liver section of the glibenclamide treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3c</xref>) showed mild distortion of the histoarchitecture of the liver, area of congestion, and infiltration by inflammatory cells and necrosis. The liver section of the MLEMC treated groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3d</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">e</xref>) revealed mild distortion of the hepatic architecture showing that the extract reduced the histopathological abnormalities that were seen in the liver of diabetic rats. Liver sections from rats treated with MLEMC showed recovery of the hepatocytes from necrosis and other pathological changes indicating that the extract preserved the structural integrity of the hepatocellular membrane and liver cell architecture.
