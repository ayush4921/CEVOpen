<p>In this study, administration of alloxan induced oxidative stress by significantly (α
 <sub>0.05</sub>) increasing hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and MDA levels in the liver post-mitochondrial fractions of the diabetic non-treated rats compared with the normal control. Concurrent administration of MLEMC (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) and glibenclamide (4 mg/kg) significantly (α
 <sub>0.05</sub>) reduced the level of these oxidative stress markers (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and MDA) when compared with the diabetic non-treated rats. Administration of both doses of the extract reduced the hepatic hydrogen peroxide and MDA levels to near normal levels (
