<p>The effects of MLEMC on liver functions and blood glucose levels are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table-1</xref>. The serum levels of hepato-specific enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP) were significantly elevated in the diabetic rats due to hepatocellular injury. The rats treated with MLEMC and glibenclamide showed significant reduction in the elevated activities of liver enzymes. In the case of blood glucose level, results showed that at day 28, all the groups treated with glibenclamide and MLEMC experienced significant decrease in their values.
