<p id="par0195">Similarly, rats administered nitrobenzene only exhibited marked neuro-behavioural deficits as revealed by decrease in the exploratory activities and increased in frequency of faecal pellets. Exploratory activities and frequency of faecal pellets are parameters used to determined anxiogenic-like phenotype and behavioural imbalance in rats [
