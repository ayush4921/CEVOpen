 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The depletion and consequent energy dysfunction of the mitochondria cascades affects the dopaminergic neurons, which requires greater energy for efficient function. In this study, nitrobenzene greatly reduced dopamine activity in the striatum, cerebellum and the mid brain. The severity of the clinical manifestations of parkinsonism (motor disturbance) and dementia is associated largely with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons resulting in reduction of brain dopamine content [

 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly increase the level of dopamine activity especially in the striatum. Certain plant nutrients serve as main precursors in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine [
