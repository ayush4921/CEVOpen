<p id="par0190">In this study, experimental animals exposed to nitrobenzene alone demonstrated notable locomotor alterations as shown by decrease in speed, total mobility time and total distance covered. Furthermore, there is significant decline in the forelimb grip, body rotation and turn angle which are essential psychomotor coordination tools to assess neurodegenerative disorders [

 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The observed decrease in these locomotor markers implies dysfunction in the cellular signalling between nervous system and muscular junctions. Treatment with methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly increase all these markers indicating their abilities to reverse chemically mediated psychomotor dysfunctions in rats. Grooming in rats is a standard neurobehavioural index to evaluate alterations in behavioural patterns and psychomotor activities in rats [

 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> in reversing nitrobenzene-induced decrease in grooming time further potentiate beneficial effects of the extract against psychomotor deficiency in rats.
