<p id="par0220">One of the beneficial effects of phytochemicals is their ability to contribute immensely to the general antioxidant defence system in various organs in the body including the brain, thereby influencing brain function, cognitive ability, and preventing oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, exposure of rats to Nitrobenzene cause oxidative stress with significant decrease in GSH, CAT, and SOD. The reduction in the activities of these antioxidant enzymes is well-known to provide evidence about oxidative damage as a result of accumulation of ROS including H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> which eventually leads to lipid peroxidation [

 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly increase the activity levels of these enzymes. This result agrees with previous report that endogenous antioxidants enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) play significant role in inhibiting neurodegeneration in the brain [
