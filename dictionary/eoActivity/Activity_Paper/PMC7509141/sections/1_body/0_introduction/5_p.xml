<p id="par0050">In this study, nitrobenzene was used to induced neurodegeneration in rats. It is a toxic industrial and environmental chemical which was first synthesized by treating benzene with fuming nitric acid in 1834 and was produced for commercial purpose in England in 1856. Since then, it has been produced in very large quantity across the globe due to its relevance in industrial and manufacturing activities [
