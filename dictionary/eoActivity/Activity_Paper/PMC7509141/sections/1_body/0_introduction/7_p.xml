<p id="par0060">This study aimed at investigating the protective effects of methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> on nitrobenzene-induced neurotoxicity by assessing some locomotor activities and exploratory profiles in experimental rats using standard behavioural protocols and a video-tracking software. Moreover, in order to further understand the neuroprotective mechanisms of the extract in nitrobenzene-induced neurodegeneration in rats, assessment of oxidative stress and inflammatory indices in addition to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes activities were carried out in the midbrain, cerebrum and cerebellum of the treated rats.
