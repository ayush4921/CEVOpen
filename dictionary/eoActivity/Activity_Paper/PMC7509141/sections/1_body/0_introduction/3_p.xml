<p id="par0040">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is referred to as the major root of dementia [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which is characterized by an impairment of cognitive function especially the memory and the incapability to carryout daily activities [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) in the brain neurons which interrupt nerve activities impulses is one of the established theories for AD aetiology. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3B) and phosphatases are kinase enzymes which enhance tau regulation by phosphorylation to perform its physiological function [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several lysosomal disorders such as lysosomal storage disorder has been documented to result into failure of tau degradation which in turn leads to hyper-phosphorylation and ultimately cause formation of extracellular NFTs interrupting neural network thus, result into a pathological condition known as AD [
