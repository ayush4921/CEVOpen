<p id="par0230">Data from this study further potentiate the beneficial effects of methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> in neurodegenerative disorders. The results obtained demonstrated with convincing evidence that behavioural deficit associated with administration of nitrobenzene in rats were markedly attenuated by methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic>. In addition, the extract mitigated the molecular processes and pathological features associated with neurodegenerative disorders in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and midbrain 
 <italic>via</italic> mechanisms related to its antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase suppression, lipid peroxidation inhibition, anti-inflammatory and neurobehavioural restoring properties. Thus, our data suggest the clinical significance of methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> in the prevention and management of neurodegenerative disorders with behavioural impairment.
