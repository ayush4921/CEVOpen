   <italic>K</italic> = 2). Each individual sample is represented by a thin vertical line divided into 
   <italic>K</italic> coloured segments that represent the individual’s estimated membership fractions in 
   <italic>K</italic> clusters. Populations and main geographical areas are indicated below following Table 
   <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Asterisks indicate individuals with a probably of membership lower than 90% to the main genetic cluster, as revealed by STRUCTURE.
