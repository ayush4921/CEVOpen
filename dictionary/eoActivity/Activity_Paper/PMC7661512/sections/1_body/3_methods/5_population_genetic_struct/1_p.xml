 </sup> was used to infer the population structure and to assign individual plants to subpopulations. Models with a putative numbers of populations (K) from 1–5, imposing ancestral admixture and correlated allele frequencies priors, were considered. Ten independent runs with 50 000 burn-in steps, followed by run lengths of 1 000 000 interactions for each K, were computed. The number of clusters in the data was estimated using STRUCTURE HARVESTER
 <sup>

 </sup>, which identifies the optimal K based both on the posterior probability of the data for a given K and the ΔK
 <sup>

 </sup>. To correctly assess the membership proportions (q values) for clusters identified in STRUCTURE, the results of the replicates at the best fit K were post-processed using CLUMPP 1.1.2
