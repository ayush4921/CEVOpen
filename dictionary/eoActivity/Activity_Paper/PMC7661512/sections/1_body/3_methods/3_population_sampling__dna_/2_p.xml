<p id="Par23">For the development of the markers, we first estimated the nuclear DNA content of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> by flow cytometry using fresh young leaves that were chopped using a razor blade together with an internal standard in a Petri dish containing 1 mL of Woody Plant Buffer

 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> ‘Stupické’ (2C = 1.96 pg)

 </sup> was used as internal standard. The nuclear suspension was then filtered through a 30 μm nylon filter, and 50 μg/mL of propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and 50 μg/mL of RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to stain the DNA only. The fluorescence intensity of nuclei was analysed using a CyFlow Space flow cytometer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Four independent replicates collected from Kazimat (TR) were measured. Conversion of mass values into numbers of base pairs was done according to the factor 1 pg = 978 Mbp

 </sup>. The mean 2C-value of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> was found to be 2.91 pg (± 0.068), corresponding to an average genome size of 2845 Mbp (Fig. S2). Samples had an average coefficient of variation of 4.18%.
