<p id="Par22">Based on the areas of occurrence (Senkoro et al., unpublished data), 48 individuals were sampled: 19 individuals from LM, 15 from TR and 14 from LM (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Fresh, young undamaged leaves were collected for each individual plant and frozen at − 80 °C until DNA isolation. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 50 mg of ground leaves using the InnuSPEED Plant DNA Kit (Analytik Jena Innuscreen GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The average yield and purity were assessed spectrophotometrically by OD230, OD260 and OD280 readings (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and visualized by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels under UV light. Normalized DNA from five individuals of each population was used to develop the SSR markers at CD Genomics (cd-genomics.com/hi-ssrseq.html).
