<p id="Par11">The first two coordinates of the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) explained 22.9% of the total variation, and populations were spatially separated into the two main groups found by STRUCTURE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The neighbour-joining tree revealed several small clusters although mostly with a very low support (&lt; 30% BS) and overall, with no association between the clusters found and the three geographic areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) as reported in the other analyses. However, a clear cluster grouped all the FC geographical area.
