<p id="Par19">Considering the confined distribution and threatened status, the long-term persistence of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> should be secured by conserving the maximum genetic diversity of the species. As it is impossible to designate every natural wild plant habitat as a protected area, nurseries could be implemented to ensure production stability. The disclosure of genetic variation and understanding of genetic relatedness within populations is useful for their sustainable uses

 </sup>. Knowledge of genetic diversity from other countries as the one reported here would also help to implement conservation strategies including re-introduction programs, selecting the most suitable material to be used. Understanding the degree of genetic variation between Mozambique and the neighbouring countries would facilitate transborder conservation actions. Further studies must also be conducted to detect and understand how reductions of natural regeneration or fitness are affected by harvesting. Finally, efforts to educate the local population and landowners on the importance of conserving the natural populations of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> should continue.
