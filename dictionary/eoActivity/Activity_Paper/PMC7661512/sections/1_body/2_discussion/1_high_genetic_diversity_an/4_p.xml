<p id="Par16">Our study suggests that, although some local populations might have been severely affected by harvesting, the pepper-bark tree might have persisted in sufficient numbers in Mozambique to allow outcrossing between sites, retaining a large proportion of genetic diversity. Although there are no records of the historical distribution of this species, the studied populations could be relicts of once much larger populations that persisted in specific locations. In addition, recent conservation efforts might have diminished trade in Mozambique, avoiding severe barking in these populations. Further research should focus on understanding the factors limiting the regeneration of
