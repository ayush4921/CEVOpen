 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> by employing next generation sequencing (Illumina platform). The 10 SSRs markers were validated and found to be highly polymorphic, with values similar to the ones found in other threatened species such as 
 <italic>Acer miaotaiense</italic> (
 <italic>PIC</italic> = 0.604)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>

 <italic>Corylus avellana</italic> (
 <italic>PIC</italic> = 0.778)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup>. These markers are now available to extend 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> population studies to a worldwide level. Additionally, the SSRs developed during this work might potentially be suitable to study genetic diversity in other species within the genus 
 <italic>Warburgia</italic>, since only a limited number of studies is available and based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>, a time-consuming and costly technique. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first genome size estimation of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> and only the second within the Canellaceae family having a genome size 4 × smaller than 
 <italic>Canella winterana</italic> (2C = 11.7 pg
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>). The relatively small genome size of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> (see methods) is within the range of the non-expanded genomes of currently known magnoliids (Fig. S2) and may facilitate future genomic initiatives although further analyses are needed to determine its ploidy level.
