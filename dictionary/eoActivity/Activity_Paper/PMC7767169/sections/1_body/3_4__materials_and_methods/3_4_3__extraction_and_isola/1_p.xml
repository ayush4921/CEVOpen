<p>The pulverized bark of 
 <italic>G. longistipetes</italic> was extracted in the sequential order—hexane and chloroform and methanol using the Soxhlet apparatus. The respective crude extracts were concentrated and dried by means of a rotatory evaporator and blow down under nitrogen gas and then fractionated by Vacuum Liquid Chromatography (silica gel with 100–200 mesh as stationary phase) into 13 fractions using a mixture of two solvents in increasing order of polarity. Preparative-TLC (prep-TLC) was done on the fractions based on the activities in the biological assay using a full normal-phase silica sheet gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> (Merck KGaA).The TLC plate was then air dried in a flow hood and viewed under short UV (254 nm) and long UV (356 nm) light (Camag) as well as sprayed with appropriate stains to locate the compounds. The respective bands were then scratched off the plate and the compounds were obtained by desorption using a solvent appropriate for the pure compounds.
