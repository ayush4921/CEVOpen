<p>The ER1793 strain was used as the recipient (streptomycin-resistant) whilst the pKM101-containing strain was the donor (amoxicillin-resistant). The plate conjugation assay used MacConkey agar supplemented with amoxicillin to facilitate identification of donor cells, and agar containing amoxicillin and streptomycin to distinguish transconjuants. The number of transconjugants to donor cells were used to determine the conjugation frequencies. Conjugation efficacy was calculated based on the conjugation frequencies expressed as a percentage relative to the control.</p>
