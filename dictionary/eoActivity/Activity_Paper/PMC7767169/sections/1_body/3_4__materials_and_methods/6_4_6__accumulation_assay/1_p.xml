<p>The accumulation assay was conducted using the whole cell phenotypic assay with 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> mc
 <sup>2</sup> 122 cells as the model. The method used followed that employed by [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Verapamil (final working concentration of 12.5 µg/mL) and chlorpromazine (final working concentration of 15.6 µg/mL) were the positive efflux pump inhibitory controls together with a drug-free control in the assay. All the test samples and blanks were prepared in triplicate. The continuous live monitoring of the florescence was done, a cycle of measurement every 60 s for a total period of 60 min, using a plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech, Manchester, UK) with the settings as follows; 540 and 590 nm for excitation and detection of fluorescence (emission).
