<p>All statistical analyses were computed using Microsoft Excel 2010 or GraphPad prism. The coefficient of variation (cv) was calculated as a ratio of the standard deviation to the mean with the data obtained from the 3 replicates (no outlier if cv &lt; 1) whilst the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value was carried out by comparing the means of each experiment using independent t-test (significant difference if 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05).
