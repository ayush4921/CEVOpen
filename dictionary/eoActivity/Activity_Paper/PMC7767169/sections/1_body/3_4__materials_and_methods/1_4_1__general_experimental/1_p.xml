<p>One- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker) using tetramethylsilane as internal references with referencing to solvent signals (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>). UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Electron Corporation Helios spectrophotometer and on a Nicolet 360 FT-IR spectrophotometer respectively. Mass spectra were recorded using HRESIMS for accurate mass determination (m/z value up to four decimal places) and were performed using a Waters Quadrupole/Time of flight (Q-ToF) premier Tandem Mass Spectrometer and a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 which is a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with a mass range of 50 Da to 2000 Da. Chemical and biological reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset, UK unless otherwise stated.
