<p>The pKM101 plasmid belongs to the IncN plasmid family, and is a 35.4kb derivative from the parent R46 [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It renders 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> resistant to the effects of UV radiation and mutagenesis [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The DNA region of R46, when removed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, removed the gene coding for resistance to sulphonamides, streptomycin, and spectinomycin but conferred the ability of pKM 101 to increase resistance to UV as well as the presence of ampicillin resistance and the fertility factor of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
