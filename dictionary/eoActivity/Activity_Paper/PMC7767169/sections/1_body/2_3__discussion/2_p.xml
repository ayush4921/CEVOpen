<p>The results of the inhibitory activities in the accumulation assay for compounds

 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00913-f003">Figure 3</xref>) indicated that they were able to inhibit efflux pumps. In addition, all three compounds could also inhibit the formation of biofilms using 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as a model and there is a correlation with efflux pump inhibition. There is evidence from several studies that have shown that efflux pumps also play a significant role in biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Kvist et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> that the inactivation of efflux pumps resulted in the failure to form a bacterial biofilm. The downregulation in particular of, the 
 <italic>AdeFGH</italic> efflux pump, is probably responsible for a decrease in the formation of biofilm in 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> treated with tigecycline below inhibitory concentrations [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Aristolactam alkaloids from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus velutinus</italic> have been shown to possess selective inhibitory activities on biofilm formation of some selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species [
