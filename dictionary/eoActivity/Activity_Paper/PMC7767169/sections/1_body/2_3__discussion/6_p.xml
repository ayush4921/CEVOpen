<p>The result from the plate conjugation assay for compound 
 <bold>4</bold> showed a reduction in the plasmid conjugation by about 70%. This demonstrated that the compound which is amphiphilic might be able to inhibit the conjugation process (e.g.,Type-IV secretory systems (T4SS)) or the horizontal transfer of the plasmid [

 <bold>4</bold> was not investigated. However, compounds very similar to compound 4 (5-alkyl resorcinols) isolated from the Australian plant,

Type-IV secretion systems (T4SS) are important secretion systems or ‘molecular syringes’ that are found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and secrete a wide range of substrates, from single proteins to protein–protein and protein–DNA complexes into other cells in order to manipulate and often kill rival bacterial and eukaryotic cells.

 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The horizontal gene transfer conferred by T4SS is also one of the main mechanisms for the spread of genes responsible for resistance to antibiotics as well as virulence factors in a variety of human diseases such as whooping cough (
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>) and peptic and gastric cancers [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Plasmids carry resistance genes which are separated from and can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosomal DNA and can, therefore, render resistance to one or more antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Plasmids are commonly able to transfer between bacterial cells from different species by a mechanism known as conjugation, which involves cell-to-cell contact followed by transfer of a copy of plasmid DNA from a donor to a recipient [
