<p>Stereoisomers 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> showed differing activities against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and acid-fast mycobacterial strains. However, both stereoisomers did not show much difference in their activities against the two effluxing strains (XU212 and SA1199B) for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> when compared with the susceptible strain (SA25923), indicating that they might not be able to inhibit the efflux pumps in both strains. The overexpression of efflux pumps in XU212 is coded by the 
 <italic>tet</italic>(K) gene [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and causes resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline while in SA1199B, it is coded by the 
 <italic>norA</italic> gene which causes overexpression of the NorA efflux pump and therefore resistance to the antibiotic norfloxacin and both efflux pumps belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) family [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in the whole cell phenotypic accumulation assay using 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, there were good activities shown by both styryllactone isomers. This could mean that the compounds inhibit efflux pumps other than those in the MFS family, because 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> is known to possess all 5 families of efflux pumps.
