<p>There are few studies done on the antibacterial properties for chemical constituents isolated from species of 
 <italic>Goniothalamus</italic>. Styryllactone, altholactone, and previously isolated from 
 <italic>G. malayanus</italic> showed moderate broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria except 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which is consistent with the results from our study. Another stereoisomer of compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, isoaltholacthone, isolated from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus grandifolius</italic> (not isolated from this study) also displayed broad-spectrum activities [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the pyrimidine alkaloid (
 <bold>3</bold>) isolated in this study and for the first time from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus,</italic> specific activities against strains of Gram-positive bacteria were only observed. Previously, only aristolactam alkaloids have been isolated from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus velutinus</italic>, which did not show any antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies on the mechanisms of action of antibacterial compounds from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus</italic> have been neglected.
