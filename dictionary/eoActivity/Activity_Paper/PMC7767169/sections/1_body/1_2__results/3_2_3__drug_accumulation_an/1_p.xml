<p>Efflux pumps and biofilm formation are two important mechanisms by which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. The results of the accumulation assay and the biofilm formation assay for compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00913-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> displayed inhibitory activities in the whole cell phenotypic accumulation assay using 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>smegmatis</italic> as a model when compared to the controls demonstrating that the compounds can inhibit the efflux pumps. For the biofilm inhibition assay, the three compounds also exhibited inhibitory activities (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01) at both the concentrations for MIC and their respective sub-inhibitory concentrations (half that of MICs) when compared with their respective controls. For the accumulation assay, EtBr was used as a known substrate for whole cell efflux pumps and the two known efflux pump inhibitors, verapamil and chlorpromazine, were used as controls whilst for the biofilm inhibition assay, a negative control was employed. DMSO was also used to see if there was any effect on biofilm inhibition, because DMSO was used as the solvent to dissolve the compounds tested.
