<p>A full structure elucidation of these compounds is presented in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-09-00913">Supplementary Materials (Figures S1–S33; Tables S1–S4)</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was identified by comparison of its 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C and mass spectral data with that of the literature [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The structures of 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold> were determined by full 2D NMR analysis, particularly using HMBC spectroscopy. In addition to these techniques, for compound 
 <bold>4</bold>, the position of the double bond was identified by derivatization and comparison of fragments with a mass spectral library, confidently allowing placement of the double bond between C-8 and C-9.
