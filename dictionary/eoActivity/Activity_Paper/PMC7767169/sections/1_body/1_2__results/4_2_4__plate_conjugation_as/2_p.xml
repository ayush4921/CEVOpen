<p>In order to discern between antibacterial activity and the inhibition of plasmid conjugation, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was assessed at a quarter of its MIC value (256 Âµg/mL) for this assay. A negative control was employed. Plasmid pKM101 (donor strain) confers resistance to amoxicillin whilst the recipient strain ER1793 is resistant to streptomycin. Subculturing onto media containing amoxicillin and streptomycin allows determination of transconjugation. So, each strain was subcultured in its selective media based on resistance characteristics. The experiment was repeated three times. The results of the conjugation assay are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00913-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Based on the result of the transconjugant bacterial colony count as well as the donor colony count in the control, there was an approximately 70% reduction in plasmid conjugation when compared to the control (

 <bold>4</bold> might be able to inhibit plasmid conjugation.
