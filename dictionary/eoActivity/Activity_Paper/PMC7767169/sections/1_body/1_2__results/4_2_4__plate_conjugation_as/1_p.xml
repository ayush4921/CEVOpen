<p>Apart from efflux pumps and biofilm formation, another mechanism that contributes to drug resistance in bacteria is plasmid conjugation. Bacteria can disseminate plasmids harbouring genes responsible for drug resistance to other bacteria through plasmid conjugation [

 <bold>4</bold> is amphiphilic, a plate conjugation assay [
