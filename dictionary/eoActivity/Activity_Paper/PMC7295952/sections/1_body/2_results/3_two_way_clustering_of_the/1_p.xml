<p>We used the screening results obtained with 2 µg/ml for two-way clustering, i.e. clustering the plants according to their bioactivity, and clustering the parasites according to their susceptibility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2</bold>
 </xref>). Per plant only one fraction from the partitioning was included, i.e. the one which had displayed the highest activity against any of the four parasites. This approach clearly confirmed the notion that 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, despite their large phylogenetic distance, have a similar susceptibility profile. It also highlighted 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> as the least susceptible of the four tested parasites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2</bold>
 </xref>). There was no clear separation between the medicinal plants with reported anti-infective use (printed in red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2</bold>
 </xref>) and the rest. Regarding antiplasmodial activity, the plants that had a reported use against malaria (n=17; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref>) were slightly more active against 
 <italic>P. falciparum in vitro</italic>, both at 2 µg/ml (mean inhibition of 43% vs. 39%) and at 10 µg/ml (mean inhibition of 89% vs. 75%). However, these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.70, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test).
