<p>The ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>Ziziphus spina-christi</italic> (L.) Desf. (Rhamnaceae) leaves had shown &gt;80% growth inhibition at 10 µg/ml, and &gt;50% inhibition at 2 µg/ml across all parasites (

 <italic>L. donovani</italic> on the one side, and against 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on the other side, were different. The antitrypanosomal and antiplasmodial activity was associated with more polar, earlier eluting compounds, while the antileishmanial activity was located in the more lipophilic and later eluting compounds (
