<p>Extracts with antiparasitic activity were also tested for cytotoxicity. This was done against rat L6 skeletal myoblast cells, the same cell line that had been used as host cells for testing against amastigote 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Concentration-response curves allowed the calculation of both 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub>;

The cytotoxicity data of the tested fractions cannot directly be compared to their antiparasitic activity because the antiparasitic and cytotoxic activity of a given fraction can be due to different molecules. Nevertheless, the aim was to identify non-toxic fractions for the following HPLC-based activity profiling and identification of active compounds.
