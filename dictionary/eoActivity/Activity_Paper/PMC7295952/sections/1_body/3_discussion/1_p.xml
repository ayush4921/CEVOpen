<p>A total of 62 Sudanese plants were selected on the basis of their traditional use as medicinal plants, with an emphasis on plants that had been used to treat protozoal diseases. Of these plants a library of 235 extracts was prepared and tested against four protozoan parasites: 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (erythrocytic stages), 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> (bloodstream forms), 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (intracellular amastigotes), and 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (axenic amastigotes). The methods used were standard 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests for drug discovery, where the measured signals correlated with the number of parasites. Screening of the library resulted in 125 potential hits that fulfilled the chosen activity criteria, i.e. &gt; 80% growth inhibition at 10 μg/ml or &gt;50% growth inhibition at 2 μg/ml against one or more of the four parasites. A total of 11 extracts were solely active against 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic>, 13 against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and 5 against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>. A total of 27 extracts exhibited activity against three parasites. The percentage of extracts that displayed activity against both 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (21%) was considerably higher than that with activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> (5%), despite the fact that trypanosomes and leishmania are taxonomically related trypanosomatid parasites. This somehow surprising result is in agreement with previous screening campaigns reports (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Llurba Montesino et al., 2015</xref>). The lack of overlap between activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> is not unusual and has been documented previously (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Witschel et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Zulfiqar et al., 2017</xref>). They are different parasites living in different compartments, i.e. cytoplasma for 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> but acidic environment for 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>.
