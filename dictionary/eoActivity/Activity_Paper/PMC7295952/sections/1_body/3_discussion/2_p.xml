<p>Interestingly, a major part of these extracts were from plants of the family Combretaceae (
 <italic>Guiera senegalensis</italic> J.F.Gmel
 <italic>., T. leiocarpa</italic> (DC.) Baill., 
 <italic>Combretum glutinosum</italic> Perr. ex DC
 <italic>., Combretum indicum</italic> (L.) DeFilipps (syn. 
 <italic>Quisqualis indica</italic> L.), and 
 <italic>Terminalia laxiflora</italic> Engl.). Plants of this family are known to be rich in phenolic compounds. The lowest number of hits was found for 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. This may be due, in part, to the fact that 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes (which are the clinically relevant stages for chemotherapy) cannot be grown axenically. Hence, activity can only be identified if the antiparasitic activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is significantly higher than cytotoxicity in L6 cells used for culturing the parasite.
