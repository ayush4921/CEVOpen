<p>Sudanâ€™s biodiversity coupled with a deeply rooted ethno-botanical heritage is an untapped reservoir for the discovery of new bioactive natural products. Here we performed a survey of plants from Sudan that are used in traditional medicine, with a focus on malaria and neglected tropical diseases caused by protozoa. On the basis of this survey a library of plant extracts was assembled and screened against trypanosomatid parasites and
