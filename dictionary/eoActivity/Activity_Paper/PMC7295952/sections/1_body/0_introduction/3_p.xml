<p>Plants are still considered as important sources for the discovery of novel bioactive molecules. Plants secondary metabolism represents a huge and unique reservoir of chemical diversity, which may serve as a source of new drugs, either directly or after optimization by medicinal chemistry. Independent chemoinformatic analyses have consistently shown that natural products often exhibit unique features, a high degree of structural diversity, and drug- or lead-like structural properties (
