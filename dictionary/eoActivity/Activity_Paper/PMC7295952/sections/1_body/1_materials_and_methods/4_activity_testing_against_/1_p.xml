 <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes strain MHOM/ET/67/L82 were grown in axenic culture in SM medium at pH 5.4 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. In the two-concentration assay, 50 µL medium containing the corresponding samples concentration (10 or 2  µg/ml) was added to the wells of a 96 well plate. For the IC
 <sub>50</sub> determination, 50 µl medium was added to each well and a serial sample dilution of eleven 3-fold dilution steps covering a range from 100 to 0.002 μg/ml were prepared. Then 10
