 <italic>In vitro</italic> antimalarial activity was tested against the erythrocytic stages of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54, originally isolated from a patient at Schiphol airport. The parasites were grown in human erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% ALBUMAX
 <sup>®</sup> II, 25 mM Hepes, 25 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (pH 7.3), 0.36 mM hypoxanthine, and 100 U/ml neomycin and kept in an atmosphere of 3% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 4% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 93% N
 <sub>2</sub> in humidified modular chambers at 37°C. In the two-concentration assay, 100 µl medium containing the corresponding samples concentration (final sample concentration of 10 or 2 µg/ml) was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. For the IC
 <sub>50</sub> determination, a 50-µl medium was added to each well and a serial sample dilution of 11 threefold dilution steps covering a final range from 100 to 0.002 μg/ml were prepared. Then 100-µl parasite (erythrocytes at 1.25% final hematocrit and 0.3% final parasitemia) was added. After 48 h of incubation with test compounds, 0.25 μCi of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]hypoxanthine was added per well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters, and radioactivity was counted using a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Artemisinin was used as reference drug. Final in-test DMSO concentration did not exceed 1%. All assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.
