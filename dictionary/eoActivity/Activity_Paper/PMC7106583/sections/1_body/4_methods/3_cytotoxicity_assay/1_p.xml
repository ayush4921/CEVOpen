<p id="Par39">The cytotoxicity of the seven Thai medicinal plant extracts was determined using the MTT assay. Briefly, MARC-145 cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C for 24 h. When cells had at least 90% confluence, the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing two-fold serial dilutions of the plant extracts. In addition, medium without plant extract was used as a positive control. Incubation was then continued in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C for 72 h. After this, the medium was removed, 20 μl of freshly prepared MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, the medium was replaced with 150 μl DMSO to dissolve the crystals, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to dissolve any air bubbles before measuring the MTT signal at an absorbance of 550 nm. Results are reported as CC
 <sub>50</sub>.
