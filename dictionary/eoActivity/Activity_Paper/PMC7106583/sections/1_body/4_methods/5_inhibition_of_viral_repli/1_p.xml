<p id="Par41">The inhibition of viral replication assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Briefly, MARC-145 cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and infected with PRRSV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, PRRSV was removed from each well and replaced with the diluted plant extracts at the concentration that was determined in the cytotoxicity test and at two lower concentrations ins two-fold dilution. Further, 1% DMSO was mixed to medium as the control. The plates were cultured under standard conditions; supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi; and virus titer was quantified.
