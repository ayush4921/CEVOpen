<p id="Par42">Virus titer was further assessed by IPMA as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 100 μl of 4% cold formalin for 15 min at room temperature (RT), washed once with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and twice with 100 μl of 0.5% PBS Tween-20 (PBST), and blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA in 0.5% PBST for 30 min at RT. After blocking, the cells were stained with 70 μl of anti-PRRSV NC protein monoclonal antibody (Median Diagnostics, Gangwon-do, Korea) diluted at a ratio of 1:400 at RT for 60 min, washed, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania, USA) diluted at a ratio of 1:1200 for 60 min at RT. After washing thrice with PBS, the cells were counter stained with 1,5-diaminopentane substrate and examined under a microscope. Virus titer is expressed as TCID
 <sub>50</sub> and was determined using the Reed–Muench method.
