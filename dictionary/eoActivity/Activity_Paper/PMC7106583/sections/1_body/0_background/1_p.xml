<p id="Par23">Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is endemic in most pig-producing countries, and it results in enormous economic losses to the swine industry globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> family (order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>), which also includes the equine arteritis virus, mouse lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In general, PRRSV infection causes a disease that is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory infections in growing pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and this disease predisposes pigs to infection by bacteria and other viral pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This disease is known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and has become endemic in many countries throughout the world following an epidemic phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Its incidence was first reported in Thailand in 1989, and since then, several outbreaks have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has become a major infectious disease that causes high mortality in swine and production losses in the swine industry in this country.
