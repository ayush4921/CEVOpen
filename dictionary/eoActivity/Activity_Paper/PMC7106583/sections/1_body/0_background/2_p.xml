<p id="Par24">Preventative measures such as gilt acclimatization, vigilant biosecurity, and vaccination have been shown to be useful in controlling PRRS outbreaks, and supportive treatments are available for alleviating its severity; however, no specific treatment for PRRS is available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Antiviral therapeutics are a critical tool for combating viral infections, particularly in cases wherein no vaccines are available against the circulating virus. Thus, pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative approach in controlling PRRSV. A number of natural compounds and compositions have been shown to possess antiviral activities against PRRSV. Gao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Cryptoporus volvatus</italic> extract exhibited antiviral activity against PRRSV infection and replication. Pringproa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that crude 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> extract significantly inhibited PRRSV replication as early as 24 h post-infection (hpi). Therefore, the antiviral activities of other Thai medicinal plants against PRRSV should also be investigated. Thai medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Caesalpinia sappan</italic> Linn., 
 <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> Linn., 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic>, 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Clinacanthus nutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tiliacora triandra</italic> are known to have antioxidant and antiviral activities. These plants have already been promoted for use in primary health care and have been classified according to their pharmacological actions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts against PRRSV infection in vitro and to measure their phytochemical contents to develop an alternative anti-PRRSV therapy for use in veterinary medicine.
