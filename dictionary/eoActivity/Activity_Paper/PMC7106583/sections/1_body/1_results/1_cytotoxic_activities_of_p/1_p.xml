<p id="Par25">Prior to determining antiviral activity, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of the seven Thai medicinal plant extracts on the viability of MARC-145 cells, and viability is expressed as 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>). The results showed that the CC
 <sub>50</sub> of the seven plant extracts ranged from 78 to 2500 μg/ml, and the effect of Thai medicinal plant extract concentration on the tested cells increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract had the lowest CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 78 μg/ml. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> extract was the second lowest (312.5 μg/ml) and that of 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract was 625 μg/ml. Further, 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> extracts had CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1250 μg/ml, whereas 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. frutescens</italic> extracts had the highest CC
 <sub>50</sub> (2500 μg/ml).
