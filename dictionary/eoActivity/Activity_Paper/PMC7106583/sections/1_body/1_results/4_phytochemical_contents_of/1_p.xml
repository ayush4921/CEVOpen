<p id="Par28">The total phenolic contents of the seven Thai medicinal plant extracts were determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay by constructing a standard curve of gallic acid. Total phenolic content was the highest in 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract [mean ± standard error: 220.52 ± 4.47 mM gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g sample], followed by 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> extract (91.16 ± 4.62 mM GAE/g sample), with the lowest total phenolic content was observed in
