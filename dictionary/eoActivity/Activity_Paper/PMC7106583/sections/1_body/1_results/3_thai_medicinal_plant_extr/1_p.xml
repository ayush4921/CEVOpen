<p id="Par27">Different Thai medicinal plant extracts were tested in an in vitro inhibitor screening assay to determine inhibition of PRRSV replication at three time intervals (24, 48, and 72 hpi). At various time points after the infection, PRRSV in supernatants was quantified for determining virus titer by IPMA. Results of screening were the same as those of the inhibition test of PRRSV infectivity, i.e., PRRSV replication was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we found that 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract had significant potential to inhibit PRRSV replication in vitro. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>L, few cells that were stained brown showed the efficiency of 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract at a concentration of 625 μg/ml, and the inhibition of PRRSV replication by 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract was significantly stronger than that by other plant extracts at 72 hpi [2.7 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml (log
 <sub>10</sub>)].
