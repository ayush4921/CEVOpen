<p id="Par26">We treated PRRSV with different concentrations of Thai medicinal plant extracts that were determined based on their CC
 <sub>50</sub> values so that these plant extracts did not affect the proliferative activity of MARC-145 cells. The screening results of the inhibition of PRRSV infectivity showed the potential of Thai medicinal plant extracts to inhibit PRRSV infectivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> extract significantly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells at 24 hpi when supplied at a concentration of 1250 μg/ml (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the observed virus titer at this concentration was 3.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml (log
 <sub>10</sub>). Interestingly, 
 <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract at a low concentration of 78 μg/ml could inhibit PRRSV infectivity [virus titer = 4.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml (log
 <sub>10</sub>)]. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) indicated that 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. emblica</italic> extracts blocked PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells, as shown by slight brown staining of cells.
