<p id="Par31">Before determining the antiviral properties of a compound, it is essential that a cytotoxicity assay is performed to determine the concentrations that can be used to avoid cell damage and ensure PRRSV selectivity in vitro. In this study, we reported cytotoxicity as CC
 <sub>50</sub>, which indicates the concentration of a substance that can inhibit virus activity by 50%. We found that 
 <italic>P. emblica</italic> extract showed the highest cell toxicity (78.1 μg/ml). In this study, high-potential plant extracts were found to be 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> and 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> extracts, with CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 625 and 1250 μg/ml, respectively. Antiviral compounds should be highly effective while showing minimal toxicity to normal cells and tissues [
