<p id="Par33">Regarding phytochemical content, 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract had the highest total phenolic content (220.52 ± 4.47 mM GAE/g sample). The total phenolic content of a plant is considered an indicator of its antioxidant capacity because the redox properties of phenolic compounds allow them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, and radical scavengers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that ethanolic 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract had a total phenolic content of 723.67 μg GAE/mg. The values of total phenolic content in this study were slightly different from those reported previously. This may be because of the different durations, geographical variations, or extraction methods, which may have altered the phenolic content. Ethanolic plant extracts can be used for the investigation of antiviral activity in a cell line. Abu-Jafar and Huleihel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported that ethanolic 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> leave extracts had strong antiviral activity against different members of the herpes virus family (HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV). Ramalingam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported that the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> have the highest antiviral inhibitory effects against dengue virus in Vero cells.
