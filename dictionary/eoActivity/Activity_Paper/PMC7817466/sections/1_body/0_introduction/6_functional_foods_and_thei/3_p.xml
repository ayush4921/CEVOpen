<p id="p0055">In this context, functional foods are used to strengthen other physiological functions including the immunity responses (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Roberfroid, 2000</xref>). The characteristics of functional foods were tabulated in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . Functional food components can be useful components that originate logically in or complement food as functional elements such as vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, fatty acids, amino acids, polyphenols, phytopigments, non-saponifiable fractions, and functional plant-based proteins (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">London, 2010</xref>). 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarises the functional foods-based products which were quoted from the available data. These foods and/or ingredients boost the immune response by different mechanisms (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Powell 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000
 </xref>). Meanwhile, the deficiencies of one or more essential fatty and amino acids, vitamins, Se, Zn, Fe, Cu, and phytonutrients will affect almost all types of immunity (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Zhang

 </xref>). Regarding COVID-19 pandemic, these functional ingredients may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 through their immunoenhancing and antiviral activity. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2020)
 </xref> had claimed that vitamin A and/or its derivatives like retinoic acid could provide a promising alternative for CoV-therapy. Vitamin D has several immune-modulatory effects and might work as additional therapeutic against COVID-19 (Moriguchi and Muraga, 2000; 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020
 </xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Liu (2020)</xref> had stated that Zn may affect not only COVID-19-linked symptoms like inferior respiratory tract infection and diarrhea but also SARS-CoV-2 replication. Dosing the patients with Se could be an active choice for the cure of COVID-19 as previously stated by 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2020)
 </xref>, for instance. These functional compounds are essential substances at the molecular and cellular levels that play critical functions.
