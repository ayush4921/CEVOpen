<p id="p0080">Regarding SRARS-CoV, saikosaponins, naturally occurring triterpene glycosides derived from medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Heteromorpha spp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Bupleurum spp.</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scrophularia scorodonia</italic>, showed several biological activities, specifically antihepatoma, anti-hepatitis, antinephritis, anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and antimicrobial effects. Thus, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)
 </xref> recommended the use of saikosaponins as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against CoVs-22E9. The extracts of 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic>, 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra, Dioscorea batatas, Cassia tora,</italic> and 
 <italic>Taxillus chinensis</italic> inhibited the SARS-CoV replication better than other 200 extracts (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Wen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>). Likewise, the extracts of 
 <italic>Gentianae radix, Dioscoreae rhizoma, Cassiae Semen</italic>, 
 <italic>Loranthi Ramus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhizoma Cibotii</italic> in the concentrations from 25 to 200 μg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> inhibited SARS-CoV. Bioflavonoids from 
 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic> inhibited SARS-CoV 3CLpro by 62% at 100 μg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ryu, Jeong, 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 </xref>), where he identified 8 diterpenoids and 4 bioflavonoids by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. The activity of flavones (apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin) was also investigated with IC
 <sub>50</sub>-values of 280.8, 20.2, and 23.8 μM, separately, and the presence of the apigenin moiety at the C-30 position of flavones seems to be more effective. Ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> Thunb. contribute to the superior antiviral efficacy 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> presenting the potential for the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus and dengue infections (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chiow 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub>-value of 0.98 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub>-values for quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, and galusatechin gallate against SARS-CoV were 73, 73, and 47 μM, respectively, and the galooyl group should be present at 3-OH-position to be more efficient (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Quercetin derivatives such as 7-O-arylmethylquercetin and quercetin-3-β-galactoside could combat as anti-SARS-CoV agent (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Park 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Flavonoids found in 
 <italic>Galla chinensis</italic> or 
 <italic>Veronica lin rrifolia</italic> extracts may interact with the surface of the spiky protein of the SARS-CoV, avoiding virus particles from powerful the cell (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Liu, 2014</xref>). Phlorotannins isolated from brown algae display an inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-3CLpro, regulating the virus replication. In particular, dieckol showed high inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.7 μM (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Park 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Tetra-O-galoilo-β-d-glucose and luteolin have been confirmed to be active against SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lin 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). In particular, 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> extract showed to be a good entrant against SARS-CoV as it showed the highest efficacy, mainly due to the lycorin component (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lin 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). In addition, 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Park 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> isolated 10 polyphenolics from 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> as CoVs-protease inhibitors against 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) and-papain-like-CoVs-cysteine-proteases (PLpro). It was also found that all polyphenols have more effectiveness against PLpro than 3CLpro; the results suggested polyphenols of 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> have anti-CoVs activity. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ryu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)
 </xref> examined the capacity for SARS-CoV inhibition of flavonoids from the 
 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic> leaves. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. nucifera</italic> leaves-inhibited the SARS-CoV-3CLprotease with inhibition values of 62% at 100 g mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, this study confirmed that amentoflavone is more effective than the respective flavones (luteolin and apigenin) and bioflavonoids derivatives on SARS-CoV-3CLpro. Thus, amentoflavone may be a good component for development as a natural therapeutic medicine against SARS-CoV infection. Jo 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2020) studied the antiviral activity of three flavonoids against SARS-CoV. Rhoifolin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin have been found to block SARS-CoV-3CLpro's enzyme activity. The interaction of these bioflavonoids was established using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, and the three flavonoids were recommended to be templates to strategy functionally developed inhibitors. 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> A. presented the binding pose of amentoflavone in SARS-CoV 3CLpro cited from the study of 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ryu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)
 </xref>. As for MERS-CoV, flavonoids were considered as potential inhibitors of MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jo 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>), where each of herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3-β-d-glucoside, and helichristetine blocked the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV-3CLpro. It was noted that flavonoid derivatives with hydrophobic or carbohydrate groups devoted to their core structures inhibit MERS-CoV. The computational and experimental study showed that chalcone and flavonol are desired supports to bind with the catalytic site of MERS-CoV-3CLpro. Therefore, this study suggested that flavonoids with these properties can be used as models to develop powerful MERS-CoV-3CLpro inhibitors. Regarding SARS-CoV-2, 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Negida, and Bahbah (2020)</xref> reported that saikosaponins are considered as active substances for SARS-CoV-2 due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. The water extract from 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> root, containing a number of phenolic compounds, namely sinigrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 217 μM) and hesperetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 8.3 μM) showed anti-SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro. Through sequential matching, it has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 major protease has approximately a 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2-Mpro (
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Xu 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020
 </xref>). The inhibition of Mpro was ascribed to floronates, flavonoids, and pseudo-opeptides. The most hopeful inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 were found to be oligomers of phloroglucin (1,3,5- trihydroxybenzene) derived from brown algae 
 <italic>Sergassum spinuligerum</italic>. In turn, the most active inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 are compounds from the florotannin group (8,8′-Bieckol, 6,6′-Bieckol, Dieckol) isolated from the brown algae 
 <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gentile 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020
 </xref>). Khalifa, Nawaz, 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2020) revealed that phacelianin, gentiodelphin, cyanodelphin, and tecophilin authentically interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro. Khalifa, Zhu, 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2020) also discovered that pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin intensely interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro. These studies unleashed that anthocyanins and/or tannins with specific structure could be used as effective anti-COVID-19 natural components. Meanwhile, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>B. portrayed the interaction between tannins with SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro (
