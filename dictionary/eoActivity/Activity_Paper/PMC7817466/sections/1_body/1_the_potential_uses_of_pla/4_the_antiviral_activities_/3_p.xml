<p id="p0075">Interestingly, there are no known therapies for CoVs-infection and defensive vaccines are still being discovered even discovered still need extensive evaluation. Thus, the situation illustrates the need for appropriate antivirals and/or immune-enhancers to be produced for prophylaxis CoV-infection. Recently, the antiviral activity of numerous polyphenols from different sources was evaluated against several viruses (

He found that the anti-influenza activity of pomegranate polyphenols is substantially modified by changes in covering glycoproteins. Likewise,

It was also found that theaflavins, which are the polyphenols of black tea, had antiviral effects on vaccinia virus, influenza virus, poliovirus-1, herpes simplex virus, coxsackievirus, and human rotavirus.
