<p id="p0095">Numerous instances display that nature proposes the greatest solutions. Many plant species hold biologically active polyphenols, which in synergistic blends are active in battling many diseases. They already have been discovered by ancient medicine and/or folk. Recognizing individual components and revealing the underlying mechanisms is a challenge. This delays the product’s standardization, namely since plant extracts hold a wide variety of different components, happening in fluctuating concentrations, with seemingly synergistic effects. Despite several unknowns, studies decidedly show that polyphenols inhibit the life cycle of CoVs. This review indicates the huge possibility of polyphenols in the expansion of functional foods and/or pharmaceutical preparations. Laboratory model trials are required to verify their efficiency in inhibiting CoVs-replication. The upcoming phase should be to conduct clinical trials on COVID-19-patients and remarking the possibility to decrease virus multiplication in the patient’s organism and thus recover clinical signs. It appears that the addition of polyphenols into food and clinical practice should be fairly fast because those are mixtures of natural origin, attained from plants approved for use as herbs and food. It is worth stating that the advantage of using polyphenols is related to the high-safety profile without causing major side effects.</p>
