<p>Antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> extract/active fraction was screened by ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> assay, as described by Arnao et al. (2001) with a minor modification [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An ABTS tablet (A9941, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10 mg of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> was dissolved in 2.45 mM of potassium persulphate and methanol to make the stock solution. After 12 h of incubation period, the absorbance of the solution was recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at 734 nm. Fresh working solution of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> was prepared by dissolving 250 µL of stock solution in 4.5 mL of ethanol. About 100 µL of sample (Ht-EAF, Ht-HF, Ht-MF, and HT-ME) was allowed to react with 100 µL ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> in dark for 10–15 min and the absorbance was recorded at 734 nm. Similarly, DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical scavenging activity was measured by the method described elsewhere. Briefly, 100 µL of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> extract/active fraction was treated with 0.1 mM of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> (100 µL) solution, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. Antioxidant activity in terms of % ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical scavenging activity were calculated by standard methods described earlier.
