<p>The molecular docking study of selected phytocompounds (neochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, 3-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)propan-1-amine and feruloylquinic acid) against anti-diabetic target enzymes of α-amylase and α-glucosidase was performed by ArgusLab 4.01 and the docking outputs were visualized by using BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer V20. Docking process has several steps, which includes ligand and protein processing, conversion, optimization, and energy minimalization, etc. The structures of all the tested phytocompounds were retrieved from NIH PubChem (
 <uri xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</uri>) and their energy minimalization was done by USCF chimera (Ver 1.14). The target proteins of α-amylase (IOSE) and α-glucosidase (3A4A) were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB), and the non-protein parts (water molecules, other ligands, etc.,) were removed. The molecular docking of processed α-amylase/α-glucosidase with energy minimalized selected phytocompounds was analyzed by ArgusLab 4.01 programme. The size of the Grid box was fixed into maximum with default space. The results were visualized by using BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer V20 software.
