<p>Wound-healing potential of Ht-EAF was screened using NIH3T3 cells according to the method described by Mariadoss et al., 2020 [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and kept in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C to grow for full confluence. Afterwards, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS solution and exposed to fresh medium. The monolayer of the cells was horizontally scratched with a 100-µL pipette tip to make an artificial wound and the cell debris was removed by washing with PBS. Then, the cells were treated with different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) of Ht-EAF and diluted with serum-free media of DMEM. The cells without treatment were considered as control cells. The cell migration assay was documented using a phase contrast microscope (20×) at different time intervals (0 h-initial, 12 h, and 24 h-mid and 48 h-final). The photograph was analyzed by ImageJ software and the wound closure exposure was determined by the following formula. 
 <disp-formula>Wound closure = [(Measurement at 0 h-Measurement at 48 h)/Measurement at 0 h] × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
