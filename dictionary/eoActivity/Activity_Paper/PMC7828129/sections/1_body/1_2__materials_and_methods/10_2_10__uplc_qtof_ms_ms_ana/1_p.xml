<p>Chromatographic separation and the detection of mass spectroscopic analysis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of fight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) (WATERS XEVO GS-XS QTOF analyzer) was utilized for the identification of an active compound profile. About 2 μL of Ht-EAF sample was injected into the sample holder and the separation was carried out by using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) (Waters Co., USA). The flow rate of the sample was controlled at 0.3 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 30 °C. The column was evaluated by using 0.1% of formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% of formic acid in acetonitrile (B) and the separation was done by 10% A to 10% B gradient elution within 10 min. The phytochemicals were identified with the help of literature support acquired for Medicine, PubMed, Chemspider, Web of science and UNIFI 1.8 software.</p>
