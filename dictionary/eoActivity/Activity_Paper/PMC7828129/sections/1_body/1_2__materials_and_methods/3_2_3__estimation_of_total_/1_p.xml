<p>According to the method described by Saeed et al. (2012), the total phenol and flavonoid content in the organic fractions of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> (Ht-EAF: 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>-ethyl acetate fraction, Ht-HF: 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>-hexane fraction, Ht-MF: 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>-methanol fraction) and its methanolic extracts (HT-ME) were analyzed [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, 100 µL of sample (extracts/active fractions) was dissolved in 200 µL of Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and subjected to gentle shaking. To this, 200 µL of 2% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was added, mixed thoroughly, and the mixture was kept in dark conditions for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the mixture was recorded at 760 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer and the total phenolic content was determined using standard gallic acid curves. To estimate the total flavonoid content, 50 µL of sample (extracts/active fractions) was mixed with 200 µL of distilled water, 150 µL of 95% ethanol, 10 µL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and 10 µL of CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOK. Then, the mixture was kept for 45 min at room temperature and the absorbance was recorded at 415 nm against blank (without sample). Total flavonoid content was expressed in quercetin equivalents.
