<p>There is an increasing demand to establish a natural inhibitor of anti-diabetic-targeting molecules formulated in the form of functional food, capsule, pill, etc. Due to less side effects and low cost, the plant-based anti-diabetic molecules have great ability in treating DM patients [

It is one of the key enzymes that catalyze the final stages of digestion process in carbohydrate metabolism. The dysfunction of this enzyme accelerates the rise in post-prandial glucose level in DM [

The available literature evidently shows that inhibition of α-amylase activity lowers hyperglycemia. The three fractions have a significant inhibitory activity against α-glycosidase, which ranged from 1.73 to 77.74% (
