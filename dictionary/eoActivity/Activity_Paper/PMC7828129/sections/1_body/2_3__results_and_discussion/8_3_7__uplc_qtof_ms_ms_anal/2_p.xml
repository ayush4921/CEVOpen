<p>The identified phytocompounds are in the nature of carbohydrates, amino acid, polyphenol, and their derivatives and few unknown compounds. From Ht-EAF, 21 compounds were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis including phenolic compounds (neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and cryptochlorogenic acid), quinic derivatives compound (feruloylquinic acid, dicaffeoylquinic acids, and unsaturated carboxylic acid of cinnamic acid). First, sucrose was identified at the RT value of 0.79 min with deprotonated peak observed at
