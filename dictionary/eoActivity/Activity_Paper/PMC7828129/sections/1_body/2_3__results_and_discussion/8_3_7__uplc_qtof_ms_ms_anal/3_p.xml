<p>Chlorogenic acid belongs to the family of esters formed by the reaction between qunic acid and caffeic acid. [M−H]
 <sup>−</sup> ions of three chlorogenic isomers, namely neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid and cryptochlorogenic acid at RT of 1.50, 1.91 and 4.06 min, respectively, were detected at

 <italic>z</italic> 135.04, 179.03 and 191.05. These MS/MS fragmentations correspond to quinic and caffeic acids. Caffeic acid was also identified in RT at 2.37 min with
