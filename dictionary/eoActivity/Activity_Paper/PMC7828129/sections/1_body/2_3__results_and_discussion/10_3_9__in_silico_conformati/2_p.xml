<p>Based on the hydrogen bonding ability and docking score, it can be concluded that cryptochlorogenic acid showed a superior binding affinity toward the binding molecule of α-amylase and caffeoylquinic acid against α-glycosidase. In the α-amylase docking assay, the docking score of cryptochlorogenic acid was found to be −9.86082 and it forms hydrogen bonds with amino acids, such as Glu318, Gly283, and Pro34, present in the active site, at a distance of 5.23 Å, 4.22 Å and 4.43 Å, respectively. Similarly, caffeoylquinic acid showed the highest binding score (−10.7379 kcal/mol) with α-glycosidase. It was found to form hydrogen bonds with amino acids of Arg442, Glu411, Gln279, His280, Thr310, and Arg315, present in the active site, at a distance of 5.41 Å, 3.97 Å, 3.40 Å, 4.61 Å, 4.02 Å, and 2.79 Å, respectively. Other tested compounds also have a significant docking ability.</p>
