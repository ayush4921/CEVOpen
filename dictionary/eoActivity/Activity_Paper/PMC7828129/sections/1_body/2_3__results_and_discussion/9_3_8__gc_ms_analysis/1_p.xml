<p>Further, GC-MS analysis was employed to explore the phytochemical constituents of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The GC-MS spectrum of the Ht-EAF was compared with the standard phytochemical library of W8N05ST.L and the name of the phytochemical constituents, RT value, area, structure, and pharmacological activities are summarized in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00099-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The first compound, caffeoylquinic acid was identified with less retention time of 4.58 min and the last compound, cyclopentanol was identified with the longest retention time of 25.182 min. The identified compounds possess diverse pharmacological activities. Caffeoylquinic acid has anti-bacterial, antioxidant, cardio protection, hepatoprotection, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, neuroptotection, anti-hypertension, anti-viral, and free radical scavenging activities [

Isoxazolidine (RT: 5.271; % of area: 4.47) enhances the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties as well as controls the osmatic pressure in drug delivery system. Among the prevailing phytocompounds, β-bourbonene (RT: 8.921; % of area: 10.87) present in diverse plant families, has the ability to lower the blood glucose and lipid levels, and suppresses the oxidative stress in diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The phytocompounds, carbamic acid (RT: 10.253; % of area: 4.13), pent-4-enamide (RT: 12.629; % of area: 11.96), hexanoic acid (RT: 22.957; % of area: 10.20), and α-murrolene (RT: 23.011; % of area: 13.48) display significant and wide-ranging anti-microbial activity. Besides, the quinic acid derivative, feruloylquinic acid (R.t: 10.849; % of area: 13.77) possesses anti-cancer and anti-AIV (H5N1) activity [
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. 1,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (R.t: 18.833; % of area: 11.91), due to its phenolic nature, is believed to be a defense molecule against certain oxidative stress-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B49-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The % of total area of phenolic nature of the phytocompounds were found to be 49.10 in GC-MS spectrum of the Ht-EAF. i.e., caffeoylquinic acid (5.37), isoxazolidine (4.47), feruloylquinic acid (13.77), 1,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (19.91), and camphene (5.85). This finding is interconnected with the total phenolic content of ethyl acetate fractions, which reflects high amount of phenolic content. It was worth mentioning that the phenolic nature of the phytocompounds is responsible for the significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic activity.
