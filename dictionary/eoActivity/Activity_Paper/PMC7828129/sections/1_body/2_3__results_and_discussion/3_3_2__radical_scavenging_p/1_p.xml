<p>Phenolic-based phytoconstituents have diverse biological activities including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-carcinogenic activity. These activities might be directly associated with the antioxidant properties of the medicinal plants. There are several in vitro assay models available to screen the radical scavenging properties of the plant extracts and their active metabolites. Among them, DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> and ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> are widely accepted and practiced by many researchers. The DPPH radical scavenging potentials of various fractions are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The results revealed that all the active fractions from 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> showed a concentration-based radical scavenging activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical-scavenging activity of Ht-EAF, Ht-ME, Ht-HF, and Ht-MF was found to be 161.55 ± 0.98 μg/mL, 286.32± 1.21 μg/mL, 391.13 ± 4.52 μg/mL, and 756.23± 0.13μg/mL, respectively, while that of the standard ascorbic acid was 75.83 ± 0.61 μg/mL. Among the tested samples, the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical scavenging activity. The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> scavenging activities of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> fractions are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical scavenging activity of Ht-EAF, Ht-ME, Ht-HF, and Ht-MF was found to be 104.45 ± 3.01 μg/mL, 492.29 ± 1.87μg/mL, and 948.90 ± 2.09 μg/mL (&lt;1000 μg/mL), while that of the standard ascorbic acid was 48.84 ± 2.04 μg/mL. The maximum ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> scavenging activity was documented in ethyl acetate fraction of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> followed by methanol extract, hexane fraction, and methanol fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The results were compared with the antioxidant activity of standard ascorbic acid. These findings are in line with the earlier studies, wherein concentration-dependent DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical scavenging activity was recorded. The noted antioxidant activity is correlated to the phenolic profile of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>. Concentration-dependent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities have been reported in many phenolic-rich phytocompounds [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Overall, it could be suggested that the phenolic-based phytocompounds present in the active fraction of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> reduced the oxidative-stress-mediated complications in diabetic conditions.
