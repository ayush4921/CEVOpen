<p>A few analogues of isoflavonoids have been developed as drugs. Phenoxodiol (idronoxil; 
 <bold>66</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f016">Figure 16</xref>, a simple isoflavone, showed promise in clinical trials as an anticancer agent with an uncommon mode of action among naturally derived anti-tumour drugs. It inhibits NADH oxidase (tNOX) in cancer cells, which triggers apoptosis. Phenoxodiol is still being tested in late-phase clinical trials against a wide range of cancer types, including chemo-resistant ovarian cancers as well as prostate and cervical cancers [
