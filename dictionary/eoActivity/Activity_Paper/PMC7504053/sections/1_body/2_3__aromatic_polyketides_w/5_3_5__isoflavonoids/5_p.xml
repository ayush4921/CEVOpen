<p>The dried, powdered roots have long been used as insecticides. The insecticidal action of rotenone and deguelin is achieved via their ability to complex with the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase of the respiratory chain, blocking electron transport to ubiquinone and disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. Insects and fish lack the enzymes for rapid detoxification, while mammals are not susceptible to rotenoids because they are able to rapidly metabolize them when ingested. Rotenoids pose a serious threat only when they enter the blood stream. Rotenoid-producing plants were traditionally used for “lazy fishing” in which the powdered root was sprinkled in water, killing all nearby fish. When the fish were eaten, the diners suffered no adverse effects. With their non-toxic profile and biodegradability, rotenoids are still frequently used as insecticides. Rotenone is used in human medicine to treat head lice and scabies and in veterinary practice in the management of mites, lice and ticks [

It is however being superseded by agents with improved stability and insecticidal activity, such as semi-synthetic derivatives of pyrethrin. Rotenone is also utilized in rat models of Parkinson’s disease, although the validity of this model has been questioned [
