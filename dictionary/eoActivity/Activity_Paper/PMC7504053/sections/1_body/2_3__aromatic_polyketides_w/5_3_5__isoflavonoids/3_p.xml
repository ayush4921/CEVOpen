<p>The aforementioned information raises doubts about the safety and usefulness of isoflavonoids in menopause and other diseases. After years of testing alternatives, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) still seems to provide the best therapy, at least for osteoporosis. Isoflavonoids have not been accepted by conventional medical practice, but they are available as dietary supplements primarily from soybean (
 <italic>Glycine max</italic>; Fabaceae), which contain high levels of daidzein and genistein in free or 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosidic forms and red clover (
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic>; Fabaceae), whose isoflavones are chiefly composed of formononetin and daidzein free or as 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosides; 
 <bold>55</bold>â€“
 <bold>58</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f014">Figure 14</xref>. Another compound that has been largely discussed as a potential phytoestrogen is miroestrol (
 <bold>65</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f015">Figure 15</xref>, from 
 <italic>Pueraria mirifica</italic> (Fabaceae). Miroestrol is available in the form of standardized extracts of 
 <italic>P. mirifica</italic> and is marketed as dietary supplement to treat the symptoms of menopause, similar to other more common isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein). However, much of the miroestrol claims have not been sufficiently proved in clinical trials, and the Federal Trade Commission has taken legal action against some marketers of these products. Other isoflavonoids, such as vestitol (
 <bold>59</bold>), medicacarpin (
 <bold>61</bold>), and pisatin (
 <bold>62</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f014">Figure 14</xref>, seem to be only active in plants for defence against fungal attack, and are not of interest as phytoestrogens.
