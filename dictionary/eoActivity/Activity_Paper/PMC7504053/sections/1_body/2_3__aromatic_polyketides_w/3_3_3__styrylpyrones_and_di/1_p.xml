<p>As noted above, flavonoids and allied compounds are formed via a combination of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA and three units of malonyl-CoA. This is the most common biosynthetic pathway for aromatic polyketides. The 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA starter unit may be extended with one or two malonyl units, giving rise to a subgroup of compounds with a considerably limited spread in the plant kingdom. In styrylpyrones, for example, two C
 <sub>2</sub> units were added via malonate and the terminal chain often undergoes cyclisation to give lactones. Yangonin and the related kavalactones from kava (
 <italic>Piper methysticum</italic>; Piperaceae) provide one of the best illustrations of such compounds.
