<p>Aqueous extracts of the underground parts of kava have long been used in the South Pacific countries of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia as a drink with intoxicating properties. Kava has also gained popularity in herbal medicine for providing significant relief from anxiety, nervous tension, agitation, insomnia, headache and migraine [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. There is mounting evidence that the pharmacological activity of kava stems from various kavalactones. To date, more than 18 kavalactones have been described, the predominant ones being the four enolides, kavain, methysticin, and their corresponding dihydro-derivatives, and two dienolides, yangonin and demethoxyyangonin (

 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Isolated kavalactones have also demonstrated analgesic, anticonvulsive, and relaxing activity on central muscles. Some of the kavalactones appear to affect neurotransmitter systems, including those where glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin are involved. Yangonin has also been shown to interact with cannabinoid receptors [

These cases of hepatotoxicity have raised questions of the safety of kava products. What was not sufficiently emphasized is that many of the kava users were taking extracts prepared using organic solvents such as acetone and alcohol. The hepatotoxicity might thus have been associated with the mode of preparation, rather than the kavalactones themselves [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Liver poisoning was also observed in people taking kava in a traditional aqueous form [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. As a result, kava has been banned from sale in some countries. The problem was revisited and now it seems that cases of poisonings may have been related to low-grade kava material containing fungi with the possibility of hepatotoxic constituents such as aflatoxins and ochratotoxin A [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. There is also an alternative explanation that some of the cases may have developed hepatotoxicity due to the specific reaction of their individual metabolic subtype [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. At any rate, it should be noted that there are not enough data to prove that kavalactones cause liver damage. In addition to the hepatotoxicity problem, there is now ample evidence that kava can alter the metabolic breakdown of some prescription drugs, presumably by the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes [

Kava is marketed as a dietary supplement, but it still remains peripheral to mainstream medicine and is not available as a pharmaceutical drug. Commonly used anxiolytics like benzodiazepines and barbiturates are strong enhancers of GABA receptors and they can cause serious adverse effects. Thus, kavalactones would provide a safer alternative in anxiety and the related disorders if their hepatotoxicity issue could be resolved. In addition to the promising results in anxiety, kava and kavalactones might also be of value to migraine sufferers, who have said that kava helped in reducing some of their symptoms, although there are no clinical data to back this up [
