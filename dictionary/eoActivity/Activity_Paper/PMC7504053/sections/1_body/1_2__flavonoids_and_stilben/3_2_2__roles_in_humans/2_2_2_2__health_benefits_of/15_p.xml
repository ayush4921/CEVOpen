 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> and 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (Rutaceae), respectively. These glycosides are perceived by most persons as intensely bitter. An array of biological activities was suggested for neohesperidin and naringin, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antidiabetic, and as a preventive in cardiovascular disorders, but sufficient clinical data are not available to support these claims. Naringin, naringenin and hesperidin were thought to be the ingredients of grapefruit juice responsible for the inhibition of human cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 that are necessary for the metabolism of some drugs [

However, it was later found out that the juice also contained considerable quantities of furanocoumarins, which turned out to be strong cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and it is now thought that they, rather than the flavonoids, are the main cause of the drug dose-elevating effect of grapefruit juice. Recently, naringin and hesperidin were implicated as inhibitors of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), through which they may significantly contribute to this drug effect as well [
