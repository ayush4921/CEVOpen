<p>Catechins (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, existing as mixtures of diastereomers (–)-catechin, (+)-catechin, (–)-epicatechin, and (+)-epicatechin, are quite abundant in food plants, though cocoa (
 <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic>; Malvaceae) seems to be an exceptionally rich source. The pharmacopeia of 100 years ago included catechin formulations for the treatment of various cardiovascular problems. Recent dietary studies showed that catechins might have a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Very interestingly, it was not long ago that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel stated that cocoa flavanols might be effective in maintaining endothelium-dependent vasodilation and normal blood flow [

Their mode of action has not been fully established, but they appear to affect platelet aggregation, are capable of decreasing blood pressure and glucose levels, and counteract dyslipidaemia [

It is questionable to what extent this activity can be ascribed solely to catechins, since catechin-rich foods such a cocoa contain a myriad of other compounds. Catechins might also produce adverse effects—the ingestion of some catechin-containing products was associated with haemolytic anaemia and renal failure triggered by an autoimmune reaction [
