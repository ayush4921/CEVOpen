<p>Quercetin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, is perhaps the best known of the basic flavonoids. It was originally isolated in 1895 from the bark of the oak, 
 <italic>Quercus tinctoria</italic>; Fagaceae, hence the name. It demonstrated modest anticancer activity by interfering with protein tyrosine kinases [

This discovery led to the development of agents with improved anticancer activity such as the Cdk-inhibiting rohitukine-derived drugs, discussed later. The anticancer effect of quercetin was tested in a phase I clinical trial, but it was not advanced to later testing stages, presumably because of the discovery of more effective agents. Quercetin was also found to be an oestrogen receptor agonist similar to isoflavonoids (discussed below in

Despite these facts, quercetin is marketed as a dietary supplement and some manufacturers claim that it is of benefit in various human diseases, including some cancers such as that of the prostate [
