<p>Taxifolin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, is a dihydro variant of quercetin that possesses some of the properties of the structurally related flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol. It shows relatively strong anticancer activity in ovarian cancer through the inhibition of the cell cycle, angiogenesis, and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) expression [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which suggests that these compounds might have skin-bleaching activity in vivo. Similar to other flavonoids like catechin and apigenin, taxifolin appears to have some mild antagonistic activity towards opioid receptors [
