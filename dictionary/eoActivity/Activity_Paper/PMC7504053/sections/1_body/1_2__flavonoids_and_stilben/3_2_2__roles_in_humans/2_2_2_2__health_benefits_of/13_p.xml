These products are claimed to be of value in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions related to endothelial dysfunction, post-thrombotic syndrome, and venous insufficiency by reducing the fragility of blood capillaries and increasing the flexibility of blood vessels. To date, there is still little evidence of their use being safe and effective, though rutin was found to moderately reduce oedema in lower extremities in patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) [

In spite of being glycosylated, a modification that is believed to increase bioavailability, both rutin and hesperidin have low absorption levels and are readily metabolized and excreted. These factors limit their therapeutic potential.
