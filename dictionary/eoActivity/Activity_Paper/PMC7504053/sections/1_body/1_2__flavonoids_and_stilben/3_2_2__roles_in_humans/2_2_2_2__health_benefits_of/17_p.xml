<p>Some of the information concerning the major flavonoids described above are summed-up in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03846-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. This table also contains information on doses at which these compounds were tested for their biological activities (for animals, and where possible for humans), the observed toxic doses (for animals), and the daily doses recommended by the dietary supplement retailer. Note that the doses tested on animals are generally significantly higher than those tested on human subjects and those present in dietary supplements. It is particularly worthy of note that to date, the recommended daily dose has not been established for most (if not all) flavonoids.
