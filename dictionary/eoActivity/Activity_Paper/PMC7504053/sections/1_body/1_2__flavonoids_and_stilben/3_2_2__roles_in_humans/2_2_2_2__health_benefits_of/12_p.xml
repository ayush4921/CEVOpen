<p>If the tea leaves are allowed to ferment (oxidise), much of the colourless catechins, including EGCG, are enzymatically converted into theaflavins and thearubigins, which are responsible for the darker colour of black tea. Theaflavin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f004">Figure 4</xref>, might also be present as theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, and theaflavin-3-3′-digallate. Since theaflavins are structurally related to catechins and EGCG, they are assumed to possess similar biological activities, and are thought to be especially of value in cancer prevention and CVD. Few clinical trials on theaflavin have been done. One study found an association between the consumption of theaflavin-enriched tea extracts and reduced levels of cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], though this effect was not observed when purified theaflavins were administered [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Theaflavins, tea extracts, and tea also demonstrated promising results in psychophysiological stress [

 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], though more data are required. What was not addressed was the possibility that other compounds may significantly contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of tea, and the clinical usefulness of theaflavins is still far from conclusive. Theaflavins were also investigated as potential antivirals, in particular against HIV, and anticancer effects such as inhibiting cell growth, survival and metastasis [
