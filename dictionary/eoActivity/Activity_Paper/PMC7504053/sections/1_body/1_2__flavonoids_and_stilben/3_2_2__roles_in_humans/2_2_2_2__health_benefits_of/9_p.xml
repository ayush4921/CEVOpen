<p>Anthocyanidins are unusual in that their oxygen at C
 <sub>1</sub> is present in a positively charged state, commonly known as flavylium cation. Some examples of an anthocyanidin structure such as pelargonidin (16) and cyanidin (17) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>. These compounds are commonly distributed in plants and are generally responsible for the purple, dark blue, violet, and black colouration of various plant parts such as blueberries and purple cabbage, and the colour changes depend on pH [

With regard to clinical usefulness, many of the properties of other flavonoids will be valid for anthocyanidinsâ€”low bioavailability, rapid metabolism and high excretion rate, together with beneficial effects in the treatment of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and neurodegenerative disorders. Some recent studies have disputed the claim that anthocyanidin consumption has antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-aging effects [
