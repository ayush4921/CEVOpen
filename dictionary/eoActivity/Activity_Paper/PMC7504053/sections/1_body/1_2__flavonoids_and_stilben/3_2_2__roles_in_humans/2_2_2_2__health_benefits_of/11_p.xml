<p>The hydroxy- group at position C

 <bold>21</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f004">Figure 4</xref>, is an ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid. EGCG is found in high quantities in unfermented green tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>; Theaceae) and is considered the active ingredient for the health benefits of drinking green tea. EGCG was said to have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, and GABA antagonistic activity, and to be beneficial in preventing CVD, diabetes, and obesity [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and EGCG is available as a dietary supplement. None of this was proved satisfactorily in clinical trials and there is still little evidence that EGCG provides these health benefits in humans. Some studies even showed that the excessive intake of EGCG is associated with hepatotoxicity and liver damage [
