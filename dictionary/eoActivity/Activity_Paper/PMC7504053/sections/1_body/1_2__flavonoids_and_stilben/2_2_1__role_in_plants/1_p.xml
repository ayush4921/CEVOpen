<p>Plants produce flavonoids and stilbenes for various purposes. The name flavonoid is derived from the Latin flavus meaning yellow. Flavonoids possess a strong chromophore, producing various colours from white as in luteolin, to the yellow of quercetin, pink of peonidin, or blue/black of cyanidin and delphinidin. Flavonoids were first discovered in flowers and fruits, and solely or together with other compounds like carotenoids are responsible for their colour, which helps in attracting pollinators and in seed dispersal [

They have also been isolated from leaves, bark, stems, and roots, in which they chiefly accumulate in vacuoles and cytoplasm, suggesting that they play other roles than just assisting in plant reproduction and gene pool transfer [

Flavonoids were shown to protect the plants against excessive UV light, as a defence against bacterial and fungal pathogens, to deter herbivory, and to prevent damage from frost, drought, heat, and heavy metals. These compounds were also shown to mediate both intra-organismal and extra-organismal interactions, including the regulation of hormonal activity such as auxin [
