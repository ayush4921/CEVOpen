<p>Since flavonoids are present in fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages, and other common foodstuffs, humans may consume appreciable quantities (&gt;500 mg) of these compounds every day [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Flavonoids have been presented by the media and in advertisement and even in some scientific articles as molecules with powerful health-promoting and anti-aging properties. They are viewed as strong antioxidants and free radical scavengers that can prevent the oxidation of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, which are essential for the maintenance of the basic physiological functions of an organism. Flavonoids have been present in the human diet for centuries and adverse biological effects have generally not been reported. This might raise the question of whether these compounds have any therapeutic benefit because most effective medicines do have side effects. Recent studies seem to be predominantly focused on the widely distributed common members of the aromatic polyketide family like dietary flavonoids (some examples are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03846-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which are somewhat non-critically perceived as miracle molecules with broad health-promoting effects. However, those with a much more restricted distribution, such as specific stilbenes, styrylpyrones, flavonolignans, and various isoflavonoids might be more promising as clinically useful therapeutics (
