<p>Plants have always played a significant role in human life. They have been used in nearly every aspect of human needs, as food, medicine, spices, beverages, sugar, oil, dyes, clothing, building materials, pesticides and hunting poisons. A plethora of different plants has been used in ritual ceremonies and traditional medicine. The knowledge of the use of medicinal plants provided an important clue that particular plants might contain chemicals with significant health-affecting activities and eventually became the basis of a plant-derived pharmacopeia. The various extracts, potions and formulations in a combination with advances in medicinal chemistry led researchers to the discovery of a large number of drugs, many of which are still in use today. It is estimated that our planet is home to 250,000â€“300,000 species of higher plants, of which only a relatively small number have been characterized from a phytochemical standpoint with a view towards using them pharmaceutically [

Thus, there is still a significant chance of discovering new plant-derived compounds with useful pharmaceutical properties that could eventually lead to clinically effective new drugs. And now, with the development of molecular medicine and the capability to study signalling pathways and drug targets in detail, naturally-derived agents that have previously failed in the clinic might become the focus of renewed interest. The position of natural products as sources of new pharmaceutical agents, especially anticancer drugs, is still very important, as recently reviewed by Newman and Cragg (2016) [
