<p>It has been estimated that 500,000–600,000 plant-derived compounds have been described, of which about 100,000 have demonstrated promising biological activity that could be of value in the treatment of human diseases [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many chemical groups such as polyketides, cannabinoids and many others derived from plants have been the starting points of successful therapeutics, such as shikimate-derived compounds (Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>, etoposide, teniposide), terpenoids (artemisinin and Taxol
 <sup>®</sup>), and high molecular weight compounds (ricin and polysaccharides). Certain groups, however, have demonstrated greater medicinal utility than the others. Plant-derived alkaloids have supplied a large share of clinically useful drugs including cocaine, tubocurarine, morphine, quinine, vincristine, vinblastine, ellipticine, camptothecin, and physostigmine [
