<p>Plant-derived aromatic polyketides are collectively referred to as compounds that combine biosynthetic features from both shikimate and acetate pathways, usually incorporating aromatic rings and polyketide-derived groups on their structures, hence the name. There are other plant-derived polyketides with an aromatic functional group, such as emodin, sennosides, and hypericin. However, in the course of biosynthesis, these structures utilize acetate starter units (e.g., acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA) instead of that derived from shikimate metabolism (e.g., 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA) and are usually products of type II polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes (not type III PKS; see further sections for more details). Aromatic polyketides that are discussed in this review are regarded as a subgroup which, from the nomenclature point of view, fall under the larger group of shikimate-derived compounds, and are further divided into styrylpyrones, diarylheptanoids, flavonoids and stilbenes, flavonolignans, and isoflavonoids [

Some of these compounds, particularly flavonoids, are present in large amounts in most plant tissues, whereas others have a rather restricted distribution and abundancy. Flavonoids were demonstrated to have very important roles in plant reproduction, defence, and hormonal regulation, but the degree to which they are functionally active in humans remains uncertain.
