<p>Although there is local ethnobotanical data on the use of the genus 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> to relieve pain and inflammation, few preclinical studies to evaluate the effect have been published. An even smaller amount describes the biological activity and therapeutic potential of the genus for this purpose. Furthermore, the relationship between antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effect has not been analyzed. Therefore, this review will focus on the ethnopharmacological analysis of the genus 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> and the decisive role that it could play in the management of inflammatory pain.
