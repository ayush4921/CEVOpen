<p>The pathological effects of ROS, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 are due to the activation of various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways including the three (ERK, JNK, and p38) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), NFκB, AP1, and JAK/STAT [

Mammalian nerves are especially susceptible to free radicals, both oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS), due to the high content of phospholipids and axonal mitochondria; in addition to having a weak antioxidant system and other hand, some studies on antioxidant supplementation in animal models show that hydroxyl radicals (OH), superoxide (O

 <sup>−</sup>), and nitric oxide (ON) may have a role in peripheral sensitization due to a deleterious effect on lipids and nucleic acids, protein carbonylation, and therefore the involvement of organelles and antioxidant enzymes [

PI3K catalyzes the synthesis of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), wherein the membrane-bound PIP3 serves as a signaling molecule to recruit proteins containing the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. These PH domain proteins, such as the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK) and protein kinase B (AKT) serine/threonine kinases are thus activated and mediate further downstream signaling events. Both PI3K and MAPK are similarly regulated by ROS at the oxidative interface, where protein phosphatases are directly oxidized by ROS, resulting in sustained activation of signaling pathways [
