<p>Inflammatory pain, as a pathological phenomenon, has been established throughout history as a public health problem. There are several pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the complex web of the process. However, the data presented here show that the phytoconstituents of the genus 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> have the potential capacity to modulate different therapeutic targets and those effects could be associated with their antioxidant properties. Several compounds with antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects have been identified. Among them, several prenylated flavonoids that, due to their characteristic structures, have a better interaction with the target molecules. However, the lack of preclinical studies on these compounds and the species of the genus 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> indicates that most of the medicinal potential of this genus has not yet been explored. Likewise, it is necessary to delve into the molecular mechanisms involved in both effects.
