<p>Pain is always associated with the region where the inflammation is located and can become chronic if the inflammation is not relieved quickly [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several mediators are involved in the inflammatory pathway, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, platelet-activating factor, and chemokines [

Likewise, during the inflammatory process reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are also produced along with different proteases that can cause tissue damage, fibrosis, and cell proliferation, which can contribute to the chronicity of inflammation [
