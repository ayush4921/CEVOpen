However, the role of these compounds in inflammatory pain has not been explored. Prenylated flavonoids have a very restricted application due to their lower abundance in the environment. However, the lack of preclinical studies on these compounds present in the species of the genus 
 <italic>Erythrina</italic> indicates that most of the medicinal potential of this genus has not yet been exploited.
