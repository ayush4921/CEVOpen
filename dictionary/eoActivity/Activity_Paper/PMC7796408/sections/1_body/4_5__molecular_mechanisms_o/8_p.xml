<p>The sources that precede the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be both endogenous and exogenous. B (XO) located on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. It catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. The production of xanthine and XO is greatly increased during ischemia, accompanied by the loss of antioxidant enzymes. O

Gout, a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone, is characterized by sudden and intense attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in the joints. Its treatment consists of increasing uric acid excretion or reducing uric acid production [

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) are particularly useful, as they have minor side effects compared to uricosuric and anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs and corticosteroids). However, allopurinol, the only clinically used XOI, also causes side effects such as rash, low blood cells, and hypersensitivity syndrome. In this context, it has been shown that the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>E. stricta</italic> leaves inhibits xanthine oxidase in a concentration-dependent manner. Although in vitro inhibition was moderate compared to allopurinol, at higher doses (21.2 y 100 µg/mL) XO was significantly inhibited. It was suggested that the presence of phenolic and flavonoid content in the extract contributed to the inhibition of XO [

 <italic>E. indica</italic> has a strong activity in the inhibition of XO. Additionally, it has been shown that the methanol extract of the root has an important antioxidant activity and a strong inhibition of NO [
