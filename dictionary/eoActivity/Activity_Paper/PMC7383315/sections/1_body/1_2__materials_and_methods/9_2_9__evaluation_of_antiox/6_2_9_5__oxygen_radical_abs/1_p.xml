<p>The ORAC radical scavenging assay was performed in 96-well microplates according to the method described by Ou [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with some modification. The assay was conducted at 37°C and pH 7.4, with a blank sample in parallel. Trolox standards (1.5 and 0.75 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), fluorescein (4.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) (40 mg/mL) solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4) prior to use. Ethanol or aqueous extracts of PHAF were initially dissolved in DMSO. Reaction volumes of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L containing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 4.8 Μm fluorescein and 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 15.62 and 7.81 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL of different concentrations of ethanol and aqueous extracts of PHAF were preincubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by addition of 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of AAPH (40 mg/mL) to each well to initiate the reaction. The plate was placed on the fluorescent microplate reader (SpectraMax-Gemini EM, Molecular Devices Inc., USA) set with excitation and emission at 494 nm and 535 nm and decay of fluorescein was recorded in 1-minute intervals for 60 minutes. Results were expressed as trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity (mg trolox equivalents per gram of extract) on a dry weight basis.
