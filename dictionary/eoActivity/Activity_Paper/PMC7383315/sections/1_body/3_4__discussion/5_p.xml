<p>In the present study, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> (for both aqueous and ethanol extracts) were significantly lower than that of DPPH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that, in addition to hydrophilic antioxidants, lipophilic antioxidants play a major role in scavenging free radicals. Similar activity is exhibited in many plants such as 
 <italic>Toddalia asiatica, Glinus oppositifolius, Spondias pinnata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aganonerion polymorphum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast, some plant extracts such as 
 <italic>Sonchus asper</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have shown more radical scavenging properties in the DPPH
 <sup>.</sup> assay than in the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> assay.
