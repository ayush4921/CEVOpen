<p>Phenolic compounds and flavonoids are reported to have antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They perform scavenging activity by stabilizing free radicals via their conjugated ring structures and hydroxyl groups [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The high quantity of phenolic and flavonoid contents of PHAF may contribute to its high antioxidant property. Therefore, ethanol extract of this drug has more radical scavenging activity towards both ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and DPPH than aqueous extract of the drug. Similar results have been shown with 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Among the plant metabolites, polyphenols and flavonoids are promising in governing number of bioactivities as antidiabetic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, etc. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, presence of high content of polyphenols and flavonoids may play a major role in proven anti-inflammatory activity of PHAF.
