<p>According to traditional Ayurveda practice, PHAF is administered to patients in the hot water extract form. We, therefore, assayed antioxidant activities for the aqueous extract. However, hot water preparations have some drawbacks, such as unpleasant taste, and have lower stability, requiring them to be prepared freshly on each occasion. To avoid this drawback, it would be better to develop pharmaceutics such as syrups and tonics. Therefore, we also assayed the ethanol extract of PHAF, which exhibited overall higher levels of antioxidant activities than that of aqueous extract (

Ethanol extract is safe compared to other solvent (e.g., hexane, methanol, and acetone) extracts, and one of the targets of the present study is to formulate a modern drug from PHAF. Therefore, antioxidant potential of PHAF was compared with only water and ethanol extracts.
