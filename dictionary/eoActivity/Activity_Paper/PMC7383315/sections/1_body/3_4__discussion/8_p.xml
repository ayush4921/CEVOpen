<p>The ash content is a criterion to judge the identity and purity of crude drugs [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A high acid insoluble ash content is indicative of contamination, substitution, adulteration, or carelessness in preparing the samples for marketing. Acid-insoluble ash indicates contamination with silica, for example. earth and sand [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, the low acid insoluble ash content in PHAF indicates high purity of the drug. Furthermore, very low levels of microbes in PHAF indicate good manufacturing practices during preparation. In addition, heavy metals such as Hg, Pb, As, and Cd were not present in PHAF. The extractable matter value is useful for the evaluation of a crude drug as it gives an idea about the nature of chemical constituents present in the drug. In addition, it is useful for the estimation of chemical constituents soluble in a particular solvent used for extraction [
