<p>Based on preliminary tests, the six compounds were most toxic to 4-d-old 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs. At this time, eggs have turned black. Thus, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the toxicity of fumigation of the sample compounds to the 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs were determined on 4-d-old eggs. Filter paper containing 30 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs was cut and hung in the center of each of the corresponding containers. The treatments were δ-3-carene (6.53–1.68 mg/liter air), γ-terpinene (4.23–1.73 mg/liter air), terpinolene (4.57–1.83 mg/liter air), eucarvone (2.32–0.60 mg/liter air), 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (0.85–0.41 mg/liter air), and methyleugenol (0.89–0.15 mg/liter air) for a 24 h fumigation. After fumigation, the eggs of each treatment group were transferred to a clean container and placed in the breeding room. Three days after the 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs of the control group had hatching, the number of dead eggs of each treatment group was recorded. Unhatched eggs were considered as dead (
