<p>To determine the fumigation LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the sample compounds to adult 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>, 10 pairs of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> adults (1 d old) were released in the each of corresponding containers with δ-3-carene (11.03–5.32 mg/liter air), γ-terpinene (8.38–4.79 mg/liter air), terpinolene (5.13–3.57 mg/liter air), eucarvone (1.27– 0.61 mg/liter air), 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (1.93–1.59 mg/liter air), and methyleugenol (1.81–0.87 mg/liter air) for a 24 h fumigation. After the fumigation, the adults were transferred to a clean container for 24 h recovery, followed by recording the number of dead insects. We gently probed immobile moths with a dissecting needle and those not responding were considered to be dead. Each treatment was repeated three times.
