<p>The indoor breeding and housing methods of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> were similar to those used by 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. (2013)</xref>. 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> adults were confined in a cylindrical container (11 × 10 cm) and fed with water containing 10% honey. The top of the container was closed with nylon gauze (24-mesh). A filter paper was placed on top, which served as an oviposition substrate and facilitated egg collection. After egg hatch, the first instar larvae were inoculated on fresh potatoes (variety Hezuo 88) at a density of 20 larvae per potato (≈130g). The infested potatoes were placed in a mesh cage (35 × 35 × 35 cm
 <sup>3</sup>) in which sterilized sand was provided. Mature larvae emerged from the potato, entered the sand to pupate and the adults emerged. The breeding room conditions were 27 ± 2°C, 50–70% RH, and a 14:10 (L:D) h photoperiod.
