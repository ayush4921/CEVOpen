<p id="Par26">Insoluble glucan synthesized by GTF was measured turbidimetrically. GTF was incubated in 300 μl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1% sucrose, 0.5% dextran T-10, and in the presence or absence of samples at 37 °C for 3 h. The volume of the crude GTF solution used in the assay was determined by absorbance of around 1.0 at 590 nm. Chlorhexidine was used as a positive control [
