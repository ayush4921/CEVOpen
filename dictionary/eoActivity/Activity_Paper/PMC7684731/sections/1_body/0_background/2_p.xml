<p id="Par18">Periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders of bacterial origin that affect tooth-supporting tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Over 700 bacterial species that have been identified in the oral cavity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], only a few are associated with periodontitis, including 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is a gram-negative bacterium closely associated with chronic periodontitis. High numbers of 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, together with other periodontopathogens, induce a host immune response, which in turn leads to a destructive inflammatory process.
