 <italic>Acacia nilotica</italic> (L.) Delile sub 
 <italic>nilotica</italic> (Leguminosae) is a tree found in the central and northern parts of Sudan and is known in Sudanese folk medicine by the common name ‘Garad or Sunt.’ The fruit and the stem bark are regarded as a tonic and astringent and are used internally to treat colds, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and dysentery [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Fractionation of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> leaves and bark showed the presence of phenols condensed tannin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], gallic acid, (+) catechin, (−) epigallocatechin-7-g’allate, catechin derivatives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], ellagic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Parallelly many researches demonstrated its wide array of pharmacological activities, such as anti- HIV-1 protease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], antibacterial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], antioxidant, anticarcinogenic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Sudanese and Indian traditional medicine, gargle the decoction of the 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark is used to strengthens teeth and eliminates toothache [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Even though there is a little investigation on the potential beneficial effects of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark on oral health. Thus, we evaluated the effects of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark methanolic extract and its fractions on the growth of two oral bacteria included 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. We also investigated their GTF inhibitory activity and antioxidant functions for oral hygiene purposes.
