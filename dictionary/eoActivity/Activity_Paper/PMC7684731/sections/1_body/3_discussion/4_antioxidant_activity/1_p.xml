<p id="Par41">The role of antioxidants is to remove harmful oxidants or (ROS) as soon as they form or to repair the damage caused by ROS. Numerous antioxidants have been tried and tested both by systemic administration and as mouthwashes. These include synthetic products like vitamins to natural products like wine and green tea [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Additionally, few studies were carried out on the antioxidant activity of oral hygiene products. Battino et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] showed that a few antioxidant-enriched toothpastes displayed a clear antioxidant activity. In vivo assay, Tamaki et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] stated that the oral administration of resveratrol improves oxidative stress and prevents the progression of periodontitis in a rat periodontitis model. In this study, the antioxidant assay is based on the ability of an antioxidant to scavenge ABTS radicals. It is a simple, rapid and inexpensive antioxidant assay usually used for the evaluation of antioxidant capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The ABTS radical is soluble in water and organic solvents, enabling the determination of the antioxidant capacity of both hydrophilic and lipophilic samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The finding in this study agreed with Sohi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. They stated that pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with gallic acid effectively inhibit lipid peroxidation and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and it was found to be a stronger antiradical than trolox.
