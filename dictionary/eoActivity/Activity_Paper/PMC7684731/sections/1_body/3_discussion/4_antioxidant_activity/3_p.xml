<p id="Par43">Therefore in the present study, we showed that the crude extract of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> and their fractions can affect bacterial and GTF enzyme viability. Furthermore, some fractions showed significant antioxidant activity. The might be proposed mechanisms of action to explain the crude extract or their fractions antimicrobial activities, including direct action on microbial metabolism through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation or inhibition of extracellular microbial enzymes required for microbial growth. Another overlooked advantage of GTF-targeting inhibitors is their potential to possess anti-biofilm activity without being (with less) bactericidal, thus providing alternative methods to prevent biofilm-related diseases with minimal effect on the ecological balance in the microbial community [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] reported that caries antagonistic activity of antioxidants polyphenols had been attributed to three main mechanisms (i) Direct antimicrobial effect by killing the responsible bacteria, (ii) Inhibition of extracellular polysaccharide production, and (iii) Impairment of bacterial adhesion.
