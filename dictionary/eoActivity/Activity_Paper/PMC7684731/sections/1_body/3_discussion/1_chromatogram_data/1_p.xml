<p id="Par38">HPLC analysis is the best way for the chemical profiling of plant extract. The described method showed relatively good separation of specific fractions. Identification of phenolic compounds in methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark was carried out by using the available standards (GA and MG) as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In the present study, Fr1 and F2 contained a GA and mixture GA and MG respectively. These results were in agreement with Sharma et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Leela et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. They isolated and purified GA and MGfrom 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark through open column chromatography and HPTLC. In contrast, Sadiqa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported that quantification of bark extract of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> collected from Pakistan by using HPLC/DAD showed that catechin, isoquercetin, tannic acid and quercetin contained in considerable quantities. However, the gallic acid was found in leaves and pods only. Also, Zhang and Lin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] stated that the broad peaks in HPLC chromatogram spectra indicated that there was a large structural heterogeneity with different degrees of polymerization. Fr4 HPLC chromatogram contains a broad peak after 17 min retention time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This broad peak was suggested to be a mixture of higher molecular weight of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins).
