<p id="Par39">Several authors suggested that the effective antimicrobial agents from herbal extracts along with their derived materials against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria, could form an important part preventing dental caries and periodontal diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Gibbons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] suggested that isolated phytochemicals should have MIC&lt; 1 mg/ml, therefore in this study MIC value of 0.5 mg/ml or less for 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> was considered as a good antibacterial. Even though gram-negative bacteria are more resistant than gram-positive due to the presence of outer membrane, which acts as a barrier to environmental substances, including antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The observed activity of Fr1 and Fr2 against gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>) could be explained by the fact that the active compounds might act by inhibiting the bacterial growth without necessarily penetrating into the bacterial cell itself [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In earlier studies, extracts of the 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> pods displayed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with MIC value of 0.4 mg/ml. Abdel Nabi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] suggested that the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> fruit extract (MIC = 0.05–1.6 mg/ml) was not due to tannins but to another substance(s). 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark and leaves showed good antibacterial activities against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark has been shown to contain simple phenolic compounds like GA and MG, which have often been implicated in antibacterial activity. Deshpande and Kadam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] reported that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark showed activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> with MIC value of 5 mg/ml. The results obtained in this study are similar to Kang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], who reported that both GA and MG had inhibitory effects on the growth of cariogenic (MIC = 8 mg/ml) and periodontopathic bacteria (MIC = 1 mg/ml). Hence, MG and GA might be used to prevent the formation of oral biofilms. However, MG was more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth and formation of 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> biofilm than GA.
