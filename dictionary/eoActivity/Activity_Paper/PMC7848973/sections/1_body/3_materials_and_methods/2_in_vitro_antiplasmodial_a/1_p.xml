<p>The evaluation of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity of the alkaloids (compounds 1 to 3) and semisynthetic analogues (compounds 4 and 5) were performed on the intraerythrocytic 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> Dd2 strain (chloroquine-resistant strain) using a SYBR green1 fluorescence dye assay as described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Compounds 1 to 5 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with no greater than 1% of the total solvent concentration in any assay. Normalized fluorescence signals were measured against controls with 1% DMSO (100% growth) and after exposure to a supralethal concentration (10 μM) of chloroquine (0% growth). Determination of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was performed from a log concentration versus the mean normalized fluorescence signal curve using GraphPad Prism software (v5.0). Each biological replicate consisted of three technical repeats, with three independent biological replicates performed.
