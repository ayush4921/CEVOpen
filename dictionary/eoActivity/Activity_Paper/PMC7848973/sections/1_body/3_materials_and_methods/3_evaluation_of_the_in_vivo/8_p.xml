 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The mice were randomly divided into four groups of six mice per group. Groups 1 and 2 were given 25 and 50 mg/kg of cycleanine, respectively, group 3 was given 1.2 mg/kg of pyrimethamine (positive control), and group 4 was given 10 ml/kg of distilled water (negative control). Administration of cycleanine or the drug continued for three consecutive days. On the fourth day, the mice were inoculated with
