<p>Study on the metabolism of drugs can help to further understand their pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For example, metabolites of piperaquine were shown to have stronger antiplasmodial activity (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, there have been only a few 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism studies of BBIQ alkaloids. Previously, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolites of a BBIQ alkaloid, isoliensinine, from dog hepatic microsomes were identified as 2′-
 <italic>N</italic>-desmethylisoliensinine, 2-
 <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl-isoliensinine, and 2′-
 <italic>N</italic>-6-
 <italic>O</italic>-didesmethylisoliensinine (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The study of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of another BBIQ alkaloid, neferine, indicated that it was partially converted to liensinine, desmethyl-liensinine, isoliensinine, and desmethyl-isoliensinine by CYP2D6 (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Tetrandrine was found to be initially biotransformed to a quinone methide-derived metabolite mediated by CYP3A enzymes, which was then trapped by a glutathione molecule to form a glutathione conjugate in mice (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Metabolism of isotetrandrine 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by the rat hepatic system produced a major metabolite, 
 <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl isotetrandrine (16%), and three minor oxidized metabolites, oxo-isotetrandrine (7%), hydroxy-isotetrandrine (6%), and oxohydroxy-isotetrandrine (7%), via 
 <italic>N</italic>-demethylation and isoquinoline ring oxidation (
