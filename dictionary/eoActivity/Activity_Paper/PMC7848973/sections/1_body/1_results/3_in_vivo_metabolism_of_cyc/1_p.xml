<p>In order to explore the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism of cycleanine, the plasma and urine of Wistar rats following an oral dose of 120 mg/kg body weight/day over a 24-h period were analyzed for cycleanine metabolites. Samples from urine and plasma were prepared and submitted to high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. The peak at the retention time of 9.7 min was cycleanine (M0) with the protonated molecular ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 623.3116 [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> (elemental composition C
 <sub>18</sub>H
 <sub>43</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>) in the positive ion mode spectrum (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In MS/MS, the quasimolecular ion loses a neutral molecular NH
 <sub>2</sub>CH
 <sub>3</sub> fragment to generate an ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 592.2694 also by symmetric cleavage, and breaking C-O and C-C bonds to produce a fragment ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 312.1594, which can also lose C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub> to produce a fragment ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 282.1125. After another C-O and C-C bond cleavage and the subsequent loss of CH
 <sub>3</sub> and OCH
 <sub>3</sub>, fragment ions 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 204.101, 190.0863, and 159.0679 were generated. A fragment ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 400.1907 was also generated by simultaneous C-O bond cleavage and C-C bond cleavage adjacent to the N atom (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and Fig. S2).
