<p>The isolation of the abundant cycleanine (compound 1) in 
 <italic>T. subcordata</italic> root enabled us to investigate its toxicity in healthy mice and efficacy in murine malaria models after infection with 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium berghei</named-content>. The acute median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of cycleanine after 24-h oral administration was determined to be 4.5 g/kg in mice, indicating a good safety profile. The malaria-suppressive activity of cycleanine using two oral doses (25 and 50 mg/kg of body weight/day) following 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> infection was demonstrated through a significant suppression of parasitemia and an increased mean survival time (MST) compared to those of untreated controls (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In particular, the higher dose (50 mg/kg/day) showed efficacy, both in terms of suppression of parasitemia and in MST, comparable to that for chloroquine at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. The prophylactic activity of cycleanine, with the same 25 and 50 mg/kg dosing regimen during 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> infection in mice, was also demonstrated (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At the higher dose (50 mg/kg), cycleanine showed a suppression of parasitemia by 59.0%, only slightly less than that of 76.2% using the prophylactic pyrimethamine control at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg /day.
