<p>The curative activity and MST of mice after initial 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> infection and subsequent treatment with cycleanine (compound 1) were determined. After infection of mice for 3 days, cycleanine was administered at both doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg and mice showed decreasing parasitemia in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner from day 3 to day 7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The speed of killing of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> parasites by chloroquine was much faster than that with cycleanine. Chloroquine reached 0% parasitemia after 5 days, while at that time cycleanine at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg had remaining levels of 13.3 and 10.5%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In this curative model, the MST of mice at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg were 21 and 25 days, respectively, which were significantly longer than that of the control (12 days). However, they were both shorter than that of mice treated with chloroquine (30 days) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
