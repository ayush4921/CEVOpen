<p>In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) report estimated a global burden of 228 million cases accounting for 405,000 deaths (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The majority of this burden fell on the WHO Africa Region, where malaria, particularly that caused by the most virulent etiological agent 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content>, exerts an immense economic impact. While malaria cases and mortality figures continue to fall (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the development and spread of resistance to available chemotherapeutic agents poses a significant threat to malaria treatment and management (

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Artemisia annua</named-content>, sweet wormwood, a traditional Chinese medicine, together with a series of its semisynthetic derivatives, has become the first-line therapy for
