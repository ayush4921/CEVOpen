<p>Bisbenzylisoquinoline (BBIQ) alkaloids are a diverse group of natural products consisting of two benzylisoquinoline groups (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). BBIQ alkaloids are primarily found in the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Berberidaceae</named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lauraceae</named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Menispermaceae</named-content>, and 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ranunculaceae</named-content> plant families. These alkaloids possess a variety of biological activities, which include antimalarial activities (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For example, BBIQ alkaloids isolated and identified from 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Triclisia</named-content> species of the 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> family have antiproliferative activities (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In Nigeria, the root of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Triclisia subcordata</named-content> Oliv. is traditionally used for the treatment of a range of diseases, including malaria (

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. subcordata</named-content> are the BBIQ alkaloids cycleanine (compound 1), isochondodendrine (compound 2) and 2′-norcocsuline (compound 3) (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We have also produced synthetic analogues of cycleanine (compounds 4 and 5) (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The three naturally occurring BBIQ alkaloids, cycleanine (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and 2′-norcocsuline (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) have been reported to possess antiplasmodial effects against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> strains. Despite the promising 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological activity of these natural BBIQ alkaloids, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity of BBIQ alkaloids has not been evaluated, nor has their potential 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism. Here, we assess the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity and metabolism of cycleanine (compound 1). The effect of cycleanine analogues (compounds 4 and 5) on antiplasmodial potency and selectivity is also investigated.
