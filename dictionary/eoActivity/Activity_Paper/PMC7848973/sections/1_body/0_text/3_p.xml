<p>This study sets out an evaluation of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimalarial activities of BBIQ alkaloid compounds 1 to 3 compared to those of two semisynthetic BBIQ alkaloids (compounds 4 and 5) derived by a modification of cycleanine at the C-5 position by introducing additional secondary or tertiary amine moieties in an attempt to increase potential solubility and potency (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The most abundant BBIQ alkaloid in 
 <italic>T. subcordata</italic> extract is cycleanine; this was therefore used to establish 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity in a murine malaria model. In addition, the metabolites and metabolic pathways of cycleanine were analyzed after intragastric administration in rats to help understand how cycleanine is eliminated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to guide future optimization of cycleanine for antimalarial development.
