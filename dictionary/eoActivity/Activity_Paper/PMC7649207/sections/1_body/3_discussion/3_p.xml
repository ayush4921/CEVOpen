<p>The crystal structure of FIP-fve has been reported previously (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and based on the reported protein structure, several homologous FIPs from other origins have predicted their own protein structures. However, based on the sequence alignment results, FIP-mco was homologous only to two reported FIPs (ACA and YZP), whose crystallization structure have not been reported till now. Therefore, it seems impossible to predict the crystal structure of FIP-mco based on available data. Accordingly, structure determination and analysis of FIP-mco will be a new direction for us in subsequent work.
