<p>BLAST results suggested that more than sixteen FIPs share a Fve conserved domain. The Fve protein family showed significant immunomodulatory activity associated with many biologic processes (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Noticeably, there are an exception in the reported FIPs, ACA, YZP, and c13717 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
 </xref>), which share low identities (&lt;10%) to those FIPs from the Fve family. They share a conserved cerato-platanin (pfam07249) domain. Proteins from this family were usually involved in host-pathogen interaction and induction of cell necrosis and phytoalexin synthesis which are part of the defense-related events. Proteins from this family were only founded in filamentous fungi previously (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis revealed two major lineages that significantly distanced from each other. The results suggested that the FIPs could be divided into two groups. At present, only three immunomodulator proteins with cerato-platanin conserved domain have been reported, more evidence or homologs need to be characterized in this new protein family. In this paper, FIP-mco possessed the conserved cerato-platanin domain. It is a new member of the family. The inspiring discovery of FIP-mco means a great progress in the study of the young protein family branch in FIPs. In 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH genome, BLAST results suggested the absent of conventional FIP homolog, however, a candidate (scaffold3t326) which shows significant identity (&gt;40%) to ACA and YZP were chosen for analysis of heterologous expression and biological activity.
