<p>In previous reports on FIPs, they exist as dimers in a dumbbell-shaped structure similar to that of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chains, but they exhibit diverse activities (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It is reported that most FIPs can induce the expression of many cytokines. The recombinant ACA (rACA) has previously been demonstrated to have a LPS-mimetic proinflammatory response toward RAW 264.7 macrophages, and can induce TNF-α and IL-1B production within murine peritoneal macrophages (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). FIP-glu can enhance the transcription of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-γ, and TNF-α (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). FIP-gts (
 <italic>Ganoderma tsugae</italic>) can induce cytokine secretion, and FIP-gaps enhances IL-2 and IFN-γ release from mouse lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, FIP-gmi from 
 <italic>Ganoderma microsporum</italic> exhibits the effect of down regulation of TNF-α (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The induction effect of FIPs on some certain cytokines suggests that they are immune stimulants and can strengthen the immune response of its host, while the down regulation effect suggests they can mitigate inflammatory response.
