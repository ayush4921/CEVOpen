<p>Molecular mechanisms of FIPs on modulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines have been reported rarely. It has been previously reported that the expression of TNF-α was closely related with the activation of NF-κB pathway in macrophage cells (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In order to make clear how the expression levels of cytokines are modulated, the NF-κB signaling pathway was studied in this paper. The results demonstrated that rFIP-mco reduced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines by suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway. The regulating mechanism is similar to the report of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), in which the anti-inflammmatory properties of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 were also mediated through regulating the NF-κB pathway. In the biological activity study of ACA, ACA directly activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in murine macrophages (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Combined with the above different cytokine expression levels enhanced or reduced by different FIPs, it indicated that FIPs from different origins may activate or suppress the NF-κB pathway. When FIPs have the function of activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, the expression levels of some cytokines may be induced. While FIPs have the function of suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway, the expression levels of some cytokines may be reduced. To illustrate definite and clear regulating molecular mechanisms of FIPs on this aspect, the expression levels of more cytokines need to be studied, and more FIPs need to be characterized in this family. As for the reduction effect on inflammatory cytokines by rFIP-mco, it showed that rFIP-mco could mitigate inflammatory response and possessed significant anti-inflammatory effect. The character endowed FIP-mco the prospect of anti-inflammatory medicine development.
