<p>The FIP-mco encoding gene was synthesized, cloned into yeast pPICZαA vector, and was successfully expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> X33. SDS-PAGE revealed a monomer form of the recombinant protein, whose size conformed to the calculated molecular weight of 13.57 kDa. FIPs from the Fve family tend to polymerize in the N-terminal α-helices and form as dimer in solution, therefore, both monomer and dimer form can be observed during expression (
