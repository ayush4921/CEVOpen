<p>In recent decades, an immunomodulatory component from mushrooms, fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP), has been a new area due to its potential applications in anti-tumor, anti-anaphylactic, and immunomodulatory activities (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). FIPs are a type of small protein (110–114 amino acids, approximately 13 KD) which possesses immunomodulatory function. FIP-fve was first reported in 
 <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic>. At present, there are at least twenty FIPs been reported (

 </xref>) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). FIPs lack His, Cys and Met residues but are rich in Asp and Val residues (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). They share a Fve conserved domain (PF09259). FIPs are considered as a T cell activator which can stimulate several important cytokines and molecular factors (IL-2, IL-3, IFN-γ, and TNF-α etc.), and can inhibit progression or migration of several kinds of cancer cells (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, homologous FIPs from different sources could display diverse activities and anti-tumor mechanisms, for example, FIP-gts from 
 <italic>Ganoderma tsugae</italic> induces premature senescence of A549 lung cancer cells, while LZ-8 from 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> increases A549 G1 arrest, and FIP-sch3 (FIP from 
 <italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>) induces A549 apoptosis and inhibits migration (
