<p>The low yield of native FIPs extracted from mushrooms is a major limitation in the application of FIPs, and there’s neither report about the native FIP nor its recombinant expression and immunomodulatory studies in 
 <italic>M. conica</italic>. Therefore, in this paper, FIP-mco, was first obtained from the precious rare edible fungus 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH sequenced by our lab. The 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expression system was employed to successfully express the recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco). The phylogenetic analysis of FIP-mco indicated that FIP-mco is evolutionarily more closed to YZP, ACA, and APP. They share a relatively conserved amino acid sequence and functional similarity, suggesting that this cluster of FIPs could be characterized as a novel immunomodulatory family. The protein rFIP-mco could suppress the proliferation of human A549 and HepG2 cancer cells significantly at the concentration of 15 and 5 μg/ml, and could remarkably inhibit the migration of A549 and HepG2 cancer cells at the concentration of 15 and 30 μg/ml respectively 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Through cell cycle and apoptosis assay in A549 and HepG2 cancer cells, it was found that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells. Further, rFIP-mco could significantly reduce the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. The immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities will surely render 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH high pharmaceutical and economical values.
