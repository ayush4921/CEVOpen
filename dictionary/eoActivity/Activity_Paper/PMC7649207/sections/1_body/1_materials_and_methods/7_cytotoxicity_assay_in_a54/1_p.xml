<p>The Cell-Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) was utilized to evaluate the viability of A549 and HepG2 cells according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan). Twenty-four hours after seeding cells in 96-well plates, different concentrations of rFIP-mco (5, 15, 30 μg/ml) were delivered for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days. Complete medium (100 µl) along with CCK-8 solution (10 µl) was used to replace the medium in each well followed by a 60-min incubation at 37°C. A Multiskan Spectrum (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL, USA) was utilized to measure the absorbance at 450 nm.</p>
