<p>Apoptosis assay was performed using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences). Briefly, A549 and HepG2 cells were harvested using trypsin after treatment with rFIP-mco at the concentration of 0, 5, 15, and 30 μg/ml for 48 h, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 1 × Binding Buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Solution (100 μl) was transferred into a 5-ml culture tube, and then 5-μl PI and 5-μl FITC Annexin V were added. After incubated for 15 min at 25°C in the dark, 400-μl 1×Binding Buffer was added to each tube and stained cells were analyzed by FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p>
