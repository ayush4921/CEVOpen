<p>To evaluate the immunomodulatory bioactivities of rFIP-mco, the levels of induced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 released from the THP-1 cells were detected. The THP-1 cells were prepared, recovered and cultured in 6-well plates with 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 24 h. RFIP-mco was added into the THP-1 cell culture which was pretreated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at the concentration of 0, 5, 15, and 30 μg/ml, respectively. After 24 h of incubation, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the supernatants were detected using ELISA Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&amp;D, Minnesota, USA). Ultimately, the absorbance was determined with a microplate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;D, D6050), Human IL-1β Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;D, DLB50), Human TNF-α Quantikine ELISA Kit were all purchased from Dakewe. The THP-1 cell culture without adding rFIP-mco and cells added with 30 μg/ml rFIP-mco were used as control.
