<p>FIP-mco was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For SDS-PAGE, 20-µl supernatant of the culture transformed with pPICZαA-fipmco was mixed with 6 × loading buffer, boiled and centrifuged before electrophoresis. The sample was then loaded onto 12% resolving acrylamide gel. After 120 V, 60-min electrophoresis in the separation gel and 80 V, 20 min in the concentrated gel, the gel was subjected to staining with Coomassie brilliant blue G250. The supernatant of 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> X33 without the recombinant plasmid was used as control. For Western blotting, it was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Bio-Rad, California, USA). The protein resolved in SDS-PAGE was transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk and washed using TBST for three times, the membrane was incubated with 1:500 diluted anti-6×His rabbit polyclonal antibody (Concentration: 0.6 mg/ml, D110002, Sangon, Shanghai, China) as the primary antibody with gentle agitation at 37°C for 1 h, and then incubated with 1:8,000 HPR-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Concentration: 0.2 mg/ml, D110058, Sangon, Shanghai, China) as the secondary antibody at 37°C for 1 h while gently agitated, finally stained with TMB (TMB color reagent B solution).
