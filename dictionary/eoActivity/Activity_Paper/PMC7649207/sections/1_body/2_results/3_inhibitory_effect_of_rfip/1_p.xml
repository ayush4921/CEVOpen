<p>By CCK-8 assay, effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cell proliferation was observed at different concentrations (5, 15, 30 μg/ml). The proliferation of the cells could be suppressed at all the set concentrations. At the concentration of 15 μg/ml, rFIP-mco can remarkably inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells (

 </xref>). Treatment of A549 cells with 15 μg/ml rFIP-mco for 48 h and 72 h resulted in inhibition by 6.91% and 14.48%, respectively. At the concentration of 5 μg/ml, rFIP-mco can remarkably inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells (

 <sub>50</sub> values of rFIP-mco in A549 and HepG2 cells were also determined, which were 22.35 and 16.51 μg/ml, respectively (

  <bold>Figures 4C, D</bold>
 </xref>). The results indicated that rFIP-mco could be used as a potent tumor inhibitor in A549 and HepG2 cells, and rFIP-mco showed a stronger effect in HepG2 cells.
