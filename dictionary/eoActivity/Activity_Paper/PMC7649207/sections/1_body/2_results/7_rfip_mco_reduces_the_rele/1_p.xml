<p>To determine the molecular mechanism of the reduced expression level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 induced by rFIP-mco, the relative nuclear level of NF-κB p65 subunit and the cytoplasmic level of IκBα were determined by Western blot analysis. The nucleic p65 level was significantly enhanced, while IκBα was degraded apparently in the cytoplasm of THP1 cells. The increase of p65 expression and IκBα degradation was remarkedly blocked by the treatment with 30 μg/ml rFIP-mco (
