<p>By transwell and wound healing assay, effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cell migration and invasion was observed. At the concentration of 15 μg/ml, rFIP-mco could significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of A549 cells (

 </xref>). At the concentration of 30 μg/ml, rFIP-mco could remarkably inhibit the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells (

  <bold>Figures 5C, D</bold>
 </xref>). It showed that rFIP-mco could both inhibit the migration and invasion of the two cancer cells, indicating the application prospect of rFIP-mco as antitumor therapeutic adjuvant. In the test of rFIP-mco’s effect on migration and invasion, the result was different to the proliferation inhibit effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cells, in which HepG2 cells were more sensitive to rFIP-mco. The migration and invasion of A549 cells were inhibited by rFIP-mco at a relative low concentration compared with HepG2 cells. It displayed a more potent inhibition effect in A549 cancer cells in the migration and invasion assay.
