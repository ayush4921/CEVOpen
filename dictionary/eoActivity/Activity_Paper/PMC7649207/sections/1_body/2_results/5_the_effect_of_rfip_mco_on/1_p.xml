<p>In order to explore the potential mechanism of the proliferation inhibitory effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cells, cell cycle, and apoptosis assay in the two cancer cells were conducted. The analysis of cell-cycle distribution revealed that rFIP-mco significantly decreased the percentage of S-phase cells and increased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells, indicating that the increase amount of rFIP-mco caused a G0/G1 arrest in A549 and HepG2 cells (

 </xref>), indicating that the addition of rFIP-mco induced cell apoptosis of A549 and HepG2 cells. The effect of rFIP-mco on cell apoptosis was more significant in HepG2 cells than that in A549 cells. These data imply that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells.
