 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences of selected FIPs. 24 amino acid sequences (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
    <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
   </xref>) were analyzed. The evolutionary relationship between FIPs were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method, and Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model was used to compute evolutionary distances. The numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap support values (%). The scale bar represents 0.5 substitutions per site.
