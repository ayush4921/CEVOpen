  <p>Amino acid sequence alignment of FIPs with cerato-platanin motif. The alignment was performed by MUSCLE. ACA and YZP were from 
   <italic>A. camphorata</italic> and 
   <italic>T. versicolor</italic>, respectively. Other FIP-like proteins, 
   <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, 
   <italic>L. edodes</italic>, 
   <italic>L. tigrinus</italic>, 
   <italic>C. cinerea</italic>, 
   <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, and 
   <italic>M. conica</italic> SH, were selected by genome mining using the sequences of ACA and YZP as baits. NCBI accession numbers are addressed in brackets. Amino acids residues are colored according to their physicochemical properties, alphatic/hydrophobic (residues ILVAM) - rose; aromatic (FWY) - orange; positive (KRH) - dark blue; negative (DE) - red; hydrophilic (STNQ) - light green; conformationally special (PG) - magenta; cysteine (C) - yellow. Bar above amino acids residues represent consensus level, and consensus amino acid residues were labeled by asterisk. Secondary structure predictions are shown under the sequences, cylinders represent α helices, arrows represent β sheets, and straight lines represent random coils. Amino acid residue positions are numbered in last row.
