Phylogenetic analyses of FIPs from different origins were performed using Neighbor-Joining method. It was found that FIP-mco belonged to a new branch of the FIP family and may evolved from a different ancestor compared with most other FIPs. The cDNA sequence of FIP-mco was cloned and expressed in the yeast <italic>Pichia Pastoris</italic> X33. The recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco) was purified by agarose Ni chromatography and determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. The protein rFIP-mco could significantly suppress the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively, and inhibited the migration and invasion of human A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 30 &#x003bc;g/ml respectively <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, rFIP-mco can significantly reduce the expression levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 in the THP1 cells (human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells). In order to explore the potential mechanism of the cytotoxicity effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cells, cell cycle and apoptosis assay in the two cancer cells were conducted. The results demonstrated that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells. Molecular mechanism of rFIP-mco&#x02019;s reduction effect on the inflammatory cytokines was also studied by suppression of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. It showed that suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is responsible for the reduction of inflammatory cytokines by rFIP-mco. The results indicated the prospect of FIP-mco from <italic>M. conica</italic> SH as an effective and feasible source for cancer therapeutic studies and medical applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fungal immunomodulatory protein</kwd><kwd>FIP-mco</kwd><kwd>rFIP-mco</kwd><kwd><italic>Morchella conica</italic> SH</kwd><kwd><italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> X33</kwd><kwd>anti-tumor</kwd><kwd>immunomodulatory</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="6688"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Edible mushrooms are famous for their highly nutrient constitution, as well as their tonic and medicinal values in medical applications. In recent decades, medicinal mushrooms has aroused much attention for their antitumor, immunomodulating, antiviral, hypocholesterolemia, and hepatoprotective activities (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many bioactive components isolated from edible mushrooms have been studied, including polysaccharides, terpenoids, lectins, proteins, and organic compounds (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). They have been isolated not only from fruiting body but also the mycelium, and possess various chemical characteristics and biological effects on immune cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Morels</italic> (<italic>Morchella</italic> spp.) are precious rare edible fungi famous for their delicious taste and rich nutrients. True morels are ascomycetous fungi with high reputation for their edibility and appearance, which is similar to &#x0201c;a sponge on a stick&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Due to their unique flavor and nutritional value, these morels have been used in soups and gravies, as a source of medicinal adaptogens, immunostimulants, and potential anti-tumor agents (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is also widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat indigestion, excessive phlegm and shortness of breath (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p><italic>Morchella conica</italic> is an edible mushroom belonging to the genus <italic>Morchella</italic>. It prefers humid areas covered by deciduous and coniferous forests subjected to seasonal flooding (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been consumed as tasted food. Despite the popularity of morels, the difficulties of culturing wild <italic>M. conica</italic> make them very expensive in food markets (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). On its molecular study, several components isolated from <italic>M. conica</italic>, including polysaccharides, have been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antioxidant activities. For example, a kind of polysaccharide NMCP-2 from <italic>M. conica Pers</italic>. shows antioxidant activities against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in human embryonic kidney cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another two kinds of polysaccharides from <italic>M. conica</italic> demonstrate their inhibition on nitric oxide production in macrophages (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, numerous aspects of their biological features such as life cycle and ecology remain poorly understood, especially little is known on molecular study of the species.</p><p>In recent decades, an immunomodulatory component from mushrooms, fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP), has been a new area due to its potential applications in anti-tumor, anti-anaphylactic, and immunomodulatory activities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). FIPs are a type of small protein (110&#x02013;114 amino acids, approximately 13 KD) which possesses immunomodulatory function. FIP-fve was first reported in <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic>. At present, there are at least twenty FIPs been reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold></xref>) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). FIPs lack His, Cys and Met residues but are rich in Asp and Val residues (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). They share a Fve conserved domain (PF09259). FIPs are considered as a T cell activator which can stimulate several important cytokines and molecular factors (IL-2, IL-3, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b1; etc.), and can inhibit progression or migration of several kinds of cancer cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, homologous FIPs from different sources could display diverse activities and anti-tumor mechanisms, for example, FIP-gts from <italic>Ganoderma tsugae</italic> induces premature senescence of A549 lung cancer cells, while LZ-8 from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> increases A549 G1 arrest, and FIP-sch3 (FIP from <italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>) induces A549 apoptosis and inhibits migration (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>To our best knowledge, until now, ten FIPs have been extracted from fruit body or mycelium: LZ-8, FIP-fve, FIP-vvo, FIP-gts, ACA, APP, PCP, FIP-her, FIP-gts, and YZP. Eleven FIPs have been identified using homologous cloning method: FIP-cve, FIP-gap1, FIP-gap2, FIP-gat, FIP-gja, FIP-gmi, FIP-gsi, FIP- tvc, FIP-cru, FIP-gat, and LZ-9. As the development of Next Generation Sequencing, genome mining has been applied as a new tool for searching potential FIPs. FIP-nha, FIP-bbo, FIP-sch2, FIP-sch3, FIP-lrh, FIP-dsq2, c13717, FIP-vv082, and FIP-ppl were cloned directly by genome mining.</p><p>The low yield of native FIPs extracted from mushrooms is a major limitation in the application of FIPs, and there&#x02019;s neither report about the native FIP nor its recombinant expression and immunomodulatory studies in <italic>M. conica</italic>. Therefore, in this paper, FIP-mco, was first obtained from the precious rare edible fungus <italic>M. conica</italic> SH sequenced by our lab. The <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expression system was employed to successfully express the recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco). The phylogenetic analysis of FIP-mco indicated that FIP-mco is evolutionarily more closed to YZP, ACA, and APP. They share a relatively conserved amino acid sequence and functional similarity, suggesting that this cluster of FIPs could be characterized as a novel immunomodulatory family. The protein rFIP-mco could suppress the proliferation of human A549 and HepG2 cancer cells significantly at the concentration of 15 and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml, and could remarkably inhibit the migration of A549 and HepG2 cancer cells at the concentration of 15 and 30 &#x003bc;g/ml respectively <italic>in vitro</italic>. Through cell cycle and apoptosis assay in A549 and HepG2 cancer cells, it was found that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells. Further, rFIP-mco could significantly reduce the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 by suppressing the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. The immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities will surely render <italic>M. conica</italic> SH high pharmaceutical and economical values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Strains and Media</title><p><italic>M. conica</italic> SH was collected from a local farm affiliated to Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yunnan Province, China. <italic>M. conica</italic> SH was sequenced with a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy.

Proteins from this family were usually involved in host-pathogen interaction and induction of cell necrosis and phytoalexin synthesis which are part of the defense-related events. Proteins from this family were only founded in filamentous fungi previously (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis revealed two major lineages that significantly distanced from each other. The results suggested that the FIPs could be divided into two groups. At present, only three immunomodulator proteins with cerato-platanin conserved domain have been reported, more evidence or homologs need to be characterized in this new protein family. In this paper, FIP-mco possessed the conserved cerato-platanin domain. It is a new member of the family. The inspiring discovery of FIP-mco means a great progress in the study of the young protein family branch in FIPs. In <italic>M. conica</italic> SH genome, BLAST results suggested the absent of conventional FIP homolog, however, a candidate (scaffold3t326) which shows significant identity (&#x0003e;40%) to ACA and YZP were chosen for analysis of heterologous expression and biological activity.</p><p>The crystal structure of FIP-fve has been reported previously (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and based on the reported protein structure, several homologous FIPs from other origins have predicted their own protein structures.

Therefore, it seems impossible to predict the crystal structure of FIP-mco based on available data.

The protein rFIP-mco can remarkably inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells at the concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml, which is a relative low effecting concentration reported to date. The effect of rFIP-mco was especially apparent in HepG2 cells, which was similar to that of some FIPs such as rFIP-nha (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the determination of the effect on cell viability of the THP1 cells by rFIP-mco at different concentrations, it was found that cell viability of the THP-1 cell was almost not affected. About the different effects of rFIP-mco on A549, HepG2, and the THP-1 cells, the possible cause may be that THP-1 belongs to a kind of blood malignancy while A549 and HepG2 belong to solid tumor. The functional targets for rFIP-mco may be different in different cancer cells, or may express higher in A549 and HepG2 cancer cells while expressing lower or with no expression in the THP1 cells. This also conforms to previous report, which demonstrates that the biological activities of FIPs are quite varied despite high sequence and structure conservation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It was considered to be associated with the structural differences at the loop DE and loop FG (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Moreover, structural differences at the N- terminal &#x003b1;-helix region may be also an important factor in cell surface recognition (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Besides, we also studied the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cancer cells. The results showed that the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cancer cells may be inhibited through G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis. According to previous report, rFIP-ppl (rFIP from <italic>Postia placenta</italic>) could effectively induce MGC823 and HepG2 tumor cell apoptosis in a dose dependent manner, and the apoptotic effects were cell specific (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which was in accordance with the result in this study. As the increase of the concentration of rFIP-mco, the ratio of apoptotic cells also went ascend. At the concentration of 30 &#x003bc;g/ml, the effect on HepG2 apoptotic cells are more significant, which is consistent with the result of cytotoxicity assay. Moreover, rFIP-mco can apparently repress A549 and HepG2 cancer cell migration and invasion, and rFIP-mco showed a stronger effect on the migration and invasion of A549 cells compared with that on HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated potential application prospect of FIP-mco as antitumor therapeutic agent both in cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.</p><p>In previous reports on FIPs, they exist as dimers in a dumbbell-shaped structure similar to that of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chains, but they exhibit diverse activities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

On the effect of TNF-&#x003b1;, rFIP-mco exhibits reduction activity, which is similar to the effect of FIP-gmi on TNF-&#x003b1;, suggesting rFIP-mco can inhibit inflammatory response. Diverse bioactivities of FIPs from different origins may indicate that they have different immunomodulatory mechanisms while binding to the cytokines. ACA from <italic>Auricularia polytricha</italic> enhances the production of TNF-&#x003b1; by LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). YZP can induce the production of IL-6 and IL-10 in B cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Although FIP-mco, ACA and YZP belong to a new branch of the FIP family, the inflammatory activities they displayed were different. According to the reports (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), different responses to FIPs may be associated with small changes in protein structure and folding, to the formation of homo-, di-, tri-, and tetra-mers of rFIPs, or might be relevant to the post-translational modification, all of which can possibly affect receptor binding. As previously referred, different biological activities to cancer cells by FIPs may be related to the structural differences at the loop DE and loop FG. Significant conformation changes were observed between FIP-fve and LZ-8 at the two loop regions of the fibronectin type &#x00399;&#x00399;&#x00399; (FN&#x00399;&#x00399;&#x00399;) domain which may be potential active sites, while the loops of FN&#x00399;&#x00399;&#x00399;-containing proteins are also usually involved in the recognition of cytokine receptors (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). To elucidate the divergence, it is essential to determine the crystal structure of FIP-mco which is already underway now.</p><p>Molecular mechanisms of FIPs on modulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines have been reported rarely. It has been previously reported that the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; was closely related with the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in macrophage cells (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In order to make clear how the expression levels of cytokines are modulated, the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway was studied in this paper. The results demonstrated that rFIP-mco reduced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines by suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. The regulating mechanism is similar to the report of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), in which the anti-inflammmatory properties of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 were also mediated through regulating the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. In the biological activity study of ACA, ACA directly activates the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway in murine macrophages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Combined with the above different cytokine expression levels enhanced or reduced by different FIPs, it indicated that FIPs from different origins may activate or suppress the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. When FIPs have the function of activating the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, the expression levels of some cytokines may be induced. While FIPs have the function of suppressing the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, the expression levels of some cytokines may be reduced. To illustrate definite and clear regulating molecular mechanisms of FIPs on this aspect, the expression levels of more cytokines need to be studied, and more FIPs need to be characterized in this family. As for the reduction effect on inflammatory cytokines by rFIP-mco, it showed that rFIP-mco could mitigate inflammatory response and possessed significant anti-inflammatory effect. The character endowed FIP-mco the prospect of anti-inflammatory medicine development.</p><p>As reported in FIP-nha and LZ-9, it is concluded that each FIP has its own unique bioactivity profile (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In our study, it also demonstrated this point. They are diversified in biological activity and possess independent features, behind which the possible cause in structure differences is very interesting. For subsequent work, further study on rFIP-mco using animal models is underway. Further function mechanism of FIPs on cancer cells and cytokines is also an interesting aspect and deserves deep study on crystal structure. As a new member of the branch family of FIPs, the found and biological activity determination of FIP-mco from the precious rare edible mushroom <italic>M. conica</italic> SH has enormous research and application value. It will promote the study of the protein divergence in the FIP family, the molecular mechanism of FIPs on cytokines and cancer cells. FIP-mco possesses wide application prospect as antitumor adjuvant in medical and pharmaceutical area, and also in health care and food industry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets presented in this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplementary Material</bold></xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>GW and YS carried out the study and drafted the manuscript.
