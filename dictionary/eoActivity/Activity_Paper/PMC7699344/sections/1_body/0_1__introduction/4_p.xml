<p>While BJO and its molecular components are medicinally active, they have a poor solubility in aqueous solutions, which has motivated the development of 
 <italic>B. javanica</italic> oil emulsion (BJOE) systems that enable improved solubility [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. BJOE samples are composed of oil extracts isolated from 
 <italic>B. javanica</italic> fruit together with a naturally sourced lipid emulsifier [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To date, intravenously administered BJOE has been used clinically, including in China, as a standalone treatment [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in combination with radiotherapy [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or chemotherapeutic drugs [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to improve cancer treatment efficacy and enhance immune functions [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, BJOE still has shortcomings, such as a relatively low bioavailability of medicinally active compounds, physicochemical stability issues, and potential administration side effects such as blood vessel irritation and adverse immune reactions [
