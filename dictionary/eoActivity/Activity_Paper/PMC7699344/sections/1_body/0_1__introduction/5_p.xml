<p>Such challenges have spurred ongoing efforts to develop innovative nanomedicine strategies that harness the medicinal activity of BJO and its molecular components with nanoparticle carriers. Key examples of promising nanostructures in various stages of development include nanoemulsions, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, and spongosomes, which can help to improve bioavailability, controlled release, physicochemical stability, drug loading, and encapsulation efficiency. The objective of this review is to cover the latest progress in the field, starting with an overview of the pharmacological properties of BJO and its molecular components, followed by a critical presentation of various types of cutting-edge nanomedicine strategies and how they are being utilized to deliver BJO and purified quassinoids.</p>
