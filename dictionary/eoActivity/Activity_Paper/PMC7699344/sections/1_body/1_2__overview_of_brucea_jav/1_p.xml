<p>BJO is mainly extracted from 
 <italic>B. javanica</italic> seeds, and the major molecular components are various fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, including around 63% oleic acid and 21% linoleic acid in free and mono-, di- and triglyceride forms, along with medicinally active quassinoids in lower concentrations [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While oleic acid and linoleic acid constitute a large fraction of BJO contents by mass, quassinoids are present in lower concentrations but exhibit a rich diversity and can have highly potent biological activities. To date, over 100 quassinoids have been identified in BJO [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Certain classes of quassinoids, such as bruceines, brusatols, and bruceosides, typically exhibit high levels of biological activity [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this section, we introduce four representative types of medicinal activity that BJO and its molecular components exhibit. Schematic illustrations of these activities are presented in
