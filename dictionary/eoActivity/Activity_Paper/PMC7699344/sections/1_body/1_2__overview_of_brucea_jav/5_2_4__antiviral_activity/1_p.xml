<p>Plant viruses are a major threat to agricultural production [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and have led to the exploration of quassinoids from BJO as a potential antiviral solution. Crude extracts of BJO were first reported to inhibit tobacco mosaic virus (
 <italic>TMV</italic>) infection and replication [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A follow-up study tested different BJO fractions and identified that the BD quassinoid had a particularly high antiviral activity against 
 <italic>TMV</italic>, could be used as a foliar spray to inhibit the systemic 
 <italic>TMV</italic> infection of plants, and also inhibited potato virus Y (
 <italic>PVY</italic>) and cucumber mosaic virus (
 <italic>CMV</italic>) [
