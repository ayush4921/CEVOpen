<p>Using a leaf-based assay, Ryu et al. further investigated the antiviral properties of various quassinoids to inhibit pepper mottle virus (
 <italic>PepMOV</italic>), which affects pepper plants (
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> spp.) and can impair pepper production quality and yield [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It was discovered that a BJO extract and various quassinoids therein, including brucein A, inhibited the 
 <italic>PepMOV</italic> infection of plant leaves based on a fluorescence reporter assay, in which case 
 <italic>PepMOV</italic>-infected leaves exhibited fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light. In marked contrast to this result, leaves treated with BJO extract or brucein A quassinoid did not exhibit fluorescence, indicating an effective antiviral activity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot data further indicated the lack of viral coat protein for the treated samples, in alignment with the negative control data without virus and in contrast to the virus-only positive control data.
