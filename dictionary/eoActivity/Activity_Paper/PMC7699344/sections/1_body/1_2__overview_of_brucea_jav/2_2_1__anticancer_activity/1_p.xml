<p>Since BJO has been shown to have clinical prospects as a cancer treatment option, there have been intensive experimental efforts to investigate the anticancer activity of BJO. Accordingly, BJO has been shown to inhibit leukemia [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] cancer cells in vitro. BJO can exhibit anticancer activity by multiple mechanisms, including by inducing cancer cell apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been discussed how BJO-induced cancer cell apoptosis can involve the upregulated expression of caspase enzymes associated with programmed cell death and the downregulated expression of other important biological machinery components [
