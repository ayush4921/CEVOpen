<p>Huang et al. reported that BJOE could have therapeutic benefits in an experimental rat model of Crohn’s disease and inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines [

These experimental results have been obtained using BJOE in various animal models, while there have also been efforts to better understand which molecular components are responsible for therapeutic effects. For example, it has been identified that components such as the quassinoid brusatol (BR) can be useful for treating inflammatory diseases [
