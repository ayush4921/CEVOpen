<p>NoorShahida et al. extracted various fractions of medicinally active compounds from BJO and observed that the oral or intraperitoneal administration of BJO fractions could reduce blood glucose levels in normoglycemic mice [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further investigation revealed that the extracted fraction that contained the BD quassinoid had the greatest effects, which prompted the isolation and further examination of BD. Dose-dependent reductions in the blood glucose levels of normoglycemic mice upon intraperitoneal administration of BD were observed. Notably, to achieve a reasonable solubility, the BJO fractions and isolated quassinoids had to be formulated with the organic solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer chains, highlighting the need to further develop effective delivery strategies, as discussed below.
