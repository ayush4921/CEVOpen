<p>While it has long been suggested that BJO is useful for treating diabetes mellitus [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], more recent work has investigated which molecular components in BJO are responsible for antidiabetic activity. Ablat et al. tested fractions of a BJO extract—which contained different molecular components that had been separated by using various solvents with distinct polarities—to evaluate the therapeutic activity in a rat model of diabetes and identified that certain fractions could reduce blood glucose levels along with more favorable insulin and glycogen results and decreased levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammation [
