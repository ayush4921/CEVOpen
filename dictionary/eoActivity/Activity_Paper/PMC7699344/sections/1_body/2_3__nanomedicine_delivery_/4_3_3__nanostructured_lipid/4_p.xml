<p>Expanding on this concept, Li et al. developed pH-responsive lipid nanoparticles with liquid crystalline properties, which were loaded with BJO and doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used anticancer medication [

The lipid nanoparticles (termed LCNPs for lipid crystalline nanoparticles) were composed of BJO and DOX plus monoolein and oleic acid, and they exhibited pH-dependent morphological properties, including inverted hexagonal, cubic, and emulsified microemulsion phases at pH 7.4, 6.8, and 5.3, respectively (
