<p>Lv et al. developed an NLC carrier based on a combination of solid- and liquid-phase lipids and other materials to encapsulate BJO [

The mixture was processed using high-pressure homogenization, resulting in the formation of BJO-loaded NLCs with a typical diameter of around 182 nm. The NLCs exhibited a high physical stability after a 30-day storage, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified that the NLCs were mainly spherical or moderately elongated (

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments supported the presence of a dense particle core and the loading of BJO within the particles rather than on the particle surface. These morphological observations were consistent with the measured encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading values of 99% and 10%, respectively. These values indicated a high loading performance, which was attributed to defects within the crystal structure [
