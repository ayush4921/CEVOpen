<p>The pH range around which the LCNPs exhibited morphological changes was relevant to the conditions found near and in tumor microenvironments, and the rate of in vitro release of DOX from the dual-loaded DOX-BJO LCNPs depended on the solution pH. An appreciably quicker release rate was observed at pH 5.3 vs. pH 7.4, and it was noted that the presence of a liquid crystalline structure tended to slow down the drug release (

In vitro cell cytotoxicity testing against a human breast cancer cell line revealed that blank LCNPs had no inhibitory activity, while LCNPs containing DOX and BJO had a more potent inhibitory activity than free DOX and BJO in combination without the nanocarrier. Importantly, the LNCPs also enabled inhibition against previously DOX-resistant cancer cells.
