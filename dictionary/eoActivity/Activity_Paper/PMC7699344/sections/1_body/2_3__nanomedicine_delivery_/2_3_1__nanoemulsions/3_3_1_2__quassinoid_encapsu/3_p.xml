<p>The in vivo pharmacokinetics of BD in the nanoemulsions vs. free BD in an aqueous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution were compared upon oral administration of a 3-mg/kg dose in rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05414-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). The nanoemulsion formulation yielded a more than twofold higher maximum concentration of BD in plasma compared to the aqueous BD suspension, along with a longer circulation half-life of around 2.6 h vs. 1.5 h. In a rat model of chemically induced colitis, 0.75-, 1.5-, and 3.0-mg/kg doses of the BD nanoemulsions were orally administered and improved clinically relevant disease parameters, for instance through reductions in diarrhea, bloody stool, and colon mucosal damage as well as the prevention of colon length shortening (

The results were comparable to or exceeded those of azathioprine (AZA), which is a medication used to treat colitis and various other ailments. The BD nanoemulsions also reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppressed oxidative stress associated with colon inflammation.
