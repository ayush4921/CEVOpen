<p>There has also been an ongoing exploration of sponge-type nanocarriers that are called spongosomes, which are liquid crystalline lipid nanocarriers that exhibit a high encapsulation efficiency and controlled release, and that can protect active ingredients from degradation. Spongosomes typically lack a solid inner core structure, which allows them to function as spongy materials, and they are endowed with stabilizing molecules on the outer surface to support colloidal stability [

Compared to liposomal carriers that also lack a solid, inner core and are filled with an aqueous medium, a useful advantage of the sponge-like architecture of spongosomes is that it can encapsulate a wider range of drugs with varying hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.
