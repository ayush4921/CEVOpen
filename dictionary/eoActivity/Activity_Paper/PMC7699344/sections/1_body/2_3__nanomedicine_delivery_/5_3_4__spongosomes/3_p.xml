<p>In another effort, Chen et al. reported the development of poly(ethylene glycol)-coated spongosomes that encapsulated both BJO and baicalin (BAI), which is a small-molecule flavonoid with anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The coloaded spongosomes had a relatively large polydispersity, with the two main populations of sponges exhibiting around 60- and 310-nm diameters, respectively. Cryo-TEM images of spongosomes without drug, spongosomes containing BAI only, and spongosomes containing both BJO and BAI are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05414-f006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ€“C, and they support that the internal region of the spongosomes consisted of sponge-like lipid assemblies. In the presence of BJO, the encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading values of BAI were maintained at around 70% and 19%, respectively, and remained stable over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05414-f006">Figure 6</xref>D). The spongosome vehicle also helped ensure the controlled release of BAI, while the inclusion of BJO had a modest tendency to improve the amount of released BAI (
