<p>BJOE formulations have demonstrated clinical utility as a means of utilizing the medicinal activities of BJO for anticancer applications. However, BJOE formulations have drawbacks, such as low bioavailability, physicochemical stability issues, and potential administration side effects, as described above. To overcome these issues, nanoparticle carriers have been widely explored to improve solubility and formulation properties, increase bioavailability, and extend circulation time [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Extensive progress has been achieved in recent years with various classes of self-assembled nanostructures, which have been utilized to encapsulate not only BJO but also purified molecular components with a high medicinal activity, such as particular quassinoids. The latest results are described below and organized according to nanostructure class. Where applicable, the results are divided between nanomedicine strategies that utilize whole BJO vs. purified quassinoids extracted from BJO.
