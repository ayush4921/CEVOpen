<p>Yue et al. also investigated the effects of BJO liposomes on cancer cells in vitro and reported a greater inhibitory activity compared to that of a BJOE sample tested in parallel [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The higher potency of the BJO liposomes also translated into better success at preventing intrahepatic metastasis in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. A fivefold lower dose of intraperitoneally administered BJO-loaded liposomes inhibited intrahepatic metastasis by almost 99%, while the BJOE sample only demonstrated a 75% inhibition.
