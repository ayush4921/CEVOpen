<p>There is also a significant opportunity to further explore how nanomedicine formulations of quassinoids might be used treat additional types of diseases, since quassinoids have been shown potentially useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy [

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Since quassinoids are found in a wide range of plants, the nanomedicine delivery strategies discussed herein could be further explored to encapsulate various types of seed oils and purified quassinoids with distinct medicinal activities. Such possibilities would open the door to developing broadly effective nanomedicine delivery strategies that could combine the benefits of naturally evolved molecules with targeted biological functions and nanoparticle carriers with tunable structural properties in order to realize new application opportunities across human medicine, biotechnology, and agricultural science.
