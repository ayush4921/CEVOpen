<p>While there has long been interest in harnessing the medicinal properties of BJO and its molecular components in order to treat a wide range of medical diseases, recent progress in nanomedicine strategies has greatly advanced the field by realizing the potential to not only improve the solubility of BJO and its molecular components but also to achieve greater performance outcomes in terms of treatment efficacy and pharmacological properties. To date, a large number of proof-of-concept studies have been performed with many different types of nanoparticle-like delivery vehicles, and the results have set important precedents, especially with nanoemulsions.
