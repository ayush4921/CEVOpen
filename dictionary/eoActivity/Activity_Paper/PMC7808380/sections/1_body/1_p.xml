<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic> were collected in Haiyuan County of Ningxia province, China (105°38′E, 36°21′N) and dried with silica gel. The voucher specimen was stored in Sichuan University Herbarium (JQ13383018). Total genomic DNA was extracted with a modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) and a 350-bp library was constructed. This library was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system with 150 bp paired-end reads. We obtained 10 million high quality pair-end reads from 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic>, and after removing the adapters, the remained reads were used to assemble the complete chloroplast genome by NOVOPlasty (Dierckxsens et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>S. insignis</italic> was used as a reference. Plann v1.1 (Huang and CronK 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and Geneious v11.0.3 (Kearse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) were used to annotate the chloroplasts genome and correct the annotation.
