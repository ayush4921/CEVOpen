<p id="par0035">Remdesivir® possessed broad activity against RNA viruses; many research groups assessed its antiviral activity both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, validating its activity against coronaviruses. Its antiviral activity was confirmed against SARS, MERS zoonotic coronaviruses, as well as the circulating human coronaviruses HCoV−OC43 and HCoV-229E, which cause common human cold. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and preclinical 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models supported the effectiveness of Remdesivir® against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. These include a recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study of Remdesivir® assessing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 using qRT-PCR quantification of viral copy number in infected Vero E6 cells. This study demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 770 nM and an IC
 <sub>90</sub> equal to 1760 nM (with cytotoxic concentration &gt;100 mM). The mechanism of action of Remdesivir® is attacking a weak point of viral replication within the host, such as targeting the divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The chemical structure for Remdesivir® resembles adenosine one (
