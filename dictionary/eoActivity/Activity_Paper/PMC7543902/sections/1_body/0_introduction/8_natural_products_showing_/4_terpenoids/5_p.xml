<p id="par0150">In another study, 221 phytocompounds were evaluated for their activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using a cell-based assay measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6 cells. Twenty tested compounds exhibited significant levels of anti-SARS-CoV activity at 10 μM with no cytotoxicity against Vero E6 cells. Due to its pivotal role in the SARS-CoV life cycle, the 3CL protease is a key target for discovery of anti-SARS- CoV agents [
