 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ) were shown to be potent inhibitors of SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> by virtue of high-throughput screening of a natural product library (approx. 720 compounds) [

 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. According to the results obtained, the extracts from Pu-erh tea and black tea were the most potent inhibitors of SARS protease [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It was also reported that bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections could be neutralized by theaflavins extracted from black tea [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 34.7 μg/mL. The findings also corroborate the presence of an inactivation activity (
