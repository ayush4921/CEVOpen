<p id="par0130">The inhibitory activities of chalcones and coumarins isolated from the edible 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> against SARS-CoV proteases (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) were determined (cell-free/based) [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Xanthoangelol E (

 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), exhibited the most inhibitory activity against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 11.4 and 1.2 Î¼M [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Data suggested that chalcones exhibited competitive inhibition to the SARS-CoV 3 CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and noncompetitive inhibition to the SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>.
