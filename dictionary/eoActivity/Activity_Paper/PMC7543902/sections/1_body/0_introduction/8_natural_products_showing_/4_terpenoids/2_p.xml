The assay results indicated the highly influence of the antiviral activity with small differences in the structural features of the tested compounds. Among the friedelane derivatives tested, two epimers, 3

 <italic>α</italic>-friedelanol, with difference orientation at C-3 that affected dramatically their antiviral activity while epitaraxerol (
