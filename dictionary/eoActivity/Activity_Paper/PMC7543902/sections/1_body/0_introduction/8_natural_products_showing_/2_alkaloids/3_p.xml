 <bold>1</bold>) has been used in China as an antihypertensive drug. In 1970s, tetrandrine (
 <bold>1</bold>) underwent a phase I clinical trial as an antitumor drug in US. Although tetrandrine is not in clinical use in countries other than mainland China, it has been used in research worldwide showing to have multiple pharmacological activities including immunosuppression, antihypertensive, and antitumor activities. Tetrandrine had a synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents; 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel in two gastric cancer cell lines [
