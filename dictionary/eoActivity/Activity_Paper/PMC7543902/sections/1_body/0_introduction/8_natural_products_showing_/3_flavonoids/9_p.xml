<p id="par0105">The most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity was shown by an aglycon of baicalin, baicalein (
 <bold>16</bold>), with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.39 μM. Studies of several analogs have demonstrated the potentiality of additionally four flavonoids as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These potent inhibitors include scutellarein (
 <bold>14</bold>), which is largely distributed in genera 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Erigerontis</italic>, and shows IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.8 μM against SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The other three remaining flavonoid compounds are myricetin (
 <bold>13</bold>), dihydromyricetin (
 <bold>17</bold>), and quercetagetin (
 <bold>18</bold>). They were respectively constituents from 
 <italic>Ampelopsis japonica</italic> (Bailian in Chinese), 
 <italic>Eriocaulon buergerianum</italic> (Gujingcao in Chinese) and 
 <italic>Polygoni avicularis</italic> (Bianxu in Chinese), and possess inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV- 2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.20, 1.24, and 2.86 μM [
