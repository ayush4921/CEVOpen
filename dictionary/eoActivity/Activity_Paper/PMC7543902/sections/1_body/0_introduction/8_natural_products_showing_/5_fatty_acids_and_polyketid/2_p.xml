 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> and its constituents exhibit various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-influenza activities. The ethanol extract of the stem bark of 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> exhibited PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity. Nine diarylheptanoids were identified; platyphyllenone, hirsutenone (
 <bold>30</bold>), platyphyllone, platyphyllonol-5-xylopyranoside, hirsutanonol, oregonin, rubranol, rubranoside B (
 <bold>31</bold>), and rubranoside (
 <bold>32</bold>) (
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The isolated compounds were tested against SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> using a continuous fluorometric assay, where six diarylheptanoids showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against the PL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Compounds 
 <bold>30</bold> and 
 <bold>31</bold> exhibited modest activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 8.0 and 9.1 μM. These compounds also were tested using recombinant 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> expressed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, where compound 
 <bold>32</bold> exhibited stronger 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition than the other derivatives with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>M.
