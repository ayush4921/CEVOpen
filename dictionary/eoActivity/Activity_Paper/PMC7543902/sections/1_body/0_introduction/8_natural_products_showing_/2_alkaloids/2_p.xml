<p id="par0050">Several alkaloids have shown antiviral activity, for example, Kim et al. 2019, showed that 
 <italic>bis</italic>-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as, tetrandrine (
 <bold>1</bold>), fangchinoline (
 <bold>2</bold>), and cepharanthine (
 <bold>3</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic> and other related species of 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic>, (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ) to have potent activity against human coronavirus OC43 infection. Interestingly, 
 <italic>bis</italic>-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are enriched in several well-known edible plants such as 
 <italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic> (lotus) which is widely cultivated in Asia [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Tetrandrine (
 <bold>1</bold>) and fangchinoline (
 <bold>2</bold>) showed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against human coronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The expression levels of the 
 <italic>S-</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic>-proteins in MRC-5 lung human cells infected with HCoV−OC43 at two days’ post-infection were significantly diminished and virus replication was suppressed by the action of alkaloids 
 <bold>1-3</bold>. These alkaloids did not show cytotoxic effects on MRC-5 cells up to 10 μM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of tetrandrine (
 <bold>1</bold>), fangchinoline (
 <bold>2</bold>), and cepharanthine (
 <bold>3</bold>) were 0.33 ± 0.03, 1.01 ± 0.07, and 0.83 ± 0.07 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This in turn demonstrated that tetrandrine (
 <bold>1</bold>), fangchinoline (
 <bold>2</bold>), and cepharanthine (
 <bold>3</bold>) inhibited HCoV−OC43 at the early stage of infection which is mainly due to suppression of the replication of HCoV−OC43 virus [
