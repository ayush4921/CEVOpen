 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> root is a Chinese herb frequently used for the prevention of SARS during the SARS outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The main components of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root are the alkaloids; indigo (
 <bold>5</bold>), indirubin (
 <bold>6</bold>), and indican (indoxyl-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside) (
 <bold>7</bold>), and the allyl glucosinate, sinigrin (
 <bold>8</bold>) (

 <bold>5</bold>) and indirubin (
 <bold>6</bold>) were identified as the promiscuous chymotrypsin inhibitors [

 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] characterized the anti-SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> effect of the water extract of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> root-derived compounds. Of the five compounds that were tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, sinigrin (
 <bold>8</bold>) and indigo (
 <bold>5</bold>) showed dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activities of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in cell-free and cell-based assays. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the cell-free assays were 121 μM for sinigrin and 300 μM for indigo. The cell-based assay indicated that sinigrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 217 μM) was more efficient in blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> than indigo (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 752 μM). Sinigrin (
 <bold>8</bold>) is a component in many edible plants of the 
 <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> family, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. In seeds of 
 <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (mustard seeds) sinigrin 
 <bold>(8)</bold> is found in high concentration, mustard has been used for centuries by mankind for its culinary, as well as various medicinal properties [
