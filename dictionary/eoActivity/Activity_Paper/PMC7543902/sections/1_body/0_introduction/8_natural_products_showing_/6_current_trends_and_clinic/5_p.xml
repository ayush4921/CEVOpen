<p id="par0185">Desferrioxamine B (DesferalÂ®) is produced by 
 <italic>Streptomyces pilosus</italic> and the only siderophore currently marketed (DB00746). It is produced by the fermentation of 
 <italic>S. pilosus</italic> and is used therapeutically in patients with iron and aluminum overload [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and in current clinical trials for its antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be influenced by iron, hence, decreasing the availability of iron may inhibit HIV-1 replication, where deferoxamine is capable of forming catalytically inactive iron-chelator complexes [
