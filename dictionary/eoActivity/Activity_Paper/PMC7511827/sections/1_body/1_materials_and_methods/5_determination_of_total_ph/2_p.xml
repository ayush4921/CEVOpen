<p id="p0035">The total phenolics content in methanol and aqueous extracts of the spices were determined according to the Folin–Ciocalteu procedure (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Singleton et al., 1999</xref>). About 4 mg of the dried crude extract was mixed with 5 ml 80% acetone, shaken well in a vortex-shaker and centrifuged at 2,200 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask with a Pasteur pipette. The remaining residue was extracted twice with 2.5 mL 80% acetone, shaken well in a vortex-shaker, centrifuged as before after standing for 5 min and the supernatants were transferred to the same 10 mL volumetric flask with a Pasteur pipette. Aliquots (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of supernatant from each sample were put into a 10 mL volumetric flask and mixed with 1.9 mL deionized water. Folin–Ciocalteu–phenol reagent (1 mL) was added and the solution was shaken vigorously and mixed with 5 mL sodium carbonate (20%). After 20 min, the solution was centrifuged at 2,200 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 735 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC) and the results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents from a gallic acid standard curve (mg GAE/100 g
