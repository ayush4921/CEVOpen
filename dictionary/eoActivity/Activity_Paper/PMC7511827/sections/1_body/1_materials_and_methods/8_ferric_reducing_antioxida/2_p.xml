<p id="p0055">The reducing powers of the extracts and the positive standard controls were determined by using the potassium ferricyanide reduction method (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oyaizu, 1986</xref>). Extracts (0.5 mL) of the different concentrations (i.e., 10–1000 μg/mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) that were made by reconstituting in respective solvents were mixed with 2.5 mL of (0.2 M) sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide [K

 <sub>3</sub> (1%) was added in each test tube and incubated at 35 °C for 10 min. The formation of Perls Prussian color was measured at 700 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC). Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates increased reducing power. Ascorbic acid and Butyl Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) were used as standard antioxidants.
