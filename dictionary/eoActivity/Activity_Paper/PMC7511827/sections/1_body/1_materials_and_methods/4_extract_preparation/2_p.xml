<p id="p0030">The plant samples (leaves and seeds) were first separately washed using tap water, rinsed with distilled water and dried in an oven (Bluefic, India) (at 40 °C, 96 h) to a constant weight. The dried samples were then pulverized using mortar and pestle. The powder of each spice (50 g) was extracted (in triplicate) by separately dissolving in 250 ml of methanol and distilled water for 24 h. After 24 h of soaking, the extract was filtered using Whatman no.1 filter paper and the filtered solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph rotary evaporator, Laborata 4001) at 55 °C to remove the solvent and the dried extract was then stored in the refrigerator (at 4 °C) until analysis.</p>
