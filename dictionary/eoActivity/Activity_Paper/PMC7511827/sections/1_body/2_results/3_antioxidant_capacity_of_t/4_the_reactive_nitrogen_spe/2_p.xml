<p id="p0090">There was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 199.968) difference between antioxidant source in Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) inhibition potential at each concentration level examined. The RNS inhibition potentials of all spices were significantly lower when compared with standard antioxidant compounds, which are, BHT and catechin. Antioxidant capacity of BHT was on a par with catechin at the highest concentration, but appeared to be lower than catechin at the lower concentration levels. The RNS inhibition potentials of the spices varied significantly (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 222.414) between extract concentrations and inhibitory effect appeared to increase in a concentration dependent manner. Extraction solvent used to get the extracts had also significantly impacted (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 1, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 15.470) RNS inhibition potential of each spice whereby some spices had higher potential when extracted with methanol than aqueous, whereas the reverse is true for other spices (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> A and B). Though correlations are positive between RNS inhibitory effects of both methanol and aqueous extracts, they were insignificant (r

 <italic>F</italic> = 92.821) varied between spices in RNS inhibition potential in a decreasing order of their potential,

 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> (IC

 <sub>50</sub> values of 386.02 ± 3.81 and 387.44 ± 4.2 μg/mL, respectively.
