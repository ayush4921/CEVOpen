<p id="p0085">The reducing capacity of the tested spices are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> A and B. There was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 29.977) difference between antioxidant source in reducing ferric ion (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to ferrous ion (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) at each concentration level examined. The reducing potentials of the spices varied significantly (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 67.465) between extract concentrations. Extraction solvent used to get the extracts had also significantly impacted (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 1, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 14.758) reducing potential of each spice whereby some spices had higher potential when extracted with methanol than aqueous, whereas the reverse is true for other spices. Among the tested spices, methanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic> exhibited better reducing power than other spices, and at the highest concentration tested it was also found to be superior to standard antioxidants in its reducing capacity. Next to 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic>, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> or 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> was more effective in reducing Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup> depending on the extraction solvents used to extract them. Strong positive correlation was observed between total phenolic contents of aqueous extracts and ferric reducing capacity (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.942, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .017). Similarly, positive correlation was found between ferric reducing capacity of methanolic extracts and total phenolic contents, but values are not significant (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.620, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).
