<p id="p0105">There are various methods that are used to determine the antioxidant potentials of plant extracts. The results to be obtained may of course be different from method to method due to the complexity of chemicals in the extracts leading to varying sensitivity to the test employed (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Prior et al., 2005</xref>). In this study we used three tests viz. DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine) radical scavenging assay, RNS inhibition assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power. The DPPH assay is a low cost method, which has frequently been used to evaluate the antioxidative potential of various natural products of plant origin (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). In our study, the methanol extracts of all the spices exhibited antioxidant property compared to the control (solution without plant extracts), which had 0% DPPH radical scavenging activity. At some concentration levels, some spices demonstrated better or equivalent antioxidative potential as reference antioxidants (BHT and AA). Generally speaking, however, scavenging activities of all spices' extracts and reference antioxidants increased with increasing concentrations, suggesting an increased ability of the extracts to donate hydrogen ions to the radical (

In our study, a strong and significant positive correlation was observed between total phenolic content and DPPH scavenging activity of both the methanol and aqueous extracts of the tested spices. The positive correlations obtained from our study support the hypothesis that DPPH radical scavenging activity is attributed to phenolic concentration. Previously, many researchers (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Soulef et al., 2020</xref>) have shown strong positive correlation between antioxidant activity and phenolic contents in plant structure. The antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds owes to their redox properties which help them act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors and/or singlet oxygen quenchers (
