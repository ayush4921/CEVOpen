<p>Microbial metabolites are essential resources for drug discovery (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Lenzi et al., 2018</xref>). Compared with other natural product resources, fungi have the following advantages. First, there are enormous fungal species: about 120,000 fungal species have been described (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Hawksworth &amp; Lucking, 2017</xref>) and 5.1 million fungal species are estimated (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell, 2011</xref>). Second, fungi produce broad and diverse secondary metabolites with a vast difference in chemical structures (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Pham et al., 2019</xref>). Third, large-scale fermentation can generate a large amount of fungal secondary metabolites, which was exampled by the production of alcohol and lactic acid. However, yield of many target fungal secondary metabolites is restricted by fungal growth and differentiation (

 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Keller, 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Pham et al., 2019</xref>), which is resolved by new technologies that enable us to engineer a fungus to produce a specific compound in high yield by modifying its metabolic pathways (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk &amp; Wang, 2016</xref>). Also, the recent development of genomic sequencing technology and the identification of more biosynthetic gene clusters accelerate the discovery and application of new compounds from fungi (
