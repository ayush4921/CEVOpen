<p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria threaten public health (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Todd, 2017</xref>). We screened potential antibiotics from this newly established fungal library against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We randomly picked 574 fungal extracts and examined their activity in inhibiting Gram-positive (methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MRSA) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>) bacterial pathogens. These fungi were isolated from samples collected in late 2017. Among them, 47 inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MRSA (hit rate of 10.8%), and one inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> (hit rate of 0.17%, 
 <xref rid="table-6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The hit rate of antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria was higher than that of the Gram-negative bacteria, which is consistent with the well-known challenges in antibiotic discovery against gram-negative pathogens. Gram-negative pathogens have unique outer membrane and efflux pumps (
