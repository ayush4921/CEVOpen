<p>To maximize the diversity and quantity in our fungal library, we selected fungal colonies based on their location, color, and morphology on culture plates. Therefore, the fungal isolates in the library look strikingly different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This visible criterion facilitates the fungal library construction. However, we also discarded many fungi that are different species with similar morphology. We examined the species diversity of our fungal library at the molecular level by randomly picking 40 fungal isolates. Their genomic DNA was isolated, the ITS regions were amplified, and PCR products were sequenced. These sequences have been deposited into GenBank at

We searched these sequences against NCBI DNA databases using blast. Results show that about 12.5% of total fungal isolates have identical ITS sequences to others in the library (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For instance, 126-G10, 117-B9, and 45-F10 have identical ITS to 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, and 2 of 3 might be duplicates. Strains 99-H5 and 78-D10 have identical ITS to 
 <italic>Penicillium sclerotiorum</italic>. More than 80% of fungal isolates belong to different species or strains, indicating the fungal library is highly diverse. A small portion (&lt;12.5%) are duplications of the other. Based on these ITS sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed, displaying the fungal diversity in samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information">File S1</xref>). Three genera (
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic>) present in three big branches, which is consistent to our sampling sources, e.g., soil and plants. 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> are the most prevalent soil fungi and many are associated with plants (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Harman et al., 2004</xref>). 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> is ubiquitous genus with more than 350 species already identified (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Visagie et al., 2014</xref>).
