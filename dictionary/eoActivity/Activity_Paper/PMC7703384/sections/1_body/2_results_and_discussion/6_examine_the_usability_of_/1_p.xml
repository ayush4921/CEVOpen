<p>Finally, we studied the possibility of obtaining drug candidate leads against chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), a malignant tumor of the blood system (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kaleem et al., 2015</xref>). A small subset of endophytic fungi from Chinese medicinal plants was used for this purpose. Fifty extracts were examined for their inhibition against the human immortalized myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 using the MTT method. The final concentrations of crude extracts were 20 µg/mL. The results from triplicates showed that 4 extracts (#17, #22, #29, #35) significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information">File S4</xref>). The hit rate of the plant-fungal metabolite library was 8%. Notably, the survivorship of K562 cells with extract #29 was about 24.8% compared with the control, e.g., the inhibition of extract #29 on K562 proliferation was as high as 75.2%. The specimen of #29 was from the fungus (

 <italic>Litsea glutinosa</italic> has been used to treat diarrhea, traumatic injuries, mumps, and rheumatism. It contains abundant flavonoids, terpenes, and alkaloids, and has good antibacterial activity, immunomodulatory effect, and anti-tumor effect. We PCR-amplified the ITS region of the fungal candidate (#29) and sequenced the region. Based on the ITS region sequence (Accession # at GenBank:
