<p>Forty fungal ITS sequences in FASTA format were input into an online multiple sequence alignment tool (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Higgins &amp; Sharp, 1988</xref>). The parameter “DNA” was selected for input sequence and “ClustalW” was selected as output format. All other parameters were kept as defaults. Multiple sequence alignment was conducted by clicking on “Submit”. After alignment was completed, the tab of “Phylogenetic Tree” was clicked and the checkbox “Real” was selected for “Branch length” to visualize the phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree was saved as a pdf file through “print” under “File”.
