<p>A subset of fungal extracts, randomly selected, were tested for the antibacterial activity to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (ATCC 9199), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 14775), methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA, ATCC BAA-44) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (AS17tolc). The drug-screening was performed in a 384-well microplate format using the following procedures. Bacteria were cultured in 50 mL Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) in a 150-mL flask overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the cells were first OD
 <sub>600</sub> adjusted to 0.1 and then further diluted 1:100 in MHB, and a volume of 50 µL (∼10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU) is added to each well of the 384-well sterile microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fungal extracts (0.5 µL in DMSO) were then added to each test well at a final concentration of 40 µg/mL. The plates were incubated for 18–20 hr at 37 °C. At the end of this incubation, resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the wells to determine the growth of bacteria. The final concentration was 0.02%, and the plates were further incubated for 4-6 hr at 37 °C. In the presence of viable cells, resazurin was reduced to resorufin (pink) along with an increase in fluorescence (

Extracts showing antibiotic activity (hits) were scored as those that prevented the color change and also reduced the fluorescence (Ex 540, Em 590nm) by 90% when compared to the control wells containing no inhibitor. Ciprofloxacin was used as a positive control for bacterial growth inhibition. Three wells were used for each sample. For the positive candidate extracts, we repeated the experiments at least once to confirm the results.
