<p>For each soil sample, we transferred 50 mg soil to a 1.5 mL plastic tube, and one mL autoclaved distilled water was added. The sample was vortexed for 30 secs and centrifuged at 500 g for 2 min (min) to get rid of the soil particles. For plant samples, the first step was to sterilize the plant surface by rinsing the sample with distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O, then soaking in 70% ethanol for 10 s (sec) and rinsing again with distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O. After sterilization, the plants were cut into 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm pieces and transferred into a sterile mortar. Then, two mL of distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O was added, followed by grinding with a pestle for 1–3 min and the slurry was transferred to a 1.5 mL plastic tube and then centrifuged at 500 g for 2 min to get rid of the particles. About 100 µL of upper supernatant from treated soil or plants was evenly spread onto a 100 × 15 mm Petri Dish plate containing 14 mL Malt Extract Agar (MEA), made of 10 g malt extract, 1 g yeast extract, 15 g agar, and 0.05 g chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 1 L distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. The plates were sealed with parafilm, and the fungi were allowed to grow for 7–14 days at room temperature (RT) with cycles of 12 h (hr) of darkness and 12 hr of light.
