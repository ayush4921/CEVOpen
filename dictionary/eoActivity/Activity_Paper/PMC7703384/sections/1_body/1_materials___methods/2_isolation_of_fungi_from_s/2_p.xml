<p>The fungal colonies on the MEA medium plates were picked with a toothpick and inoculated in a new MEA plate by streaking. If the colonies were mixtures of two or more species, we kept inoculating and streaking until a single colony appeared. Finally, a piece of fungal agar containing mycelium or spores was cut and transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 500 µL of sterile 20% glycerol in distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O. We stored the cells in a −80 °C freezer for long-term storage.
