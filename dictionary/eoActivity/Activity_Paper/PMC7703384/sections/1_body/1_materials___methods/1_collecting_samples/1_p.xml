<p>We collected plant and soil samples from different regions around the world. The field collection was approved by the United States Department of Agriculture with permit number of P526P-18-03319. The soil samples were taken in 5–10 cm depths under the surface. Plant samples consisted of the whole plant or separated plant parts such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, or various combinations of components. Samples were stored on ice or in a 4 °C fridge immediately after collection. No samples were more than 5 g. Most of samples collected by authors, residents, and friends were mailed to labs and processed locally. For instance, samples collected in China and Myanmar were shipped to Guomin Niu’s lab in Guangdong, China to process. Samples collected in the US were processed at Jun Li’s lab in Florida, USA. The fungal extracts form the GFEL library.</p>
