<p>Cell proliferation was analyzed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) using Vybrant
 <sup>®</sup> MTT Cell Proliferation Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the human immortalized myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Around 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells in 100 µL culture medium (RPMI 1640 + 2mM glutamine + 10% fetal bovine serum) were seeded in 96-well microplates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The next day, one µL fungal extract in DMSO was added (final concentration of the fungal extract was 20 µg/mL), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for another 24 hr. Next, the microplate was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to pellet the cells, the medium was carefully removed as much as possible, and 100 µL of fresh medium was then added. About 10 µL of the 12 mM MTT stock solution was added, mixed, and incubated for 4 hr at 37 °C. The microplate was centrifuged again at 500 g for 10 m. After removing 75 µL of the medium from the wells with 25 µL medium with cells left, 50 µL of DMSO was added to each well, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to dissolve formazan crystal for measurement. The same amount of DMSO without drugs was applied as a control. The optical density was measured at an absorbance wavelength of 540 nm. Cell growth inhibition rate (%) = (A
 <sub>540</sub> of control −A
 <sub>540</sub> of treatment/ A
 <sub>540</sub> of control) ×100%. Triplicates were conducted for each sample.
