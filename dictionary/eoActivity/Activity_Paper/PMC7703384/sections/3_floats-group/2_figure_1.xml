  <title>Worldwide localization of samples, distribution of collected fungi in different climate zones, and some fungal morphology.</title>
  <p>(A) Samples were collected worldwide, indicated by red dots. (B) Distribution of the collected fungi in different climates zones. The climate classification was based on the Köppen–Geiger Climate Classification. The codes of the climate are as the following: Aw: Tropical monsoon climate; Bsk: Cold semi-arid climate; Cfa: Humid subtropical climate; Cfb: Temperate oceanic climate; Cwa: Monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate; Cwb: Subtropical highland climate or Monsoon-influenced temperate marine climate; Dfb: Humid continental climate; Dwa: Monsoon-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate; Dwb: Monsoon-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate. (C) Morphology of some isolated fungal colonies in the library.</p>
