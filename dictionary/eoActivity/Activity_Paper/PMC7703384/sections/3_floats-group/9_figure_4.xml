  <title>Anti-chronic myeloid leukemia screening results.</title>
  <p>About 50 extracts of endophytic fungi isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant-fungal metabolite library were examined against K562 cells using the MTT method. The results show that 4 extracts (#17, #22, #29, #35) significantly inhibited the growth of K562 cells (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Notably, the survivorship of K562 cells with extract #29 was about 24.3% compared with the control, or the inhibition of extract #29 on K562 was 75.7%. DMSO was applied as the control. The data shows the means and standard deviations of triplicates.
