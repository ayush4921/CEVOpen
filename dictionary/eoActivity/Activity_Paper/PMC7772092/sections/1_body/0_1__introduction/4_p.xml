<p>Quinoline and pyrimidine are important scaffolds for anti-HIV drugs. Hameed et al. designed and synthesized quinoline-based chalcones as HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. Molecular docking studies were performed for the synthesized compounds to determine their binding affinity in the active site of the enzyme. HIV-RT bioassay was used to access the biological activity of the synthesized compounds and to verify the results of molecular docking studies, which indicated that chloro- and bromo-substituted quinoline-containing compounds showed potent cytotoxicity against HIV-RT [5]. Anti-HIV drug-like elvitegravir is a quinoline derivative, whereas efavirenz contains a benzoxazine (quinoline-like) scaffold. Rilpivirine, etravirine, and dapivirine possess a pyrimidine scaffold [6]. Pyrazole is also an important scaffold of anti-HIV drugs. The pyrazole ring as the core structure enhances the solubility and bioavailability of anti-HIV agents [7,8]. Quinoline and pyrimidine derivatives reported as NNRTIs are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively [9â€“18].</p>
