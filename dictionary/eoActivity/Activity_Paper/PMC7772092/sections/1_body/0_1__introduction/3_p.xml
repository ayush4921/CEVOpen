<p>Drug discovery is a very long and costly procedure. It requires 10â€“15 years and billions of dollars to discover a new drug. CADD tools significantly reduce time and monetary investment in drug discovery. Molecular docking is one of the most important tools of CADD used in drug discovery today to understand drug-receptor interactions, the binding affinity of drugs, and orientation of drug molecules to the target site. This helps in better prediction of activity and reduction in side effects, and is a rational approach to drug design [4].</p>
