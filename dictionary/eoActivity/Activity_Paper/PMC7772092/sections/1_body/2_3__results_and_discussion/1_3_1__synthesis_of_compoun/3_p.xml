<p>In one of the series, pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized from chalcones using guanidine hydrochloride, benzamidine hydrochloride, and methyl guanidine hydrochloride. The reaction proceeded by Michael addition to the chalcones, followed by proton transfer, cyclization via Claisen addition, hydrolysis, and spontaneous dehydration, as described in Figure 3. In the other series, pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized from chalcones using substituted phenylhydrazine hydrochloride as shown in Figure 4.</p>
