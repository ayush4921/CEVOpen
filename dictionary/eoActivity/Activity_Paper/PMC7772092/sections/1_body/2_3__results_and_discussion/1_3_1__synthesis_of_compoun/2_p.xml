<p>Chalcones were synthesized by the Claisen–Schmidt condensation reaction as described in Figure 2. Mechanistically, base-catalysed Claisen–Schmidt condensation was characterized by the formation of an enolate ion of the ketone [32]. This enolate ion acting as the nucleophile attacked the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde, in the process rendering to the electron-rich ion, which took up the proton from the aqueous solution. The final step of the reaction was dehydration, which produced the chalcone.</p>
