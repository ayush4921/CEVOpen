<p>A mixture of chalcone (2a or 2b) (0.50 mM), substituted guanidine hydrochloride (0.80 mM) and sodium carbonate (1.34 mM) was dissolved in DMF (3 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight at 90 Â°C with stirring. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC using pet ether:ethyl acetate (7:3) as a mobile phase. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled and extracted with water and ethylacetate. The product obtained was evaporated and purified by column chromatography and recrystallized by DCM and ethanol [21].</p>
