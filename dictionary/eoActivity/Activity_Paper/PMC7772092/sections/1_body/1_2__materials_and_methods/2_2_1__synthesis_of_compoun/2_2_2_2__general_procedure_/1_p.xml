<p>2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1 mM)Â was added to substituted acetophenones (1 mM). After adding 5mL ethanol, the mixture was stirred until the reactants were completely dissolved. Then, 20% NaOH (1mL) was added by drops to it. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the precipitate that appeared was filtered, washed with water, dried, and recrystallized using ethanol and DCM. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC using petroleum ether:ethyl acetate (7:3) [20].</p>
