<p>Chalcone (0.50 mM) was added to substituted phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (0.80 mM). After adding 5 mL methanol, the mixture was stirred until the reactants were completely dissolved. The reaction was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 4–5 h at 50–60 °C. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC using pet ether:ethyl acetate (7:3). After 4–5 h, precipitate appeared, which was filtered and washed with water. The filtered precipitate was dried and purified by column chromatography and recrystallized by methanol and DCM [22]. The synthesized compounds are shown in Table 3.</p>
