<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extracts or components isolated from the species has been repeatedly evaluated, confirmed, and ascribed to different phytochemicals from its composition. In a rat model, H. J. Jacker et al. (1981) showed that a triterpene saponin fraction administered i.v. at a low dose (1.25–2.5 mg/kg) caused a significant decrease of edema, as measured by pletysmograph [

 <xref rid="B115-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Although J. Metzner et al. (1984) reported some anti-inflammatory effect for leiocarposide (200 mg/kg) in a carrageenan-induced edema model in rats, the effect was obviously inferior to that of phenylbutazone (e.g., 3% vs. 53% two hours post-administration and 27% vs. 54% reduction five hours post-administration) [

 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Rutin and quercetin, as well as 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were shown by M. Melzig et al. (2000) to inhibit leukocyte elastase, an effect considered synergistic with the radical scavenging of the same molecules in exerting their anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Instead, saponins and leiocarposide did not demonstrate any such elastase inhibition; the same authors claimed that ester saponins stimulate the release of ACTH by their interaction with cell membranes of the pituitary cells, and thus, consecutively, glucocorticoids with anti-inflammatory effects [

 <italic>O</italic>-tricaffeoylquinic acid was identified among phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> as having the highest anti-inflammatory effect (88% of that of indomethacin) in rats (carrageenan-based rat paw edema) and to inhibit TNF-α and IL-1β [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, other studies reported stimulation of TNF-α secretion by macrophages, an effect induced by different phytochemicals of the species (2-methoxybenzyl-2-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxybenzoate) [
 <xref rid="B116-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], and it remains to be investigated in what contexts and under the influence of what variables one or the other effect will predominate.
