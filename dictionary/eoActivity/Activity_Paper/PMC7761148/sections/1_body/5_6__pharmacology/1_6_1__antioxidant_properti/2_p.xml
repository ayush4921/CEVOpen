<p>The key component and marker of the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> was found by M. Marksa et al. (2020) to be 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (about half of the whole scavenging activity, as for 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. Ã—niederederi</italic>, but unlike 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>, for which the main component responsible is chlorogenic acid) [

 <italic>Solidago</italic> species tested, the scavenging activities were stronger for the leaf products than for the inflorescences [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The radical neutralizing properties of quercetin derivatives from 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> species was shown to be considerably lower to that of the cafeoylquinic derivatives, but it is higher than that of kaempferol derivatives, whose antioxidant potential is insignificant [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Di-caffeoylquinic acids have a stronger radical scavenging effect than mono-caffeoylquinic acids [
