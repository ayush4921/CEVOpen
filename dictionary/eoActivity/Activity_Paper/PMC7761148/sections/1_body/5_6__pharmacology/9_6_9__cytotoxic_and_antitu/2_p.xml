<p>A methanol extract of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> ssp. gigantean was reported to be active against the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2 [
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Fractionation guided by cytotoxicity led to the isolation of three active compounds from the hexane-soluble fraction, evaluated on five human tumor cell lines: erythrodiol-3-acetate, α-tocopherol quinone, and 2-phyten-l-ol [

 <sub>50</sub> varied between 5.9 and 54.8 μM, which qualified the activity as rather modest (the most active one, with ED
 <sub>50</sub> less than 10 μM on four out of the five cancer cell lines was the α-tocopherol quinone) [

 <xref rid="B154-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], a mere cytotoxicity test may not be appropriate to assess the antitumor potential of these extracts.
