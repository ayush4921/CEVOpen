<p>A root extract was fractioned in a bioassay-guided manner and the active compounds responsible for the antibacterial effects (on 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</italic>, a plant pathogen) were identified as two isomers of the matricaria ester. For the extract, the MIC determined was 172 µg/mL for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 86 µg/mL for 
 <italic>X. euvesicatoria</italic> [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and all had a modest activity, considerably inferior to that of vancomycin (the lowest MIC, observed for the second clerodane compound, was 30 µg/mL, 15 times higher than that of vancomycin and over the 16 µg/mL for a pure compound to be considered “active”) [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> for the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but these positive results were observed only with the undiluted essential oil and the ½ dilution, which is of very little clinical significance for systemic use.
