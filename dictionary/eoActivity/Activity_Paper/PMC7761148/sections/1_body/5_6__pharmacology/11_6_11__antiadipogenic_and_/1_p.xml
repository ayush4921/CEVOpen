<p>Following an impressive screening of about 300 plant extracts, kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside was isolated from a butanol fraction of a water extract of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, showing strong anti-adipogenic effects in vitro and supressing PPAR-γ and C/EBPα expression [
 <xref rid="B100-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Of a number of several phenolic derivatives of the species, evaluated in vitro for their anti-adipogenic potential, 5-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid was found to have the most potent inhibitory effect [
 <xref rid="B157-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. A 10% ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> also showed good anti-adipogenic effects in vitro and in vivo in a murine model, causing a decrease in body weight, liver weight, and the magnitude of the adipose tissues [
 <xref rid="B158-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Such experimental data are worth further investigation of the species for its potential use for weight loss purposes.
