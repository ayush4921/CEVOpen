<p>The European 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L. has been described as “an exceedingly polymorphic taxon”, and a multitude of narrowly related taxa have been included within it at different levels (varieties, subspecies, and even species) [

 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In a European country (Czech Republic) flora, discussing the variability, S. Slavik (2004) has identified 17 taxa as belonging to the 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L. group (leaving aside taxa from Japan), of which a number of six are qualified as subspecies, whereas a number of eleven as “microspecies” [

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). The Atlas of the British and Irish flora [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] describes 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> as highly variable, with many distinct forms for distinct habitats (ecotypes). Strong correlations have been claimed between 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> genotypes and their geography, and a strong ability to rapidly evolve and ecologically diversify has been recognized for the species [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
