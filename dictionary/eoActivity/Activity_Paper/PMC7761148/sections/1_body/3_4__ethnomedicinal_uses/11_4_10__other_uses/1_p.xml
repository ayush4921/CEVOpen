<p>Besides its medicinal uses, 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> has been recognized as a first-class alternative source for the floriculture business, both on the old continent and in the new world [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It has also been proposed to be used as a rotation crop as a means of containing noxious weeds in an organic agriculture context [

 <italic>Solidago</italic> spp., including 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, have been claimed to have potential utility for phytoremediation purposes, based on their ability to transfer iron from soil to plants near iron processing industrial sites [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; however, studies on other oligo-elements (such as zinc) have not identified particular hyperaccumulator properties for the plant [
 <xref rid="B52-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and whereas a number of papers have been published on the phytoremediation potential of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], we could find none on 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>. The pollen of the latter is of good quality, and its availability may contribute to long-lived bees being able to survive a hard winter [
