<p>Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554), one of the first modern botanists in Germany, conjectured that Germanic tribes had been using the plant for medicinal purposes, mentioning that they regarded it as a “miracle herb” (
 <italic>Wunderkraut</italic>) [

 <italic>Heydnisch Wundkraut</italic> (heathen woundwort), employed in the German territories during the Middle Ages for the plant, evokes the healing properties of the herb. Another vernacular German name, 
 <italic>Unsegenkraut</italic> (curse herb), indicates belief at that time in its magic abilities, in an era where disease was often attributed to witchcraft and metaphysical causes, and indirectly the name might still point towards its potential medicinal properties [
