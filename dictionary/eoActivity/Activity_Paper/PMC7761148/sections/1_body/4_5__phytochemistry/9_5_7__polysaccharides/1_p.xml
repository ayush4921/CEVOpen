<p>Both inflorescences and leaves of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L. contain polysaccharides. Those isolated from inflorescences contain uronic acids (over 40%, mostly galacturonic acid), galactose (13–18%), glucose (7–12.5%), rhamnose (4–7.5%), arabinose (2–8%), and xylose (1–2%) residues [

Saluk-Juszczak (2010) reported quite different proportions of sugars for the polyphenolic-polysaccharide conjugates isolated from the flower heads (rhamnose 22.4%, fucose 5.0%, arabinose 19.2%, xylose 2.6%, mannose 1.3%, glucose 13.0%, galactose 14.0%) [
