<p>It has been speculated [

 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extracts (leiocarposide, polyphenolic acids, flavonoids, saponins) exert a synergistic activity in displaying the reported anti-inflammatory effects of the product [

 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The antioxidant activity has been attributed to the polyphenolic compounds [
