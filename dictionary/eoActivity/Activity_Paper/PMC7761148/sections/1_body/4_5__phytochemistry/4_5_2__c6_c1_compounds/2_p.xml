<p>A somewhat detailed history of the discovery of the two phenolic glycosides was provided by L. Skrzypczak et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Leiocarposide is currently considered the most important and was found to be maximally biosynthesized in the flower buds (1.60%) and in the two-year leaves, post-blooming (1.05%) [
 <xref rid="B104-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Similar contents (0.4–1.6%) were reported by other researchers, depending on a number of variables such as plant height at harvest, collection time, or the natural state of the herbal samples [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Leiocarposide has attracted interest for its pharmacological potential, being explored for its hypothesized anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antilithiatic, and diuretic effects, as discussed below. For plants cultivated in vitro, the content of leiocarposide is lower than that of naturally growing plants (0.18% vs. 0.2–1.0%) [
