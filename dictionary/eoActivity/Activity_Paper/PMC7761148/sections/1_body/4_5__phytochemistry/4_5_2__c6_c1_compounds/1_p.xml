<p>Several main compounds with a C6–C1 have apparently been reported up to date in 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, two glycosides and two aglycones: virgaureoside A, a bis-desmosidic glycoside derived from benzoic acid (2-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxybenzoic acid-2′-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxybenzyl ester) [
 <xref rid="B101-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], leiocarposide (2′-hydroxybenzyl-3-methoxybenzoate 2′,4-diglucoside) [
 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], vanillic acid, gallic acid [

 <xref rid="B102-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], benzoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic (protocatechuic) acid, and 2,5-dihydroxibenzoic (gentisic) acid [

 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Such derivatives of the benzoic acid are often occurring in the family Asteraceae [
