<p>As part of the plant wealth resources and traditional herbal medicament, the halophytes have a strong presence in the Mediterranean regions and Peninsular Arabia. These plant species also grow in the normal climatic zones, as well as have a higher occurrence in the salty environment owing to their better adaptation capabilities. Among the major halophytes of the region, the 
 <italic>Salsola imbricata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salsola cyclophylla</italic>, which are also part of camels’ feed, besides being the commonest remedy for diarrhea, is also used against worms’ infestation, stomach ache, and dysentery [

 <italic>Tamarix aphylla</italic> and 
 <italic>Aeluropus lagopoides</italic> are employed for wound healing, anti-diabetic, and also as pain-remover [

 <italic>Zygophyllum simplex</italic> is commonly used in the treatments of various diabetic conditions, wound-healing, and as an analgesic [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there is no significant work reported on the phytochemical constituents and biological activity of these major halophytes of the Saudi Arabian regions. The five of the widely, and wildly growing halophytes, 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic>, 
 <italic>S. imbricata, S. cyclophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic>, of central Saudi Arabia, have been investigated for their in vitro anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-diabetic activities. The study also determined the enhanced presence of trace elements, in addition to the higher levels of total phenolics and flavonoid contents in these plants, as a hallmark of halophytic plant characteristics.
