<p>The iron metal ions chelating activity of the plant extracts were compared to the di sodium-EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic-Acid) as the referral standard. The results showed that 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> extract chelated about 46.12% of the ferrous ions at the 1.25 mg/mL of minimum concentration, while at the same time, the intermediate levels of iron-chelating activities were recorded for the extracts, at the same concentration, for 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic>, 
 <italic>A. lagopoides,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. aphylla,</italic> which chelated the ferrous ions by 31.92%, 26.09%, and 25.47%, respectively. The 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> exhibited the lowest chelating activity (19.23%) among all the tested plantsâ€™ extracts. The results revealed that these particular plants, and halophytes in general, comparatively possessed moderate to high levels of anti-oxidant behaviors than the halophytic and non-halophytic plants of same genera found in non-salinity conditions [
