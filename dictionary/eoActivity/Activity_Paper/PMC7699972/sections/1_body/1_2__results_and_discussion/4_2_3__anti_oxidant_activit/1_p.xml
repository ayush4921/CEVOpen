<p>The anti-oxidant potentials of the halophytes were assayed by the DPPH radicals’ inhibition capacity method [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The highest DPPH radicals scavenging capacity was observed in the extract of 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value at 94.42 ± 4.19 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Ascorbic acid, the referral standard, showed the highest DPPH radicals’ inhibition capacity percentage at all the measured concentrations, wherein the maximum inhibition of 94.00 ± 0.26% was observed at 1000 µg/mL concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 60.49 ± 3.73 µg/mL). The plants, 
 <italic>Z. simplex, S. cyclophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic>, 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> showed their maximum DPPH radicals’ inhibition activity of 90.30 ± 0.35% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 65.67 ± 1.49 µg/mL), 93.28 ± 0.18% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 76.78 ± 2.12 µg/mL), 91.04 ± 0.12% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 94.42 ± 4.19 µg/mL), 90.30 ± 0.39% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 71.01 ± 1.93 µg/mL), and 91.04 ± 0.12% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 66.34 ± 2.28 µg/mL), respectively, at the same, 1000 µg/mL, concentrations. Among all the studied plants, 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> at 10 µg/mL extract’s concentration showed significantly increased DPPH radicals’ inhibition percentage as compared to the 
 <italic>Z. simplex, A. lagopoides</italic>, 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> extracts. Similarly, at 25 µg/mL, and 50 µg/mL extracts’ concentrations, the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> showed significantly increased DPPH radicals’ inhibitions as compared to all the other plants’ extracts. No significant inhibitory differences were observed among all the studied plants at 250 µg/mL concentrations of the extracts, while at 500 mg/mL concentrations, a significant increase in the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> was observed, which showed the highest inhibitory capacity compared to all other plants studied (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All the plants also scavenged the DPPH free radicals with a higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value which is attributable to the chemical nature of the phytoconstituents present in these plants, and they may not be the phenolics and flavonoids structural types.
