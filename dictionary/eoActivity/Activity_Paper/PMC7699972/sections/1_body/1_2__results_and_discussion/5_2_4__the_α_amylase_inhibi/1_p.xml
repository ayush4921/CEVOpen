<p>The α-amylase inhibitory activity is a rapid, reproducible, and indirect method for screening the anti-diabetic potential of plant extracts and their pure constituents. The halophytic nature of the plants under investigation, and the abundances of phenolics, flavonoids, and trace elements contents in their extracts, prompted to examine their potential anti-diabetic effects. The obtained anti-amylase activity data (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) indicated that these halophytic plants may yield a prospective natural product-based template for an anti-diabetic drug lead. The 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> extract demonstrated the highest capacity to inhibit α-amylase enzyme at IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 60.43 ± 8.29 µg/mL with significant differences in comparison to the referral standard, acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 40.54 ± 1.65 µg/mL). Similarly, all the other plants’ extracts demonstrated α-amylase inhibitory activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 49.24 ± 1.88, 56.60 ± 8.46, 50.58 ± 2.25, and 44.66 ± 1.90 µg/mL for 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla, A. lagopoides, T. aphylla,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> plants extracts, respectively. The results of α-amylase based anti-diabetic activity also revealed a positive relationship between total phenolics and total flavonoids contents of the plants, and their maximum α-amylase inhibitory activity was found in 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> extract which has the highest phenolics and flavonoids contents (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> possessed the lowest concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids contents in its extract, and the plant’s extract also showed the lowest α-amylase inhibitory capacity. The observation that 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> extract possessed the highest α-amylase inhibitory capacity also corroborated its traditional use as an anti-diabetic concoction. The finding also suggested that it can be a good candidate for at least as a crude drug, and a candidate for further investigations towards developing an anti-diabetic drug.
