<p>The anti-oxidant potentials of the halophytic plants’ extracts’ samples were determined by estimating the iron chelating activity using ferrozine, and radicals scavenging activity through the DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A volume of 500 μL of DPPH (0.44 mg DPPH was dissolved in 1000 mL of 5% aqueous ethanol), and mixed with 500 μL of different concentrations of the plant extracts separately (1000 to 10 μg/mL). Similarly, blank and positive control mixtures were prepared [

The mixtures were then heated at 45 °C in a water-bath for 20 min, and the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm by the available UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The experimental values are expressed as the mean ± Standard Error Mean (SEM), and all the experiments were carried out in triplicates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The inhibition, which reflected the radical scavenging activity, was calculated using the following equation:
