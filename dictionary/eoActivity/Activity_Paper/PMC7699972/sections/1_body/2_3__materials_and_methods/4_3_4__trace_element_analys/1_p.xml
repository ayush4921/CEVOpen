<p>The trace elements, i.e., Fe, Cu, and Zn of the halophytic plants, were determined from the dried plant’s powder, as reported by Johnsson [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The plants were dried at 70 °C for two days and sifted by a stainless-steel mill under 5 mm pore size. The dried materials (0.5 gm, each plant separately) were digested using a solution of concentrated HNO

 <sub>4</sub>, and H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (7:2:l) [
