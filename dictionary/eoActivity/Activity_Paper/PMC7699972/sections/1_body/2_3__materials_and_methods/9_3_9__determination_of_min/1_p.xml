<p>The two-fold broth dilution method [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts. 900 μL of bacterial suspension (cultured in Mueller Hinton Broth supplemented with Tween-80) was added to 100 μL of each of the extracts from the serially diluted concentration range (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.195, 0.097, 0.048 mg/mL). The mixtures were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h, and observed bacterial growths were determined. The lowest concentration showed no turbidity, and that was considered the MIC value.
