<p>The α-amylase enzyme inhibition potentials of the extracts were carried out according to the reported method [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A volume of 500 μL acarbose or halophytic plant’s sample at different concentrations were incubated with 500 μL of 0.5 mg/mL α-amylase in 0.2 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 1% starch solution (500 μL) in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9), and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The dinitro-α-salicylic acid (DNS) coloring reagent (1 mL) was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min, cooled to RT (24 ± 2 °C), followed by the addition of 10 mL of distilled water to dilute the reaction mixture. The absorbance was recorded at 540 nm. A blank control was prepared using a similar procedure with solvent in the absence of an extract sample. The experimental value is expressed as mean ± Standard Error Mean (SEM), and all experiments were carried in triplicates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The percentages of α-amylase enzyme inhibition were calculated using the following formula:
