<p>All the plants’ extracts were assayed for their flavonoids contents as Rutin Equivalents (RE) in mg/g of the dried plant extract using the method described by Ordonez [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Concisely, 1 mL of an extract in a 1 mg/mL concentration was mixed with 1 mL of aluminum chloride (2% in ethanol), and the mixture was shaken vigorously, and kept at RT (24 ± 2 °C) for 1 h, followed by measurement of the absorbance at 440 nm using a UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (V-630, JASCO Spectrophotometer). The flavonoids contents of the extracts were calculated from the generated calibration curve of rutin as mg/g of the dried extract. All the results were obtained as an average of three independent measurements, and standard deviations were calculated [
