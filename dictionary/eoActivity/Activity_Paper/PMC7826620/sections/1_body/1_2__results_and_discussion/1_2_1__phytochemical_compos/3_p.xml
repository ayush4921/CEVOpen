<p>The phytochemical analysis was performed and revealed different interesting molecules like (a) terpinene-4-ol, a compound found in multiple plants and has antimicrobial effects against various bacteria and microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], (b) ferrocene, which possesses an anti-proliferative effect against lymphocytic leukemia [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and also approved antidiabetic effects [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], (c) phenazine, a molecule with antimicrobial proprieties [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and also affects the viability of pancreatic Î²-cells and has an impact on the secretion of insulin [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These compounds may be behind the antidiabetic effect of the extract and needs further investigation to confirm it.
