<p>Alpha-amylase inhibition potential of WFLE is demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00293-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The inhibition of the enzyme appears to be dose-related as the concentration of the extract clearly affects the amount of enzyme inhibited. The calculated IC50 showed that WFLE inhibition potential is better than acarbose, with an IC50 of 0.40 ± 0.124 mg/mL noted for WFLE against 0.717 ± 0.054 mg/mL noted for acarbose.
