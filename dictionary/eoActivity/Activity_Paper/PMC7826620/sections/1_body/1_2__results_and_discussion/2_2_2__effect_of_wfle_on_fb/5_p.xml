 <xref rid="molecules-26-00293-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the bodyweight development and biochemical parameters of alloxan-induced diabetic mice during the experimental period of 4 weeks. Untreated diabetic mice have reported a substantial drop in body weight concomitant with hyperglycemia. The decline in body weight of diabetic mice is attributed to the excessive catabolism of fats and structural proteins used as an energy source because of the lack of availability of carbohydrates. Insulin plays a vital role in regulating protein synthesis and proteolysis in the skeletal muscle, and the observed effect is mainly due to its deficiency [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Treatment of diabetic mice with WFLE and glibenclamide for four weeks improved their body weight concomitant with the stabilization of the hyperglycemic state. In 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00293-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the biochemical parameters indicate an elevated serum ASAT and ALAT levels in the untreated diabetic mice, which is a marker of cellular leakage and loss of hepatic cell membrane functional integrity, which implies hepatocellular injury [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After the treatment of diabetic mice with different doses of WFLE, a significant decrease in ASAT and ALAT levels compared to those of the diabetic control groups was observed. The results may indicate a potential hepatoprotective activity of the extract maybe due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and healing proprieties [
