<p>Based on previous pharmacological tests and a toxicity study, two doses (200 and 400 mg/kg) were chosen as the lowest most effective doses to treat the mice with induced diabetes [

In this type of experimental diabetes (chemically induced), we used alloxan monohydrate, a glucose toxic analog that uses the same glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) to penetrate into pancreatic β-cells and drive them to apoptosis following its free radical formation ability. Degeneration of the β-cells responsible for the production of insulin results in an elevated fasting blood glucose [
