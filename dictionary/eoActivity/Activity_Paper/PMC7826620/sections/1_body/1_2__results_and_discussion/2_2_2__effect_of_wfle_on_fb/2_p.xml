<p>The FBG of diabetic mice was estimated on day 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the treatment. Both WFLE doses show a statistically significant reduction with diabetic control mice (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) within the first week but not compared to the powerful reduction noted with the glibenclamide treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was also no significant difference between the decrease in the FBG of the two doses during this week (433 ± 23 mg/dL for the dose of 200 mg/kg and 425 ± 20 mg/dL for the dose of 400 mg/kg against 321 ± 23 mg/dL noted for glibenclamide). However, this reduction becomes very significant during the next three weeks for both doses (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the difference in the decrease in the FBG level becomes evident by the end of the test with 266 ± 19 mg/dL noted for the dose of 200 mg/kg and 148 ± 14 for the dose of 400 mg/kg against the best FBG level marked with glibenclamide 133 ± 18 mg/dL. Those results show that WFLE extracts exhibit better fasting blood glucose level activity with the dose of 400 mg/dL, a reduction that may reach the glibenclamide effect with a longer time of use.
