<p>The results of this study confirmed the traditional use of this plant for the management of diabetes. However, it is observed that 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> antidiabetic activity starts to be noticeable after the second week of the study, suggesting that the effect needs time to take place. The dose of 400 mg/kg exhibited the best effect with a perfect toxicity profile. One of the proposed mechanisms of action exhibited by this plant is the inhibition of two digestive enzymes responsible for the breakdown and the absorption of carbohydrates, demonstrating a better control of postprandial glycemia.
