<p>In addition, the SMAC/DIABLO molecule, inhibitor of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), might be involved in the mechanism of ferutinin toxicity, as once leaked from the mitochondria, it can bind IAP, preventing the inhibition of caspase activity and promoting the formation and activation of the apoptosome complex, leading to caspase-9 activation [
