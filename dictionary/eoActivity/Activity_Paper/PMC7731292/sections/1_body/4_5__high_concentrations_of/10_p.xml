<p>Among cell lines tested to verify ferutinin effects, it was observed that, for tumor cell lines, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), human cells of urothelial carcinoma (TCC), human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT29), murine cells of colon carcinoma (CT26), IC 50 was between 67 and 81 μM, while the IC 50 for normal human and murine fibroblast lines (HFF3 and NIH/3T3) was higher, with values of 98 and 136 μM respectively, with about 67% of viable cells in both cell lines treated at the above concentrations (

(2008) showed that the ferutinin produced cytotoxic effects on (imatinib-resistant) human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562R) and (dasatinib-resistant) mouse leukemia cell lines (DA1-3b/M2BCR-ABL), respectively at IC 50 25.3 μM and 29.1 μM [
