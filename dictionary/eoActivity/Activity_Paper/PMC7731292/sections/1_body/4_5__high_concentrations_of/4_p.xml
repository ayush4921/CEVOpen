<p>A recent study, using isolated rat liver mitochondria, aimed to evaluate the mitochondrial damages produced by ferutinin and demonstrated that the latter, was able to decrease the organelle respiration at concentration of 5–27 µM and to determine the membrane potential dissipation at concentration of 10–60 µM in a dose-dependent manner. It has also been observed that the mitochondrial effects of ferutinin might be primarily induced by stimulation of Ca
