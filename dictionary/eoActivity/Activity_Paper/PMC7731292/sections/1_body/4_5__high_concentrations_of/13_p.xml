<p>In vitro studies have shown that, thanks to its phytoestrogenic activity, ferutinin induced the inhibition of proliferation in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. To test whether ferutinin actually acts as a protective agent on breast and uterine carcinoma, two different mechanisms involved in the initiation and in the progression of cancer, respectively, were assessed. The first was the evaluation of the cell proliferation rate through the Ki-67 antigen, a non-histone nuclear protein used as a good proliferation marker, as it is present at low levels in the quiescent cells and increases in proliferating cells, especially in phase G2, M and in the second half of phase S. The second was the detection of DNA fragments generating during the apoptotic process [

These studies showed that ferutinin produced dose-dependent effects and, in particular, the oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day offered the best protective action, increasing the rate of apoptosis in the glandular epithelia of ovariectomized rats [
