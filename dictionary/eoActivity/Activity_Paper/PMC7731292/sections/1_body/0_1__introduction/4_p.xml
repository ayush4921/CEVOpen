<p>The results obtained in different experimental works suggest that the sesquiterpenes have protective potential at low doses and cause severe toxic effects at high doses [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; this bipolar effect is due to the increases, induced by sesquiterpenes, of the cation permeability of lipid bilayers and mitochondrial membrane in a dose-dependent manner with a higher selectivity for divalent cations, such as calcium ions which play a key role in several pathophysiological processes [
