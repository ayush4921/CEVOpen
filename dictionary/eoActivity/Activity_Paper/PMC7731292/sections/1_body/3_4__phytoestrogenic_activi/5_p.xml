<p>In vivo studies also shown that ferutinin prevents osteoporosis and exhibits dose-dependent osteoprotective effects. Indeed, different doses of ferutinin exerted an important activity on bone remodelling in rats ovariectomized which reflects the effects of estrogen deficiency in menopause women [

In these experimental works the histomorphometric analysis of cortical bone of femoral diaphysis and of vertebral bodies, specifically the trabecular bone of lumen vertebrae and distal femoral epiphysis has been performed. The data obtained showed that the ovariectomized rats orally treated with ferutinin (2 mg/Kg/day for 60 days) showed the same bone mass values of ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol benzoate [

Another in vivo study conducted in ovariectomized rats, treated with the same concentration of ferutinin (2 mg/Kg/day for 60 days), it has been showed that ferutinin exerts an important action on body weight and bone loss, since the administration of this molecule is able to prevent together the excessive gain of weight and the osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency [
