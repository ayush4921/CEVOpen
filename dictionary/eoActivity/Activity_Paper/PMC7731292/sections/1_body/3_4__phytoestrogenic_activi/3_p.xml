<p>ERα and ERβ receptors are transcribed from different genes and their expression is cell-type and tissue-type dependent. The nuclear estrogen receptors activate signalling pathway that result in the expression control of several genes by the direct binding to gene promoters or specific DNA sequences, called estrogen response elements (EREs). These palindromic sequences are located into the regulatory regions of target genes [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], such as the genes encoding the estrogen-responsive finger protein (EFP), which are strongly expressed in breast cancer, and the estrogen receptor-binding fragment-associated antigen 9 (EBAG9). Several transcription factors (TP53, FOS, JUN), secreted proteins (C3, AGT, LTF), proteins of intracellular signaling (BRCA1, BCL2, HRAS) are directly regulated by estrogenic action [

Instead, the GPER receptors are associated with a rapid cellular signaling, inducing cAMP production, ions mobilization, kinases activation, such as ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt. In addition, GPER receptors regulates both calcium and potassium channels and are able to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with the subsequent maintenance of physiological nitric oxide (NO) production and, consequently, of endothelial function [
