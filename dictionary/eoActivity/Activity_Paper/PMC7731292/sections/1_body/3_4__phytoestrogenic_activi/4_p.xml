<p>In vitro, the ferutinin binding affinity shows an inversion compared to other phytoestrogens since it has a greater affinity for estrogenic receptor ERα than for ERβ [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; the in vivo phytoestrogenic activity confirms this binding specificity as, at the hypothalamic level, it has been observed a modulated expression of the ERα receptor [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It has been observed that ferutinin, when administered alone, increases the expression of ERα, while, when co-administered concomitantly with estradiol, decreases its expression [

Additional evidence demonstrated that ferutinin exerts an action comparable to estradiol benzoate, stimulating the endometrial proliferation. Moreover, ferutinin, dissimilar to estrogens, is able to increase the apoptotic index in luminal and glandular epithelia, avoiding the consequent stimulation of excessive cell proliferation leading to endometrial cancer. This represents an important goal because it might overcome the main risks related to the HRT [
