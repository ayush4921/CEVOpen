<p>Furthermore, a recent study showed that ferutinin, through the regulation of Wnt/β catenin pathway, was able to promote osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp-derived stem cells, with a consequent promotion of bone density, acting on the promoter regions of Wnt Family Member 3A (
 <italic>WNT3A)</italic> and disheveled segment polarity protein 3 (
 <italic>DVL3)</italic>, by the activation of H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation (not shown), upregulating their expression, as well as that of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (
 <italic>LRP6</italic>); instead ferutinin leads the downregulation of the expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (
 <italic>GSK3)</italic>. It is known that in the absence of 
 <italic>WNT, GSK3</italic> constitutively phosphorylates the β-catenin and leads its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. However, in the presence of the ligand 
 <italic>WNT</italic> and the binding of 
 <italic>WNT</italic> protein to their receptor-co-receptor complexes (
 <italic>Frizzled-LRP</italic>), disheveled is activated and inhibits the phosphorylation of beta catenin by 
 <italic>GSK3</italic>. The downregulation of 
 <italic>GSK3</italic> expression is also associated with an inhibition of adipogenic process through the regulatory axis of 
 <italic>GSK3/STAT5/Sfrp/Wnt</italic>. This evidence leads to hypothesize a potential role for Ferutinin as epigenetic activator and modulator of stem cells therapy to counteract osteoporosis (
