<p>Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain these results. The first regards the evidence that the ionophoric activity of ferutinin in platelet is able to stimulate the calcium-dependent NOS and the subsequent increase of NO; the NO elevation, through the cAMP and cGMP signaling, in turn, could directly and indirectly induce the calcium ions accumulation into the intracellular stores, reducing the calcium ions in platelets [
