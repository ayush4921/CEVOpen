<p>It has been demonstrated that low doses of ferutinin are associated with a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic activity [

In accordance, the results obtained in different experimental works suggest a key role of low doses of ferutinin in the reduction of free radicals production. This, in turn, determines an increase of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione and a decrease of inflammation [
