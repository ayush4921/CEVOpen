<p>Raafat et al. (2015) studied the potential in vivo antioxidant and antihyperglicemic activity of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> extracts, including ferutinin at low doses (0.4–0.8–1.6 mg/Kg). At concentration of 1.6 mg/Kg, ferutinin was able to cause a significant glucose levels decrease and body weight increase in treated-mice respect to diabetic control group. Furthermore, consistent with previous experimental studies [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it was observed that the same concentration of ferutinin administration significantly reverted the reduction trend of antioxidant enzyme catalase expression observed in diabetic mice. In addition to this evidence, this study for the first time described the antioxidant effects of ferutinin on neuropathic pain associated with diabetes, showing that 1.6 mg/Kg of ferutinin led to attenuation of tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia [
