<p>The moisture content of the 200 g of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was 10.20 ± 0.95%, and a slightly higher oil yield of 0.7 mL/200 g (0.35%) was obtained through SFME after 30 min of extraction as compared to 0.59 mL/200 g (0.295%) obtained after 180 min by the hydrodistillation method. The oils were pale-yellow liquids with fine aroma. For the energy consumption and environmental footprint, the amount of energy consumed and the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere were higher for the hydrodistillation method (4.2 kWh and 3360 g CO
 <sub>2</sub>/g of essential oil) as compared to the SFME method (0.25 kWh and 200 g CO
 <sub>2</sub>/g of essential oil).
