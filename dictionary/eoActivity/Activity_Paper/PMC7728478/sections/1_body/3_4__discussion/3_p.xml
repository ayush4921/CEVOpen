<p>The two oils were characterized with monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and oxygenated compounds. However, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were dominant in the SFME and hydrodistilled oils, respectively, but higher quantity of oxygenated compounds was present in the SFME-extracted oil. This is in agreement with the essential oil compositions of

Lower quantity of monoterpenes with higher sesquiterpenes and oxygenated compounds was observed in the SFME-derived oil. Monoterpene hydrocarbons are less important than oxygenated compounds in terms of their impact on the pleasant aroma of essential oils, while the oxygenated compounds are highly fragrant and, hence, the most important [
