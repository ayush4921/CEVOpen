<p>The solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) set up is referred to as a “green technology” which involves a combination of heat from the microwave and dry distillation at atmospheric pressure [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is a sustainable extraction method which relies on reduced energy consumption, ensuring a safe and high quality end product [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It involves heating the fresh plant material in a microwave reactor, devoid of water or any solvent at all for 30 min. The short-term heating of the water in the plant material expands the plant cells causing the plant cells and oil producing glands to release the oil from the plant material [

 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves using hydrodistillation and SFME methods. This work is therefore aimed at making a comparative study in terms of extraction yields and chemical compositions of essential oils obtained from
