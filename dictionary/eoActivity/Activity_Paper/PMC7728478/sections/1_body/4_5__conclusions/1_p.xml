<p>This study has shown that the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>H.arborescens</italic> leaves is dependent on the extraction method. The SFME method resulted in a higher yield in terms of quantity and an essential oil of better quality due to the presence of higher valuable oxygenated compounds than that which was obtained by hydrodistillation. Furthermore, the use of the SFME method indicated lower energy consumption and CO
 <sub>2</sub> emission. It can therefore be concluded that the SFME method is considered as a good alternative for the extraction of essential oil from 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves at shorter extraction time, reduced energy consumption, lower cost, and environmental footprint when compared with the hydrodistillation method.
