<p>Polysaccharides obtained from thuja leaf extract have been shown to reduce mice-induced inflammation. They have the ability to prevent metastasis by diminishing inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and TNF-α. Moreover, these polysaccharides stimulated the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, cell mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (ACC) and stimulated the activity of antitumor factors, IL-2, and TIMP [
