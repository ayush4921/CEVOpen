The study also determined the antimicrobial effects and histopathological changes in a wound&#x02019;s healing process treated with these medicinal herbs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materialsandmethods"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Surgical wounds (<italic>n</italic> = 18) were created aseptically in the skin of the flank region of six healthy sheep dividing them into three experimental groups. Follow-up data were taken up to day 21. Different morphological characteristics of the wound and wound contraction (length and width) were recorded weekly. Samples were collected on days 1, 2, and 3 to test the antimicrobial effects and on days 1, 3, and 7 for histopathological studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment with marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste resulted in a swelled wound area of 11.78 &#x000b1; 0.38 mm and 11.52 &#x000b1; 0.27 mm, respectively. The wound areas were comparatively lower than that of the control group (11.44 &#x000b1; 0.20 mm). Moreover, the least elevation (2.44 &#x000b1; 0.12 mm) of the sutured line from the skin surface was noted and compared between the marigold leaf paste and normal saline (2.74 &#x000b1; 0.13 mm). Bacterial colonies in the nutrient agar medium cultured with swabs from the normal saline-treated group&#x02019;s wound area were found on day 1. On the contrary, bacterial colonies were absent on days 2 and 3 of treatment in the groups treated with both the paste of marigold leaves and turmeric. Less intense tissue reactions and higher keratinization of epithelium were shown in the group treated with marigold leaf paste than turmeric paste and saline-treated groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Marigold leaf paste showed less tissue reaction and healed the wounds effectively. Thus, this paste could be used for the treatment of superficial wounds in sheep.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Histopathological study</kwd><kwd>Microbiological culture</kwd><kwd>Wound healing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The interruption of regular anatomical arrangements and tissue function is defined as a wound and can be differentiated by its etiology, duration, or location. Wound healing involves a chain of well-organized cellular and biochemical events regarding the development and regeneration of tissues in a definite fashion, including blood clotting, inflammation, tissue regeneration, epithelialization, collagen synthesis, and wounded tissue remodeling [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Different serious consequences may occur if the wound is not treated duly. The complications of wound healing in Bangladesh commonly occur due to lack of modern treatment facilities, high cost of medicines, and the management of wounds by unauthorized persons [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Wound healing is suppressed by different immunosuppressive agents, cytotoxins, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotics, herbal drugs, and analgesics expedited wound healing [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite trade drugs being used instead of medicinal plants, people still use medicinal herbs for primary healthcare worldwide [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Tribes in India use many plants and their extracts for cuts, wounds, and burn treatment [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In current years, the antimicrobial activities of plants and their extracts have been documented [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic>, a herb known as marigold, has exceptional healing powers, and it is fantastic in the treatment of wounds. Marigold is beneficial as an antiseptic and an excellent remedy for wound treatment [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to Ayurvedic and Unani medicine, the flowers and leaves of marigold have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antimicrobial, and antiepileptic effects [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Marigolds are generally administered in tinctures, ointments, and infusions to treat wounds for inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Polysaccharides having (1&#x02192;3)-linked <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-D-galactan are isolated from aqueous marigold extract, which stimulates phagocytosis of granulocytes in humans [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Curcumin, the main active component of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> (Turmeric), has also been studied for an extended period. Turmeric has many bio-functional properties, such as antioxidants, free radical scavengers, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory actions, that are responsible for the healing process [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The main ingredients of the turmeric essential oil identified were <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-sesquiphellandrene (38.69%), <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-curcumene (18.44%), and <italic>p</italic>-mentha-1,4 (8)-diene (16.29%). Hassan et al. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that the extract of turmeric showed the utmost Mg (49.4 mg/l) concentration after Ca (35.42 mg/l) and Fe (1.27 mg/l).</p><p>Paul et al. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] used marigold flower and turmeric root in the goat&#x02019;s wound healing. They studied some physical parameters and histological appearances of the wound, but they did not test these herbs for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, marigold leaves might be more available than flowers in terms of quantity year-round. Miah et al. [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used turmeric in the wound healing of black Bengal goat and carried out antimicrobial tests and histological and morphological parameters. However, they did not compare the efficacy of turmeric with other herbal plants. No such comparative study of the herbal plants on wound healing of sheep was carried out in Bangladesh. In this study, we tested the relative efficacy of marigold and turmeric to recover surgical wounds. We also justified the antimicrobial activities and observed histopathological changes of wounds treated with marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materialsandmethods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was conducted ensuring the guidelines and approval from the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (AEEC), Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh-2202, Bangladesh (Approval number: 03/2017/AEEC).</p></sec><sec><title>Study period and population</title><p>This experiment was carried out on indigenous sheep to determine the effect of marigold leaves paste on wound healing. The study was conducted at the Research Animal Farm of the Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, BAU, from July 2017 to December 2017. Six sheep with normal signs of health were selected for the experiment. The bodyweight of the sheep varied between 11.5 and 14 kg. The study animals were nourished in conventional housing systems with routine veterinary supervision. Adequate food and water were given <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Before the experiment, the sheep were kept in quarantine for 14 days. Anthelmintic at 25 mg/kg body weight (Renadex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Renata pharmaceuticals, Bangladesh Ltd.) was given. The animals were vaccinated with the peste des petits ruminant (PPR) vaccine (PPR Vaccine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Livestock Research Institute, Bangladesh) for immunization against PPR1 disease.</p></sec><sec><title>The assortment of agents and drug formulation</title><p>Fresh turmeric root and marigold leaves were collected locally, of good quality in size, shape, and color. After washing, the turmeric was skinned and cleaned frequently with fresh water. Turmeric was sliced and dried overnight in a hot air oven. Dry slices of turmeric were powdered manually, and the powder was then preserved in an airtight container. The marigold leaves were cleaned with fresh water and cut into small pieces. Then, it was made into a paste with the help of a mortar and pestle.</p><p>A 10% solution of povidone-iodine (Povisep<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Jayson pharmaceuticals, Bangladesh) was used to prepare the operation site. 2% lidocaine hydrochloride (Jasocaine A<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Jayson pharmaceuticals, Bangladesh) was used as local anesthetics. Making of an aseptic wound, suturing the wound edges, drug formulation and application, sample collection and preservation, and regular wound observation were carried out at the Research Animal Farm, Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, and BAU. A microbiological study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, BAU. Histological slides were prepared and observed at the Department of Pathobiology and Central Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences (FVMAS), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU), Gazipur-1706, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Design of experiment</title><p>Six healthy sheep were collected for this study and separated into three equal groups, and each group confined two sheep with three wounds in each. By ensuring the animal&#x02019;s presurgical preparations, three wounds (incised) in each sheep were produced aseptically through a vertical incision in the flank region&#x02019;s skin. The incised wounds were approximately 2.5 cm long and 1.0 cm deep. A horizontal mattress suture (8-mm apart) with silk (black braided non-absorbable suture material waxed silk, U.S.P 2-0; Japan) was used for wound closure. The average distance between suture bites and the border of wound edges was 5 mm. No antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antihistaminic drugs were applied for the healing of the wounds. The fresh marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste (turmeric powder:distilled water = 1:1) were prepared daily just before application. Six incised wounds were treated with marigold leaves paste locally for 7 days. Another six wounds were treated with turmeric paste in the same way. The remaining six wounds were treated with 0.9% normal saline (NS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, The Acme Laboratories Ltd., Bangladesh) for 7 days and considered as a control. After 7 days of treatment, sutures were removed and maintained carefully to avoid the formation of granulation tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation of wounds</title><p>Routine follow-up data were documented up to day 21 (D<sub>21</sub>). Various morphological wound factors, such as swelling area (mm), the width of the sutured area (mm), the elevation of suture line (mm), and the wound contraction per week (mm), were measured using slide calipers. The swelling area of the wound was measured for up to 3 days. The sutures were removed after 7 days, and elevation of the suture line was noted. The width of the suture area was recorded on days 0 (D<sub>0</sub>), 3 (D<sub>3</sub>), 7 (D<sub>7</sub>), 14 (D<sub>14</sub>), and 21 (D<sub>21</sub>) to determine the status of healing. All wounds were supervised daily to note any complications, such as hemorrhage, unusual swelling, wound dehiscence, stitch abscess, exudation, putrefaction, and infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacteriological study</title><p>Sterile cotton buds were used to collect samples aseptically from the experimental wounds. Then, samples were transferred into the nutrient broth in screw-capped test tubes. Samples from wounds were incubated for 12 h in nutrient broth at 37&#x000b0;C. After that, the samples were inoculated in the specific agar according to the streak plate method. Then, the inoculated samples were incubated overnight to grow bacterial colonies at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Gram stain protocol was conducted to know the staining and morphological characteristics of specific bacteria [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Biopsy and histopathology</title><p>The biopsy samples (15 &#x000d7; 10 mm) were collected on days 1 (D<sub>1</sub>), 3 (D<sub>3</sub>), and 7 (D<sub>7</sub>) from the wounds of each group. For histopathology, 10% buffered neutral formalin solution was used to fix the dermis and epidermis tissues. Preparation of histopathological slides was carried out according to the method of Luna [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The whole procedure was conducted at the Pathology Laboratory of the Department of Pathobiology, FVMAS, BSMRAU, Gazipur-1706. The stained slides were examined at a 4x objective view under an inverted microscope (Primovert<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Compact inverted microscope, Germany) in the Central Laboratory of FVMAS, BSMRAU, Gazipur-1706, to identify reactive cells, debris, clots, and keratin layer among the test and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were shown as Mean &#x000b1; SEM.

The value of probability, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, was regarded as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eighteen incised wounds were classified into three groups, which consisted of six wounds in each group. The first two groups were treated with marigold leaf paste and turmeric root paste to evaluate their healing effects. Another six wounds were treated with normal saline and were considered as control. Morphological, microbiological, and histopathological changes were studied to assess and compare the groups&#x02019; healing efficiency.</p><sec><title>Morphological changes</title><p>In this study, parameters such as swollen area (mm), the altitude of suture line (mm), wound contraction, and girth of sutured area (mm) of wounds were estimated. The swelling was detected up to D<sub>3</sub> post-operation in all groups. The more swollen area (11.78 &#x000b1; 0.38 mm) in the wounds was seen in the case of the control group treated with normal saline solution. Marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups resulted in swollen areas of 11.44 &#x000b1; 0.20 mm and 11.52 &#x000b1; 0.27 mm, respectively, which were lesser than the control. However, the differences in swelled areas of wounds among the groups differed insignificantly.</p><p>The external sutures were detached on the D<sub>7</sub> post-operation, and suture lines&#x02019; altitudes were recorded. The height of suture lines in marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups was 2.44 &#x000b1; 0.12 mm and 2.74 &#x000b1; 0.13 mm, respectively, which were remarkably lower than the control (3.68 &#x000b1; 0.14 mm) (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Moreover, epidermal regeneration and the proliferation of connective tissue (thickening of the keratin layer) were more prominent in the wound treated with marigold leaves paste than the other two groups (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, and <xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The sutured wound&#x02019;s breadth was documented from D<sub>0</sub> up to D<sub>21</sub> to realize the reduction of the wound. Results indicated that the sutured area&#x02019;s breadth was remarkably reduced from the D<sub>7</sub> (<xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) irrespective of treatments. Wound contraction is the inward motion of cutting edges that helps close a wound, which occurs throughout 5&#x02013;15 days of wounding [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Insignificant (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05) difference was detected in terms of the weekly decline of contraction length (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in the wounds of all groups. This result conforms with the proposition of Yannas et al. [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. They stated that in the skin, the spontaneous wound healing process occurred through a contractile mechanical area to make collagen fiber meshwork. They also noted that contraction and regeneration of wounds are belligerently related to each other, where wound contraction is a dominant process during the natural healing of wounds.</p><p>Among the three treatment groups, the marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste resulted in a lower elevation of the suture line and a swollen area of wounds compared to control. Therefore, the results suggested an obvious tissue reaction in the wounds, which was established by histopathological findings. Infiltration of various inflammatory cells, the existence of hemorrhages, and proliferation of fibroblast tissue were characterized in the histopathological study. This experiment&#x02019;s histological results revealed noticeable infiltration of macrophages in samples obtained from marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated group from D<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>7</sub> (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, and <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Still, less infiltration of macrophages existed in control (<xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b and c</xref>). The infiltration of macrophages indicates the stimulatory effect of the healing of marigold leaves and turmeric paste. The macrophage is beneficial for healing, which promotes inflammation. As a multifunctional cell, the macrophage reduces fibrous and scar tissue formation and improves wounds&#x02019; healing [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The application of marigold leaf extracts twice daily for 3 weeks achieved complete epithelialization in all patients and reduced 41.71% of venous ulcers&#x02019; surface in the leg [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, marigold leaf paste exhibited better efficacy in the restorative activity of incised wounds.</p><p>The microbiological study suggested different bacterial colonies were absent in the samples of marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups following D<sub>1</sub>. However, the bacterial colonies existed in the culture of samples of the normal saline-treated group until D<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, through Gram stain, cultured samples proved the existence of <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>spp. and <italic>E. coli</italic>. The bacteria gradually reduced their susceptibility to elimination by the host immune response and antibiotics. Different types of bacteria, such as<italic> Staphylococcus </italic>spp., hemolytic <italic>Streptococci</italic>, and<italic> Pseudomonas </italic>spp<italic>. </italic>are mostly found in surgical wounds [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We have discovered the splendid antibacterial activity of both the marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste in wound healing in sheep, which is analogous to the findings of Nandita et al. [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Dasgupta et al. [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They showed the comparative antibacterial action of marigold leaves extracts against <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>.</p><fig id="figure2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Histological analysis of wound healing processes with marigold leaf paste-treated group stained with H&#x00026;E (4x).

[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the marigold plant has some unique phytoconstituents useful in wound healing. They also stated that marigolds&#x02019; pharmacological aspects have antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal, insecticidal, nematocidal, mosquitocidal, and wound healing activity. Various phytochemicals such as thiophenes, flavonoids, carotenoids, and triterpenoids are isolated from different parts of the plant. Flavonoids have antibacterial activity, and hydro-alcoholic extract of leaves have anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Dasgupta et al. [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] stated that marigold leaf extract has excellent blood clotting properties. Different phenolic composites (gallic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and scopoletin) were recognized and measured for blood coagulation. The counts of white blood cells and platelet were increased significantly by the marigold extract. Several alkaloids and calcium ions in the marigold extracts shortened the bleeding and clotting times [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, various ingredients such as bisacurone B, ar-turmerone, bisdemethoxycurcumin demethoxycurcumin, and curcumin are found in turmeric [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Among them, curcumin is the most active component of <italic>C. longa</italic>. It has different bio-functional properties like a free radical scavenger, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities that help in wound healing progression [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. According to Zdrojewicz et al. [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], curcumin has wide-ranging applications and anti-inflammatory effects in the cure of various ailments, such as diseases dermis, arthritis, psoriasis, acne, and itching. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory activity and an anti-metastatic impact as well [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>On the contrary, Paul et al. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] stated that the clinical efficacy of marigold flower paste was not as satisfactory as the turmeric in the wound healing of goat, which is slightly contradictory to our findings. But in their experiment, they did not explain the reasons suggesting their conclusions. The difference in animal species and the use of flowers instead of leaves of marigold might be the reason for this variation.</p><p>Some postoperative complications such as excessive swelling, exudation with a foul odor, and stitch abscess in the control group were treated with normal saline. In this research, marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste showed outstanding wound healing progress devoid of any postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the morphological parameters of wounds and the bacteriological study suggest that both the marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste are similarly effective in healing the incised wound in sheep. However, histopathological studies indicate that the marigold leaf paste is more effective in recovering wounds than the turmeric paste. Therefore, veterinary practitioners may use the pastes of marigold leaf and turmeric as herbal medicine to treat superficial wounds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge and are sincerely grateful to the authority and staff of the Research Animal Farm and Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, BAU, Mymensingh-2202, for their kind support throughout the study period.
