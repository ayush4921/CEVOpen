<p>The external sutures were detached on the D
 <sub>7</sub> post-operation, and suture lines’ altitudes were recorded. The height of suture lines in marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups was 2.44 ± 0.12 mm and 2.74 ± 0.13 mm, respectively, which were remarkably lower than the control (3.68 ± 0.14 mm) (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the presence of a significantly lower elevation of the suture line and the less swollen area indicates better anti-inflammatory effects in the wounds of the marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste-treated groups than that of the control group.
