<p>Six healthy sheep were collected for this study and separated into three equal groups, and each group confined two sheep with three wounds in each. By ensuring the animal’s presurgical preparations, three wounds (incised) in each sheep were produced aseptically through a vertical incision in the flank region’s skin. The incised wounds were approximately 2.5 cm long and 1.0 cm deep. A horizontal mattress suture (8-mm apart) with silk (black braided non-absorbable suture material waxed silk, U.S.P 2-0; Japan) was used for wound closure. The average distance between suture bites and the border of wound edges was 5 mm. No antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antihistaminic drugs were applied for the healing of the wounds. The fresh marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste (turmeric powder:distilled water = 1:1) were prepared daily just before application. Six incised wounds were treated with marigold leaves paste locally for 7 days. Another six wounds were treated with turmeric paste in the same way. The remaining six wounds were treated with 0.9% normal saline (NS
 <sup>®</sup>, The Acme Laboratories Ltd., Bangladesh) for 7 days and considered as a control. After 7 days of treatment, sutures were removed and maintained carefully to avoid the formation of granulation tissues.
