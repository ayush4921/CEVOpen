<p>Routine follow-up data were documented up to day 21 (D
 <sub>21</sub>). Various morphological wound factors, such as swelling area (mm), the width of the sutured area (mm), the elevation of suture line (mm), and the wound contraction per week (mm), were measured using slide calipers. The swelling area of the wound was measured for up to 3 days. The sutures were removed after 7 days, and elevation of the suture line was noted. The width of the suture area was recorded on days 0 (D
 <sub>0</sub>), 3 (D
 <sub>3</sub>), 7 (D
 <sub>7</sub>), 14 (D
 <sub>14</sub>), and 21 (D
 <sub>21</sub>) to determine the status of healing. All wounds were supervised daily to note any complications, such as hemorrhage, unusual swelling, wound dehiscence, stitch abscess, exudation, putrefaction, and infection.
