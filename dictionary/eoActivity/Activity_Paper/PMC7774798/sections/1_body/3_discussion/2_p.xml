<p>Among the three treatment groups, the marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste resulted in a lower elevation of the suture line and a swollen area of wounds compared to control. Therefore, the results suggested an obvious tissue reaction in the wounds, which was established by histopathological findings. Infiltration of various inflammatory cells, the existence of hemorrhages, and proliferation of fibroblast tissue were characterized in the histopathological study. This experiment’s histological results revealed noticeable infiltration of macrophages in samples obtained from marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated group from D
 <sub>3</sub> to D
 <sub>7</sub> (

The macrophage is beneficial for healing, which promotes inflammation. As a multifunctional cell, the macrophage reduces fibrous and scar tissue formation and improves wounds’ healing [
