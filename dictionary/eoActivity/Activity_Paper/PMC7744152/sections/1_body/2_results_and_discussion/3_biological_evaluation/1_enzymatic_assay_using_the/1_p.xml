<p>In the next step of our investigation, the synthesised new STS inhibitors based on 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> were tested in the enzymatic assay (at 0.5 µM of inhibitor concentration) in order to verify their theoretical potential to inhibit of the STS activity. Screening tests were performed using the STS enzyme isolated from the human placenta and purified by a 3-step chromatography procedure. After purification, the obtained fraction was used directly as the enzyme source. In this activity assay, a radiolabelled [
 <sup>3</sup>H] oestrone sulphate has been used as a substrate to provide higher selectivity and more reliable results. The summarised results of the enzymatic assay for newly synthesised 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The received data showed that all compounds effectively inhibited the activity of the steroid sulphatase to a level from 7.98 to 27.17%. In the course of the research, we found that the highest inhibitory activity was exhibited by the compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> containing three fluorine atoms in its structure (remaining STS activity of 7.98%). This result was in agreement with the data from the molecular modelling studies. It was observed that the substitution of the terminal aromatic ring with a less halogen atoms resulted in a decrease in the activity of the tested compounds towards STS. This observation may confirm our assumptions that the higher number of electronegative heteroatoms may reduce the pKa value of the inhibitor cores, making them more susceptible to nucleophilic substitution reaction on the sulphur atom. The obtained results may also suggest that the position of the halogen substitution in the above-mentioned aryl ring may be crucial for the potency of evaluated compounds. As it turns out, the presence of halogen atoms at the R
 <sub>1</sub> and R
 <sub>2</sub> positions may have the greatest influence on the increase of inhibitory potency. On the other hand, the type of substituent is slightly less significant.
