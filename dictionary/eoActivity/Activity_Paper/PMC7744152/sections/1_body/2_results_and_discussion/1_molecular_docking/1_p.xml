<p>Initially, to verify that the 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives are able to effectively bind to the STS active site, molecular docking studies were performed. The X-ray structure of STS was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank accession code 1P49) and properly prepared for docking calculations. The docking procedure of the optimised ligands was performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software (Molecular Graphics Laboratory, The Scripps Research Institute, LaJolla, CA). The calculated results for the proposed structures of the inhibitors 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> were at a satisfactory, comparable level in the range of −6.0 to −8.3 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (the measurement error for the AutoDock Vina software is 2.85 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and lower than the free energy of binding value of the reference inhibitor 
 <italic>Irosustat</italic> (–5.4 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). The most favourable binding energy was determined for compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> (–8.3 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) suggesting that this compound could theoretically create the most stable inhibitor-enzyme complex in the STS active site, leading to effective inhibition.
