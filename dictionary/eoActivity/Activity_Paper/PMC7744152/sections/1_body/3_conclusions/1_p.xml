<p>In the present work, we described our research on molecular modelling, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> as new very potent STS inhibitors. Screening enzymatic assay, performed using the STS enzyme isolated from the human placenta indicated that all of the newly synthesised inhibitors 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> were able to effectively inhibit the action of STS. Among them, the highest inhibitory activity was exhibited by compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> containing three fluorine atoms in its structure (remaining STS activity of 7.98%). In the course of the cell line experiment, we observed the highest inhibition of STS in the presence of 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamates 
 <bold>3I</bold>, 
 <bold>3K</bold>, and 
 <bold>3L</bold> characterised by low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 30.14, 17.02, 15.97 nM, respectively (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value determined for 
 <italic>Irosustat</italic> was 1.14 nM). The presented results showed that 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives may be very promising anticancer agents and their therapeutic potential should be confirmed in further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Furthermore, the data of enzymatic and cell line experiments suggested that the possibility of creating electrostatic interactions between the fluorine atoms of compounds and the Arg98 residue in the active site of STS as well as a higher susceptibility to nucleophilic substitution reaction on the sulphur atom could be critical for their inhibitory effects.
