<p>In the present work, we described our recent research on the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of compounds based on non-steroidal core containing triazole and naphthalene rings in their structure as new and potent STS inhibitors. The presence of the triazole ring in the structure of obtained compounds is justified by the fact that triazoles are a class of compounds showing very attractive properties and are successfully used in the design of new pharmaceuticals

 </xref>. One of the most important triazoles feature is that they do not undergo hydrolysis under acidic, basic, and redox conditions and they are stable to metabolic degradation. Moreover, these compounds are weakly acidic and weakly basic. Some properties like hydrogen bond formation, π-π stacking interaction, strong dipole moments, and bioisosteric effects make triazole derivatives an attractive type of compounds in the field of medicinal chemistry. Despite the fact that 1,2,3-triazoles do not exist in the nature
