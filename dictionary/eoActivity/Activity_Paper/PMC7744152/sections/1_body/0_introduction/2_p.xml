<p>Nowadays, STS has been considered as an attractive molecular target for the development of hormone-dependent cancer therapies, and therefore, the synthesis of new, efficient, selective STS inhibitors is of particular importance for modern medicinal chemistry. Recently, there has been intensive research towards finding novel STS inhibitors. Scientists have developed, both, steroidal and non-steroidal compounds containing various functional groups (e.g. sulphamate and phosphorus moieties)
