<p>Docking calculations of the optimised ligands to the prepared structure of human STS were carried out with AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software (The Molecular Graphic Laboratory, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA)

 </xref>. For all of docking studies, a grid box was centred on the Cβ atom of amino acid 75 of the prepared STS structure, and the size of the grid box was 24 Å × 24 Å × 24 Å. Then, the best binding modes for a particular ligand were inspected visually. Illustrations of the 3D models were prepared using VMD 1.9 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA)
