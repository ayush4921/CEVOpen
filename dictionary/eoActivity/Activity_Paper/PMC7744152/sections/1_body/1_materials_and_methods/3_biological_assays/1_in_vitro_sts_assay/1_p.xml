 </xref>. The reaction mixtures, at a final volume of 100 µL, containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.4, 3 nM radiolabelled [
 <sup>3</sup>H] oestrone sulphate, various concentrations of inhibitor and 5 U of purified enzyme (1 U is the amount of enzyme that hydrolyses 100 nM radiolabelled [
 <sup>3</sup>H] oestrone sulphate in 1 h at 37 °C). The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the reaction mixtures (90 µL) were collected from each well, and the product formed by STS-mediated hydrolysis of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]E1 was extracted with toluene (0.5 ml). Next 0.3 ml of toluene was combined with 0.3 ml of scintillation liquid. STS activity was measured using the radioluminometer MicroBeta (Perkin Elmer). Assays were performed in triplicate.
