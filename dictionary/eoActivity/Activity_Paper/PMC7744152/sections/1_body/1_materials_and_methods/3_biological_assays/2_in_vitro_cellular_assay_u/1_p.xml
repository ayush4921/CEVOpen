<p>Inhibition of STS activity in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was measured according to the method described by Purohit et al.

 </xref>. MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% of foetal bovine serum and cultured until 80% of confluence was received. Cells were seeded in 24-well microplates (Nest Biotechnology) at a density of 1·10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. In order to assure an equal amount of cells in each reaction sample the number of cells was determined using a Bürker Counting Chamber. The STS activity was evaluated in living MCF-7 cells. Incubation of cells was conducted for 20 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator in a serum-free medium (0.5 ml) with radiolabelled oestrone sulphate [
 <sup>3</sup>H]E1S (4·105 cpm, 3 nM) with or without an inhibitor. After incubation, a medium containing STS-mediated reaction product was collected (0.45 ml) from each well and the product was isolated from the mixture by extraction with toluene (4 ml). The STS activity expressed as the level of product radioactivity was measured using the Radioluminometer MicroBeta (Perkin Elmer). Cellular assay was carried out in triplicate. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
