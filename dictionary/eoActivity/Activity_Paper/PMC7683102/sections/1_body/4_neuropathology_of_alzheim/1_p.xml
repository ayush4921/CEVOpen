<p>AD is mainly characterized by the loss of brain cells and synapses in subcortical regions and cerebral cortex, resulting in the degeneration of the parts of cingulate gyrus and frontal cortex including the parietal and temporal lobes. Therefore, numerous cases of MCI are diagnosed with a reduced brain size as compared to that of a healthy individual [

 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While plaques are formed around the neurons due to the deposition of dense and insoluble AÎ² proteins, neurofibrillary tangles are the aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins accumulated inside the neurons. As a consequence of aging, fewer individuals might develop certain tangles and plaques when compared with the patients suffering from AD, who would display a greater number of tangles and plaques in the temporal lobe region [
