<p>The initiation of AD occurrence involves a complex pathogenic process which may have started decades before the symptomatic phase arrives. Early stage treatment addressing the problem at molecular levels at which the initial structural alterations occur would translate into a successful therapy. Currently, such disease-modifying drugs designed to be used in the early stages of AD are in the developmental stage. Multifactorial pathogenesis of AD addressing various molecular targets seems to be the possible approach to be followed modify the disease progression. Thus, the drugs having multimodal action or the combination of drugs targeting the single molecular mechanism promise alternative AD therapy.</p>
