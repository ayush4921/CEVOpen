<p>AD is characterized into give different stages: 1) Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Mild AD; 3) Moderate AD; 4) Severe AD; and 5) Very Severe AD. Several studies suggest that the very early phase may be regarded MCI, which may remain unchanged for years, characterized by predominant loss of memory along with cognitive deficits. Whatsoever, there is no clear evidence for this disease. An ambiguity does prevail regarding MCI, with a few concluding it to be an AD precursor, while others classify it a normal aging phenomenon. Despite the debate, few studies have reported that cognitive impairment is the precursor causing dementia which is 15-fold more likely than normal aging to progress into AD. Presently, both early metabolic and structural changes in the brain can be identified using imaging techniques, whereas there is no single screening technique/test to identify the individuals affected with MCI. In such a situation, people with cognitive decline can be accurately predicted utilizing the combination tests involving neuroimaging and neuropsychology.</p>
