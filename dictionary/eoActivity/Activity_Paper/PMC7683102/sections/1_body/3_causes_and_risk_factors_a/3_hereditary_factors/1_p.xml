<p>AD caused due to genetic heritability ranges from 49% to 79%, according to the studies conducted on familial history [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of the above, only 0.1% of the cases have been symptomatic at the age of 65 or earlier, mostly due to the autosomal dominant inheritance, amounting to an early-onset disease [
 <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In any such case, the autosomal changes or mutations have been reported to occur in one of the three genes, 
 <italic>viz.</italic> the genes encoding for presenilins 1 and 2, and the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (
 <italic>APP</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a reported upregulation of AÎ²
 <sub>42</sub>, a small protein that happens to be the main component of senile plaques, production due to the above-mentioned gene mutation [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, two other genes, 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> (Sortilin related receptor 1) and 
 <italic>ABCA7</italic> (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A member 7), have been identified to be associated with the autosomal dominant inheritance in AD [
