<p>Delaying or slowing down AD progression as well as postponing or preventing the disease in an older age can assure a consequential quality of life and health improvement. The high/elevated amounts of saturated fats may have negative effects on the age-related MCI and cognitive decline [

 <italic>APOE4</italic>) concentrations, low cognitive and physical activity, high cholesterol and diabetes. Promisingly, a few of the above-mentioned risk factors are modifiable [

Recent studies have shown that the risk of dementia and cognitive decline could be reduced with the possible association toward fish consumption resulting in uptake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids. On the contrary, consumption of dairy products with whole fats by elderly people might lead to cognitive decline [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moderate or light consumption of alcohol is also associated with a reduced risk of AD and incidence of dementia. There is limited evidence on how vegetable and fruit consumption may generally play a neuroprotective role against dementia, AD, and cognitive decline [
