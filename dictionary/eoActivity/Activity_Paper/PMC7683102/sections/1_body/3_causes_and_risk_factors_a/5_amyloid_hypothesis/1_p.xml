<p>The amyloid hypothesis, proposed in 1991, reasoned that AD occurred due to the presence of accumulated Aβ proteins [

 <italic>APP</italic> gene, responsible for the production of Aβ protein, is located on the 21st chromosome and people exhibiting Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) carried an extra copy of this gene thus having the earliest recorded symptom(s) of AD by the age of 40 years [

 <italic>APOE4</italic> has been considered the major risk factor for AD as it helps in the breakdown of Aβ, while some isoforms of 
 <italic>APOE4</italic> are not very effective resulting in excess neural deposition of the amyloid [

Researchers suspect that non-plaque Aβ oligomers referred to as ADDLs (amyloid-derived diffusible ligands) are the aggregates of several monomers which are the pathogenic primary forms of Aβ. The ADDLs modify the structure of synapse by binding to the neurons through surface receptor, causing a breakdown of neuronal communication [
