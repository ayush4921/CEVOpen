<p>This hypothesis was updated recently to suggest that there is a major culprit, N-APP, that not only causes AD but was also closely related to the Aβ protein. N-APP has been identified to be a fragment of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) peptide’s N-terminus, eventually cleaved or broken-down from AβPP that is adjacent to the Aβ protein. This fragment, N-APP, binds to the neural receptor DR6 (death receptor 6). Also known as the TNFRSF21, to trigger a self-destruction pathway in the neuronal cells. The N-APP-DR6 pathway was reported to further damage the aging human brain as those brain regions affected by AD overexpress DR6 [
