<p>As mentioned earlier, the 
 <italic>APP</italic> gene is located on chromosome 21 and is expressed in specific cells of the body including glia, neurons, and endothelia [
 <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. AβPP occurs naturally in three major isoforms, AβPP
 <sub>770</sub>, AβPP
 <sub>751</sub>, and AβPP
 <sub>695</sub>, obtained as the result of alternate splicing of pre-mRNA. The AβPP
 <sub>695</sub> isoform lacks a KPI (Kunitz protease inhibitor) domain, in the extracellular region. In an event of AD, AβPP
 <sub>695</sub> has been reported to be overexpressed as compared to the other isoforms, at a ratio of 1:10:20 (AβPP
 <sub>770</sub>:AβPP
 <sub>751</sub>:AβPP
 <sub>695</sub>) [
