<p>This hypothesis is based on the fact that cholinergic neurons use ACh for cognitive processes of central and peripheral nervous systems apart from modulating several important neural functions. The cholinergic neurons, mainly found in the basal forebrain, spinal cord, striatum, medial habenula, and olfactory tubercle, are involved in vital physiological aspects such as memory, wakefulness and sleep, learning, sensory information, attention, and stress response-management. The CA3 cholinergic receptor is mainly involved in memory management, thus blocking this receptor might impair the functions of memory and information management in the brain. This consequent dopaminergic impairment and loss of cholinergic neurons was presumed to be the main factor responsible for the psychiatric symptoms related to AD [
