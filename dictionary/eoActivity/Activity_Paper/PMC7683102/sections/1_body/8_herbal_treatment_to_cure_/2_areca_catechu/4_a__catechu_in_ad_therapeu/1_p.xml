<p>The effects of arecoline on the nervous system was investigated to know its effect on dementia. Results suggested an improved memory and cognitive skills by stimulating the M receptor (muscarinic receptor). Thereby, concluding that arecoline is one of the muscarinic agonists that work on memory improvement. The hydrolyzed product of arecoline, arecaidine also showed an inhibitory effect towards the central inhibitory transmitter. Arecoline bypasses the blood-brain barrier to activate the M receptor in the central nervous system. Further investigations proved that arecoline can clinically improve memory, thinking skills, and cognitive functions in patients suffering from AD [
