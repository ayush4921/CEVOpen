<p>Several studies have reported six 
 <italic>A. catechu</italic> alkaloids, identified as isoguvacine, homoarecoline, arecaidine, arecoline, guavacine, and guavacoline [
 <xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Reports suggest that guavacine and arecaidine are the hydrolyzed products of guavacoline and arecoline, respectively. Among these alkaloids, areciadine (0.31–0.66%) and arecoline (0.30–0.63%) were found more in number as compared to guavacine (0.19–0.72%) and guavacoline (0.03–0.06%). Additionally, various fatty acid constituents, decanoic acid, stearic acid and monoethylenic acids, are present in minor proportions, while linoleic acid (5.4%), oleic acid (6.2%), hexadecenoic acid (7.2%), palmitic acid (12.7%), lauric acid (19.5%), and myristic acid (46.2%) can be found in major proportions. On the maturity of nut, there is an increase in the number of fibers, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and fats, while the polyphenol levels are found to decrease [
