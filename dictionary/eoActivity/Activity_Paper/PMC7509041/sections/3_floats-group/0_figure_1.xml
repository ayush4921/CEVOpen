  <p>Effects of pectolinarin on cell viability and gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones in the PC12 cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The cells were under the incubator for 24 h with diverse concentrations of pectolinarin (0–0.1 mg/ml). Then cell viability assay was performed using MTT kit (Sigma-Aldrich). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The cells were treated with pectolinarin (10 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h. The results of gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones of disulfide isomerase (PDI), binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), calexin and ERp29. The RT-PCR outcomes were checked three times.
