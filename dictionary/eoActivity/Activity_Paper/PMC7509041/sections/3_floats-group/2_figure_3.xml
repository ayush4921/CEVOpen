  <p>Pectolinarin causes apoptosis in the PC12 cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The cells were treated with pectolinarin (10 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h. RT-PCR was performed against various mRNAs; LC3a and Beclin-1 LC3a, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; Beclin, coiled-coil moesin-like BCL2 interacting protein; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X; Bad, Bcl-2-associated death promoter; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; Bcl-xl, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-x long, respectively. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> To make sure DNA fragmentation, the cells were dealt with pectolinarin (10 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h, respectively. The DNA was lysed on a 1.5% agarose gel and pictured with Ethidium bromide, an intercalating agent. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The cells were dealt with the same conditions of the above 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and mixed with Hoechst 33342 solution to perceive the formation of apoptotic bodies indicated by arrows. Mixed nuclei were detected from a fluorescent microscope employing a blue filter.
