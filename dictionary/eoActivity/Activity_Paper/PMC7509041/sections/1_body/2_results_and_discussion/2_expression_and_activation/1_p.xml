<p>Although pectolinarin induces unremarkable cell viability and endoplasmic reticulum chaperone expression, next we have examined the gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors (ATF6, PERK and IRE1) and the activations by pectolinarin treatment on the PC 12 cells. Under altered endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, the endoplasmic reticulum stress signal transduction pathway is mediated 
 <italic>via</italic> being active of ER(endoplasmic reticulum)- stress sensors. IRE1 activates XBP mRNA cleaving, producing an activated form of the XBP1 protein. PERK induces phosphorylation of the eIF2Î±, which hinders translation initiation. Active ATF6 is cleaved at the cytosolic face and the resulting N-terminal cytoplasmic domain ties to the endoplasmic reticulum stress-responding element, which enhances endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gene expression (
