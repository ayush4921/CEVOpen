<p>Apoptosis shows two typical cell changes, it morphologically makes apoptotic bodies by cell shrinkage and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is being used as a useful marker for identification of apoptotic cells detection of both apoptotic bodies by microscope and apoptotic DNA fragmentation

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In this study, to confirm that pectolinarin induces apoptosis, we investigated PC12 cells treated by pectolinarin that shows apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation or not. As a result, inter-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation increased in cells treated with pectolinarin dose-dependently (
