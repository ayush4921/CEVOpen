<p>If early cellular responses fail to maintain endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum stress that activates UPR signal to stimulate the apoptosis as well as this autophagy for cell survival or local cell death. Already, there are already some reports that UPR strongly associated with both apoptosis and autophagy by several regulators, such as for apoptosis (Bax, Bak, Bcl2 and Bcl-xl) and autophagy (LC3a and Beclin) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, nonetheless, pectolinarin induces mild endoplasmic reticulum chaperone expression, the ER stress sensors are actively induced. These findings provide new insights that the mild endoplasmic reticulum stress through PERK-eIF2Î±-p or/and ATF6 fragmentation indicating pathway has a main role in saving cellular damage from pectolinarin. We therefore tested the role of instantaneous endoplasmic reticulum stress in both apoptosis and autophagy induction of bystander cells treated with pectolinarin. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> showed that the pectolinarin induces only the expression of pro-apoptosis (Bax and Bak), no meaningful expression of anti-apoptosis (Bcl2 and Bcl-xl) and autophagy (LC3a and Beclin) induction. The result may provide an evidence indicating that pectolinarin induces apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling but not autophagy.
