<p>These results indicate that TA extracts at smaller doses have a small amount of bioactive substances and probably are diffused across the plasma membrane in low concentrations to impart any toxicity effect. Therefore, the highest doses of plant extract which are beyond the concentrations used in commercial products would have bioactive constituents in adequate quantities to be toxic. Intriguingly, the outcome of this effect depends on the duration of interaction between the extract components and the cells. Thus, this interaction will decide the uptake of bioactive components by cells and their impact on cell viability. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the lower doses of such plant extracts, firstly, display a safe toxicity profile and, secondly, are not deleterious to skin fibroblasts. Therefore, being incorporated into the commercial products in smaller doses will enhance their effectiveness.</p>
