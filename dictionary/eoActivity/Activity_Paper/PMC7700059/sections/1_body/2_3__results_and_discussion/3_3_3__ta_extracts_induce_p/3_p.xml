<p>Previous studies revealed that quercetin reduces the oxidative damage of skin cells by acting as a powerful protectant against H₂O₂-mediated oxidative insults and effectively protects cell death mechanisms at a 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M dose [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, we use quercetin as the positive control in our study to evaluate the level of protection against H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress. In comparison to TA extracts, the positive control quercetin (16 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) protects cells significantly at all time points when exposed to H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress for 1 h. Pretreatment with varying doses (27.5, 55, 110, and 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of TA extract for 4 h, followed by H₂O₂-mediated oxidative insult, offers protection in a dose-dependent manner. Significant protection (11–17%) was offered at 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, followed by 6–9% at 110 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL; however, positive control quercetin offers 42–45% protection against H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress (
