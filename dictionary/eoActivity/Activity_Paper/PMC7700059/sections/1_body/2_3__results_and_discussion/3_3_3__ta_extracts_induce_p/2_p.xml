<p>The vulnerable targets of free radicals and ROS are cell membrane, lipids, DNA, and proteins [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Under oxidative stress conditions, the body's own antioxidant system is not sufficient to neutralize free radicals and ROS effectively; hence, it is dependent on exogenous sources [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Owing to the presence of high antioxidant compounds, the plants are the main exogenous source of antioxidants in the form of fruits, dietary products, and cosmetic products derived from natural sources to enrich the antioxidant level in our body to neutralize free radicals and ROS effectively [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Various plant extracts can display antioxidant potential by neutralizing free radicals produced during physiological reactions [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of TA extract for different time points (4, 24, and 48 h), followed by 300

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], to evaluate the protective effect of TA extract. The cell killing induced by H₂O₂-mediated by oxidative stress in untreated cells was significantly different from cells pretreated with TA extract in both dose- and time-dependent ways. Owing to the production of ROS, the percentage of cell viability varies when H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress was induced. Pretreatment with TA extracts offers significant protection at higher concentrations as well as different time points in skin fibroblasts against H₂O₂-mediated cell death.
