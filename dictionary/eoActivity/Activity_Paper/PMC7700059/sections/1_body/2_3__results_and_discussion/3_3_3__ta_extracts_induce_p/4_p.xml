<p>As evidenced by the high survival percentage of Hs27 fibroblasts in solely TA extract treatment compared to pretreatment with TA, this was followed by H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Similarly, significant protection at 14–15% and 25–33% at doses of 110 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, were noticed when Hs27 fibroblasts were pretreated with TA extract for 24 h followed by oxidative stress with H₂O₂ for 1 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although we observe a maximum cell toxicity effect after 48 h of treatment with larger doses of TA extract alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), pretreatment of Hs27 cells with TA extracts in a dose-dependent way for 48 h was followed by 1 h exposure to H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress. We observed significant protection at 16–23%, 26–34%, and 39–44% at doses of 55 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 110 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The relative cell survival after pretreatment with TA extracts followed by exposure to H₂O₂ for 1 h was significantly higher than untreated cells following exposure to H₂O₂. The high percentage of protection offered to Hs27 fibroblasts after 48 h exposure to TA extracts followed by oxidative stress-induced by H₂O₂ could be due to enough time being required for bioactive compounds. These are present in TA extract and can enter the cells and offer protection by neutralizing free radicals generated during exposure to H₂O₂. Although the higher concentrations for a longer period of time show significant cell death, at lower doses for a longer time point, they do not exhibit toxic effects to Hs27 fibroblasts. Nonetheless, they permit bioactive compounds to pass through the cell membrane. These bioactive compounds have antioxidant potential and protect cells against any exposure to free radicals generated by H₂O₂.
