<p>The generation of free radicals and ROS leads to oxidative stress which in turn leads to various ailments in the human body [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is one of the most common forms of ROS, generated in the cellular models when exposed to UV radiation and pollutants. Depending on the level of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the cellular system, it may help in wound healing by acting as a secondary messenger and remodulating signaling to repair damaged tissue. Nonetheless, excessive production of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may lead to inflammation and induce oxidative stress in cellular models [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> promotes oxidative damage to cellular models by augmenting MAPK-dependent cell death mechanisms [
