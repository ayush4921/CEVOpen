<p>Cell viability was determined by a well-known MTT assay as per the standard protocol [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> Hs27 cells were harvested and plated in each well of the 96-well plate and subsequently attached to the bottom of the well overnight at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. After they had properly adhered to the bottom surface of the well, the cells were exposed to the varying (27.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) doses of each extract along with untreated control for 24 h in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. Subsequently, after 24 h, each well-containing cell had 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MTT solution (2.5 mg/mL) added to it and incubated for 3 to 4 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. The formazan crystals formed by the interaction of MTT dye with succinyl dehydrogenase of mitochondria of live cells were dissolved in DMSO. The solution thus obtained appears to be measured at 570 nm wavelength using a multiplate reader. The absorbance recorded was analyzed and results were expressed as percentage cell viability of TA extract-treated cells compared to the untreated control cells.
