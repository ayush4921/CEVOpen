<p>The TAC of TA extracts was determined by a standard method [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with only slight modifications. Briefly, 0.5 mL of varying concentrations of TA extracts along with standard compound (ascorbic acid) was mixed with a 3 mL mixture (1% ammonium molybdate, 28 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.6 M sulphuric acid) in the test tubes. After ensuring complete mixing by gentle vortex, the mixtures in the glass test tubes were incubated for 10 min at 95°C. Once the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled down at room temperature and using a spectrophotometer, optical density of the reaction mixture was measured at 695 nm after being normalized with a blank. Increase in optical density of the reaction mixture is directly proportional to the TAC of TA extracts.
