<p>Inhibition of VEGFR2 activity has been proposed as an important strategy for the clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] have extensively studied the effects of CA on its cellular regulating effects found that CA inhibits VEGFR2 kinase activity by directly interacting with the ATP-binding pocket. Moreover, they found CA could decrease the VEGFR2/Src/FAK/Cdc42 axis, subsequently decreasing F-actin formation and migratory activity
