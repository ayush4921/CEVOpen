 <italic>Cudrania cochinchinensis</italic> (Moraceae) has been reported for its potent biological activites such as: anti-inflammation [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and neuroprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Whereas, the compound 
 <italic>Cudraxanthone-S</italic> derived from 
 <italic>C. cochinchinensis</italic> was studied for its pharmacokinetics and binding potential in treating the fungal infection of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which could cause several lethal infections in immune-suppressed patients and recently emerged as drug-resistant pathogens worldwide [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Authors found that
