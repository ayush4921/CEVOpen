<p>Natural products and their molecular frameworks have a long tradition as valuable starting points for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Recently, there has been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation. Although currently, there have been no reports on the natural product, which could play a therapeutic role in bone loss diseases (osteoporosis and osteolysis) through the regulation of Rac1/2 and Cdc42 during osteoclasts cytoskeletal structuring. There have been several excellent studies exploring the therapeutic potentials of various natural products in regulating cancer cells migration and function (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Here we collected several natural products with a focus on recent advances in their properties on the regulation of Rac1 and/or Rac2 and Cdc42, and related signaling molecules, in order to inspire drug discovery in regulating osteoclastogenesis (
