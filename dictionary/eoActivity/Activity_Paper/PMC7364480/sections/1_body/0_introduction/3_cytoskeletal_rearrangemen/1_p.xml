<p>It is worthy to note that during the cytoskeletal rearrangement in the osteoclastogenesis, podosome is the most prominent cytoskeletal structure for the degradation of mineralized bone matrix and associates with the mobility of osteoclasts [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In fact, podosome is not the exclusive organelle in osteoclast, which also includes endothelial cells, and cells from the monocytic lineage such as: dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regardless, the presentation of podosomes in various cells, podosomes patterning plays a crucial and unique role in the support osteoclast final maturation [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As early as individual podosome forms within an osteoclast, they are collectively and sequentially organized into different patterns along the life of the same cell. However, these patterns evolve along with osteoclastogenesis from monocytes/macrophages to osteoclast precursors, further to the bone resorptive matured osteoclast. In the early stage of osteoclastogenesis, podosome pattern from apparently random groups of ‘clusters’ to circle pattern ‘rings’ in the middle-term stage [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Eventually, in the late stage of osteoclastogenesis, podosome patterns into much massive circular structures, i.e., either ‘sealing zone like structures’ (SZL, also known as ‘belts’) or ‘sealing zones’ (SZ) [
