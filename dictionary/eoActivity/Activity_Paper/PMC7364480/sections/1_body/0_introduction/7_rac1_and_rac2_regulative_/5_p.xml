<p>As aforementioned, cytoskeletal structure rearrangement grant various cellular functions in various cell linages, such as: podosome patterning in osteoclasts and EMT transition. This has led to a surge in the efforts for identification of safer and more effective compounds which can modulate these cellular behaviors. 
 <italic>Plectranthoic acid</italic> (PA), a natural compound isolated from the extracts of 
 <italic>Ficus microcarpa</italic>, has been reported to possess the capability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [
