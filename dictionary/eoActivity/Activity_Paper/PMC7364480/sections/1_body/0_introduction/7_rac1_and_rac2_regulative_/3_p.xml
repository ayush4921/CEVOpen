 <italic>Diallyl disulfide</italic> (DADS), one of the sulfur compounds derived from garlic, exhibits biological activity via modulating molecules and signaling pathways in various cell physiologies [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53–57</xref>]. These properties suggesting that DADS could be used as a potential therapeutic compound for the treatment or prevention of various diseases. Moreover, study has demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) could promote epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and proliferation through the activation of Rac1 and β-catenin signaling pathways. Therefore, Su et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] have conducted a study for investigating the effects of DADS on TGF-β1-induced EMT and cellular invasion. Primarily, they found TGF-β1 treatment augmented EMT and invasion, concomitantly with increased expression of Rac1 and β-catenin. However, the DADS treatment could decrease the activities of Rac1 and β-catenin. DADS, TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor as well as Rac1 inhibitor antagonized the up-regulation of the TGF-β1-induced expression of these genes, abolishing the enhanced effects of TGF-β1 on EMT and invasion. These data indicated that the blockage of TGF-β1/Rac1 signaling by DADS may be responsible for the suppression of EMT and cellular invasion.
