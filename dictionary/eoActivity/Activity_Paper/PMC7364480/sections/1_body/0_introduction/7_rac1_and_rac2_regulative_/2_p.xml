 <italic>Deacetyl-mycoepoxydiene</italic> (DA-MED) is a 248 molecular weight compound that has been isolated from the endophytic fungus, 
 <italic>Phomopsis sp.</italic>, of 
 <italic>costal mangrove</italic> plants and has been shown to be a secondary metabolite with a rare oxygen-bridged cyclopentadiene skeleton [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This compound has cytotoxic activities toward various cell lines, including A549, HCC-S102 and HepG2 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.05 to 1.95 mg/ml. Recently, Xie et al. [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] have reported that DA-MED treatment drives Rac1 activation and promotes robust production of ROS, activating mitochondrial permeability transition and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Knockdown of Rac1 decreases ROS production in DA-MED-treated cells, resulting in a concomitant decrease in DA-MED-induced apoptosis. DA-MED-activated Rac1 induces autophagy by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin, leading to anti-apoptotic and anti-metastatic effects. Therefore, the present study provides novel insight into the complex cytotoxic and pro-survival mechanisms associated with a potent Rac1 agonist and suggests that further development of more potent Rac1 agonists could be an effective strategy for future non-small cell lung cancer treatments.
