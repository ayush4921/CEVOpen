<p>Cdc42 is another Rho family small GTPase [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As a downstream signaling of RANKL, Cdc42 might interact with the Crib domain of the adaptor Par3 [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Par6 and atypical PKC (aPKC) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36â€“38</xref>], which forms a quaternary complex to cascade the upper signaling transduction from RANKL and RANK binding, further stimulating the osteoclastogenesis. However, unlike Rac1 and Rac2 the definition role of Cdc42 in osteoclastogenesis is much clearly associated with its actin regulative effects, i.e. the podosome regulation. Recent studies using mice with increased Cdc42 activation due to knockout of its negative regulator Cdc42GAP have shown increased SZ formation and bone resorption, compared with wildtype cells [
