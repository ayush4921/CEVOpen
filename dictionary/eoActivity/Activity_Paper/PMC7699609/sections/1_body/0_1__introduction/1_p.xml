<p>Antimicrobial resistance, increasingly observed within a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, has become a worldwide threat to public health [

 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over time, bacteria adapt to the drugs that are designed to kill them, evolving or selecting resistance mechanisms to ensure survival. The resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a naturally occurring phenomenon, supposedly progressive over contact with antibiotics. However, the misuse and abuse of antibiotics led to a strong and rapid selective pressure, leading to an uncontrolled widespread development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [

Beyond resistance to antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to develop effective biofilms represents one of the major obstacles in the fight against bacterial infections. Indeed, while planktonic lifestyle allows bacteria to easily diffuse in diverse environments, their biofilm lifestyle allows efficient colonization of biotic and abiotic surfaces and protection from environmental aggression [
