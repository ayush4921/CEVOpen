<p>Over millions of years of co-evolution, plants accumulated highly diverse secondary metabolites (so-called ‘natural products’), developing means of surviving in hostile environments that combine herbivorous insects and pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses [

Given the huge diversity of flora and ecosystems in the world, the plants likely represent significant sources of innovative compounds with antivirulence properties. Indeed, several studies have already reported natural compounds, mainly isolated from plants, and synthetic compounds interfering with bacterial virulence [

 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L., Liliaceae) and baicalin, a flavone glycoside isolated from Huangqin (
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi, Lamiaceae) have been reported to inhibit both virulence factors production and biofilm formation in
