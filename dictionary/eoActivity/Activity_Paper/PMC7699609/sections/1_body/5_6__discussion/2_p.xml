<p>Considering that bacterial strategies to invade hosts may subtly differ according to species as well as within species, with different pathovars, it is difficult to claim that a single bacterial virulence target would be effective to undermine a bacterial invasion process. Although QS seems to be located at the crossroads of bacterial virulence expression, there is no universal QS system and cell-to-cell communication is differently exploited by bacterial species during bacterial infection, meaning that antivirulence compounds will generally be strain-specific.</p>
