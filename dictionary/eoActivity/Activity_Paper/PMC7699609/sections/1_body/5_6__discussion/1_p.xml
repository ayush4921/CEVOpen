<p>African plants screened so far provide a clear indication that we have a fairly large source of non-microbicidal natural products active on bacteria (

According to literature, the search for antivirulence activities have been shyly initiated since the last decade; by contrast, there has been a wide research on conventional antimicrobial activities (i.e., bactericidal activity) of African plants over the past 30 years [

 <xref rid="B79-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Although African plants investigated for antivirulence activities are diverse (largely from Southern and Eastern African regions), very few studies have resulted in the characterization of the active compound(s), suggesting that this investigation is only beginning, which highlights a huge potential for new substances still to be discovered.
