<p>(iii) Plants from the Myrtaceae family, endemic to South Africa and traditionally used to treat different ailments such as diarrhea, diabetes, reproductive problems, and respiratory diseases, have been investigated for their antibiofilm activity against various Gram-negative bacteria, including 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> ser. 
 <italic>typhimurium</italic> ATCC 39183, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has been highlighted that acetone extracts of leaves from different 
 <italic>Syzygium</italic> and 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> species, particularly 
 <italic>S. legatii</italic> Burtt Davy &amp; Greenway and 
 <italic>E. erythrophylla</italic> Strey, at 1000 µg/mL reduce biofilm formation (from 59–100% inhibition) but were unable to destroy pre-formed biofilms. These extracts exert in planktonic growth condition, a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values ranging from 40 to 310 µg/mL and relatively low cytotoxicity towards kidney epithelial cells (Vero) as concentrations of 140 to 1140 µg/mL inhibit cell viability by 50% (LC
 <sub>50</sub>); this indicates potentially safe herbal products;
