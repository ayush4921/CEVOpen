<p>(i) The hexanic extract from South African 
 <italic>Kigelia africana</italic> (Lam.) Benth. (Fruits, Bignoniaceae) used to treat dysentery, reduces the production of violacein in 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472 by 65% when tested at 660 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additionally, this extract interferes with the QS mechanism in 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> by affecting the 
 <italic>luxI</italic> synthase gene and the LuxR transcriptional regulator of autoinducers;
