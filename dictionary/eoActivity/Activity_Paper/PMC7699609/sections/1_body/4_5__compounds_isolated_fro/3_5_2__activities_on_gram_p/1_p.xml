<p>Epicatechin (8000 µg/mL, 3.4 mM) and isovitexin (

 <italic>Ficus sansibarica</italic> Warb. subsp. 
 <italic>Sansibarica,</italic> (Moraceae) collected in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were found to decrease the adhesion of methicillin-susceptible

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 43300 was increased in presence of isovitexin and the epicatechin isolated from the South African medicinal plant

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> LMG 21263 [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], suggesting that inhibition of biofilm process by these compounds is strain-specific. Two other compounds (epigallocatechin and β-sitosterol), isolated from 
 <italic>V. karroo</italic>, inhibit 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> LMG 21263 biofilm formation at the concentration of 500 µg/mL (1.2 mM) [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Both present MICs at 31 µg/mL and 62 µg/mL (67 and 149 µM), respectively. Considering these interesting bactericidal and antibiofilm properties, it is regrettable that no investigation on potential synergistic properties with conventional antibiotic has been performed so far; these could strengthen arguments to consider them as potential candidates for drug discovery and development.
