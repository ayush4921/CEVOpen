<p>The methyl gallate (MG) isolated from the galls (produced on leaves following insect attack) methanol extract of 
 <italic>Guiera senegalensis</italic> J. F. Gmel (Combretaceae), a traditional burkinabe treatment of cough, dysentery, and malaria, has been shown to exert antivirulence activities [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], Methyl gallate presents MIC values of 512 and 64 µg/mL against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV026, respectively, but, at 12.5 µg/mL (67.9 µM), already inhibits the production of pyocyanin (by 65%), and violacein (by 10%). These antivirulence activities are in correlation with the data of Hossain et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] who showed that the production of pyocyanin was inhibited (37–64%) by MG in a concentration-dependent manner (16–256 μg/mL). Moreover, in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, MG reduces the expression of the AHL synthetases genes (
 <italic>lasI</italic> and 
 <italic>rhlI</italic>) and the QS regulator genes (
 <italic>lasR</italic> and 
 <italic>rhlR</italic>) and biofilm formation.
