<p>A triterpenoid coumarate ester has been isolated from 
 <italic>Dalbergia trichocarpa</italic> Baker (Malagasy endemic species) bark extract as a major bioactive compound. Indeed, oleanolic aldehyde coumarate (OALC), at 200 ÂµM, inhibits the formation of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilm (by 44%) and its maintenance as well as the expression of the 
 <italic>las</italic> and 
 <italic>rhl</italic> QS systems [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a consequence, the production of QS-controlled virulence factors, including rhamnolipids, pyocyanin, elastase, and extracellular polysaccharides, as well as twitching and swarming motilities are significantly reduced (75%, 64%, 19%, 44%, 40%, and 52% inhibition, respectively). Additionally, OALC disorganizes established biofilm structure and significantly increases the bactericidal activity of tobramycin against biofilm-encapsulated PAO1 cells. Consistently, in vivo experiments indicated that OALC treatment reduces 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathogenicity in 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a nematode.
