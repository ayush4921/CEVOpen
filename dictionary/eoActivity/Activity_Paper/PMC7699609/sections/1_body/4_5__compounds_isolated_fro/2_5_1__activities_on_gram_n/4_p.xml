<p>The monocyclic diterpenoid cassipourol and the phytosterol β-sitosterol, isolated from 
 <italic>Platostoma rotundifolium</italic> (Briq.) A. J. Paton (Lamiaceae), a Burundian anti-infectious plant [
 <xref rid="B75-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], inhibit QS-regulated and QS-regulatory genes expression in 
 <italic>las</italic> and 
 <italic>rhl</italic> systems and disrupt the formation of biofilms by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at concentrations down to 12.5 and 50 µM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Authors also isolated α-amyrin, a biosynthesis precursor of ursolic acid [
 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], that exerts antibiofilm properties at 50 µM without any effect on QS-regulatory genes expression; this suggests that other ursane and oleane-type triterpenes may exert antibiofilm properties with similar mechanisms of action. The three isolated compounds improve swimming but not twitching motilities which consequently promotes planktonic lifestyle in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 and dispersal on preformed biofilms. Interestingly, the addition of cassipourol, α-amyrin, and β-sitosterol (100 µM) considerably improved the effectiveness of tobramycin (50 µg/mL = 107 µM) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 with a drastic reduction in cell viability of biofilm-encapsulated bacteria (89%, 70%, and 76% of bacterial death, respectively, versus 40% in DMSO control treatment).
