<p>Interestingly, EPS have been shown to play a major role in the protection properties of biofilm matrix; this is particularly the case for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, in which both components drastically reduce antimicrobials and microbicide penetration, severely reducing the levels of antibiotics in contact with bacterial cells. The formation of biofilm can then be considered as a real mechanism of bacterial resistance to antibiotics [

Moreover, the biofilm lifestyle allows the generation of bacterial persister cells, a specific sub-population of bacterial cells that have acquired temporary antibiotic-resistance phenotypes and for which a long-retention effect, or ‘memory effect’, has been demonstrated, even if they return at planktonic lifestyle mode [
