  <p>Schematic representation of bacterial invasion processes (

   <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, (

   <italic>E. coli</italic>, and (
   <bold>C</bold>) 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Bacterial dissemination is done thanks to active and/or passive motilities (swimming, swarming, twitching, gliding, sliding, and darting). In presence of appropriate surfaces and environment, the invasion is initiated by adhesion steps and microcolony formation which lead to the development of mature biofilms in four major steps (adhesion, microcolonies development, biofilm maturation, and dispersion). Under modulation by QS, the bacterial community deploys an arsenal of virulence factors (pyocyanin, heat labile (LT) and heat stable (ST)-enterotoxin, hemolysins, and leukotoxins) that undermine nearby cells (including immune defense cells) and stimulate the production of exogenous biofilm matrix for protection purposes.
