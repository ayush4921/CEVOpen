<p>The safety and efficacy of 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> on treatment of functional dyspepsia (FD) in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study showed that treatment with 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> (250 mg × 2/day) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) for 30 days significantly improved the overall score and quality of life compared to the placebo group. In addition, treatment with 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> eliminates and improve the symptoms, including bloating (58%), appetite (69%), postprandial fullness (74%), motion sickness (75%), and indigestion (77%) as compared to less than 10% improvement of symptoms in the placebo group [

 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> mouthwash (10%) twice daily for a period of 7 days compared to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) mouthwash (15 ml) were also studied. The result of the research was that modified gingival index (MGI) and the plaque index (PI) were improved in both groups of intervention. However, mean differences of MGI and PI in 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> group were lower than the CHG group [

 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> prepared as masculine tablet (310 mg) on young men for 3 months were studied. Masculinity reduced production and release of MDA in human sperm cells. Furthermore, treatment with masculine tablet increased sperm motility and sperm count in 15 oligospermic volunteers (60%) compared with the baseline of the study [
