<p>The relaxant effect of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> on skeletal muscle [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and smooth muscle [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] has been shown. The hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> showed a stimulatory effect on 
 <italic>β</italic>-adrenoceptor in the tracheal smooth muscles of guinea pigs [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The relaxant effect of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> on tracheal smooth muscles via the blocking of the muscarinic receptor was also investigated [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The researchers suggested that bronchodilatory effects of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> can be attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors stimulation [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], strengthening the inhibitory effect of nonadrenergic and noncholinergic nervous system [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], opening potassium channels [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], inhibition of phosphodiesterase [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and calcium channel antagonism in tracheal chain [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Ethyl acetate (EA) of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> extract has been indicated to decrease intestinal motility in ICR mice compared to those treated with acetylcholine [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Based on the conducted studies, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> has been shown to enhance acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) induced vascular relaxation of aortic rings in diabetic mice. The created effect is associated with a significant reduction in the level of vasoconstrictor endothelin- (ET-) 1. It has also been suggested that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> suppresses overexpression of vascular cell adhesion molecule- (VCAM) 1, intracellular cell adhesion molecular- (ICAM) 1, E-selectin, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 in aortic tissue in db/db mice [
