<p>Culture medium of nonactivated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and allogeneic cells exposed to 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract (1 and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) stimulate production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and IL-4 levels. Furthermore, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) suppresses the production of IL-8 in nonstimulated as well as mitogen-activated PBMC cells [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> aqueous extract (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) suppresses lymphocytes response to all mitogens and allogeneic cells. However, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) stimulates lymphocytes response to allogeneic cells. Moreover, the fraction of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (10 kDa) stimulates the production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and IL-3 by human lymphocytes without need for any kind of mitogen. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) also significantly increased IL-3 production when it was added to lymphocytes culture [
