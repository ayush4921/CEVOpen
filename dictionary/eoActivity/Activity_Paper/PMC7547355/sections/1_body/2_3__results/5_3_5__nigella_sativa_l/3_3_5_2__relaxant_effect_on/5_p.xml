 <italic>N. sativa</italic> boiled extract (50 and 100 mg/kg) compared to theophylline (6 mg/kg) in asthmatic patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15) become obvious in improvement of all measured PFTs values, in most time intervals. However, the increase in PFT values was significantly lower than those of theophylline, whereas the onset of the bronchodilatory effect of the extract was similar to that of theophylline beginning 30 min after administration [
