<p>Whole ground seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (1 and 2 g/day, capsules) significantly decreased fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks compared to the baseline. Serum levels of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> were significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment with 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> compared to the baseline [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Treatment with soft gel capsules of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil (15–30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased serum levels of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> and reduced serum levels of IL-4 in asthmatic children (aged 6–15) compared to control [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (15–30 mg/kg) significantly decreased Th17 and also increased Treg percentages. In the same way, Th17/Treg ratio was lower in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> treated group compared to the standard treated group [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for 8 weeks decreased the level of FBS, lipid profiles (TG, TC, LDL, and VLDL), liver enzymes (AST and ALT), inflammatory marker (hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), whereas it increased the HDL-C levels compared to the placebo (paraffin oil) group [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> supplementation (2 g/day for 12 weeks) in patients who have cardiovascular disorders risk factors and also in patients with NAFLD 2 significantly decreased glucose and insulin serum levels and also decreased hepatic steatosis percentage compared to the placebo [
