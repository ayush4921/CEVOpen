However, any breakage of the integrity of the skin or the continuity of living tissues due to trauma as well as underlying medical conditions such as diabetes lead to the development of wounds. Acute wounds repair themselves within 30 days without underlying pathology and complications while chronic wounds could not undergo the healing process timely which results in complications attributed to prolonged inflammation.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> All wound types could become chronic unless properly managed timely.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The physical and psychosocial health outcomes and an economic impact comprise the majority costs of the wound in developing countries. Wounds of microbial origin, in particular, are the most common public health problems, resulting in cellulitis, abscess formation, osteomyelitis, gangrene, sepsis and even have the potential for transformation to malignancy.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The problem has become worse due to the fact that antimicrobial resistance is an alarming global threat, and the efficacies of the currently available antimicrobial agents have been reduced due to increasing resistance. Therefore, wounds should be managed to promote healing timely without causing significant harm to people.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Since ancient times, medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of a variety of ailments including skin disorders.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Review reports of phytoextracts involved in wound healing demonstrated that those with confirmed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and mitogenic activities are responsible for the wound-healing effects of medicinal plants.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, plants endowed with anti-oxidant activities have a valuable use in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, wound, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, in which their pathophysiology is related to oxidative stress and the accumulation of free radicals.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The studied plant, <italic>Acokanthera schimperi</italic> (locally called &#x0201c;merenz&#x0201d;) is widely used for the traditional treatment of wound<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and various microbial infections such as tonsillitis (leaf), bacterial infection of the nails, leprosy (leaf), tinea capitis (leaf), and sexually transmitted diseases.

Then, the extract was initially filtered by gauze and re-filtered gently using Whatman No 1 filter paper. For exhaustive extraction, the marc was re-macerated twice in a similar manner. Then, the filtrates were combined and evaporated on a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) under reduced pressure and dried in an oven at 40&#x000b0;c (Gallenkamp, England).

The addition of 2 mL of glacial acetic acid to the extract followed by the mixing of a few drops of ferric chloride solution and 1 mL of conc. sulphuric acid forms a brown ring at the interface which showed the presence of glycosides. The formation of dark green color when a few drops of 2% ferric chloride are added to the extract indicated the presence of phenols. The formation of broth upon vigorous shaking indicates saponins. A reddish-brown layer formation at the junction of two solutions when 2 mL of chloroform and 3 mL of conc. sulphuric acid are added to the extract established terpenoids. Three to five drops of 2% lead acetate solution were added to 2 mL of the extract solution and the formation of orange/yellow color indicated flavonoids. When 2 mL of extract was dissolved in 2 mL of chloroform and followed by the addition of 2 mL concentrated H2SO4 and the formation of red color in the lower chloroform layer showed steroids. Adding 0.1% ferric chloride to the extract and the appearance of brownish-green or blue-black coloration showed the presence of tannins. After adding 10&#x02009;mL of benzene in the extract and soaked for 10 minutes, further addition of 10&#x02009;mL of 10% ammonia solution and the formation of pink, violet, or red color upon vigorously shaking for 30 seconds revealed the presence of anthraquinones.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2006"><title>Acute Dermal Toxicity</title><p>Following the procedures elaborated in the OECD guideline number 434, the acute dermal toxicity testing was performed.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Accordingly, ten albino female rats (Rattus albus) (weight: 200&#x02013;300g, age: 8&#x02013;12 weeks) were selected and grouped randomly into five rats each for the test and control groups.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> After acclimatization of the rats for one week, the back furs of the rats were shaved and the 10% w/w extract ointment at a limit dose of 2000 mg/kg was applied to establish the acute dermal toxicity.

Since the direct application of the extract into the affected part does not have a significant purpose for the intended time, ointment preparation of the extracts is essential to produce a prolonged wound healing effect. Besides, the addition of hard and white soft paraffin during the formulation of ointment base provides an occlusive barrier for moisture whereas wool fat and cetostearyl alcohol (thickeners) are used for the ointment stabilization effect.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This study, therefore, investigated the antioxidant and wound healing activity of <italic>A. schimperi</italic> leaf extract.

In addition, a significant reduction of the epithelialization period was shown in both ointment preparations ie 16 days for 5% w/w extract ointment and 13 days for 10% w/w extract ointment. It is noteworthy that the major biological mechanisms behind the wound-healing effects of medicinal plants involve through their antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and mitogenic activities of bioactive constituents.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For instance, scavenging of excess free radicals and protection of macromolecules like lipids and proteins against oxidative stress is an important biological mechanism for enhanced collagen synthesis and facilitated epithelial cell proliferation, thereby promoting wound healing.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Therefore, a rapid rate of wound area contraction and a shorter epithelialization period of the extract ointments may be partly explained by its good free scavenging properties as investigated in the present study as well as its antibacterial activity as reported in the previous studies.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>In the incision model, a significant increase in tensile-strength was revealed in both 10% (by 36.80%) and 5% (by 32.23%) w/w extract ointments, as compared to their negative controls.

As evidence, the leaf extract of <italic>Acokanthera oppositifolia</italic> showed good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic activities.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Likewise, the leaf extract of <italic>Acokanthera oblongifolia</italic> also displayed strong antimicrobial, antioxidant, and wound healing activities.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Moreover, the crude extract ointments of this plant revealed a statistically significant wound healing effect in <italic>S. aurous-</italic>infected mice, in an infected model. A faster wound contraction and epithelialization effects were noticed in mice treated with the 10% w/w extract ointment than the standard drug and 5% w/w extract ointment-treated mice. Likewise, the phlogistic characteristics of the wound that occurred before the initiation of treatment progressively and significantly reduced in all mice treated with the extract ointments in comparison with the negative-control treated groups. The antibacterial properties of triterpenoids isolated from the leaves of <italic>A. schimperi</italic> could support this finding.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>Furthermore, secondary metabolites like polyphenols, anthraquinones, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, steroids, and terpenoids found in the extract could contribute to the wound healing effect. For example, terpenoids facilitate wound healing primarily due to their antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties;<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> flavonoids, and tannins are potent antioxidants;<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> polyphenols and flavonoids have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities;<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> glycosides have antioxidant, antimicrobial, analgesic, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Hence, the observed wound healing and antioxidant effects of the crude extract may be due to the individual or synergistic effects of active phytochemicals present in the plant. In general, faster rates of wound contraction and epithelialization, and increased tensile strength of the extract ointments were suggestive to support the folklore wound healing claims of the plant and consequently, the study recommends further isolation and characterization, structural elucidation and the study of the structure-activity relationship of the active constituents responsible for this activity.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study investigated that the 80% hydromethanolic extract ointments of leaves of <italic>A. schimperi</italic> possess potential wound healing effects in all three models. The study also suggested that the significant antibacterial and anti-oxidant activities of the extracts are the mechanisms for its wound-healing effects. Thus, the current study strongly supported the traditional claims of the plant for use in the treatment of wounds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank Wollo University for the financial support extended to complete the research work.</p></ack><sec id="s0006"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA, one way analysis of variance; OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; SEM, standard error of the mean; SPSS, Statistical Package for Social Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>All the data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate</title><p>The study was reviewed, presented to and approved by Ethical Review Committee of College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University with ethical approval number WU CMHS/701/19.
