<p>In addition, a significant reduction (p&lt; 0.001) in the epithelization period was shown in mice treated with both the 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract ointments, in comparison with their negative controls. Interestingly, the 10% (w/w) extract ointment showed a statistically significant shortening of epithelization periods when compared to the 5% (w/w) extract as well as the standard drug (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the animals treated with 10% (w/w) extract, nitrofurazone, and 5% (w/w) extract ointments showed a reduction in the epithelialization periods by 34.98%, 25.22%, and 22.78%, respectively when compared to their negative control groups (
