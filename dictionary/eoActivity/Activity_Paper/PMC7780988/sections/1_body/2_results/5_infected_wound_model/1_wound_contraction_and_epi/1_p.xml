<p>In the infected wound model, mice treated with negative control remained to exhibit different signs of infection for more than one week. However, mice treated with the test extract ointments started to decrease phlogistic characteristics after 3 days of treatment initiation. Significant wound contraction effect was exhibited among the 10% (w/w) extract ointment treated group starting from day 4 (

 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.01) and onwards (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001), as compared to the negative control. However, a statistically significant difference effect was not seen among the treatment and the positive control groups (
