<p>The tensile strength was significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001) in mice treated with the 10% (w/w) extract ointment, standard drug, and 5% (w/w) extract ointment by 36.80, 33.67, and 32.23%, respectively, when compared to the negative controls. Moreover, the 10% w/w extract ointment showed the highest increase in tensile strength as compared to the standard drug and the 5% (w/w) extract ointment, though it was not found to be statistically significant (
