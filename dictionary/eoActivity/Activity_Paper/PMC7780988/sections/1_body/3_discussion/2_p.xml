<p>Regarding the wound healing effect, the study revealed that the crude extract ointments of the leaves of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> promoted wound healing at both doses, in the three models used during the experiment. In the excision model, the 10% (w/w) extract ointment treated groups displayed a faster wound healing effect from day 6 to day 14 when compared to the 5% (w/w) extract ointment treated groups that started from the 8th day and continued to day 16. In addition, a significant reduction of the epithelialization period was shown in both ointment preparations ie 16 days for 5% w/w extract ointment and 13 days for 10% w/w extract ointment. It is noteworthy that the major biological mechanisms behind the wound-healing effects of medicinal plants involve through their antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and mitogenic activities of bioactive constituents.
