<p>Furthermore, secondary metabolites like polyphenols, anthraquinones, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, steroids, and terpenoids found in the extract could contribute to the wound healing effect. For example, terpenoids facilitate wound healing primarily due to their antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties;

In general, faster rates of wound contraction and epithelialization, and increased tensile strength of the extract ointments were suggestive to support the folklore wound healing claims of the plant and consequently, the study recommends further isolation and characterization, structural elucidation and the study of the structure-activity relationship of the active constituents responsible for this activity.
