<p>Previous literature reports indicated that the methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> was found to be active against common wound causing pathogens in clinical isolates as well as standard strains.

 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> On the other hand, the ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> possesses significant antioxidant activity in different assays.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Similarly, another study showed that the 80% methanolic leaf extract was shown to have antiviral

 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, no reports about the wound healing potential of the plant to date, and hence, the current study evaluated the wound healing activity of the leaves extract of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> in an incision, excision, and infected wound models in mice.
