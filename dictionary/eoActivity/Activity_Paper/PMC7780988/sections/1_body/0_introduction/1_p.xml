<p>The skin is the largest organ in the body and acts as a first-line defense against invasive pathogens. However, any breakage of the integrity of the skin or the continuity of living tissues due to trauma as well as underlying medical conditions such as diabetes lead to the development of wounds. Acute wounds repair themselves within 30 days without underlying pathology and complications while chronic wounds could not undergo the healing process timely which results in complications attributed to prolonged inflammation.

Therefore, wounds should be managed to promote healing timely without causing significant harm to people.
