<p>Following subcutaneous injection of mice with ketamine (1 mL/kg) and diazepam (1 mL/kg), approximately 300 mm
 <sup>2</sup> circular marks were formed, and the full thickness was excised by punch biopsy method to create a wound. Then, the mice were treated as explained in the experimental animals, grouping and handling section after 24 hours of wound creation. The wound area was not covered with gauze.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The extract ointments were applied in mice daily until complete wound healing was observed in the test groups. Parameters such as wound contraction and epithelialization period were determined to establish the wound healing effect of the extract. The epithelialization period is the total number of days required for the shedding of the scar without leaving any raw wound.
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In addition, the percentage of wound contraction was determined by using the formula.
