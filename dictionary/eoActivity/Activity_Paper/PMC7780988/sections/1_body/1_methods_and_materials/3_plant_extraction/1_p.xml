<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>A. schemperi</italic> were dried for three weeks under the shade and then ground to a coarse powder by mortar and pestle. The powder test material was weighed (200 g) and extracted in cold maceration in 80% methanol (625 mL) by using Erlenmeyer flasks for 3 days with infrequent shaking at ambient temperature. Then, the extract was initially filtered by gauze and re-filtered gently using Whatman No 1 filter paper. For exhaustive extraction, the marc was re-macerated twice in a similar manner. Then, the filtrates were combined and evaporated on a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) under reduced pressure and dried in an oven at 40Â°c (Gallenkamp, England). The extract was put in the refrigerator until used for the experiment. After determining the percentage yield value of the extract, the extracts were kept refrigerated and away from light until topical ointments were prepared.
