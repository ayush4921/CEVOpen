<p>A paper by R. Larayetan et al. studied the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial, antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, and antioxidant potentials of the crude leaf extracts (ethyl acetate and methanolic) of 
 <italic>Callistemon citrinus.</italic> The phytochemical constituents were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both extracts were bactericidal to 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. They exhibited antitrypanosomal potentials with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.6/9.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and antiplasmodial activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.4/13.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as well as antioxidant potentials. Both were characterized by high amount of fatty acids (52.88 and 62.48%).
