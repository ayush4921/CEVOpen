<p>Malaria remains a devastating disease in several parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of drugs have been developed over the years for the treatment of the disease, but the newly introduced artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the main stay drug used today. There is presently a deep concern that the Plasmodium parasite will soon develop total resistance to the existing antimalarial drugs due to the recent reports of increasing resistance of the parasite to the ACT, in many endemic areas. In addition, the mosquito vector has also developed resistance against the insecticides. The high cost as well as the adverse effects associated with some of the existing drugs also limits their usefulness in malarial treatment. Given the above, there is currently an urgent need to search for novel and more efficacious drugs to combat the disease. Natural products, including medicinal plants, have been used in the traditional treatment of malaria for thousands of years due to their efficacy, safety, lower cost, and availability. In fact, the two most successful antimalarial drugs, artemisinin and quinine, were sourced from medicinal plants. In this special issue, we intend to focus on recent studies dealing with the antimalarial activity of natural products (including extracts and compounds) derived from medicinal plants, animals, or microorganisms. Articles on the use of herbs in combination with drugs for the treatment of malaria also fall within the scope of this special issue. A brief summary of all accepted papers is provided as follows.</p>
