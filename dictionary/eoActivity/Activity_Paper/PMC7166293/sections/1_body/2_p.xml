<p>D. Okello and Y. Kang carried out a comprehensive electronic review of various plant resources used to treat malaria across communities in Uganda. Approximately, 182 plant species from 63 different plant families were found to be used for malaria treatment in Uganda, of which 112 plant species have been investigated for antimalarial activity and 96% of the plant species showed positive results. These plants could be potential sources for potent antimalarial remedies.</p>
