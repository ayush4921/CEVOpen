<p>Z. O. Ibraheem et al., in their paper, examined the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodium and chloroquine resistance reversal effects of andrographolide (a natural compound originally isolated from 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>). 
 <italic>In silico</italic> molecular characterization was done using the Molinspiration software. Results showed that andrographolide has a moderate antiplasmodium effect and chloroquine resistance reversal effect which may be due to inhibition of chloroquine accumulation or due to its impact on the biological activity of the parasite. The study suggests the addition of andrographolide with chloroquine for reversal of chloroquine resistance and tolerance, but further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are recommended to confirm this notion.
