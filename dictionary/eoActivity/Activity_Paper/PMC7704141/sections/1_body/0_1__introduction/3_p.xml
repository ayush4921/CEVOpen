<p>Seaweed is acknowledged for its excellent content of fucoidan, phenolics, fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, sterols (such as fucosterol in brown seaweed), tocopherols, terpenoids, and phycocyanins, among others [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to fatty acids, the unsaponifiable fractions of seaweed contain major photosynthetic pigments. The major photosynthetic pigments studied in seaweed, including chlorophylls (
 <italic>a, b, c</italic>), carotenoids (such as beta-carotene, lutein, and violaxanthin in red and green seaweed, fucoxanthin in brown seaweed), and phycobilins (phycoerythrin and phycocyanin) have been acknowledged to exhibit various benefits for human prosperity. This is especially true in terms of their uses as food, alternative treatments, and medicine including antioxidants, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiobesity, antiangiogenic, and neuroprotective activities [
