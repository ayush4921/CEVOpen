<p>Numerous studies have reported the role of carotenoids as potential anticancer candidates as carotenoids have been used as major phytonutrients for inhibiting the development of tumours 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This could be because carotenoids proved to play important roles such as preventing oxidative damage that is caused by free radicals or scavenging free radicals, inhibition of angiogenesis, prevention of cell propagation, apoptosis induction in lung, colon, breast, and prostate [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Several studies also reported that fucoxanthin (xanthophylls carotenoid) have inhibitory activities, antiproliferative effect, and ability to induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines including T-cell leukaemia, leukaemia cells (HL-60) human colon cancer cells (Caco-2, HT-29, and DLD-1), and human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU 145, and LNCaP) [

 <italic>Codium fragile</italic>) is a growth-inhibitor against HL-60 cells.
