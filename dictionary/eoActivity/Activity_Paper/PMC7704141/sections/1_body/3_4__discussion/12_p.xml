 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Pejin et al. [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported the cytotoxicity of phytol against seven tumour cells (MCF-7, PC-3 cells, HeLa, HT-29, A549, Hs294â€‰T, and MDA-MB-231) and one normal cell of human origin. The workers found that MCF-7 and cervical HeLa cell lines were more sensitive to phytol compared to other cell lines. Phytol's ability for anticancer activity may be associated with its ability to remove the hydroxyl radical (free radical) [
