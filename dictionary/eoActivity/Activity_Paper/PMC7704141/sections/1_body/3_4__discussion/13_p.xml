<p>The compound n-hexadecanoic acid is a common fatty acid that has been found in abundance in plants [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Previous studies reported that n-hexadecanoic acid selectively inhibits DNA topoisomerase-I and thus prevents the proliferation of human fibroblast cells [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Ravi and Krishnan [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] found that 
 <italic>Kigelia pinnata</italic> leaves' crude extracts resulted in identification of n-hexadecanoic acid and showed significant cytotoxicity against human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116). Nguyen et al. 2011 [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported that fatty acids with strong 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase-inhibitory activity, 7(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 7(Z) and 10(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, were purified and identified from sea cucumber. Another FA, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (BMEH) is known for antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer, and antioxidant activities and as a potent antimicrobial agent [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Selvakumar et al. 2019 [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] reported that BMEH isolated from marine 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. VITJS4 exhibited 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer potential against liver (HepG2) cancer cells.
