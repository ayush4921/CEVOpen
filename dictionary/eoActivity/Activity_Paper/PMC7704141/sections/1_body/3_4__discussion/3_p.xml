<p>Seaweed is known to comprise 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase inhibitors and one therapeutic approach for treating diabetes mellitus, and obesity is to retard the absorption of glucose via inhibition of 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase. Hwang et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that the Taiwanese brown seaweed 
 <italic>S. hemiphyllum</italic> had 
 <italic>a</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase (sucrose and maltase) inhibitory activity. Nagappan et al. 2017 [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] discovered that crude extract of 
 <italic>S. siliquosum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. polycystum</italic> collected from Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, inhibited 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (0.57 ± 0.02 mg/ml for 
 <italic>S. siliquosum</italic> and 0.69 ± 0.02 mg/mL for 
 <italic>S. polycystum</italic>, respectively). Another researcher also reported the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition of 
 <italic>S. ringgoldianum</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.12 mg/mL and 
 <italic>Padina arborescens</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.26 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Chin et al. 2015 found that water extracts of the green seaweed species 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> showed inhibition activity against 
 <italic>a</italic>-glucosidase with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.388 mg/mL.
