<p>Photosynthetic pigments are important in the lives of plant species and are usually classified into three major categories: chlorophylls (
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>, 
 <italic>c</italic>), carotenoids (carotene and xanthophylls), and phycobilins (phycoerythrin and phycocyanin) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The major photosynthetic pigments studied in seaweed are presented as total carotenoid content and chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> expressed as 
 <italic>μ</italic>g g
 <sup>−1</sup> dry weight (DW). While chlorophylls comprise part of the components required for photosynthesis, the essential roles played by carotenoids are to pass light energy to chlorophyll and acting as strong antioxidants. The measurement in this study of higher carotenoids concentrations (ranging from 115.57 to 162.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) in the green seaweed (
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> and 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic>) is in concurrence with results reported by other researchers. This follows the suggestion that carotenoids are abundant in seaweed with higher photosynthetic activities such as green (Chlorophyta) and red (Rhodophyta) than in the brown (Phaeophyta) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results contrasted with a previous study where high carotenoid content was found in brown seaweed and low carotenoid content found in green seaweed [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The specific photosynthetic pigments and their concentrations are known to vary depending on their morphological structures and environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, useful information with regard to different habitats that may affect the biochemical composition of seaweed may be evident when a comparative study is conducted in closely related species. The relative abundance in this study of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> content in 3 species investigated (varying between 141.98 and 313.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) agreed with those reported in other studies [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in which the highest chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> content was measured in green seaweed 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> and the lowest measured in brown seaweed 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic>. As also noted in the present study, chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic> was recorded to be the richest in green algae 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> and the poorest in brown algae 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic>.
