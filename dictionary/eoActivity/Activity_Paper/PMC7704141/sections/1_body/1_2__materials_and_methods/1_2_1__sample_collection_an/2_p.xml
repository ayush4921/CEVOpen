<p>The second portion of the clean samples was then placed in transparent polyethylene bags (inside chilled plastic containers) and transported to the research facilities of the Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Institute of Bioscience (IBS), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Serdang, Malaysia. In the laboratory, the samples were further washed thoroughly with tap water, followed by distilled water, and frozen overnight at −80°C in a deep freezer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Frozen seaweed samples were subsequently lyophilized in a freeze dryer (Labconco FreeZone, USA) until a constant weight of biomass was attained. All the dried seaweed samples were then pulverized into a fine powder with a laboratory-scale blender and sieved using a 200
