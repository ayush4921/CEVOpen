<p>Fine sample powders were collected and mixed with methanol (1 : 20 w/v) to make a solution. This resulting solution was extracted by sonication for 30 min using an ultrasonic water bath (Power Sonic 505, Korea) at ambient temperature. The resulting solvent extract was then filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper, whereas the dried residue was mixed and reextracted with another fresh methanol for the second round of extraction. The extraction process was repeated in the same manner for the third round of extraction. The filtered extracts were pooled and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator, maintained at 40°C. The concentrated extracts were stored in amber bottles in a freezer for future utilization.</p>
