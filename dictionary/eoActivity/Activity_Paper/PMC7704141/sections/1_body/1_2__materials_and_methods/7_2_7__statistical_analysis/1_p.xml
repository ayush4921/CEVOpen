<p>All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of three replicates for total carotenoids, chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b,</italic> and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition assay. For MTT assay, data are presented as mean values (and their standard errors) of six replicate determinations in either tables or figures, showing error bars to represent deviations. All data for total carotenoids, chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b,</italic> and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition assay and MTT assay were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the mean of replicate measurements was taken. All values of 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant, at a 95% confidence level.
