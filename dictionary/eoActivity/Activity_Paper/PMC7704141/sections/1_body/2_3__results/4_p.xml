<p>GC-MS is a combined method that is applied to identify different chemical contents within a sample. It functions on the separation of the individual compounds by gas chromatography according to their retention time and the separated compounds are further analysed at a molecular level by mass spectrometry. The GC-MS profiling of methanolic extracts resulted in the identification of 27 metabolites in 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic>, 22 metabolites in 
 <italic>H. macroloba,</italic> and 24 metabolites in 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic>. These metabolites belong to different chemical classes, and most of them are reported to exhibit important biological activities. The metabolites also included various aliphatic acids and aromatic compounds identified in the different samples. The identified compounds with their retention time (RT), peak area (%), and molecular formula are presented in Tables

 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. Out of 27 peaks observed in the chromatogram of 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> methanolic extract, five compounds were identified as major peaks. The major compounds included 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (7.61%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid (6.93%), hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (6.40%), benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, (5.21%), and phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)- (5.10%). Among the 22 peaks observed in the GC-MS profile of 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> methanol extract, only seven compounds were detected. The major compounds identified were 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid (16.16%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (12.76%), stigmast-5-en-3-ol, (3
 <italic>β</italic>,24S)-(6.73%), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (5.48%), benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-
 <italic>bis</italic>(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, methyl ester (4.97%), and phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) - (4.23%). The metabolites in 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> were identified (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (7.69%), benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, methyl ester (7.03%), phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)- (6.54%), and 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (6.24%), hexadecanoic acid, and methyl ester (5.28%).
