<p>The determination of cytotoxicity was carried out using a dose-response curve obtained by nonlinear regression analysis. The cell viability was determined by comparison to the survival of cells in the untreated (negative control) cultures, which was normalised to 100%. Our data indicated the potential cytotoxic activity of the methanolic extract for both green seaweed species 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> and brown seaweed 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> on five different cell lines, MCF 7, MDA- MB231, Ht-29, Hep G2, and 3T3 cells, as shown by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> results in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The results show a clear decrease in cell viability and cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> extract was found to be most cytotoxic towards MCF-7 and HT 29 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 37.25 ± 0.58 and 21.32 ± 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, compared to other cell lines. Besides, 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> extract was also the least toxic to normal cell (3T3) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 48.80 ± 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, compared to the other extracts evaluated. 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> extract exhibited the most cytotoxicity towards Hep G2 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 23.21 ± 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, while 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> was less toxic towards MDA- MB231 cell with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 25.23 ± 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
