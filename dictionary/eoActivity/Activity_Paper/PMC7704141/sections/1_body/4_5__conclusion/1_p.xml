 <italic>U. intestinalis, H. macroloba</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> seaweed species are potential sources of many bioactive, nutritionally and physiologically important compounds that could be utilized in nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical industries as sources of both food and medicine. The present study demonstrated that the contents of seaweed pigments (total carotenoids, chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic>) have antidiabetic and anticancer potentials (and therefore, the biological activities resulting from their phytochemical content of bioactive compounds) and are not only based on species differences (whether brown, red, or green seaweed) but also depend, to a large extent, on the predominant environmental conditions at their sampling locations. Besides, further studies also need to be carried out to isolate, purify, and specifically investigate the efficacies and biological activities of all the identified compounds, and the current focus on the species to mine for new drugs is justified.
