At this stage, we believe that sharing COVID‐19–related clinical research activities in a transparent and intuitive manner has the potential to (1) facilitate the flow of information, (2) enable contacts between researchers, and (3) inform the public. Using an agile workflow approach and public input, our team of geoinformation scientists, physicians, and clinical research professionals has created the “COVID‐19 Map of Hope” (Figure

This World Health Organization Portal provides access to a central database containing the trial registration data sets provided by important international registries.
