<p>After 24 h of infection, the culture medium was replaced by a fresh culture medium containing each extract at four concentrations (100, 25, 6.25, and 1.78 μg/mL) or lower, (based on the cytotoxicity showed previously by each extract). After 72 h, the progress of infection inhibition was determined. Cells were removed from the bottom plate with a trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (250 mg) solution. Recovered cells were centrifuged at 1100 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and cells were washed with 1 mL of cold PBS and centrifuged at 1100 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and cells were suspended in 500-μL PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (FC 500MPL, Cytomics, Brea, CA, US) with a total count of 10,000 events. The activity of tested extracts was conducted synchronously with the infection progress in culture medium alone as well as in culture medium with Amphotericin B and meglumine antimoniate as leishmanicidal drugs (positive controls). Determinations for each extract and standard drugs were conducted in triplicate in two independent experiments [
