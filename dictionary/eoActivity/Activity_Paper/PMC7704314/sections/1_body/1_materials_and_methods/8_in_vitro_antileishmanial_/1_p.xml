<p>The activity of the extracts was evaluated using intracellular amastigotes of

 <italic>panamensis</italic> transfected with the green fluorescent protein gene (MHOM/CO/87/UA140pIR-GFP) [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The effect of each extract was determined based on infection inhibition, which is evidenced by a decrease in the number of live intracellular amastigotes. Briefly, U937 human cells at a concentration of 3×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL in RPMI 1640 and 0.1 μg/mL of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were infected with promastigotes in the stationary growth phase using 15:1 parasites per cell ratio and incubated at 34°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to eliminate non-internalized parasites. Fresh RPMI 1640 (1 mL) was added and cells were incubated again to guarantee the multiplication of intracellular parasites.
