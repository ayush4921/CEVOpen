<p>The antileishmanial activity was determined according to the percentage of infected cells and parasite load obtained for each experimental condition using flow cytometry. The results of antileishmanial activity were expressed as the median effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) determined by the probit method [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] using the percentage of viable intracellular parasites, calculated using the formula in Equation 2, where the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the control-infected cells corresponds to 100% of parasitemia.
