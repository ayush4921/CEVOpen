 <italic>,</italic> P.F, and O.F with a percentage yield of 17.0, 6.2, and 8.5%, respectively, and hexane extract from P.B with a percentage yield of 15.1%. The preliminary phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed triterpenes in hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate extracts, while, tannins, leucoanthocyanidins, and saponins were only present in ethanol extracts of all plants. Alkaloids were found only in the ethanol extract from P.F. The presence of coumarins was found in the ethanol extract from L.S, as well as in ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from P.F and P.B.
