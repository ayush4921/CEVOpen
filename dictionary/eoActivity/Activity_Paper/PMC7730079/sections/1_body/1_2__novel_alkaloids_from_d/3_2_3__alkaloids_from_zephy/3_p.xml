<p>In particular, the cytotoxic activity of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was deeply investigated using multiple cell lines derived from human pancreatic cancer, which is one of the most mortal and refractory human malignancies. Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> showed a very strong cytotoxic activity on cancerous cells but was not toxic to healthy ones. Although the mode of action of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> remains un-determined, the results obtained comparing its cytotoxicity with the activity of the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine allowed the proposal of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> as a promising drug against pancreatic cancer [

 <bold>3</bold>, suggesting that this haemanthidine derivative has a tumor suppressive role of NOTCH (Notch Pathway Modulators as Anticancer Chemotherapeutics), signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The reactivation of this mechanism in a new attractive opportunity to develop an alternative therapy against AML [
