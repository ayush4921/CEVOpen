<p>Further investigation carried out by Masi et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] allowed to isolate abundant amounts of haemanthamine, lycorine and narciclasine, and a new alkaloid, named jonquailine (
 <bold>4</bold>,

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An extensive work was carried out by comparing the ECD spectrum of jonquailine and tazettine, and the ECD data reported in the literature for pretazettine showed that compound 
 <bold>4</bold> and pretazettine have the same absolute configuration at the B/C and B/D ring junctions, while they are empimers at C-8. The stereochemistry at C-8 was not previously assigned in pretazettine and thus is not assigned in the alkaloid 
 <bold>4</bold> [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Subsequently, the absolute configuration, 
 <italic>R,</italic> at C-8 of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was assigned by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of chiroptical properties, namely electronic circular dichroism (ECD), vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). These results confirmed the absolute configuration of jonquailine and allowed the assignment of an 
 <italic>S</italic> configuration to C-8 of pretazettine [
