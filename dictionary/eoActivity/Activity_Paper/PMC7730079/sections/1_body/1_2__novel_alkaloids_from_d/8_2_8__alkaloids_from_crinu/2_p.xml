<p>Four new bioactive alkaloids, belonging to the crynine-type subgroup and named 4,8-dimethoxy-cripowellin C, 4,8-dimethoxycripowellin D, 9-methoxy-cripowellin B, and 4-methoxy-8-hydroxy-cripowellin B (

 <bold>17</bold>,

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05621-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), were isolated from the 
 <italic>C. latifolium</italic> bulbs extract, together, the known cripowellin [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The alkaloids 
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>17</bold> and cripowellin showed strong cytotoxicity against seven lung cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 30 nM. Compounds 
 <bold>16</bold> and 
 <bold>17</bold> also showed significant antimicrobial activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &lt; 0.50 mM when tested against the Gram+ bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, and Gram– bacteria such as 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>. All the alkaloids also showed antioxidant activity in the ABTS+ and DPPH tests. In addition, alkaloids 
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>17</bold> and cripowellin, tested in vitro for their anti-inflammatory potential, showed comparable inhibition of Cox(Cyclo-oxigenase)-1 (&gt;64%) with positive control SC-560 and of Cox-2 (&gt;90%) with positive control NS–398, respectively [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These results suggested that the cleavage between C-1 and C-13 in crinane alkaloid skeleton is a structural feature important to impart biological activity, in which also the presence of the hydroxyl at C-6′ could play a role [
