<p>The investigation on the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids began in 1877 with the isolation of lycorine from 
 <italic>Narcissus pseudonarcissus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and then the interest around this group of naturally occurring compounds increased because of the large spectrum of their biological activities. These include antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antiviral, analgesic, and cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) inhibitory activities. The uniqueness of these alkaloid structures provided a viable platform for phytochemical-based drug discovery [
