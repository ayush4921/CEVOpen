<p>Flavonoids can be classified into different groups according to the chemical characteristics of the molecules. Among these, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols (catechins) and anthocyanidins are the best known. In addition, flavan-3-ois or flavan-3,4-diols give rise to the various structural types of the condensed tannin class [
