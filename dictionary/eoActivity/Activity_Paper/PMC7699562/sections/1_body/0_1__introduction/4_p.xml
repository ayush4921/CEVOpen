<p>Peptic ulcer therapy aims to relieve pain, heal the ulceration, and prevent complications and recurrence. The current treatment of peptic ulcers consists mainly of anti-secretory medications, such as histamine H
 <sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and cytoprotectors (sucralfate and salts bismuth); in cases where 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection occurs, the use of antimicrobials is necessary [

However, the pharmacological treatment of peptic ulcers still has some limiting factors, such as side effects, especially in individuals on prolonged therapy and the increased resistance of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> to antimicrobial agents [
