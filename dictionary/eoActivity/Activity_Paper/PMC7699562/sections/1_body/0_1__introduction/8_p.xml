<p>The structural diversity of flavonoids is derived by substitutions in their base skeleton through hydroxylation, glycosylation, methylation, acylation, and prenylation reactions in different positions. These constituents are present in plants as aglycone or glycoside conjugates, but most flavonoids are present in the form of glycosides under natural conditions. The attached sugar portions include
