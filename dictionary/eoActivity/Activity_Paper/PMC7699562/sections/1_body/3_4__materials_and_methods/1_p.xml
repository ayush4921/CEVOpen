<p>The antiulcer activity of the flavonoids was researched using reference databases such as PubMed and Science Direct and keywords: gastroprotective or antiulcer or antiulcerogenic activity and flavonoids.

References were consulted for details of the experimental models used to test the activity of the substances, dose, route of administration, tested organism, inducing agent, and effect.
