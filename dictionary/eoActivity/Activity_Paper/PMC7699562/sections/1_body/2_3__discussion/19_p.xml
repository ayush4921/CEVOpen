<p>Prostaglandins are lipid mediators synthesized by the enzyme, COX. There are two main isoforms of COXs, with COX-1 (constitutive) responsible for maintaining baseline levels of PGs and COX-2 (inducible) involved in inflammatory processes. PGs play a central role in the defense of the gastric epithelium, by inhibiting acid secretion, stimulating mucus and HCO
