<p>The stress-induced gastric ulcer model has been extensively studied over time. Stress is a consequence of physiological changes when the body or mind is exposed to pressure situations. The damage to the gastric mucosa induced by stress can be acute, erosive, and inflammatory; it is related mainly to changes in microcirculation and hypoxia. Mucosal lesions are usually superficial and asymptomatic, but they can extend to the submucosal and muscular layers, breaking larger vessels and causing evident and clinical significance [
