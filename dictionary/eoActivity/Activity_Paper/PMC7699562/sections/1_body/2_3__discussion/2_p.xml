<p>Ethanol is widely used as an ulcerogenic agent in the evaluation of gastroprotective effects in experimental models, mainly due to the fact that alcohol is one of the most common causes of gastric ulcers in humans [

After absorption, ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by the action of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and later converted to acetic acid, which has cytotoxicity to gastric cells [
