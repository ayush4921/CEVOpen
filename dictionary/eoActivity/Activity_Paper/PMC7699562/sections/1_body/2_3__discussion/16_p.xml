 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], increase gastric mucus. The mucus is secreted in a regulated manner by epithelial cells on the gastroduodenal surface and consists mainly of water and a mixture of phospholipids, glycoproteins (mucin), and HCO

 <sup>âˆ’</sup>. The mucus maintains a pH gradient between 6 and 7 along the surface of epithelial cells in relation to pH 1 to 2 on the gastric luminal surface, preventing the proteolytic action of pepsin and HCl [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mucus is formed by mucin granules which, when released by exocytosis, react with water and form viscous fluid, forming a physical barrier to external aggressors [
 <xref rid="B181-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Studies show that even if low acid secretion occurs, weakening the mucus barrier can cause damage to the stomach wall [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, these flavonoids act to increase the mucosal defense factors, protecting epithelial cells against the action of enzymes digestive, acid, abrasion of food particles and other aggressors.
