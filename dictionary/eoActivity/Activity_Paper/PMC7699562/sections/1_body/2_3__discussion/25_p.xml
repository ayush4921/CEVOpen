<p>Angiogenesis is an essential element for the healing of gastric ulcers, as it contributes to the reepithelization and mucosal restitution through a reconstruction of the microvascular network, favoring the supply of blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients. VEGF plays an important role in the healing of gastric ulcers, stimulating the neovascularization [
