<p>Another important ulcer induction mechanism is through NSAIDs. They exert a local action in gastric mucosa by destabilizing the layer of membrane phospholipids causing reperfusion of the H

Systemically, they exert their effects by inhibiting isoforms of COX-1 and COX-2 and are one of the most common causes of peptic ulcers, reducing the synthesis of cytoprotein prostaglandins and consequently decreasing the secretion of mucus, bicarbonate, and maintenance of adequate blood flow [
