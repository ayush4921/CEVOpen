<p>Besides, the pyloric ligation model mimics chronic constipation due to stasis of gastric motility, causing the acidic content to remain in contact with the gastric mucosa for a long time. Exposure of the gastric lumen to this accumulation of acid secretion promotes self-digestion of the gastric mucosa and loss of integrity of the mucosal barrier, leading to ulcer instability [
