<p>When the cells of the gastric epithelium are subjected to some stress conditions, thermal shock factor 1 (HSF1) is transcribed, which in turn induces the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially the HSP-70 chaperone, which prevents cells from entering apoptosis by preventing intracellular protein denaturation. Disturbance in the metabolism of HSP can also induce mucosal damage in response to ROS [
