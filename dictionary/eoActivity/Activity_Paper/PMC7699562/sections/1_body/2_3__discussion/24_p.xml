<p>One of the factors involved in the structuring of the gastric mucosa is matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs are a family of enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling. MMPs are important in the pathogenesis of ulcers, acting at the beginning of the formation of injuries, as well as in the healing process. MMP-9 is expressed by a few cells in a normal situation, but this isoform is highly inducible in inflammatory situations. Thus, MMP-9 is an important marker in the process of inflammation and ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract [
