 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa from damage induced by NSAIDs, suggesting that flavonoids can act by a cytoprotective mechanism (for example by stimulating prostaglandins and mucus and bicarbonate secretion), increasing the protective factors and maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. Thus, these flavonoids could improve the therapeutic effectiveness of NSAIDs by delaying the gastrointestinal side effects associated with these drugs.
