<p>Some studies have assessed apoptosis markers in models of gastric ulcer as caspase-3, Cit C, and Bcl-2. The apoptosis cascade is another important pathway involved in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcers and is also correlated with oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. Caspase-3 is the main executing enzyme, activated by the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor. In the mitochondrial pathway, with ROS and TNF-Î± breaking the balance between pro and anti-apoptosis factors, Cit C is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, followed by caspase-9 and activation of caspase-3 [
