<p>Catechin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and its gallate derivatives are monomeric flavanols with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities present in green tea [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Some studies have demonstrated the gastroprotective effect of catechin and their derivates. Epigallocatechin gallate (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/kg, p.o., rat) has anti-ulcer activity in the NSAIDs model, related to its ability to reduce important inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress present in pathological conditions of ulceration. The mechanism associated with this effect involves the reduction in NO and iNOS levels, neutrophil infiltration, and MPO activity. In addition, to modulating the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mucin content in gastric tissue and levels of PGEs have also been reported to protect the mucosa [

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Epicatechin (25 and 50 mg/kg, p.o., rat) has a gastroprotective action in models of ethanol (carbenoxolone, 100 mg/kg, positive group) and NSAIDs (cimetidine, 100 mg/kg, positive group), involving the participation of sulfhydryl compounds (SHs), via adrenergic, K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels, increased mucus production and decreased H
 <sup>+</sup> secretion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the involvement of SOD, NO, and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) in gastroprotection [

Catechin (35 mg/kg, rat, p.o.) increased the activity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and total sulfhydryl and up-regulating of a Nrf2 in the NSAIDs model in vivo and in vitro [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The anti-secretory potential of catechin derivatives plays a crucial role in the protective capacity of green tea against peptic ulcer, which is mediated by the inhibition of H
 <sup>+</sup>-K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. The inhibitory function of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is another pharmacological mechanism of the catechin derivates and other constituents of green tea for the treatment of peptic ulcers [
