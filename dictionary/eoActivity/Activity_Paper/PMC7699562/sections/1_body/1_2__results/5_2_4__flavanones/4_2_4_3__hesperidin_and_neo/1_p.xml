<p>Hesperidin and neohesperidine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f005">Figure 5</xref>) are flavanones found in citrus products, such as orange and lemon, associated with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Several researchers have examined the gastroprotective activity of these flavanones in experimental ulcer models [

 <xref rid="B112-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>,
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Chinese decoction containing hesperidin reduced gastric ulceration indomethacin and ethanol induced [

 <xref rid="B115-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Hesperidin and neohesperidine (100 mg/kg, p.o., rat) were evaluated in the NSAIDs model. Ulcer index, expression of gastric COX-2 gene, TNF-α, MDA, and GSH content in the stomach were measured [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Hesperidin (150, 300, and 450 mg/kg, p.o., rat) and omeprazole (20 mg/kg) were also evaluated in NSAIDs and stress models, with GSH, SOD, and CAT investigation [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The synergistic effect of a combination of lycopene and hesperidin (100 mg/kg, p.o., rat) has been reported on ulcers induced by pyloric ligation [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Hesperidin (50 mg/kg, p.o., rat) and omeprazole (20 mg/kg) exhibit protective effects in ethanol-induced peptic ulcer. Expression of gastric COX-2 gene, TNF-α, MDA, the content of hydrogen peroxide groups (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), and Thiol (-SH) in the stomach and antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GPx were measured. Hesperidin decreased COX-2 expression and gastric DNA fragmentation, reduced TNF-α production, and gastric lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Hesperidin (100 mg/kg, p.o.) prevents oxidative cell damage in the stress model in rats by significantly increasing levels of GSH, SOD, CAT, and mucin levels in the gastric mucosa and decreasing levels of lipid peroxidation and inflammatory markers [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Hesperidin (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o., rat) has a protective effect on acetic acid-induced chronic gastric ulcers (assessment of mucin, GSH, SOD, CAT, and MPO levels) [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Hesperidin also inhibited 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> in vitro (0.05–0.5 mMol/L) [
