<p>Genistein (5,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f006">Figure 6</xref>) belongs to a natural isoflavonoids class that has an estrogenic effect, being one typical example of a phytoestrogen compound [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. It was isolated for the first time from 
 <italic>Genista tinctoria</italic> and was named after the genus of this plant, but today it is known that the main sources of genistein are soy-based foods (
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> or 
 <italic>Soy hispida</italic>) [

Genistein (10 mg/kg, p.o., rat) showed a gastroprotective effect in an experimental model of gastric lesion induced by indomethacin, reducing inflammation (TNF-α), decreasing oxidative stress (increased SOD and reducing MDA and iNOS activity) and restoring mucoprotective function (PGE
 <sub>2</sub> levels) [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Another study evaluated the protective effect of genistein (10 mg/kg, p.o., rat) in the experimental model of gastric lesion induced by indomethacin in a 7-day treatment protocol. The animals were treated with genistein once a day for seven days before the induction of gastric lesion by indomethacin. Pretreatment with genistein significantly improved ulcer indexes and increased the level of NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and SOD activity and significantly decreased MDA, levels of TNF-α and MPO activity, and expression of MMP-9 was negatively regulated [

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine was evaluated, showing a significantly better gastroprotective effect than in individual administration [
