The gastroprotective effects of these two flavonoids were evaluated in the models of acute gastric ulcer induced by HCl/ethanol in mice, using carbenoxolone (200 mg/kg) as a positive control. Quercitrin (1.38 mg/kg, p.o.) and afzelin (0.026 and 0.078 mg/kg, p.o.) showed gastroprotective activity in this model. Quercitrin prevented the depletion of gastric glutathione (GSH) content and quercitrin and afzelin reduced MPO activity. These compounds also inhibited H
