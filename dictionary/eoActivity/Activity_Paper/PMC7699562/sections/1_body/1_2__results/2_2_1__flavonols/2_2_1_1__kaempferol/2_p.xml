<p>Kaempferol (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, p.o.) and the control drug omeprazole (20 mg/kg) protects gastric ulcers induced by ethanol in mice, inhibiting the accumulation of neutrophils, decreasing the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and interleukin-6 (IL-6), improving NO and gastric mucus [

 <italic>H. pylori</italic> in vitro with a 0.05 mMol/L of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); this effect involves the expression of the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (Vac A) genes and reduces the inflammatory process triggered by this microorganism (reduced levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in AGS cells) [
