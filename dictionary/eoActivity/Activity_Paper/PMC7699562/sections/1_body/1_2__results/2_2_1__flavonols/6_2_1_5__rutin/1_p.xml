<p>Rutin, also called quercetin-3-rutinoside (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f002">Figure 2</xref>), is a flavonoid found in tomatoes, orange, carrots, sweet potatoes, black tea, and apple peels. The name rutin comes from the plant 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic>, which also contains rutin. Chemically, it is a glycoside that comprises flavonolic quercetin aglycone together with rutinosis disaccharide. It has some pharmacological activities described in the literature, such as neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The mechanism underlying these effects is believed to stem from its antioxidant activity and the ability to suppress processes mediated by free radicals, inferring that the antioxidant properties of rutin may be useful in the clinical treatment of gastric disorders [

Rutin (200 mg/kg, p.o.) showed gastroprotective activity against gastric lesions induced with indomethacin in rats, inhibition of neutrophil infiltration, and suppression of the generation of oxidative stress (increasing GSH and SOD and reducing MPO) [

The anti-ulcerogenic potential of rutin (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, p.o.) has already been investigated in several ulcer induction models: ethanol, stress and acetic acid in rats reduced gastric damage in all models, with decreased MDA levels and increased GPx activity [
