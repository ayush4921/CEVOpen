<p>Baicalin is a flavone glycoside; it is the glucuronide of baicalein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The gastroprotective and antisecretory effects of baicalin (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, p.o., rats) were evaluated by different induction methods such as alcohol, stress, NSAIDs and pyloric ligation. These involved Nfr2 modulation [

 <italic>H. pylori</italic> in vitro (IC

 <italic>H. pylori</italic> is the inhibition of the urease enzyme (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.82 mMol/L) in gastric epithelial cells (GES-1). This finding was confirmed by the study of molecular docking. In addition, baicalin also exerted an inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> on multi-drug resistant strains, significantly reducing the MICs of the amoxicillin and tetracycline antimicrobials. This effect was related to reduced expression of the hefA gene [
