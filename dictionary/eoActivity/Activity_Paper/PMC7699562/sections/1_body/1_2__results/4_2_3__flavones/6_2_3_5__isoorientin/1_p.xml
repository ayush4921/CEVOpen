The gastroprotective activity of isoorientin was evaluated in the model of gastric damage induced by indomethacin in rats (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant anti-ulcer effect with a reduction in the level of MDA and increased SOD activity and GSH levels. Famotidine was used as a standard anti-ulcer medication [
