<p>Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one or 5,7-dihydroxyfavone) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) is a naturally occurring flavone present in several plants (
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>Passiflora incarnate</italic>, 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>) and natural products such as propolis [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Its molecule is very similar to that of other flavonoids such as apigenin and luteolin [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects have been reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Chrysin (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a gastroprotective effect in the indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model in rats, involving cytoprotective mechanisms (promoting mucus secretion), anti-inflammatory (inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage mobilization), antioxidant (participation of GSH, CAT, and MDA) and angiogenic with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Omeprazole (30 mg/kg) was used as a control group [

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Recently, Fagundes et al., (2020) [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] demonstrated the gastric healing effect of chrysin (10 mg/kg, p.o., mice) and lansoprazole (30 mg/kg, control group) in the acetic acid model, improving the expression of inflammatory genes such as COX-2, inhibiting the negative remodeling promoted by MMP-9, increasing the cell proliferation effect via epidermal growth factor (EGF) and reducing cell apoptosis by modulating caspase-3.
