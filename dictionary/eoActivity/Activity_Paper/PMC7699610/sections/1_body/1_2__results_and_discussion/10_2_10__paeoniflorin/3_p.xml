<p>The induction of paeoniflorin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the severity of colitis. It resulted in the negative regulation of several inflammatory parameters in the colon, including MPO activity and mRNA expression of mediators of the profile inflammatory such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), COX-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17. Experiments using knockdown animals and overexpression of TLR4 demonstrated that TLR4 is a requirement for the negative regulation of inflammatory cytokines [
