<p>Thymol treatment reduced macroscopic and histological damage compared to the control group and markedly inhibited the production of MPO and TNF-α in the colon tissue. Moreover, thymol reduced the expression of the NF-κB p65 protein. The results suggest that thymol exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on colitis, inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and decreasing the expression of TNF-α and MPO activity [
