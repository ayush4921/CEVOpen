<p>In another study by Tahmasebi et al. (2019), luminal instillation of acetic acid was used to induce colitis in rats, and thymol (100 mg/kg p.o.) was administered for ten consecutive days. The expression of COX-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, levels of total protein, NO, MPO, malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α and relative expression of IκBα and RNAm NF-κBp65 using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of colon homogenates.</p>
