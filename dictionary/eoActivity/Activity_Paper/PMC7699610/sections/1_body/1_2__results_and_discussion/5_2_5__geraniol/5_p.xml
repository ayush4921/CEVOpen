<p>The anti-inflammatory effect of geraniol was related to inhibition of the colon contents of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-1β. In assessing the pathways involved in anticolitic activity, geraniol inhibited the expression of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, β-catenin, protein kinase activated by mitogen p38 (p38MAPK), and NF-κB [

The anti-inflammatory activity of geraniol can be mediated by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and the MAPK cascade (ERK, SAP/JNK, and p38MAPK), promoting a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, geraniol upregulated the γ receptor activated by peroxisome proliferator (PPARγ), these effects were comparable to those of sulfasalazine, the standard drug. The effects mediated by the combination of sulfasalazine with geraniol, surpassed any isolated treatment [
