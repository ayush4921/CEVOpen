 <sc>d</sc>-limonene was administered orally to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and reduced intestinal inflammatory scores and serum TNF-α concentrations compared to rats with untreated TNBS-induced colitis. The anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene involved the inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB translocation in fibroblast cultures. Moreover, when applied to HT-29/B6 colonic cell monolayers, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene increased epithelial resistance [

 <sc>d</sc>-limonene presents significant anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro, and its effects involve protection in the epithelial barrier and reduction of cytokines, suggesting a beneficial role of 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene in reducing inflammation [
