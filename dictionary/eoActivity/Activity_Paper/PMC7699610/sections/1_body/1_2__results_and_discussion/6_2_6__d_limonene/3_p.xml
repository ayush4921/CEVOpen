<p>In another study by Yu et al. (2017), 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene was administered at a dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg p.o. for seven days, and the administration of 2% DSS induced colitis for seven days. Treatment with 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene reduced disease activity and colonic mucosa damage. This effect was mediated by suppression of the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase gene (MMP) 2 and 9, zinc-dependent endopeptidases produced by fibroblasts, keratinocytes and inflammatory cells [
