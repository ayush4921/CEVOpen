<p>In a study carried out by Zhang et al. (2017), the authors examined the activity of (+)-borneol and the association with edaravone (EDA) in the model of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). EDS (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a free radical scavenger that shows promising activities in the prevention of neuroinflammation, liver damage, and antioxidants [

Acute colitis was induced by adding 2.5% DSS in drinking water for seven days. The treatments were carried out with EDA (3, 6 or 12 mg/kg), with (+)-borneol (3 mg/kg), or with a preparation composed of EDA and (+)-borneol with a mass ratio of 4:1, respectively (3.75, 7.5 or 15 mg/kg). All treatments were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for another ten days after induction [
