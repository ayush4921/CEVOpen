<p>Macrophages are innate immune system cells, which play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Depending on environmental stimuli, they are generally polarized into two functionally opposed forms, i.e., classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2) [

M1 macrophages induced by IFN-γ, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can trigger Th1 and Th17 responses producing high levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL- 6, IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-23 [
