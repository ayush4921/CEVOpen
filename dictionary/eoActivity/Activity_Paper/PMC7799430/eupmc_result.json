    "The <i>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-</i>2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in outbreak of global pandemic, fatal pneumonia in human referred as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (Covid-19). Ayurveda, the age old practice of treating human ailments in India, can be considered against SARS-CoV-2. Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (<i>Phyllanthus amarus</i> and <i>Andrographis paniculata</i> used in Ayurveda<i>)</i> with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open & closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from <i>P. amarus</i> and 14 phytochemicals from <i>A. paniculata</i> shown binding energy affinity/dock score < - 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from <i>P. amarus</i> and <i>A. paniculata</i> showed binding affinity up to - 9.10 kcal/mol and - 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in <i>P. amarus</i> have shown more binding affinity (up to - 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to - 9.50 kcal/mol). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be non-carcinogenic, water soluble and biologically safe. The phytochemicals present in the extracts of <i>P. amarus</i> and <i>A. paniculata</i> might have synergistic effect with action on multiple target sites of SARS-CoV-2. The information generated here might serve as preliminary evidence for anti SARS-CoV-2 activity of phytochemicals present from <i>P. amarus</i> and <i>A. paniculata</i> and the potential of Ayurveda medicine in combating the virus.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-020-02578-7."
