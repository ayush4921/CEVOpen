<p id="Par4">The highly conserved spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by targeting the host ACE2. Hence, S protein is one of the drug target to neutralize the virus (Walker and Burton

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). Proteases (3CLpro and PLpro) translated from viral RNA are essential for polyprotein processing of SARS-CoV-2 and involved in replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 can serve as potent therapeutic targets (Prussia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2011</xref>; Sheahan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 proteases act on polyproteins (PP1a and PP1ab) to release the nsps which are encoded by open reading frame (ORF1a/b) of virus (Sheahan et al.
