According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the novel zoonotic pathogenic virus associated with COVID-19 is

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2020</xref>; Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). Sore throat, dry cough, fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell and respiratory distress are major symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Cheng et al.
