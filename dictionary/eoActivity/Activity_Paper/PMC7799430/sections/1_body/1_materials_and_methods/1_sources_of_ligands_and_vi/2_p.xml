<p id="Par9">The three-dimensional (3D) conformers of the selected ligands were retrieved from PubChem (

Similarly, the 3D structures of proteins determined using a biophysical technique such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy are openly available in protein data bank were retrieved (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>). Four different viral targets were considered for docking studies, viz
 <italic>.</italic> spike protein (S protein), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The crystal structure of S protein and 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 available in the protein databank were retrieved for the current study. The PDB ID for S protein and 3CLpro are PDB ID: 6VSB, chains A, B, C, 6VXX (closed), 6VYB (open) (Wrapp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>) and PDB ID: 6LU7, chain A (Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>), respectively. Crystal protein structures of PLpro and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 were not available in the protein databank at the time of analysis. Hence, the crystal structure developed for the both proteins using the X-ray structure of PLpro of human coronavirus papain-like proteases (PDB ID: 4OVZ, chain A) (Baez-Santos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) and the solved RdRp structure (97.08% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2) of SARS-HCoV (PDB ID: 6NUS, chain A) (Kirchdoerfer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>) were downloaded for docking studies.
