 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>), the Gasteiger charges were added and standard processes were used to obtain the PDBQT files. The downloaded 3D structures were checked for the presence of any improper bonds, side-chain anomalies and missing hydrogens using PyMOL software (Delano 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). All the water molecules, complex molecules, ions and ligands of the proteins were removed in Biovia Discovery Studio 2020 (Biovia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). The optimized PDB structures were uploaded to AutoDock-MGL Tool (Morris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>), succinctly, polar hydrogens were added and standard processes were used to obtain the PDBQT files.
