<p id="Par16">The 3D and 2D visualization of top three phytochemicals along with positive control remdesivir based on binding affinity with respective viral receptor protein is represented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, respectively. Hydrogen bond energy is the major contributor in dock score. Hydrogen bond formation between ligand structures and viral receptors is responsible for inhibition of the target protein, and it reflects the firmness of bonding between the protein and ligand (Chen et al.

 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> used in the current docking studies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins shown very good dock score above the threshold cut-off of − 6 kcal/mol. Ligand structures and necessary hydrogen bond formation between phytochemical with respective viral receptor is illustrated in Table
