<p id="Par33">The ADME and pharmacokinetic properties of selected phytochemicals are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Lipinski rule of five (Lipinski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2004</xref>) is a thumb rule to evaluate the drug likeliness or to determine the pharmacological activities that would make it orally active drug in humans. According to the rule, the compound should abide following criteria, i.e., (1) molecular mass less than 500 Daltons, (2) high lipophilicity (expressed as logP less than 5), (3) less than five hydrogen bond donors and (4) less than ten hydrogen bond acceptors (Petit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2012</xref>). Of 15 compounds along with remdesivir screened, eight compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, hinokinin, isoandrographolide, 14-deoxy-14, 15-didehydroandrographolide, 14-Deoxyandrographolide, 19-
 <italic>O</italic>-Acetyl-14-deoxy-11, 12-didehydroandrographolide and neoandrographolide) did not violate any of the above rule. However, four compounds, viz. astragalin (HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5), quercitrin (HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5) and 5-hydroxy-7, 8, 2′, 5′-tetramethoxy flavone (MW &gt; 500, HBA &gt; 10) along with positive control remdesivir, have violated two rules. Three compounds belong to tannins, i.e., corilagin (MW &gt; 500, HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5), furosin (MW &gt; 500, HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5) and geraniin (MW &gt; 500, HBA &gt; 10, HBD &gt; 5), have violated three rules (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The violation of two or more criteria predicts a molecule to be a non-orally available drug (Lipinski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2004</xref>). However, this rule applies only for oral drugs, and the compounds violating the Lipinski’s rule of five can be administered through other means after determining its side effects (Benet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>).
