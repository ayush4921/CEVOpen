<p id="Par18">The molecular docking analysis of S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 with 21 selected phytochemicals from 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>amarus</italic> showed that the majority of the compounds bind to S protein with favourable binding energy ranging from − 6.10 kcal/mol (for phyllanthin) to − 10.60 kcal/mol (for geraniin) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). When the binding energy of phytochemicals was investigated, nine compounds, viz. geraniin (− 10.60 kcal/mol), furosin (− 10.20 kcal/mol), astragalin (− 9.80 kcal/mol), quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (− 9.80 kcal/mol), quercitrin (− 9.20 kcal/mol), corilagin (− 8.80 kcal/mol), hinokinin (− 8.40 kcal/mol), kaempferol (− 8.30 kcal/mol) and quercetin (− 8.10 kcal/mol), exhibited highest binding affinity. Interestingly, the phytochemicals belonging to the flavonoids and tannins of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>amarus</italic> have shown a very high affinity with the target protein. Molecular dynamic simulation studies also reported that quercetin and kaempferol bind with the ACE2-S complex with low binding free energy (Pandey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>). The antiviral bioactivities of many flavonoids from medicinal plants were reported by several studies (Thayil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>; Zakaryan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2017</xref>; Jo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). Among all compounds, geraniin exhibited (− 10.60 kcal/mol) highest docking score with S protein. THR302, ILE312, GLN314 and ARG765 amino acid residues were involved in forming four hydrogen bonds in the binding pocket of S protein (Table
