<p id="Par21">All the 15 phytochemicals of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> docked with both closed and open state S protein falls between − 6.00 kcal/mol and − 8.4 kcal/mol for closed state and − 8.50 kcal/mol (remdesivir). However, these phytochemicals might also have neutralizing effects on the activity of S protein since their dock score is more than − 6.00 kcal/mol, which is a cut-off value for considering the effective binding affinity. The binding affinities ranged from − 7.10 kcal/mol (for andrograpanin) to − 8.20 kcal/mol (for14-deoxy-14,15-didehydroandrographolide and 14-deoxyandrographolide) for closed state of S protein. For the open state S protein, dock score ranged between − 6.60 kcal/mol (for andrograpanin) and − 8.40 kcal/mol (for neoandrographolide). The results indicate that the phytochemicals under study do not have much significant difference with respect to binding affinities in both the closed and open state of S protein. However, there was difference observed with respect to the hydrogen bonding between open and closed state S protein with more favourable bonds observed in open state compared to closed state, which is having more unfavourable bonds.
