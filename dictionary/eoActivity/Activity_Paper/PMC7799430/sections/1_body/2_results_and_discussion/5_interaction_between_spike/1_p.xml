<p id="Par17">S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 latches onto human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and undergoes structural changes that allow the viral membrane to fuse with the cell membrane of the host (Walls et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2020</xref>). Despite the high similarity between sequences and structures of SARS and SARS CoV-2, the drugs successfully used to cure SARS are ineffective in case of this novel virus (Fani et al.
