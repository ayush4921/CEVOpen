<p id="Par29">Among 21 compounds from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> screened against RdRp, epibubbialine has shown lowest dock score of − 6.30 kcal/mol (below − 6.0 kcal/mol is considered as having good binding affinity) and corilagin has shown highest dock score of − 9.30 kcal/mol (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Seven compounds: corilagin (− 9.30 kcal/mol), furosin (− 9.10 kcal/mol), geraniin (− 9.10 kcal/mol), quercetin (− 8.60 kcal/mol), hinokinin (− 8.20 kcal/mol), quercetin (− 8.10 kcal/mol) and quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (− 7.70 kcal/mol) from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> exhibited better dock score compared to the RdRp antagonist remdesivir (− 7.60 kcal/mol). Corilagin with high binding affinity of − 9.30 kcal/mol has interacted with active site residues, TYR129, HIS133, LEU207, ASN705 and GLN724 of RdRp of virus through five hydrogen bonds (Table
