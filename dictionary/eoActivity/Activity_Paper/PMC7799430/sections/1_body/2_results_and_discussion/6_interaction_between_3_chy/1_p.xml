<p id="Par22">The SARS-CoV-2 protease enzyme, 3CLpro, involved in C-terminal cleavage of virus polyprotein is a potential target for drug discovery to SARS-CoV-2, since it controls replication (Qmar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>). Hence, this potential target was evaluated with the selected 35 compounds from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>. Before docking simulation, the target site for viral receptor protein was selected based on the location of co-crystallized inhibitor N3 as this target site has been considered to be the most commending site for ligand interaction (Murugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>).
