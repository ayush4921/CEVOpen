<p id="Par14">Prior to the docking analysis, the ligands were optimized by minimizing the energy with force field type MMFF94, this helps in removing clashes among atoms and develops a stable starting pose of the ligands for binding interaction (Klebe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>). The docking coupled with a scoring function can be utilized to evaluate a large number of potential drugs in silico. In the process of molecular docking, generally, the binding affinity lesser than the upper threshold (− 6 kcal/mol) is regarded as a cut off value for determining good binding affinity between ligand and protein (Shityakov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>). Of the 35 compounds screened from two plant species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), three compounds (cinnamic acid, phenylalanine and farnesyl farnesol) did not qualify as per the threshold binding affinity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
