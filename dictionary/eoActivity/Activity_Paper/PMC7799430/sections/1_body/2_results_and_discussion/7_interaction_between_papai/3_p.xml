<p id="Par27">The binding affinity of compounds from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> with PLpro ranged from -6.80 kcal/mol (for andrograpanin) to − 9.00 kcal/mol (for 5-Hydroxy-7, 8-dimethoxyflavone). Even though binding affinities of all the 15 compounds falls between -6.00 kcal/mol and less than the dock score of positive control remdesivir (− 9.5 kcal/mol), they also might have inhibitory effects on the activity of PLpro. The results suggest that, among the promising phytochemicals from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> docked with PLpro, flavonoids (quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and astragalin) and phenylpropanoid (hinokinin) have exhibited better binding affinity. The SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is an essential for virus replication (Baez-Santos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) and any compound having good binding affinity with inhibitory effects will be of immense potential in containing this virus. The flavonoids and phenylpropanoids showing good affinity binding abilities might serve as lead molecules for the discovery of novel drugs to SARS-CoV-2.
