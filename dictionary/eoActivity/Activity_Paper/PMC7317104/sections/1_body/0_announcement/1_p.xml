 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain I05A-00742 is a Gram-positive bacterium that was isolated from a soil sample in Napahai in Shangri-La, Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. Piericidin A1 has been shown to have many biological activities, including insecticidal (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), antifungal (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and antitumor (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) activities. Three piericidin A1 biosynthetic gene clusters have been characterized in

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain SCSIO 03032 (

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces philanthi</named-content> bv. triangulum (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and display similar genetic organization. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. I05A-00742, a potential piericidin producer revealed by its genome sequence.
