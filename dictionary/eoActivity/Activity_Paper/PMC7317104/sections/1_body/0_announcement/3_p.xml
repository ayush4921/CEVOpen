<p>In the draft genome sequence of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. I05A-00742, 33 putative secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were found using antiSMASH v5.1.2 (default setting) (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Of these clusters, the putative piericidin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster is located in scaffold 13, and its gene content and amino acid sequences show high similarity with the reported piericidin A1 clusters (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, antiSMASH revealed some gene clusters related to the biosynthesis of analogues of ketomemicin, qinichelins, and citrulassin, as well as a number of clusters which are not highly conserved with any known cluster. The genome sequence of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. I05A-00742 may facilitate a better understanding of the biosynthesis of piericidins in different producing strains and provide insights into its metabolic potential for novel compounds.
