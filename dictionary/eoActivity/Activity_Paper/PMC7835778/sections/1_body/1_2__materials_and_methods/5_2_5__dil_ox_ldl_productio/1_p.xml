<p>LDLs were first oxidized and then labelled with DilC
 <sub>18</sub> (3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dardilly, France), a lipophilic fluorescent probe that interacts with phospholipid layer membranes, leading to the formation of fluorescent Dil-LDL detectable at excitation and emission wavelengths of respectively 549 nm and 565 nm. Dil-ox-LDL production was done according to Xu et al., with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Ox-LDL were incubated overnight at 37 °C under gentle agitation with of Dil stock solution (3 mg/mL in DMSO) to reach a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The excess of the unbound probe was filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane to discard undissolved crystals and then re-isolated by ultracentrifugation as described above (in KBr at 252,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 h at 10 °C). The pink Dil-ox-LDL layer was recovered and desalted as described above. Filtered sterilized Dil-ox-LDL were added to cells at a final concentration of 100 µg/mL.
