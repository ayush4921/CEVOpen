<p>Cell viability was assessed by measuring the intake of neutral red as described by Repetto et al., with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This test is based on the capacity of viable cell lysosomes to incorporate neutral red dye solution. Cells were first seeded at 250 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL in a 96-well plate for 24 h. Before incubation with LDL (native of oxidized), cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Stimulation with medicinal plant decoctions (40 µg/mL) and/or with native or oxidized LDL (50 µg/mL to 300 µg/mL) was carried out for 8, 16 and 24 h. The medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. 100 µL of neutral red solution (40 µg/mL) was added and the cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After 2 washes with PBS, neutral red destain solution (49.5% water, 49.5% ethanol, 1% glacial acetic acid) was added and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. Triton X100 (1%) was used as positive control for cytotoxicity (100% of cell death). Results are expressed as percentages of the control untreated cells.
