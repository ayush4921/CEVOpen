<p>Fatty streak formation is defined by the presence of lipid accumulation within the arterial subendothelial space (intima). In response to excessive accumulation of ox-LDL in the intima, macrophages take up modified LDL (including ox-LDL) in an uncontrolled fashion, leading to their transformation into foam cells. In contrast to native LDL endocytosis by the canonical LDL receptor, oxidized LDL uptake by scavenger receptors is not downregulated by a negative feedback loop [

Several studies also showed the contribution of foam cells in inflammation, notably by secretion of cytokines and the release of cell debris [
