 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00280-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b) showed that 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> significantly decreased the Dil-ox-LDL uptake. Interestingly, 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> respectively inhibited Dil-ox-LDL uptake by 71.4 ± 8.67% and 74.3 ± 7.01%. Cells incubated with 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> showed similar profiles to that of control cells + Dil-ox-LDL, whereas 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> decoction, traditionally described for cholesterol lowering properties [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], was associated with a decreased abundance of intracellular Dil-ox-LDL (

 <italic>A. triplinervis, P. mauritianum</italic> decoctions or PBS). This property could support the traditionally described beneficial effect of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> in cardiovascular diseases. However, this should be tested in vivo in order to assess its capacity to lower cholesterol levels (as suggested by ethnopharmacological data) and potentially to prevent foam cell formation. Our results suggest that medicinal plant decoctions could constitute a therapeutic option to prevent or reduce atherosclerosis progression, that would deserve in vivo experiments in pre-clinical models.
