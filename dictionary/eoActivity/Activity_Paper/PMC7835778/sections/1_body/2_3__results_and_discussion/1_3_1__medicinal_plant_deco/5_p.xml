<p>Incubation with cytotoxic concentrations of ox-LDL for 8, 16 and 24 h resulted in decreased number of viable cells by 28.52 ± 4.40%, 35.47 ± 7.40% and 52.53 ± 2.43%, respectively. More than 80% of cell viability was observed in co-incubation with

 <italic>P. x graveolens,</italic> maintaining 83.78 ± 10.91, 81.73 ± 2.60 and 80.98 ± 4.66% of viable cells at 24 h. The presence of polyphenols in the different decoctions may explain this bioactivity. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00280-f002">Figure 2</xref>, most of the medicinal plant decoctions tested significantly decreased the cytotoxicity induced by ox-LDL at 8, 16 and 24 h. 
 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic> and 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> displayed moderate effects that were only significant at 24 h and question the physiological relevance of this protection. An interesting aspect that should be taken into account is that 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> which contains more than 98% of mangiferin and derivatives showed the higher protective effect. Several studies on mangiferin revealed its protective effects on cell survival both in vivo and
