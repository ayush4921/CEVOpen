<p>The greatest inhibition of LPS NF-κB activation was observed for 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> with, respectively, 93.0 ± 17.84, 86.4 ± 27.06 and 76.1 ± 8.33% of inhibition. Surprisingly, even if our results confirmed 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic> anti-inflammatory properties that were traditionally described, 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic> showed stronger effects. Our results also underline the potential of most of our selected medicinal plant decoctions in the management of inflammation. Indeed, seven out of eight medicinal plant preparations significantly reduced SEAP release. A decrease of SEAP release was also observed for 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> even if it was not statistically significant relative to the control (48.0 ± 24.99%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.08).
