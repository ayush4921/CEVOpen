<p>NF-κB signaling orchestrates different transcription pathways that regulate gene expression implicated in cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecule production, cell survival and differentiation [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Atherosclerosis is associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) or Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover, increased cytokine secretion by pro-inflammatory macrophages favors atherosclerosis progression. RAW-Blue™ macrophages were stimulated with different concentrations of ox-LDL in the presence of medicinal plant decoctions in order to assess their capacity to modulate NF-κB activation (monitored by the detection of secreted embryonic phosphatase alkaline -SEAP- in the medium, induced by NF-κB activation). In our experimental conditions, we were unable to show a significant increase in NF-κB activation after incubation with 100–200 µg/mL ox-LDL. Indeed, only ox-LDL stimulation at the cytotoxic concentration of 300 µg/mL (83% cell death) led to a significant increase of 61.1 ± 5.48% of SEAP release whereas 0.5 µg/mL LPS led to an increase of 165 ± 19.82% without altering cell viability. Because lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from bacteria such as

 <italic>E. coli</italic> are also known to exacerbate inflammation (IL-6, TNF-a secretion, NF-κB activation) and may be associated with atherosclerosis [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS triggers SEAP levels to 209.1 ± 45.92% as compared to control. Medicinal plant decoctions (40 µg/mL) significantly reduced NF-κB activation induced by
