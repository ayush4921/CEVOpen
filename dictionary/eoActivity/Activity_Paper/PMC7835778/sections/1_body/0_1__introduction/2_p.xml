<p>The first steps of atherosclerosis involve endothelial shear stress and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits in the subendothelial space [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. LDL oxidation takes place within the intimal compartment and promotes monocyte attraction, leading to their differentiation into macrophages [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The excessive and unregulated uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) by macrophages triggers their transformation into foam cells and induces cell death (contributing to the necrotic core formation) [

Macrophages play a crucial role in the development and the potential resolution of atherosclerosis, by participating in all steps of atherogenesis, from the initial lipid accumulation to the plaque rupture that leads to clinical events [
