<p>To further investigate the effect of the combination of PEL+LAT on the oxidative stress, the levels of nitrite were measured. Again, the administration of the sole PEL or LAT did not alter the levels of nitrite in cell-free supernatant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, red dots). In particular, we measured the following levels of nitrite: LPS: 13.48 ± 1.8 µM, PEL+LPS: 9.2 ± 3.4 µM, LAT+LPS: 9.69 ± 3.7 µM, PEL+LAT+LPS: 3.13 ± 0.2 µM. The administration of PEL+LAT showed a potentiated pharmacological activity compared with the single compound.
