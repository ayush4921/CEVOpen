<p>Because we wanted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the combination of PEL and LAT, we first analyzed the single components with the objective to identify the suboptimal concentration to use 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. J774.1 murine macrophage cells were treated for 24 h with serial concentrations of PEL (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml) or LAT (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml), in the presence or not of LPS (0.1 µg/ml), a well-known proinflammatory stimulus [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory activities were assessed by measuring the levels of IL-1β, a proinflammatory cytokine. The administration of the sole PEL (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml) (
