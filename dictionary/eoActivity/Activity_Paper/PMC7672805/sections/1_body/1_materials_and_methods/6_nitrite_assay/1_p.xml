<p>J774.1 cells were plated (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and treated as described above for 24 h. Nitrite levels in the culture supernatants were determined using the colorimetric Griess reaction (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Absorbance was measured with a plate reader at 550 nm. The concentration of nitrite (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) was determined from standard curves constructed with serial concentrations of sodium nitrite (NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>).
