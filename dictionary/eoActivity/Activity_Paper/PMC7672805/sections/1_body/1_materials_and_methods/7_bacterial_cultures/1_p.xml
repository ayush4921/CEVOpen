 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC-6538; 0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC-25922; 0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) were cultured in Lysogeny Broth (LB) and treated as follow: LB (Negative Control), Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep) 5× (5%) (Positive Control), PEL 10 μg/ml, LAT 1 μg/ml, PEL+LAT. These concentrations were chosen upon preliminary minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies. The bacterial growth was evaluated measuring absorbance at 595 nm, at the following experimental times: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 20 h.
