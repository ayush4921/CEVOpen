<p>IL-1β was measured in cell-free supernatants obtained from the J774.1 cultures. Time-course experiments were preliminary performed to define the optimal release of IL-1β according to a positive control, LPS±ATP (0.5 mM). We found that J774.1 macrophage cell cultures released higher levels of IL-1β after 24 h of treatment. IL-1β was detected by means of a commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Kits (ELISAs) (eBioscience, CA, U.S.A.; R&amp;D Systems, U.S.A.). Cytokine levels were expressed as pg/ml.</p>
