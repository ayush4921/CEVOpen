<p>J774.1 murine macrophage cells line were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Cambrex Biosciences, Microtech, Naples, Italy) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (Cambrex Biosciences, Microtech, Naples, Italy). Cells were seeded (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) 24 h before treatment. Then, cells were treated for 24 h with PEL (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml) and LAT (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml) ± LPS (0.1 µg/ml, Alexis, Vincibiochem, Italy). The following combinations have also been tested: PEL+LAT±LPS.
