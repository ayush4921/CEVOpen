<p>2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) is a cell-permeable probe used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). DCHF-DA probe is nonfluorescent in its initial form but it undergoes multistep conversion inside the cell that results in the formation of fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein (DCF), in presence of intracellular ROS. Briefly, J774.1 cells were plated (10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and treated as described above for 45 min [
