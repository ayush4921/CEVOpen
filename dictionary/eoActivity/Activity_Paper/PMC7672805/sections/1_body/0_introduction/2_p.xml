<p>Inspired by the healing of his tuberculosis, Charles Henry Stevens introduced this phytomedical drug to England in 1897 [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and since then, the use of this plant has increased more and more interest because of its beneficial properties. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated the usefulness of PEL in the treatment of several disorders due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and its antiproliferative effect [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our very recent paper, we demonstrated that PEL together with other natural products can exert antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So far, many studies have been conducted on the combination of PEL with other compounds, in order to identify new synergistic or enhanced pharmacological effects. In the present study, we have investigated the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of Pelargonium sidoides DC (PEL) combined with lactoferrin (LAT), a multifunctional protein that participates to numerous physiological functions.
