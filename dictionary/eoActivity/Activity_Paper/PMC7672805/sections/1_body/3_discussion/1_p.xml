<p>The main goal of the present study was to evaluate whether the combination of PEL and LAT could exert additive/synergistic pharmacological activities as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial agents compared with the single components. Similarly to what reported in literature, we found that PEL and LAT used alone were able to reduce LPS-induced proinflammatory IL-1Î², as well as reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite and bacteria growth. More importantly, the combination of PEL with LAT showed an additive pharmacological activity in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.</p>
