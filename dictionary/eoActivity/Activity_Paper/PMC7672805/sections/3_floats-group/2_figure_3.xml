  <title>Release of reactive oxygen species and nitrite</title>
  <p>Treatment of J774.1 murine macrophages with LAT (1 µg/ml) and PEL (10 µg/ml) in the presence or not of LPS at the concentration of 1 μg/ml (A) and 0.1 μg/ml (C). The different concentration of LPS was used in accordance to the levels of oxidants (A) and nitrite (C) produced. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Black dots represent the percentage of DCHF
   <sup>+</sup> cells after the single compound treatment, whereas the red dots represent the percentage of DCHF
   <sup>+</sup> cells in the presence of LPS. Cells were treated for 45 min. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative flow histogram plots. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Black dots represent the nitrite concentration after the single compound treatment, whereas the red dots represent the nitrite concentration in the presence of LPS. Cells were treated for 24 h. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic>=5). Statistically significant differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test.
