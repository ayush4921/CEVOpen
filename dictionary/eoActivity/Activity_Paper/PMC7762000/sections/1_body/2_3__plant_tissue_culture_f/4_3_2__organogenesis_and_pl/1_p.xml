<p>Thus far, the information on the plant regeneration protocols for

 <xref rid="B152-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Recently, we have provided information on the effect of exogenous application of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on the in vitro organogenesis of 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B137-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], pointing at the concentration of the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) as the most critical factor guiding this process. Specifically, it was demonstrated that at operational concentrations of BAP (0.375–0.75 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) both 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> and 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> present a higher frequency of direct shoot regeneration than 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic>. In turn, 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> was revealed as the most efficient species for the induction of callus formation during indirect organogenesis [
 <xref rid="B137-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. These results highlight the complexity of the design of plant in vitro regeneration protocols and shed light into the organogenesis-related processes of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp., facing to the large-scale exploitation of these medicinal plants.
