<p>In particular, our research group has developed a simple and reliable method for the disinfection of epiphyllous buds of the adult plants of 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> species grown in greenhouse, which involves the use of common, safe and environmental-friendly disinfectant agents [

 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,

 <xref rid="B137-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The protocol includes an initial tap water wash of the buds overnight, followed by a two-step stage, where the buds are rinsed in 70% ethanol (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) for 1 min, washed with sterile distilled water and then rinsed in 0.4% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) sodium hypochlorite with a few drops of Tween
 <sup>®</sup>-20 for 10 min. Finally, buds are gently washed with sterile distilled water and dried to remove persistent residues of disinfection agents. After the establishment under aseptic conditions, disinfected buds are placed and cultured in growth chambers under controlled conditions of photoperiod and temperature, thus enabling an adequate culture development. This procedure represents an improvement on the previously established disinfection protocols for 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp., in which slower procedures were performed [
 <xref rid="B138-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] with more concentrated disinfectants [
 <xref rid="B139-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]; with greater losses of viability [
 <xref rid="B140-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] and explants integrity [
 <xref rid="B141-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], or with more polluting agents, such as mercury chloride [
