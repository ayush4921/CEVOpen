<p>A single recent report is available for the establishment of PSCCs from

 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In this work, the use of PSCCs from 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> for the production of bioactive compounds was reported, with a special focus on the operational aspects required for the establishment of plant cell cultures, such as the determination of growth kinetics [
 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The typical four-phase growth behavior was reported only after 8 days of culture, starting with an initial lag phase where cells acclimatize to new culture conditions and no growth is observed. The lag phase is followed by the exponential phase, where cell divisions occur massively, reported by a severe increase in cell biomass. Afterward, a stationary phase is reached: cell growth stabilizes and the accumulation of secondary metabolites is observed, before reaching death phase, in which cell death takes place due to a lack of nutrients [
