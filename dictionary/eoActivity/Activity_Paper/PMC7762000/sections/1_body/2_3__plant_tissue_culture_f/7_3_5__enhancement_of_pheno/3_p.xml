<p>Little information about the elicited production of bioactive compounds by 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. can be found in the literature. Recently, the elicitation of phenolic compounds from in vitro-cultured 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. subjected to nutritional stress has been reported by García-Pérez and co-workers (2020) [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It was found that a decrease in the ammonium concentration in the culture medium causes a 50% overproduction and accumulation of phenolic compounds in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic>. The effect was less in magnitude in 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, the antioxidant efficiency of the derived 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts was assessed in terms of their free-radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition [

 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], suggesting that in vitro-cultured 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> can be considered a medicinal species with an improved phytochemical potential [
 <xref rid="B80-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], in comparison to closely-related species, such as 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic>. In this sense, due to its phytochemical potential, PSCCs from 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> were subjected to elicitation by cyclodextrins (CDs) [
 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides able of forming inclusion complexes with hydrophobic molecules. The results suggested that CDs elicited the production of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> PSCCs, as well as their associated free-radical scavenging activity. Specifically, it was shown that CDs favored the accumulation of total phenols and flavonoids in the culture medium (7.9 and 17.3-fold increases, respectively) after 7 days of culture, thus, preserving the integrity of the cellular fraction for subsequent elicitation cycles [
