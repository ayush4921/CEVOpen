<p>The term elicitation, as recently defined by Narayani and Srivastava (2017) [
 <xref rid="B161-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], refers to “the manipulation of biochemical and metabolic pathways, via stress induction, that can be implemented for enhancing secondary metabolite production and characterize the role of stress factors on plants using plant cell and/or tissue cultures as model systems”. On this basis, different types of culture may constitute precious biological platforms for the stimulation of plant secondary metabolism under controlled conditions, by the administration of elicitors (
