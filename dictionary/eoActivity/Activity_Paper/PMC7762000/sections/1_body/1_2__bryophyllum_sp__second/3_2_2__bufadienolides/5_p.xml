<p>The bioactivity of phenolic and bufadienolides compounds reveals an unexploited phytochemical potential associated with 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. However, research on these secondary metabolites is still very limited, since their concentration and activity depend on adaptive responses of plants, which is why low-yield extraction protocols have been reported [

 <xref rid="B123-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Consequently, in order to explore the phytochemical properties of these medicinal plants, the establishment of efficient biotechnological approaches is required to achieve the valorization of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> subgenus.
