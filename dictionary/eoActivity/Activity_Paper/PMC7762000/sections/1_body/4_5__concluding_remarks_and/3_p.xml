<p>In our opinion, the current trends and future challenges on the research of non-well characterized medicinal plants are: (i) the combination of plant in vitro systems, using molecular approaches, and nutritional studies [

Finally, the combination of PTC and ML with omics technologies will assist to the establishment of new perspectives on the field of phytochemistry and the study of the biosynthetic potential of unexplored plants, as it is the case of
