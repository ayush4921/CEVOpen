<p>The antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts have been widely reported by a plethora of different methods. The radical scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide anion and nitric oxide of 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii,</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pinnatum</italic> leaf and aerial part extracts was reported [

 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic>, cultured in vitro was also determined [
