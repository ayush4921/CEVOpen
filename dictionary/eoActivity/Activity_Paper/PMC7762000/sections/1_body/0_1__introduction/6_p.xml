<p>The antimicrobial activity attributed to 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts was shown to present a high effectiveness against a wide range of both bacterial and fungal activities. In this sense, hydroethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>B. fedtschenkoi</italic> showed a strong inhibitory effect against different antimicrobial resistant strains from the ESKAPE complex, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [

 <italic>B. crenatum</italic> leaf juice against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> was also reported, as well as high effectiveness of methanol extracts from 
 <italic>B. pinnatum</italic> to Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, different isolated fractions from 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> ethanolic extracts promoted a potent activity against Safase S-04 yeast strain, fungi, such as 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, and bacteria, including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [

 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts has been also assessed for relevant viral diseases. It is the case of the antiviral activity of kaempferol derivatives from 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 [
 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and bryophyllin B from 
 <italic>B. pinnatum</italic> as a potent inhibitor of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [
