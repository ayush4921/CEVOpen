<p>In this sense, ML was able to identify the key mineral nutrients and their interactions, in order to optimize the growth and reproduction of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. cultured in vitro. Among the 18 different mineral nutrients used on MS formulation, ML detected that only five nutrients were critical on 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> in vitro culture, in a genotype-dependent manner [

Specifically, ammonium, sulfate, sodium, molybdenum, and copper were selected by NFL as the critical factors guiding several growth-related parameters, and the interaction between sulfate and molybdenum was widely reported as responsible for most parameters: root length, plantlet formation, and aerial parts fresh weight [
