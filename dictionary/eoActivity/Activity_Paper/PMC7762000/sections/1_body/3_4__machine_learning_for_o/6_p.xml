<p>Additionally, the production of phenolic compounds by in vitro-cultured 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. was optimized using ML [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It was observed that phenolic compounds accumulation achieved the maximum concentrations in the aerial parts of cultured plants under low ammonium concentrations (&lt;15 mM). Moreover, the extraction of total phenolic compounds was enhanced by the use of 55–85% aqueous methanol, whereas flavonoids were mostly extracted with higher methanol concentrations in water (&gt;85%). In addition, the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts, in terms of radical-scavenging activity, was shown to be improved using 55–85% MeOH as solvent on 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> cultured under low ammonium concentrations [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Furthermore, these experimental conditions for maximizing the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> were also validated in terms of preventing lipid oxidation [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and plant in vitro growth [
 <xref rid="B153-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]; thus, assessing the effectiveness of ML on the valorization of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic>.
