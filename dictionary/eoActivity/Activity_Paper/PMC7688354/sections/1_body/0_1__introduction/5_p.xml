<p>Many researchers have tried to analyze the antimicrobial functions of Kombucha; for instance, Steinkraus et al. in their valuable works proved that Kombucha has excellent antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> that this good activity can be attributed to its acetic acid content [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, using the pH indicator, the pH quantity of 4 can be seen during the process. Our paper aims to summarize and describe Kombucha's properties toward biological and medical applications and also characterize opportunities for future research.
