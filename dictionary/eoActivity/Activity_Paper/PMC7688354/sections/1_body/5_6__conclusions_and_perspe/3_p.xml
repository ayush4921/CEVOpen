<p>Besides, with the growing popularity and consumption of this functional drink, concerns about its potential risks and safety issues have also increased. Various pathogens found in Kombucha beverages are mainly due to contamination of unreliable raw materials, vessels, and packages, as well as insanitary producing environments during the fermentation process, which sometimes provide dangerous toxic metabolites such as mycotoxins. Also, antinutritional components such as cyanogenic glycosides, phytates, tannins, and protein inhibitors may be formed during the unhealthy fermentation process. The level of alcohol content of Kombucha is another problem that needs to be addressed. Therefore, health and nutrition organizations must set some regulations about the standardization of Kombucha production methods, identification of raw materials, and quality control soon. Although some countries currently have such regulations, they do not appear to be sufficient for such a high volume product and require a thorough revision of the industrial product manufacturing process and precise safety guidelines.</p>
