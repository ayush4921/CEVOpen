<p>For more understanding of Kombucha's kinetics, we need to have a definitive and comprehensive study on its composition and properties. Several essential factors such as fermentation time, the tea and sugar concentration, the used temperature, and the inoculum supply may affect the composition and concentration of the metabolites [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fermentation conditions should be controlled to get an excellent final product. However, 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrated some metabolites produced within the fermentation process. Glucuronic acid is a sugar acid derived from aldohexose in which the sixth atom oxidized to the carboxylic acid. The recent interest within the metabolism of glucuronic acid has arisen mainly as a result of the fact that the conjugation of glucuronic acid is a vital step in the metabolism of steroid hormones and adrenalin and also following the reports, glucuronic acid could be helpful in arthritis disease. The mechanism of the glucuronides formation has been principally determined in studies of drug metabolism and has been widely accepted as a detoxication method. Glucuronic acid is one of the components in Kombucha that is extremely impactful because of its drug metabolism [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is a transparent, colourless, corrosive acid with a bitter pungent smell. Ethanoic acid is synthetically created by microorganism fermentation. The increasing significance associated with the high demand for ethanoic acid has promoted an interest in medicinal usage of this acid [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, ethanoic acid is the main product of Kombucha fermentation.
