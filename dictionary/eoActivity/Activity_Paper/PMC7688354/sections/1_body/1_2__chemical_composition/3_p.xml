<p>When the fermentation improves [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the yeast portion of this complex culture can decompose sucrose to glucose, fructose, and carbon dioxide; therefore, this performance leads to the release of the gas and carbonated appearance. Indeed the transformation process between glucose and gluconic acid toward fructose into acetic acid commonly is performed by the acetic acid bacteria. Besides, after producing ethanol by the yeast portion, ethanol can be oxidized into acetaldehyde using the bacterial counterpart of this colony [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. During ethanol production, the yeast portion chooses fructose as the layer [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is a dual relationship between acetic acid produced by the acetic acid bacteria and ethanol [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The acetic acid which is provided via the acetic acid bacteria can quickly motivate the ethanol's production via yeast; on the other hand, ethanol can simplify acetic acid production and the growth of acetic acid bacteria. Ethanol and acetic acid present in Kombucha could act as active antimicrobial agents against pathogenic bacteria, which will be discussed in detail in the following parts [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Scientists, in their exciting works, analyzed the acidic value of Kombucha for about three weeks to investigate and characterize the fermentation process kinetics. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, titrimetric tests indicate that, with increasing fermentation time, acidity also increases by a rate of 1.5â€‰mm per day [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Hence, the chemical compositions of Kombucha demonstrated that this valuable product possesses different applications, which are discussed in detail below.
