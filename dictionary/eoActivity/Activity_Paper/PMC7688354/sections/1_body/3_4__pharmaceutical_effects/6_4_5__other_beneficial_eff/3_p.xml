<p>Moreover, this bacterial cellulose is preferred in such a case where plant-based cellulose cannot be applied [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in the food industries. Bacteria-based cellulose is applied as thickeners, food matrices, stabilizes, dietary fibers, and binders [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One of the Butyric acid's tasks is to protect the cellular membrane of humans where it incorporates gluconic acid and reinforces the gut walls in a situation like candidiasis [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Also, based on several biochemical and histopathological investigations, Kombucha could be an advantageous factor for treating gastric ulcers [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The researchers claimed that Kombucha has the ability to inhibit 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-amylase and lipase enzyme performance in the pancreas and even in plasma and also better suppression of increased blood glucose levels in rats and finally it is proven that Kombucha has effective hypoglycemic and antilipidemic activities [
