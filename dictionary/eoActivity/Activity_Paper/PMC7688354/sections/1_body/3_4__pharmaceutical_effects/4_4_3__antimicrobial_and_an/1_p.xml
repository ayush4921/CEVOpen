<p>Since the investigation of antibacterial and antifungal properties is a vital issue in biochemistry and pharmacy, so far a significant group of researchers has insisted on this, and therefore the preliminary element of their articles was to determine these properties [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is proven that Kombucha has a supreme antimicrobial effect on a wide range of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and so far many evaluations have been carried out to demonstrate the inhibitory performance against plenty of microorganisms including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In fact, Kombucha is able to prevent the growth of an extensive range of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] like 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Helicobacter pylori</italic> (the causative organism of peptic ulcers), 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli</italic> (the causative organism of common diarrhea), 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Shigella sonnei, Campylobacter jejuni,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Perhaps this proper antimicrobial effect is due to the presence of acetic acid in this SCOBY, and also low levels of pH can be beneficial [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Also, the proteins produced during the fermentation process and the catechins and some of the components shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> can be considered as critical factors for the improvement of antibacterial properties. It is accepted that both catechins and acetic acid found in Kombucha have bactericidal properties and also it was reported that Kombucha has antibiotic substances that lead to an increase in the antimicrobial performance. The acetic acid in Kombucha not only improves the antimicrobial properties but also can enhance antifungal properties as is proved. Recently, due to the excellent antimicrobial activity of Kombucha, it can be extensively utilized as an agent to reduce the pathogens associated with human illnesses. The scientists reported that the preparation process and fermentation time and also the origins could affect the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of Kombucha. To improve the antibacterial and antifungal activities of some substances [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], Kombucha can be utilized as an additive part and get better results. For example, Ashrafi et al. investigated the antimicrobial effects of chitosan/Kombucha films against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. They claimed that the inhibition properties of chitosan/Kombucha films mainly depend on the Kombucha concentrations and any films which contain a higher level of Kombucha have better antimicrobial activity and antioxidant effect as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Another group of researchers investigated the antimicrobial activity of yarrow Kombucha beverages. Their examination included evaluation of the samples against six diverse bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus,Klebsiela pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>) and two yeast (
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] of antimicrobial activity for Kombucha beverages are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Since MIC values were in the limitation of 9.765 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 312.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, all the samples could be considered as antimicrobial agents in comparison to the standard antibiotics Amracin (for bacteria) and Nystatin (for yeasts) [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. According to literature about antibacterial and antifungal performances of Kombucha, this valuable product can be applied in amelioration of infection diseases.
