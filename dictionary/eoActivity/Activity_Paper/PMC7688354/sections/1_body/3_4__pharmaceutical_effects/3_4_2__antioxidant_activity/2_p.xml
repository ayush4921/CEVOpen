<p>Although Kombucha's fermentation process does not possess a complicated pathway [

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], several beneficial compounds of this product with radical inhibiting activities are founded as useful antioxidant agents. It can be said that catechins and polyphenols are two primary classes of compounds that are presented in Kombucha beverage and also they belong to flavanol category. Polyphenols are very wonderful compounds that have been found in Kombucha and can efficiently scavenge free radicals reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is the reason for introducing Kombucha as a potent antioxidant agent. Polyphenols indicate different structures, of which tannins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and stilbenes are regarded as the primary structures of dietary polyphenols. Document from various investigations has provided the relations between the polyphenols' intake and reduced occurrence of several human illnesses and also confirmed their function in the inhibition of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, and cardiovascular. Specific polyphenols can be presented in the shape of polymers, glycosides, or esters; therefore, they are not able to intake in their general forms. First, they should be hydrolyzed using intestinal enzymes or even by the colonic microflora before absorption. Indeed, polyphenols tolerate different conjugation mechanisms like sulfation, methylation, and glucuronidation initially in the intestinal cells and then within the liver [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the unabsorbed polyphenols are biotransformed into a series of low-molecular-weight phenolic metabolites within the gut. These mentioned metabolites should possess better absorption activity than their previous precursors and can exert positive features in the human digestive system (local effects) and, after being absorbed, in organs and tissues (systemic effects) [
