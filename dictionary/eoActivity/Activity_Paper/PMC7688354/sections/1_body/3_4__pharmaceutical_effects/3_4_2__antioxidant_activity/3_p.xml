<p>It has been proven that the presence of complex phenolic compounds in an acidic environment or even the release of various species of enzymes by fungi and bacteria can lead to the splitting of large and complex molecules into smaller and simpler molecules, which leads to an increase in phenolic compounds in Kombucha [

In Kombucha, which contains rooibos leaves, there are no catechins, and this may lead to having lower antioxidant activity in comparison with Kombucha lonely. On the other hand, the researchers claimed that Kombucha with rooibos leaves possesses other components like orientin, aspalathin, and rutin (mainly) and, at lower concentrations, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, and isovitexin, which all of them have antioxidant effects. Another group of researchers investigated the fermentation time and Kombucha origins on its antioxidant activities by in vitro free radical scavenging assays and they concluded that, with increasing the fermentation time, the antioxidant activities increased. This activity has a direct relationship with origin materials and culture time, each of which, in turn, identifies the type of metabolites itself. Greenwalt et al. claimed that, due to the agglomeration of some organic acids that may be detrimental for direct usage, the prolonged fermentation process is not a proper pathway, although antioxidant activities of Kombucha exhibited the time-dependent profiles [
