<p>Antioxidant activity belongs to any substance that can hinder or delay oxidation of the substrate even in low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Indeed, this activity can be extensively presented in three forms like inhibition properties of molecules, scavenging of prooxidant enzymes, and binding of prooxidant metals. So far, the effects of these antioxidant activities on several illnesses like diabetes and cancer were proven [

As we know, the generation of free radicals is not beneficial for the human body, because they are able to commence the multiple chain reactions and finally these reactions lead to harm cells or even death [
