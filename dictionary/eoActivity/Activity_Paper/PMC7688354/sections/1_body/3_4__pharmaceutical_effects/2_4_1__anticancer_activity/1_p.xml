 <italic>Cancer</italic> is one of the most important causes of today's worldwide death. Therefore, to reduce the mortality rate, anticancer drugs with less destructive properties can be beneficial [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Many compounds were introduced as anticancer agents until now, with lower side effects [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and clinical studies have contended that Kombucha has anticancer activities as well. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and the Central Oncological Research Unit in Russia have done many investigations on Kombucha, and they gained that this valuable beverage can inhibit the cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Scientists have explored any possible pathway to determine the anticancer effects of Kombucha, and finally, some of them claimed that the presence of tea polyphenols and the secondary metabolites produced during the fermentation process has the most impact [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Based on the results, it can be said that the tea polyphenols which are present in Kombucha can prevent gene alteration and also it can inhibit the propagation of cancer cells and make cancer cell apoptosis, and the capability to complete metastasis has been determined as conceivable functions for the anticancer features. Indeed, using Kombucha tea can be an effective way to reequilibrate blood pH for cancer patients, whom their blood pH is 7.56 or more during illness. Moreover, a suitable solution for cancer patients who do not have enough L-lactic acid in their connective tissues is the consumption of Kombucha, because one of the products of the fermentation pathway of Kombucha is exact L-lactic acid [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Components like vitamin C, glucuronic acid, polyphenols, gluconic acid, and lactic acid which are playing the critical roles in Kombucha are capable of diminishing the incidence of stomach cancer [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another indirect factor which is related to cancer can be D-saccharic acid-1,4-lactone (DSL) that was identified to be present in Kombucha, and the main activity of DSL is to inhibit the glucuronidase task [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Besides, glucuronidase can be utilized as a glucuronide hydrolyzer, and it can generate cancer-causing aglycones [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It was proven that presence of dimethyl-2-(2-hydroxy-2-methoxypropylidene) malonate and vitexin in the ethyl acetate fraction of Kombucha has demonstrated appropriate cytotoxic activities at a concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the polyphenols in Kombucha tea have the same performance and both of them are reported as cancer prevention agent [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is essential during the fermentation process to observe the health principles because pathogenic microorganisms are capable of infecting the whole beverage by the preparation process [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. After investigating the effects of Kombucha on the human body, the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed that there is no harmful effect of this product on the body and on the other hand, a group of researchers examined the toxicity of Kombucha in mice for 3 months, and all the symptoms and results were reported. The anticancer advantages of Kombucha were considered as folklore, with no deep-rooted clinical backing. But, some researchers tried to regard Kombucha as a potent agent for renal and liver cancer cells therapies [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A general and appropriate assay for assessment of biomaterial toxicity is the MTT method. This assay is related to the metabolisms of cells and mitochondrial functions. Therefore, the cell viability of Kombucha-treated PC-3 cells was evaluated through the MTT method. Based on the results, it can be easily said that the IC 50 value of Kombucha (against PC-3 cells for 24 h treatment) was determined at approximately 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref>, with increasing the concentration of treatment in Kombucha, the percentage of cell viability diminished slowly [
