<p>The present work elucidates that n-hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds possesses both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bactericidal potential and thus, can be used as a therapy to treat wound infections. The n-hexane extract shows a minimum zone of inhibition of 12 mm against 
 <italic>P.aureginosa</italic>, 14 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 16 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to control (0 mm). The appearance of the zone of inhibition indicated that the n-hexane extract of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> seeds inhibited the growth of test pathogens, thereby validating the antimicrobial activity in n-hexane seed extract.
