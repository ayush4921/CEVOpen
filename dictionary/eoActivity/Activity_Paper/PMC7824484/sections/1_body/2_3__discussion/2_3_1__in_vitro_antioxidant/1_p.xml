<p>A wound causes inflammation leading to the production of free radicals by phagocytes. Increased production of these free radicals delays the process of wound healing; thus, their inhibition might be one of the beneficial therapeutic strategies in the action of healing of wounds. Chitra et al. and Shirwaikar et al. have reported many plants that promote wound healing aided by the mechanism of free radical scavenging [

The DPPH method is used for the detection of the free radical scavenging property of plant extracts, including its natural compounds at low concentrations. Antioxidant activity is measured using a concentration-response relationship of scavenging of DPPH free radicals as observed on treatment with hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds. The IC50 value for extract was found comparable with ascorbic acid due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolic constituents in 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds, as reported by Ndhlala et al., 2010 [
