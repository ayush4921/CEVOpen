<p>The results showed healing of wounds up to 69â€“74% within four days in case of 10% and 5% hexane hydrogel respectively in comparison to 5% povidone-iodine standard and control by 26% and 18%, at any given point in time. The study also validated that wounds healed up to 97% and 98% on day 12 using 5% and 10% 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> hexane hydrogel as compared to standard and control, which healed by 82% and 62%, respectively. Both the test groups were healed on the 13th day, whereas the standard and control group remained unhealed until the end of the protocol (
