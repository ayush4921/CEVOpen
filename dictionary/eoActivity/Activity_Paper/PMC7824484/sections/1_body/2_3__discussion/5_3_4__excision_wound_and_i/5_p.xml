<p>In the study conducted by Momoh et al. using 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaf extract, the wound took a long time to heal as compared to the present study [

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> on Swiss Albino rats for wound healing showed healing of excision wound on the 14th day whereas incision model was characterized by measurement of breaking strength on the 10th day that was found to be 507.5 g [

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seed’s and dried pulp’s aqueous extract and observed an increase in the rate of closure of wound area, hydroxyproline content, dry granuloma weight, granuloma breaking strength, skin-breaking strength, and decrease in the scar area [
