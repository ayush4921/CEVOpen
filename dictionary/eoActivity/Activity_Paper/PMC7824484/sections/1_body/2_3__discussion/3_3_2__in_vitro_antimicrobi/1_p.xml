<p>Microbial infection of wound directly affects the wound healing process and may be associated with more than 1 type of bacterial and fungal infections. Undoubtedly, open wounds are prone to infections as broken skin comprises a highly time-variable complex microbiological environment with a mixed floraâ€”an infected wound results in exudates formation and slowing of wound healing. 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> initially populate the wound before other bacteria such as 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> take up residence, usually after days or even weeks. The wound left untreated will acquire additional bacterial growth such as of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Thus, antimicrobial treatment is a crucial measure in wound healing, and identification of the specific causative pathogen and their antibiotic sensitivity could serve as a valid and influential factor for wound treatment. In the presented study, the Agar well diffusion method was used for the determination of the antimicrobial activity of hexane extract 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds and results depicted inhibition of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The formation of a zone of inhibition showed that the hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds inhibited the growth of test pathogens, thereby validating the antimicrobial activity in hexane seed extract. The hexane extract shows the minimum zone of inhibition of 12 mm against 
 <italic>P. aureginosa</italic>, 14 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 16 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to control (0 mm).
