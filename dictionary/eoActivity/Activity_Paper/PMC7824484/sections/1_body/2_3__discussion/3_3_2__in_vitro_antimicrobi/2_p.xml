<p>This wound healing efficacy is assumed to be due to phytoconstituents in terpenoids, terpenes, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, and tannins in 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00025" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous reports show a direct role of flavonoids, i.e., complex formation with the soluble extracellular proteins and cell walls of bacteria [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00025" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other studies also validated antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using different extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00025" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The zone of inhibition in various other studies of antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves various solvents was found to be less as compared to the reported in the present study with seeds [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00025" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves extracts (petroleum, ethanol, methanol, chloroform, and aqueous) have been tested against 
 <italic>P. Vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. All the extracts showed inhibition against these pathogens except petroleum ether extract which showed inhibition against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. All the pathogens were resistant against the ethanolic extract except 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. Vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> [
