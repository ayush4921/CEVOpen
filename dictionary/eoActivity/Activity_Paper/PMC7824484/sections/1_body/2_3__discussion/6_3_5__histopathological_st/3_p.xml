<p>In the incision model, the control group (group 1) showed bacterial colonies with minute ulcers and diffused inflammation in the dermis with decreased production of blood vessels and collagen fibres, while standard group (group 2) showed ulcers with massive inflammation with lower rates of healing reactions and scar over the ulcers had been seen. The test group 5% and 10% hexane hydrogels (groups 3 and 4) showed healing and regeneration of squamous epithelium, including lower inflammation in different sites of the skin. The examination of histopathology revealed that the healing process was much faster in test groups 5% and 10% hexane hydrogel.</p>
