<p>The antimicrobial study was essentially performed as given in Rojas et al., Kisangau et al. with some modifications. Briefly, preparation and sterilization of nutrient agar plates were done. Sterilized swabs were dipped into standardized bacterial suspension with an inoculums size of 1.5 × 108 cfu/mL, and unneeded culture was removed by turning the swab against the side of the tube. The spread plate method was performed with an evenly spread inoculum over the entire surface of Nutrient agar plates. Plates were allowed to dry for at least 15 min and 6mm diameter wells were made using a sterile cork borer. 100 μL (100 mg/mL) of extracts were prepared and introduced into bore agar wells using a sterile dropping pipette. For proper diffusion, plates were placed to cool down for 2 h at room temperature and incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h [
