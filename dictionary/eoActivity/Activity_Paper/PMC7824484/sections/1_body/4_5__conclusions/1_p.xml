<p>The wound healing potential of hexane hydrogel of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds could be explained using antioxidant, antimicrobial, and wound healing activities of the plant. The hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds possesses antioxidant activity. This work also elucidates that hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds possesses both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bactericidal potential and thus, can be used as a therapy to treat wound infections. In the present study, animals treated with hexane hydrogel of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds showed significant wound healing activity when compared to control and standard groups in both excision and incision models. In the histopathological study, the increase in cellular proliferation due to the mitogenic activity of the hexane hydrogel of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds remarkably contributed to the process of wound healing. It was also confirmed by early dermal and epidermal regeneration in the mice treated by test drugs that the hexane hydrogel of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds had a positive effect on the proliferation of the cells, granular tissue formation, and epithelization. Further, the histopathological observations also confirmed the experimental wound healing study results that were based on the wound area measurement and tensile strength. Thus, it can be concluded that formulated hydrogel by the hexane extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds could be used as potential herbal wound healing agents, in the management of wounds.
