<p>Wound healing is defined as an intricate and elaborate biological action initiated in response to an attack on the anatomy and functioning of normal healthy skin. The bioprocess can be categorized into three major stages viz., inflammatory phase (0–3 days), cellular proliferation (2–12 days), and remodelling phase (3–6 months) [

The acute inflammatory responses due to injury results in the necrosis of specialized cells as well as damage to the surrounding matrix, mitigated by substitution of the dead tissue with new healthy cells to aid faster tissue regeneration. However, the healing site is susceptible to microbial infections, a leading cause of delay in wound repair [

The ideal wound healing process must achieve mitigation of tissue damage, ample tissue perfusion (nutrition and oxygenation) with a moist healing environment for the restoration of the anatomy and function of the affected region [
