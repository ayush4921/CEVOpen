  <p>Anti-inflammatory ability of Sb-EE in LPS-induced peritonitis and HCl/EtOH-triggered gastritis mice. (A, B) Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) was orally injected into C57BL/6 mice daily for five days. Peritonitis was induced by peritoneal injection of LPS (10 µg/kg) for one day. NO assay was performed using peritoneal macrophages (A). Immunoblotting assay was performed with whole lysates obtained from peritoneal exudates. Phospho- or total-forms of ERK, p38, Src, Syk and β-actin were detected using specific antibodies (B). (C) Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) or ranitidine (40 mg/kg) was orally administered in ICR mice twice a day for two days, and then HCl/EtOH was injected for 1 h to induce gastritis. Stomach inflammatory lesions were photographed with a digital camera and then quantified using ImageJ.
