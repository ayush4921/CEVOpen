<p>Sb-EE suppressed NO production in RAW264.7 cells and attenuated inflammatory symptoms in LPS-induced peritonitis and HCl/EtOH-triggered gastritis mice, which suggest Sb-EE has anti-inflammatory activity. Sb-EE inhibited phosphorylation of LPS-triggered signal molecules, such as p85, IκBα, TAK1, MEK1/2, MKK4/7, MKK3/6, ERK, JNK and p38. In particular, Sb-EE acts as a direct inhibitor of Src, Syk and IRAK1, thereby inhibiting MyD88-dependent NF-

Therefore, drug development derived from natural products capable of interacting with various proteins in a biological system is accelerating (Koeberle and Werz
