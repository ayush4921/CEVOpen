<p>The leaves and twigs of 
 <italic>S. brevipes</italic> were dried at room temperature and then cut and pulverized. The pulverized plant tissues (125 g) were extracted with 95% ethanol (1500 mL) in an ultrasonic bath, and the extract was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to produce a 95% ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. brevipes</italic> (Sb-EE) (3.7 g). The Sb-EE powder was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 200 mg/mL to make a stock solution. The experiment was performed using DMSO (vehicle) control at the same dilution as a negative control.
