<p>For the MTT and NO assays, two independent experiments were performed and each experimental group had 10 parallel wells to ensure the reliability of the results. In PCR, each experimental group was performed in triplicate using lysates obtained from three independent experiments. For Western blot analysis, two independent experiments were performed, and band intensity was measured and quantified using ImageJ (Bethesda, MD). Peritonitis and gastritis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed with 10 or 4 mice per group, respectively. In this study, all data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) obtained from each experiment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe’s 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> test or the Kruskal–Wallis/Mann–Whitney tests was used to compare data and to assess the significance of group differences. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance.
