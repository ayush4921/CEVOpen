<p>To understand the molecular mechanism by which Sb-EE regulates the inflammatory response, we examined the alteration in NF-κB signalling enzymes including IκBα, p85, Syk and Src. The phosphorylation levels of each signal molecule were evaluated by immunoblotting in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells after Sb-EE pre-treatment. Sb-EE suppressed p-IκBα levels at all LPS-stimulated time points (5, 15, 30 and 60 min) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>). Phosphorylation patterns of upstream molecules of IκBα such as p85, Syk and Src were checked at the earlier time than 5 min. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>, p-Syk and p-p85 were inhibited by Sb-EE at 3 min and 5 min after LPS activation. Phosphorylation of Src kinase was also diminished by Sb-EE after 1 min and 3 min of LPS stimulation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>). Since Src and Syk are the most upstream enzymes in TLR4-mediated NF-κB signalling, we hypothesized that Sb-EE would directly regulate Src and Syk (Lowell
