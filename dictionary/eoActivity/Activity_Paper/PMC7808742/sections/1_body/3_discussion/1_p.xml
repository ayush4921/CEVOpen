<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. androgynous</italic> has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan induced rat paw oedema at dose of 400 mg/kg/body weight (Selvi and Anusha 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The anti-inflammatory property of this herb was also proved 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment using RAW 264.7 cells (Lee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the case of 
 <italic>S. rostratus</italic>, water extract of the root shows anti-inflammatory effect on dimethylbenzene-induced auricle oedema mice (Zhen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this study, we evaluated the pharmaceutical effects of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. brevipes in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A,B)</xref>, Sb-EE significantly reduced NO release without cytotoxicity. As NO is a key inflammatory mediator and various anti-inflammatory drugs including NSAIDs target NO synthesis and secretion (Stratman et al. 1997; Di Girolamo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), Sb-EE was also expected to have potent therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory diseases. PCR results showing the inhibitory effects of Sb-EE on inflammatory gene expression of 
 <italic>iNOS</italic>, 
 <italic>COX-2</italic> and 
 <italic>TNF-α</italic> also supported our hypothesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). Therefore, we decided to validate the therapeutic effect of Sb-EE on inflammatory diseases using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models such as LPS-induced peritonitis mice and HCl/EtOH-triggered gastritis mice. Consistent with RAW264.7 cell results, oral administration of Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) strongly inhibited NO levels in peritoneal macrophages from peritonitis mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). Sb-EE also alleviated gastritis symptoms, which suggests that it can be used as treatment for inflammatory diseases.
