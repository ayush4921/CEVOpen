<p>To understand the intracellular mechanism of Sb-EE, we examined alterations in the TLR4 signalling pathway during Sb-EE treatment. Since 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref> shows a defect in the mRNA expression of inflammatory genes, we confirmed these changes in transcriptional factors. Sb-EE blocked both NF-κB and AP-1 activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B–D)</xref>), and also suppressed phosphorylation of upstream enzymes responsible for activating NF-κB and AP-1 signalling such as IκBα, p85, ERK, JNK, p38, TAK1, MEK1/2, MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figures 3(A,B)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4(A,B)</xref>, left and right panel). In TLR4 signalling, external stimuli activate NF-κB and AP-1 through recruitment of the adapter molecules MyD88 and TRIF (Akira and Takeda 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Interestingly, Sb-EE affects only MyD88-activated NF-κB and AP-1 luciferase activities, not TRIF-triggered signalling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B,C)</xref>), which suggests that the MyD88-dependent pathway is a target of Sb-EE. According to immunoblotting and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, Sb-EE directly inhibited Syk, Src and IRAK1 kinases, which are activated first in response to PAMPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figures 3(B,D)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4(C,D)</xref>) (Kawagoe et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lowell 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). As TLR4 transduces MyD88 signals via IRAK4/1 to activate AP-1 (Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), inhibition of IRAK1 by Sb-EE correlates with luciferase assay results. On the other hand, the role of Syk and Src kinase is more complicated in intracellular TLR signalling. In the classic TLR4 pathway, Src and Syk tend to be activated first and function together in response to LPS engagement (Lowell 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Then, they can activate MyD88 and TRIF signals through different pathways. For example, Src kinase can activate a MyD88 dependent pathway via TRAF6 (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). On the other hand, there is also report demonstrating that Src is involved in TRIF-mediated IFN-β production (Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Syk also promotes internalization of TLR4 by phosphorylation of ITAM motif-containing proteins such as DAP12 and FcεRIγ, thereby activating TRIF-mediated interferon production (Zanoni et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). As the role of Syk in TRIF signalling is limited to regulating interferon-regulatory factor (IRF), not NF-κB and AP-1, Sb-EE seems to show selectivity for the MyD88-pathway in terms of NF-κB and AP-1 regulation.
