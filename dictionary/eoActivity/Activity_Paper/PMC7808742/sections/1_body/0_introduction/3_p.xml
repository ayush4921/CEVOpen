<p>The genus 
 <italic>Sauropus</italic> (Phyllanthaceae) consists of 40 species which are mainly distributed in Southeast Asia, Malaysia and Australia. Of these, 
 <italic>S. androgynous</italic> L. Merr., which is an ingredient of Jamu, has traditionally been used for treating genito-urinary diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, as well as for enhancement of breast milk production and eyesight (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Jamu is a traditional Indonesian medicine consisting of natural ingredients such as roots, bark, flowers, seeds, leaves and fruits (Woerdenbag and Kayser 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Leaves of 
 <italic>S. androgynous</italic> contain phytochemicals such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, carotenoids, ascorbic acids and tannins (Singh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>S. androgynous</italic> has a high content of flavonoids including quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, luteolin and apigenin (Arif 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has been reported that ethanol, methanol or aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>S. androgynus</italic> have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Eng Khoo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and these pharmacological properties are thought to be due to bioactive phytochemicals. The anti-inflammatory properties of 
 <italic>S. rostratus</italic> Miq. have also been reported (Zhen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). 
 <italic>S. brevipes</italic> has been used to treat diarrhoea in a decoction, but no literature reports the pharmacological activity of this plant. Therefore, this study investigates the anti-inflammatory activity and mechanism of action of 
 <italic>S. brevipes</italic> ethanol extract (Sb-EE) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, LPS-induced peritonitis mice and HCl/EtOH-triggered gastritis mice.
