<p>When 
 <italic>Hygrocybe</italic> extracts were evaluated it demonstrated a potential for significant reduction in the numbers of revertants and it was found to be moderate antimutagenic at all test doses without S9 mix for TA100 against SA (38%, 34% and 36%, respectively). The highest inhibition rate (97%) was observed for 10,000 µg/plate dose of 
 <italic>Hygrocybe</italic> and followed by 5000 µg/plate dose with a rate of 87% and 2500 µg/plate with 67% inhibition against 2-AA for TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation enzymes (

 <italic>Neoboletus</italic> extract was only effective against 2-AF for TA98 strain with a rate of 77% which was described as strong activity. Without S9 mix it had no capacity for combating with positive mutagens for TA98. However, this extract showed moderate antimutagenicity against SA at all doses with ratios of 35%, 31% and 28%, respectively. Except for 10,000 µg/plate dose, inhibition ratios decreased after addition of S9 and they assessed as weak activity. Only the highest dose revealed strong antimutagenicity against 2-AA with 50% inhibition rate (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Extract of 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> can be described as moderate antimutagenic against 4-NPDA for TA98 at 10,000 (34%) and 5000 (35%) µg/plate doses. It also determined as moderate antimutagenic for TA100 against SA at the same doses with 34% and 36% inhibitions. However, the supplement of metabolic activation mixture increased the inhibition ratios as 92% and 71% (very strong activity) for TA98 against 2-AF and extract strongly ameliorated the mutagenic effect of 2-AA with a ratio of 85% at a concentration of 10,000 µg/plate for TA100 (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>); (R) 
 <italic>sanguinea</italic> extract manifested moderate antimutagenicity against 4-NPDA at 10,000 µg/plate dose, while it had very strong action against 2-AF with ratios of 94% and 78% in the presence of S9 mix for TA98. When this extract evaluated for TA100 strain, it induced the inhibitions greater than 25%, reaching 38%, 26% and 28%, respectively making them as moderate antimutagenic for all test doses. Only 10,000 µg/plate dose strongly alleviated the mutagenic actions of 2-AA with 85% inhibition in the presence of S9.
