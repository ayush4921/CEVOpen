<p>The results showed that there were no mutagenic properties of mushrooms tested, but they revealed significant antimutagenicity against well-known mutagens in the presence of metabolic activation enzymes. The best antimutagenicity against 2-AA was defined for 
 <italic>Hygrocybe acutoconica</italic> extracts with a rate of 97% inhibition with S9 mix. This powerful action was followed 
 <italic>by Amanita crocea</italic> and 
 <italic>Russula aurea</italic> extracts with a ratio of 94% inhibition; 
 <italic>Hemileccinum depilatum</italic> 93% inhibition and 
 <italic>Cyclocybe cylindracea</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactarius deliciosus</italic> 92% inhibition, respectively. It was observed that metabolic activation enzymes induced the antimutagenic action of the extracts in some mushrooms. It is the fact that the mushrooms exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, cytotoxic, immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiallergic, antidepressive, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, digestive, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, nephroprotective, osteoprotective and hypotensive activities [

 <xref rid="B56-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the previous studies although antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of mushrooms were well analyzed, their mutagenic and antimutagenic potentials were not well displayed. In a study conducted by Gruter et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] 
 <italic>Craterellus</italic> ethanol extract revealed powerful inhibition against 2-NF, AFB1, B(a)P and ICR-191. Furthermore, antimutagenic effects which are comparable with those of 
 <italic>Craterellus cornucopioides</italic> were found in 
 <italic>Agaricus abruptibulbus</italic>, 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cantharellus cibarius</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactarius lilacinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lyophyllum connatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Xerocomus chrysenteron</italic>. Ham et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] manifested that 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> extracts and their subfractions had a great potential of antimutagenicity (47% to 87% inhibition) in Ames test and this activity was attributed to that the 3β-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol components of 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic>. Similarly Sugui et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] studied Lentinula edodes extract for its inhibition on 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) clastogenicity in vivo. The results showed that pretreatments with diets containing 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> lineages alleviated the micronucleated bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. In another study, the moderate (31–35%) antimutagenic action of polysaccharides extracted from 
 <italic>Agrocybe cylindracea</italic> and 
 <italic>Phellinus igniarius</italic> were revealed by Shon et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Phellinus nigricans, Phellinus rimosus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phellinus wahlbergii</italic> extracts were capable for combating with mutagens and they had strong antimutagenicity in Ames test Especially 
 <italic>P. rimosus</italic> ethanol extract possessed excellent antimutagenic activity [
 <xref rid="B61-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Morales et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] exhibited that 
 <italic>Lactarius deliciosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Boletus luteus</italic> mushrooms were not mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome test system. In our study eight mushroom extracts were not mutagenic and they also exhibited moderate to strong antimutagenicity against mutagens, so our results were consistent with authors’ results indicated above. In previous study of Mlinarič et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], 
 <italic>Lactarius vellereus</italic> extract was evaluated for its protective properties by Ames test and Comet assay and the results showed that it was highly curative against mutagens. In our study, 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic> extract showed very strong activity against 2-AF in the presence of S9 mix. For the genus Russula previous studies focused on their cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects showed that 
 <italic>R. cyanoxantha</italic> revealed antitumor activity by the way of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B64-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similarly, a lectin isolated from 
 <italic>Russula lepida</italic> exhibited anti-proliferative activity toward Hep G2 cells and MCF-7 cells [
 <xref rid="B65-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. As a result of our study prescreening of the mutagenic and antimutagenic activity of 
 <italic>Russula aurea</italic> and 
 <italic>Russula sanguinea</italic> manifested that they were not only mutagenic, but also highly effective against 2-AF and 2-AA in the presence of metabolic activation enzymes.
