<p>Mushrooms produce many chemically diverse compounds with a broad spectrum of biologic activities. Because of the presence of some useful compounds such as polysaccharides, Î²-glucans, sacchachitin, tyrosinase and other enzymes there are increasing interest to probe into the potential of mushroom [
 <xref rid="B55-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In vitro assays, animal studies, and a few clinical trials tend to justify the traditional experience and suggest a great potential of medicinal mushrooms and isolated compounds for the prophylaxis and treatment of several diseases. In this study, mutagenic and antimutagenic potential of eight mushroom were presented. This study can be considered as the first report on mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of

 <italic>Hygrocybe acutoconica</italic>, 
 <italic>Neoboletus erythropu</italic>, 
 <italic>Russula aurea</italic> and
