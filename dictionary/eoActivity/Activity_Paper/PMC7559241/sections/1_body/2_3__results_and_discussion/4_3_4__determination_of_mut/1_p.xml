 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the mean number of revertants/plate, the standard deviation after the treatments with the mushroom extracts, observed in 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> strains TA98, TA100, in the presence (+S9) and absence (âˆ’S9) of metabolic activation. According to the pre-screening of mutagenicity, it was determined that all mushroom extracts did not increase the revertant colony numbers at the test both with and without metabolic activation enzymes when compared with control plates (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). We indicated above that if the revertant numbers of test plates are two-fold of spontaneous revertants, they can be considered as mutagen. Hence, our extracts did not reach to two-fold numbers of control plates. In other word, mushroom extracts tested in this study have not mutagenic potential.
