<p>Taking the above into consideration, we evaluated the enzyme inhibitory properties of the mushroom extracts against some enzymes including cholinesterase, tyrosinase, amylase and glucosidase. The results are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In cholinesterase inhibition assays, the best inhibitory effect was obtained by 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> (1.02 mg GALAE/g for AChE and 0.99 mg GALAE/g for BChE). In addition, five mushrooms were not active on BChE. In earlier studies, some mushroom species exhibited significant cholinesterase inhibitory effects. In particular, some mushroom metabolites and chemicals showed great potentials in terms of cholinesterase inhibition [

 <xref rid="B42-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For example, Akata et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], reported that the acetylcholinesterase inhibition abilities of some mushroom species varied from 0.83 to 0.97 mg GALAE/g extract. In addition, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition abilities were found to be 0.91 mg GALAE/g extract for 
 <italic>Hymenogaster aromaticus</italic>, 1.02 mg GALAE/g extract for 
 <italic>Ramaria aurea</italic> and 1.91 mg GALAE/g extract for 
 <italic>Rhizopogon luteolus</italic> in an earlier study conducted by Zengin et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In another study [
 <xref rid="B1-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], two 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> species (
 <italic>G. applanatum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. resinaceum</italic>) displayed significant cholinesterase inhibition effects (AChE: 1.45 and 1.47 mg GALAE/g extract; BChE: 2.94 and 1.51 mg GALAE/g extract). Observed differences may be linked to the different myco-chemicals present in the extracts. Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin, which is main pigment in skin and eyes. At this point, tyrosinase inhibition is useful to manage hyperpigmentation problems [
 <xref rid="B45-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As can be seen from 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, tyrosinase inhibition effects were close in the tested mushroom extracts and the best ability was provided by 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> with the value of 54.18 mg KAE/g. The weakest ability was detected in 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic>. The observed tyrosinase inhibitory ability may be explained by the levels of phenolic compounds and this hypothesis was also corrected by correlation. In accordance with our results, some scientific studies indicated a positive correlation between tyrosinase inhibition ability and total phenolic content [
 <xref rid="B46-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Also, the identified compounds, for instance 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid [
 <xref rid="B48-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid [
 <xref rid="B50-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], in the tested mushroom extracts were reported as significant tyrosinase inhibitors. Thus, the purported ability tend to be linked to the presence of these compounds. In addition, tyrosinase inhibition abilities were reported for several mushroom species in earlier studies, for example 4.43–12.86 mg KAE/g extract for two 
 <italic>Trametes</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B51-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; 8.47–13.40 mg KAE/g extract for two 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 1.83–21.45 mg KAE/g extract for three medicinal mushroom [
 <xref rid="B44-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The amylase inhibition effects for the mushroom extracts were close and the strongest effect was noted in 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> with value of 0.17-mmol ACAE/g, followed by 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> and 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic>. Regarding glucosidase inhibition ability, two mushrooms (
 <italic>A. crocea</italic> and 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic>) were not active on glucosidase inhibition and the best ability was shown by 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> with the value of 1.86-mmol ACAE/g. In the literature, some mushrooms exhibited remarkable anti-diabetic properties [

 <xref rid="B53-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For instance, the amylase inhibitory effects of some mushroom species were found to be 0.28–0.40-mmol ACAE/g extract for three medicinal mushroom [
 <xref rid="B44-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; 0.16–0.22-mmol ACAE/g extract for six mushroom species [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Taken together, during the last century, diet or nutritional strategies are gaining much interest to control metabolic diseases and thus our findings could provide precious information for this purpose.
