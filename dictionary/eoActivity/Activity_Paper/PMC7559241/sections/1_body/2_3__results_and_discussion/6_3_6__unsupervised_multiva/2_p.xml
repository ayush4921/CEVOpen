<p>In the next step, hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to highlight the different homogeneous clusters. The clustering analysis was done from the results of PCA taking into account the first two dimensions. Wardâ€™s method and Euclidean were used as linkage algorithm and metric, respectively. The phylogenic map obtained revealed four main clusters (denoted as A, B, C and D). The cluster A comprised three species, i.e., 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic>, 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> and especially 
 <italic>H. acutoconica;</italic> the cluster B is represented by 
 <italic>A. crocea</italic> and 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> species, the cluster C included 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> and the cluster D contained 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> species.
