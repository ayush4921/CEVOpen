<p>After the initial comparison of antioxidant and enzymatic inhibitory activities of the samples of the studied mushroom species through the univariate analysis, multivariate exploratory analyses, i.e., PCA and HCA were done with the intention of differentiating of those species and clustering them. In fact, PCA and HCA are often performed successively to detect homogenous groups and find the source of variation in the studied data. One of the advantage of these multivariate projections-based approaches is to display graphic results to easily visualize and interpret the results. Thus, first, unsupervised principal component analysis was employed to discriminate the mushroom species and the results are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00166-f001">Figure 1</xref>. To identify the number of dimensions capturing the maximum of variability of the original, we have referred to “Kaiser rule” [
 <xref rid="B66-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this regard, two dimensions having an eigenvalue greater than one and contributing for more than 80% of the variability are retained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00166-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The contribution of the bioactivity assays on the first two retained dimensions of PCA are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00166-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. As can be seen, the radical scavenging assays (ABTS and DPPH) and reducing power assays (FRAP, CUPRAC) had high contribution to the first dimension (52.1% of the total variance); implying that the species are separated along the first dimension according to their antioxidant activities. Likewise, the second dimension (28.4% of the total variance) had high loading for both antidiabetic assays (α-glucosidase and α-amylase) as well as phosphomolybdenum assay. The species are distinguished along the second dimension depending on their abilities to suppress glucosidase and amylase together with their antioxidant capacity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00166-f001">Figure 1</xref>C showed the projection of the samples on the 2D score plot of PCA (PC1 vs. PC2); there is a great variability between the species to the observation of the score plot. 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic>, closed together, are separated from the other species, along the first dimension. In fact, relative to the other species, both these species showed the highest antioxidant properties. Furthermore, the second dimension separated 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic>, 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic> and 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> from 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. crocea.</italic> In addition, 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic>, 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> and especially 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> exhibited the strongest anti-amylase, anti-glucosidase activities and total antioxidant capacity.
