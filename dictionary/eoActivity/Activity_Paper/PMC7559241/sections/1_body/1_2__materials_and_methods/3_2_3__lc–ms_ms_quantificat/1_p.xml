<p>Lyophilized extracts were dissolved in water to obtain 10 mg/mL (stock solution) and stored at −4 °C. The chemical profiles were conducted by [
 <xref rid="B16-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and 45 standard compounds were used. Data were evaluated by dynamic MRM (retention time, precursor ion, product ion, voltage of fragmentor, collision voltage). For all the compounds, peak areas were calculated using Agilent MassHunter Workstation software—Qualitative Analysis (ver. B.03.01.). Calibration curves were plotted, and samples’ concentrations calculated using the OriginLabs Origin Pro (ver. 9.0) software.
