<p>Ethanol and aqueous fruit extracts of the plant revealed some degree of antimicrobial activities only against the Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>). This could be attributed to the structural difference between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The growth inhibition on the Gram-positive bacteria was below the standard inhibition zone for susceptibility. The difference in antimicrobial activities of the extracts may be accounted to differences in the amount and type of bioactive components, which in turn accounted to the source of extracts (i.e. plant parts). It is well established that the amount and types of bioactive compounds of plant extracts have different effects on different bacterial species. The presence of phytochemicals associated with insecticidal and deterrent activities in crude fruits extract of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> was reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The wider growth inhibition zone observed with the diluted ethanol and aqueous leaf crude extracts against all tested bacteria appear to imply that the leaves of the plant are the source of greater concentration of multiple phytochemical constituents. The fact that Ethiopian traditional healers often use leaf extracts in treating many skin and enteric infections e.g. [

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] may have some relations to this observation.
