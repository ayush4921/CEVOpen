<p>The minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) tests of the 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> were conducted with extracts that resulted in significant antimicrobial activities (with ≥7 mm inhibition zone) in the agar disc-diffusion tests. The data of our tests revealed that the MIC of the ethanol extracts ranged from 1.56 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL (
