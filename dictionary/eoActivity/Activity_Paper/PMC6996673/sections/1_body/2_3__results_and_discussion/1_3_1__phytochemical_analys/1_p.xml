<p>The phytochemical screening tests of the fruit, leaf, and stem crude extracts of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> turned positive for alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and steroids (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Many other groups of researchers had previously reported about the presence of glycosides, saponins, and steroids in the plant [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Aerial parts of the plant consist of two steroidal glycosidal alkaloids, solasonine and solamargine, and nonsteroidal components like three phenylalkanoic acids, benzyl-O-b-D-xylopyranosyl (1®2)-b-D-glucopyranoside, flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, adenosine, and new compound kaempferol 3-O-(6
 <sup>2</sup>¢-O-2,5-dihydroxycinnamoyl)-b-D-glucopyranosyl (1®2) b-D-glucopyranoside [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is clear that the medicinal and bioactive properties and the effects of plants are affected by the quality and quantity of their chemical constituents. The medicinal and other bioactive characteristics of the extracts of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> would be affected by the presence of all or some of these chemical constituents. The antibiotic actions of the fruits and leaves of the plant are attributed to their solanine contents and related glycoalkaloids [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Phytochemicals of several 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> species, especially steroids, alkaloids, and saponins, are known for their cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties [
