<p>Ripe fruits, mature leaves, and tender stems of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> were collected from wild stands in 
 <sc>gola</sc>'
 <sc>a-genahti</sc> area, northeast of Adigrat, Tigrai, and Ethiopia. Collection of plant materials by Ethiopian researchers for research and development purposes is granted by Article 15, Clause 1, of the Access to Genetic Resources and Community Knowledge, and Community Rights Proclamation of Ethiopia (No. 482/2006). The fruits were fully ripe yellow with no signs of browning. The leaves included stem tips with unopened leaves. The stems were prepared by removing the leaves and green, soft shoot tips. The fruits, leaves, and stems were cleaned off dust and dirt by washing with tap water. The fruits were sliced for drying. Then, all the plant materials were placed on laboratory bench top and air dried at room temperature. The dried plant materials were pulverized separately into powder with mechanical grinders and stored in airtight containers. The powdered contents were macerated with 80% v/v of ethanol and water for three days with occasional shaking and filtered to extract bioactive compounds. Upon observing the homogeneity of the contents, the ethanol and water-based maceration and filtration procedures were repeated three times to increase maceration and filtration efficiency. Then, the filtrates were lyophilized and kept for further work.
