<p>Bacterial colonies were inoculated into liquid nutrient broths and incubated in 200 rpm shaking incubator at 37°C overnight before the date of inoculation. Then, each broth culture was adjusted to match to McFarland 0.50 turbidity standard to get approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. Likewise, Mueller–Hinton (M-H) media were prepared according to the procedures given by its manufacturer as growth media for agar disc-diffusion assay and Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) test.
