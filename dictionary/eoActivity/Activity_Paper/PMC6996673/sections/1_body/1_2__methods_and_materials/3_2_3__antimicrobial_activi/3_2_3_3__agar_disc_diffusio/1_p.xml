<p>Susceptibility test was carried out using agar disc-diffusion method as outlined by Bari et al. with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plates containing M-H agar media were prepared and kept overnight to ensure that the media are free of contamination. Side by side, 6.5 mm filter paper discs were prepared from sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper using paper puncher. The M-H agar media plates were spread with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 12-hour-old bacteria cultures by spread plate technique and dried for minutes to let any surface moisture evaporate before applying the extracts. The filter paper discs were impregnated with 100 mg/mL concentration of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> plant extracts. Then, the discs were placed onto the agar plates using forceps and allowed to diffuse for 1 hour at room temperature. For comparison, standard microbial agents—streptomycin (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) and gentamicin (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g)—were tested along with the extracts. Three tests (replications) were conducted with each extract and test strain. Then, the plates were kept for two hours in the laboratory at room temperature and were transferred for incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. After incubation, the plates were observed, and the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured using electronic digital caliper. Bacterial cultures with inhibition zone of greater than or equal to 7 mm diameter were considered as susceptible to extracts [
