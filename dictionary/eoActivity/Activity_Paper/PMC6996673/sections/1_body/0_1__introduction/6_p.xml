<p>Efforts toward the collection of baseline data on medicinal plants for future phytochemical and pharmacological studies and innovation are very limited. Many scientists have underlined the urgent need for discovering new, safe, and cheap antibiotics with diverse chemical structures, novel chemical actions, and no adverse side effects in response to the emergence of resistant microbial strains to indiscriminate the use of antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this respect, medicinal plants with traditionally known bioactive constituents are important candidates for future pharmacological studies and drug discovery. Therefore, this article reports the findings of a study aimed at documenting the gross phytochemical profile and antimicrobial activities of fruit, leaf, and stem extracts of
