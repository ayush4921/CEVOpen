<p>Since the yield and production of secondary metabolites by traditional agriculture is not sufficient, plant tissue culture technique has been adapted as an alternative strategy to produce the commercially desired levels of bioactive compounds. Recently, medicinal plants have been exposed to different types of abiotic stresses leading to adaptive physiological changes and metabolic defence response signalling in the formation of secondary metabolites (extracellular or intracellular) to cope with the changing climatic conditions. Drought/dehydration is one of the abiotic stress elicitors against which tolerance can be evaluated using tissue culturing because the stress conditions get easily controlled under in vitro system. Moreover, least variability in plant population is observed in a limited time and space by the efficient tissue culture technique [
