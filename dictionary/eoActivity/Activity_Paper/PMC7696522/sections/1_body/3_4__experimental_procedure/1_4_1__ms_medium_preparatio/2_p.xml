 <sub>2</sub>). Then the culturing of these seeds was carried out on plain MS medium. The axillary shoot nodes excised from 4-week-old seedlings were incubated in various treatments of culture media. The growth room chamber having 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, 35 μmol m
 <sup>−1</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> irradiance, 24 ± 1 °C temperature, and 55–60% rate of relative humidity was utilized for conductance of experiment in triplicate. 15 explants per treatment were cultivated for 4 weeks. Various parameters of physiology, i.e., percentage (%) of nodal explants shooting, mean shoots length, mean number of leaves per regenerated shoot, mean number of nodes per explant, and fresh weight (FW) of shoots per explant were observed.
