<p>In case of different nonenzymatic antioxidant activities such as TPC, TFC, TAC, TRP, and DPPH-FRSA, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01552-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b reveals that significantly highest content (TPC 15.03 µg/mg, TFC 13.01 µg/mg, TAC 22.26 µg/mg, TRP 19.87 µg/mg, and DPPH-FRSA 95.27%) was estimated by the shoots grown in MS medium augmented with 4% of PEG 6000 stress. It was followed by the amounts obtained under the stress of 2% of PEG 6000 and later, 1% of PEG 6000 stress, followed by the PEG 6000 stress of 0.5%. The least quantity of antioxidant activities (TPC 6.97 µg/mg, TFC 4.44 µg/mg, TAC 13.7 µg/mg, TRP 10.22 µg/mg, and DPPH-FRSA 48.03%) was elucidated by the shoots grown in PEG 6000-deficit medium.
