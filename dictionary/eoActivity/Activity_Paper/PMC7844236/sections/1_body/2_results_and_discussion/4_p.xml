<p id="Par26">MDA content and the total activities of SOD and CAT enzymes were examined in order to evaluate the biochemical effects of diniconazole and CME on 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). An increase in the MDA content, a bioindicator of oxidative stress in the cells, refers to the damage to cellular membranes in connection with the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids

 </sup>. Different doses of CME did not lead a significant MDA increase in Group 2 and Group 3 when compared to the control (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). On the other hand, MDA content of diniconazole-applied Group 4 was nearly 5.4 folds that of the control group. Dinconiazole-related membrane deterioration has been previously demonstrated with animal experiments

 </sup>. MDA levels decreased with increasing doses of CME applied as a mixture with diniconazole in Groups 5 and 6. MDA content of Group 6 approximately halved when compared to Group 4. The healing power of CME applied simultaneously with toxic compounds inducing lipid peroxidation is well documented

 <italic>C. mas</italic> is a rich source of natural antioxidants
