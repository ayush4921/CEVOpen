<p id="Par27">Increased activity of antioxidant enzymes is another bioindicator of oxidative stress. SOD enzyme acts as a major warrior in suppressing the ROS-mediated toxicity by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Another endogenous antioxidant enzyme, CAT, contributes to the elimination of oxidative imbalance by converting hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen

 </sup>. CME application did not induce significant changes in the total activities of SOD and CAT in Groups 2 and 3 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, SOD and CAT activities in Group 4 were 2.17 and 1.91 times those of the control. Similar to our study, Mohamed et al.

 </sup> showed a remarkable increase in CAT activity of 
 <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> plants following the treatment of diniconazole. Although studies on the antioxidant enzyme activities of untargeted organisms exposed to diniconazole are very rare, there are many studies showing the induction of SOD and CAT activities by other triazoles

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup>. CME caused significant decreases in SOD and CAT activities when applied with diniconazole (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Considering the decrease levels in enzyme activities of Group 5 and compared to Group 4, it can be said that the positive effect of CME on antioxidant enzyme activities depends on the dose of CME in the mixture. 
 <italic>C.mas</italic> fruits have been emphasized as a priceless source of dietary antioxidants and anthocyanins those contribute to the therapeutic functions of these fruits to improve the antioxidant response and prevent cells from the detrimental effects of oxidative stress

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Anthocyanins, iridoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins are the five important structural groups found in 
 <italic>C. mas</italic> fruits
 <sup>

 </sup>. Reduction of SOD and CAT activities in the last two groups may be interpreted as the role of CME in helping antioxidant enzymes through mentioned components against ROS-mediated stress caused by diniconazole.
