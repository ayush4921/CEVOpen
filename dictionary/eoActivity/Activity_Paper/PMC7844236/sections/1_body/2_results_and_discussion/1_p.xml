<p id="Par23">The physiological effects of diniconazole fungicide and CME on 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs were examined with respect to germination, root growth and weight increase parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). There was no remarkable difference between the groups treated with CME (Groups 2 and 3) and the control group treated with tap water in all three parameters. Group 4 exhibited a significant growth delay due to diniconazole administration when compared to the first three groups. Indeed, the germination percentage in diniconazole-treated Group 4 almost halved, while the mean root length dropped to 1.60 ± 0.44 cm. The average weight gain in the control group was approximately 7.8 times that of the group treated with diniconazole. Our results were in accordance with Demirtaş et al.

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs. Similarly, another study showed that diniconazole treatment led to a reduction of root and stem growth as well as germination ratio

 </sup> reported that stunted growth caused by triazoles including diniconazole occurs due to the inhibition of gibberellin-like phytohormone biosynthesis. On the other hand, the preventive effect of CME administered as a mixture with diniconazole against growth retardation elevated with increasing doses of the extract in Group 5 and Group 6. The germination percentage in Group 6 was approximately 1.5 times that of Group 4. Besides, the detrimental effects of diniconazole in root elongation and weight gain in Group 4 relieved more in Group 6 than that of Group 5. Studies on the preventive effects of CME against compounds those inhibit plant growth are not available in the literature. However, Gülçin et al.
