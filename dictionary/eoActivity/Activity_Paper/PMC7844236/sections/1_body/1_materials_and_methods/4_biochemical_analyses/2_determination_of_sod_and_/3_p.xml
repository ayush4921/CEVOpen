 </sup> was chosen to evaluate the total CAT activity of the groups. 0.2 ml enzyme extract was added to the reaction medium containing 1.5 ml sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.8), 1.0 mL distilled water and 0.3 mL hydrogen peroxide (0.1 M). 0.2 ml enzyme extract was added to the mixture to initiate the enzymatic catalysis. The total CAT activity was recorded considering the decline in the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of 240 nm. Enzymatic consumption of hydrogen peroxide was expressed as OD240 nm minute per gr fresh weight
