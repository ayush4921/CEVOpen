<p id="Par9">Ripe Cornelian cherry fruits were collected manually in September 2019 in the Şebinkarahisar District of Giresun in Turkey. The fruits were brought to the laboratory and washed thoroughly with water to remove the residual dirt and dust. Fruit seeds were removed before the aqueous extract was prepared. Fruits were air dried at room temperature for 1 week in a dark chamber and stored at − 18 °C until the experiment started. Approximately 87 g of dry fruit was obtained from 400 g of fresh fruit without seeds. Fully dried fruits were powdered with a grinder and homogenized in distilled water with ultrasonic bath for 1 h at room temperature. The homogenate filtered through paper filter (Whatman filter No. 1) and freshly prepared
