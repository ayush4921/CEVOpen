 </sup>. It is classified as a systemic fungicide that functions in the inhibition of the ergosterol synthesis, particularly in 14α-demethylation step of the biosynthesis via lanosterol-14 α-ademethylase enzyme

 </sup> stated that its long half-life duration and highly lipophilic character let diniconazole fungicide have crucial risk potential for untargeted organisms. Although it is widely used in agricultural production processes, diniconazole was proven to be a suppressor for plant growth, chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis
