    "Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) is a medicinal plant with antioxidant-rich fruits. Diniconazole, a broad-spectrum fungicide, is employed extensively. The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive efficiency of C. mas fruit extract (CME) against the toxic effects of diniconazole on a model organism, Allium cepa L. For this aim, physiological, cytogenetic and biochemical parameters as well as the meristematic cell damages were investigated in A. cepa treated with diniconazole and C. mas extract. A. cepa bulbs were divided into six groups which were treated with tap water, 0.5 g/L CME, 1.0 g/L CME, 100 mg/L diniconazole, 0.5 g/L CME + 100 mg/L diniconazole and 1.0 g/L CME + 100 mg/L diniconazole, respectively. Diniconazole application caused a significant reduction in germination percentage, root elongation and total weight gain. Mitotic index decreased, while chromosomal aberrations increased following diniconazole application. Diniconazole caused significant rises in malondialdehyde content and the total activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes. The meristematic cell damages induced by diniconazole were indistinct transmission tissue, epidermis cell deformation, thickening of the cortex cell wall and flattened cell nucleus. Aqueous C. mas extracts induced a dose-dependent prevention and amelioration in all damages arisen from diniconazole application."
