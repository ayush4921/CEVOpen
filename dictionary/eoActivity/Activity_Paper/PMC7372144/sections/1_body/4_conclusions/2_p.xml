 <italic>Kigelia africana</italic> dichloromethane and methanol extracts exhibits high 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-cancer activity against the human breast cancer cell line HCC 1937. In general, the anti-cancer activities of the methanol and dichloromethane extracts can be attributed to the presence of flavonoids, triterpenes and phenolic constituents of the two extracts revealed on the TLC, as well as other constituents reported in literature (furanonaphthoquinones and norviburtinal). The findings for this study provide a scientific rationale of using the plant to control breast cancer in traditional medicine. More validation studies are important to determine cytotoxicity of the extracts and optimal dosage of application in traditional medicine.
