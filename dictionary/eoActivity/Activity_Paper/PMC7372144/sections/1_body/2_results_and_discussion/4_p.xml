<p id="p0060">At all tested concentrations, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>K. africana</italic> showed higher inhibition of the growth of the HCC 1937 breast cancer cell line compared to that of 50% methanol in dichloromethane as depicted by the observed trend. For instance, at 100 μg/ml, the % inhibition of cell growth by methanol and dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) extracts was 79.10% and 76.40% respectively. However, the difference in inhibition of cell growth was more pronounced at low concentrations of extract. For example, at 0.1 μg/ml, inhibition of cell growth by methanol extract (40.0%) was considerably higher than that of dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) extract (14.85%). Inhibition of cell growth was dose dependent for both extracts, with the level of inhibitory activity decreasing at lower concentrations. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies which have also reported potent anticancer properties for 
 <italic>K. africana</italic> extracts against other cell lines [
