<p id="p0065">Phytochemical screening of the plant extracts revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenols, steroids and flavonoids. This corroborates to the previous studies, which in addition have also reported presence of furanonaphthoquinoids, fatty acids, coumarins, iridoids, caffeic acid and norviburtinal [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The two extracts displayed a similar profile of chemical constituents on thin layer chromatography plate (TLC). This finding suggested that the differences in the anti-cancer activities of the extracts can be attributed to quantitative variations of the major constituents (see
