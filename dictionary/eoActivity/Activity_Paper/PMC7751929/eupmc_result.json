    "Schiff base derivatives with anthracene- and pyrene-based units, <b>A1-A6</b> and <b>P1-P6</b> were synthesized (89%-99% yields). Schiff base derivatives were designed to possess an heterocyclic moiety on one side to enhance the coordination ability towards metals. To investigate the biological assay of the newly synthesized compounds, their DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging, metal chelating, reducing power, antibacterial and DNA binding activities were tested. <b>A6</b> (63.1%) showed the maximum free radical scavenging activity among all. However, compound <b>P3</b> at concentration of 200 μg/mL possessed the highest metal chelating (45.8%) activity and power of reduction. In addition, <b>P3</b> and <b>A6</b> showed antibacterial activity against all bacteria tested and both compounds were very well bound to CT-DNA. Density functional theory method with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set was performed to get information about the structural and electronic properties of the present compounds. In addition, the metal coordination properties of the dimers of the parent Schiff bases were investigated through interactions with Zn<sup>2+</sup>."
