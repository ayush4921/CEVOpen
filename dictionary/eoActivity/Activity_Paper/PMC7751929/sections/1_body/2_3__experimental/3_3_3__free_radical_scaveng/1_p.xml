<p>Compounds were prepared with concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 Î¼g/mL in DMSO. Into different concentrations of 0.5 mL of the compounds, 2.0 mL of methanol DPPH solution was added, and then, this mixture of solutions were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Using an absorbance spectrophotometer the absorbance data at 517 nm were measured. Positive control for the measurement was performed through Trolox [40].</p>
