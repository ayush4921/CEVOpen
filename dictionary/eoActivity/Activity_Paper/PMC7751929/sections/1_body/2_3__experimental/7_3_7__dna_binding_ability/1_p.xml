<p>To determine the DNA binding activity of the compounds, CT-DNA (conc: 20 μg/mL) was diluted with sterile deionized water (1:5 ratio). 4 μL of this DNA solution was mixed with 6 μL of the present compounds in DMSO (500 μg/mL). The mixed solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h in the dark and after incubation time 3 μL DNA loading dye was added. Loading of the samples were performed on a gel containing 8 μL 0.05% ethidium bromide. 80 V in TAE buffer (50 mM Tris base, 50 mM acetic acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH: 7.8) was used for electrophoresis application for 50 min. The resultant gel was viewed and photographed under UV radiation [44].</p>
