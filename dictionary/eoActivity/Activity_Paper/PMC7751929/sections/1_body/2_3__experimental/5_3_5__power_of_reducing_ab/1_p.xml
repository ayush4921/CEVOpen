<p>The method reported by Oyaizu [42] was applied in order to determine the reducing power activities of the present compounds. Compounds of different concentrations (25–200 /g / mL) in 0.25 mL DMSO were prepared. Into the solutions of the compounds, 0.25 mL of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 0.25 mL of 1.25 mL of 1.0% potassium ferricyanide were added, respectively. Incubation of the mixture at 50 °C for 30 min followed by addition of 0.25 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The solution was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm fo 10 min. After that, the supernatant fluid of the solution (0.5 mL) was mixed with 0.5 mL deionised water and 0.2 mL ferric chloride (0.1%). Finally, the absorbance data of the solution was measured at 700 nm against a blank. The results were compared through the standard, α-tocopherol.</p>
