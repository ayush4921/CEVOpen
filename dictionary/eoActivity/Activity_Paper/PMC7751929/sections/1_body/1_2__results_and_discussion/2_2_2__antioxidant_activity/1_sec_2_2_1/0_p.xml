<p>Figure 1, all compounds tested show different scavenging activity at different rates. At a concentration of 200 Î¼g/mL, compound 
 <bold>A6</bold> (63.11%) showed the highest activity in the anthracene-based ( 
 <bold>A</bold> ) series, while compound 
 <bold>A5</bold> (14.77%) showed the lowest activity. In the pyrene-based ( 
 <bold>P</bold> ) series of compounds, 
 <bold>P6</bold> (20.72%) had the highest activity, while 
 <bold>P1</bold> (4.79%) had the lowest activity. When the two series were compared, it was found that the 
 <bold>A</bold> series compounds showed much better activity than the 
 <bold>P</bold> series compounds. The DMSO solution of the compounds showed less radical scavenging ability than Trolox (99.48%) at the same concentration.
