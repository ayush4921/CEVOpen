<p>The antioxidant capacity of organic or inorganic substances may rely on the reducing power data. Complexes with high reducing power behave as electron donors, thus, they can act as reducing agents for oxidative intermediates in lipid peroxidation process which promotes them to be used as antioxidants [36]. The reducing power of metal complexes was shown in Figure 3. Reducing power of samples increased as the concentration increased and α-tocopherol showed higher activity than the present compounds. Among the Schiff base derivatives, the highest reducing power activity was obtained from 
 <bold>P3</bold> as 0.482 at 200 μg/mL. Moreover, the rest of the series have lower reducing power, such as; 
 <bold>A3</bold> as 0.447, 
 <bold>A4</bold> as 0.418, 
 <bold>A6</bold> as 0.392 and 
 <bold>P4</bold> as 0.375 at the same concentration.
