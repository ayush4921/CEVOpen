<p>In agarose gel electrophoresis method, molecules act according to their mass, charge and shape. As a result of binding of the compounds to CT-DNA, the free DNA moves faster on the gel because it is smaller than the bound DNA [37]. Agarose gel electrophoresis results of compounds are given in Figure 4. According to the results, 
 <bold>A6</bold> and 
 <bold>P3</bold> compounds had the highest DNA binding capacity and a fragment of the DNA did not move well from the agarose gel. 
 <bold>A2</bold> , 
 <bold>A5</bold> , 
 <bold>P4</bold> and 
 <bold>P5</bold> compounds were found to have the lowest binding activity.
