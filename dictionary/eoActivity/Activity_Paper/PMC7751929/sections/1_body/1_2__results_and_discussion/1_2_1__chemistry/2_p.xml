<p>The successful synthesis of anthracene-based Schiff base derivatives 
 <bold>A1-A6</bold> prompted us to investigate the construction of pyrene-based Schiff base compounds from aminopyrene. Reactions afforded Schiff bases 
 <bold>P1-P6</bold> in good yields (89%â€“99%) (Table 1). The synthesis and anticancer activity investigation of 
 <bold>P1</bold> [32], and synthesis and chemosensor application of 
 <bold>P6</bold> [33] have been reported in the literature.
