<p>Metal coordination resulted in changes both in the electronic properties and the structure of the parent system completely. One way to observe this change and prove coordination is to calculate the absorption spectra by applying TD-DFT. In this study, B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) computational method was used for TDDFT applications. One hundred excitation levels were taken into account for the acquisition of UV-VIS spectra. The absorption spectrum of the 
 <bold>A5</bold> structure has three sharp bands at 220 nm, 340 nm and 500 nm (Figure 7). In addition, a weak band was observed at 180 nm. When 
 <bold>A5</bold> is coordinated with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, wide bands are replaced by sharp bands in the absorption spectrum of the molecule. Also, blue shifting is observed in the bands. Literature research shows that metal is coordinated with 2 structures in order to keep the intramolecular planarity intact. In this case, the central metal cation was complexed with 2 
 <bold>A5</bold> compounds. As seen in Figure 7, anthracenes are perpendicular to each other and have not lost their flatness. In the spectrum of this structure obtained, it was observed that the bands became sharp and the small band at 180 nm disappeared. A similar behavior has been observed in the case of 
 <bold>P3</bold> and 
 <bold>P3_Zn</bold> complex.
