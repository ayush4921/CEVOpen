<p>In Figure 6, 3-dimensional electrostatic potential maps obtained as a result of single point calculations performed on geometry optimized structures ( 
 <bold>A5</bold> and 
 <bold>A6</bold> ) are shown. These maps show how electrons ar dispersed on structures. Red zones are electron-dense (negative), green zones are electron-poor and blue zones are very poor (positive).
