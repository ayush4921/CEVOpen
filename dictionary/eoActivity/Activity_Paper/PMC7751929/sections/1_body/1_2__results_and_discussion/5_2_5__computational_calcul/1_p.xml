<p>Density functional theory at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level was applied to get 3-dimensional optimized geometries of 
 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>P</bold> series (Figure 5) with no symmetry restrictions. Bond lengths, angles and dihedral angles were computed by the same method to obtain the structural parameters. All theoretical calculations were performed by Gaussian 16W [38] package program. Then, vibrational analyses on the Schiff base derivatives and their metal complexes were carried on by the application of the aforementioned computational method employed for geometry optimizations. The structures of all systems were located at a minimum on the potential energy surface since the outputs of the frequency computations did not possess any imaginary data.
