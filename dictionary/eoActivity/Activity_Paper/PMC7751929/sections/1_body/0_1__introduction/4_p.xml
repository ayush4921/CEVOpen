<p>Combination of new potential biologically active species with pharmacophoric moieties identified and derived from known bioactive molecules has been known for designing novel biologically active compounds [26]. Inspired by the biological profile of Schiff base derivatives containing heteroatom rings and their increasing importance in pharmaceutical and biological science, in this study our goal was to synthesize anthracene- and pyrene-based Schiff base derivatives to obtain certain new chemicals for the intensified biological activities. Chemical units containing anthracene or pyrene framework possess prolonged π-conjugation property, high stability, good quantum yield and influential photoluminescence abilities which lead them to be well suited for potentail chemosensors [27–31]. Prompted by this information, we can say that these anthracene- and pyrene-based Schiff base derivatives are good candidates for chemosensors.</p>
