<p>Schiff bases display strong chelating ability due to the presence of unpaired electrons on nitrogen atom of the azomethine moiety, especially when one or more donor atoms located in close neighbourhood to the azomethine group. Schiff bases become interesting ligands for coordination chemistry by their chelating ability together with the convenience of separation and flexibility in changing the structural formation about the C=N group [22].</p>
