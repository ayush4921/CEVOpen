<p>The above studies show that PQR has a good therapeutic effect on type II diabetes. The hypoglycemic activity of PQR is mostly studied by animal 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and clinical double-blind control. In the future, more large sample size and longer-term controlled trials are needed to provide reliable data support for the wide application of PQR. Moreover, the composition and content of active ingredients in PQR are complex, which are often caused by varieties, medicinal parts (roots, leaves, fruits), extraction methods, harvest years, growing places and so on. Therefore, although the international community has made positive comments on the role of PQR in the treatment of diabetes and thinks that it is likely to be widely used in the future, but it is pointed out that the current PQR as a drug has not been standardized and can not be widely used. In the future, it is necessary to conduct in-depth study on different effective parts and monomer components of PQR, and to clarify the exact components and main mechanism of its anti diabetes and obesity, so as to reduce the risk of drug use in clinical patients.
