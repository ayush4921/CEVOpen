<p>Studies have shown that PQR can improve cellular immune response and mitochondrial function, increase insulin production, reduce pancreatic cell death, and improve postprandial blood glucose in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. However, the active components of PQR to improve the function of pancreatic cells have not been found (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Arginine, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid and other bioactive substances in the root of PQR can increase the levels of insulin, glycogen and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the mice with type II diabetes, and meanwhile reduce the levels of blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to play a hypoglycemic role (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanism may be mainly through the regulation of linoleic acid metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (

PQR could significantly reduced body weight and plasma insulin and C-peptide levels of type II diabetic animals, while increased body weight and plasma insulin and C-peptide levels of type I diabetic animals. However, both of them could decrease the blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and increase the area of islets. The mechanism of action may be to promote the regeneration of B cells, leading to increased insulin secretion. In addition, the effect of PQR on weight may also be one of the mechanisms of hypoglycemia in type II diabetes mellitus (

 <sub>50</sub> = 73.2 μg/ml) and α-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 111.8 ng/ml), improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in human fat cells, improve fasting glucose level, and reduce the expression of GLUT4 and PDK1 in fatty tissue induced by high-fat diet and alloxan (
