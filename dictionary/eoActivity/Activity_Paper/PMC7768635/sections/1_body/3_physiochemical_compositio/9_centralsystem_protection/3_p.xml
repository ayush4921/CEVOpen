<p>The root of PQR has no protective effect on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurodegeneration, but the stems and leaves of its aerial part could reduce the volume of striatal lesions induced by 3-NP. The main reason is that the aerial part of PQR contains a higher level of ginsenoside, among which Rb1, Rb3 and Rd play a key role. Since the neurodegeneration induced by 3-NP is similar to the neuron loss in Huntington’s disease, PQR may have clinical application value in the prevention of neurodegeneration in Huntington’s disease or other neurological diseases (

 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have shown that it may play a role by increasing the expression of choline acetyltransferase and trkA mRNA in the basal forebrain and the expression of nerve growth factor mRNA in the hippocampus through the cholinergic system (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that PQR could protect against F3 cytotoxicity induced by Aβ 1-42 by enhancing the expression of CHAT gene. It can also restore the cognitive function of mice by regulating the concentration of microtubule-associated proteins 2, synaptophysin and acetylcholine in the brain (
