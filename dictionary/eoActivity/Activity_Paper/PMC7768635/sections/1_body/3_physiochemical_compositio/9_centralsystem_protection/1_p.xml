<p>PQR can resist anxiety like behavior caused by 72-h sleep deprivation, oxidative stress state, changes in mitochondrial enzyme complex activity, elevated serum corticosterone level, increased brain TNF-α level, and neuroinflammatory like signs in discrete brain regions Pretreatment with GABA agonist could enhance the protective effect of PQR, and the protective effect is more significant than itself (

PQR can significantly improve cognitive impairment caused by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), regulate oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus, mitochondrial enzyme complex activity, and the level of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α), acetylcholinesterase, and serum corticosterone. 
 <sc>l</sc>-arginine could reverse the protective effect of PQR. And 
 <sc>l</sc>-NAME could enhance the function of PQR (

Studies have shown that PQR could improve endoplasmic reticulum stress and neuronal cultural-related cell apoptosis after acute spinal cord injury induced by triglyceride (TG), and promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury (

 <sup>+</sup> channel in the way of concentration and voltage dependence. And PQR changed the voltage dependence of inactivation and delayed the recovery after inactivation to protect the ischemic nerve (
