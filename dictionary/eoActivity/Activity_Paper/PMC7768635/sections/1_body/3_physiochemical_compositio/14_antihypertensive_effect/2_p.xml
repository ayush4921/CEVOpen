<p>Some research show that PQR combined with antihypertensive drugs can reduce systolic blood pressure, increase diastolic blood pressure, and decrease pulse pressure significantly. It can inhibit inflammatory reaction by regulating the expression of adhesion molecules and reducing the levels of sICAM-1 and sE-selectin, so as to protect and repair vascular endothelial cells and resist vascular sclerosis (

PQR, rich in Ginsenoside Rg3, can improve central systolic blood pressure and pulse wave components, reduce late systolic blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption, and reduce peripheral wave reflex to play a role in lowering blood pressure (

However, although some studies have shown that PQR has a significant effect on the treatment of hypertension, there is a lack of in-depth research on its related mechanism.The pathogenesis of hypertension is very complex, and regulating inflammatory response may be only one of the important links. PQR may also play its role by regulating immunity, regulating the levels of endogenous substances Na

Moreover, most of the antihypertensive models of PQR are clinical subjects with small sample size, large individual differences, single pathological models and various external influencing factors. In the future, scholars can use chemical reagents to induce different types of hypertension animal models, study the mechanism of action of PQR one by one, so as to improve the clinical treatment of various types of hypertension with PQR.
