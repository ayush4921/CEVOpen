<p>The above studies showed that PQR polysaccharide was the most effective material basis for immune regulation in PQR. The immunoregulation mechanism is mainly to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and the level of immune organs. And the dosage forms of PQR immunomodulator are mainly granule wrapped by nanometer biomaterials (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akhter et al., 2019</xref>). However, the present study has several limitations, such as the lack of research on the optimal extraction technology of polysaccharide compounds from PQR and the lack of research on the optimal effective dose of immune regulation of PQR. Because the content of polysaccharides extracted by different extraction methods is different, it is difficult to have an accurate index to measure the clinical dosage. Secondly, the mechanism of immunoregulation of PQR only stays at the level of inflammatory factors and immune organs. Whether it can exert a pharmacological effects in other ways remains to be further studied by future scholars. Finally, there are only studies on the gastrointestinal permeability, dissolution rate and other factors of PQR polysaccharide encapsulated with nano biomaterials. In the future, scholars can also consider developing cheaper, environmentally friendly, safe and effective materials to replace it, and develop more new dosage forms of Chinese medicine to facilitate clinical application.
