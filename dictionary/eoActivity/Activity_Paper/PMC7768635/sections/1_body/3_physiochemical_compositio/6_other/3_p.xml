<p>At present, the research on the chemical composition of PQR mainly focuses on the determination of its saponins, amino acids and trace elements.There are relatively few studies on the analysis of proteins, fatty acids and other organic compounds and their functions, which may be due to the complex components of proteins and polysaccharides, which are difficult to separate and purify. Moreover, in the process of extraction of PQR and the determination of substance content and types in the residue after production, it was found that a large amount of crude protein and crude polysaccharide could not be effectively used and could only be discarded with the discharge of waste residue. PQR as a high-grade health care products, the price is expensive, and the demand exceeds supply. According to the determination, the content of saponins and polysaccharides in the leaves of PQR is as high as more than 10%, which is twice as much as that in the root of PQR. In other words, because the leaves of 
 <italic>Panax quinquefolium</italic> are not exploited and utilized, 2/3 of the medicinal ingredients are lost. And modern pharmacological studies have shown that PQR polysaccharides have good immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities. Due to the high price of PQR, future scholars can focus on the stems and leaves of PQR. Therefore, how to make full use of PQR remains to be further studied.
