<p>Finally, most of the methods have some disadvantages, such as complex sample pretreatment, using toxic organic solvents, polluting the soil and not green enough. Future scholars should not only focus on the existing methods, but also try to adopt other methods to control the multi-component quality of PQR. For example, Hou et al. used UPLC-QDA method to analyze the spectral effect of Angelicae Pubescentis. Compared with other mass spectrometry methods, this method is cheaper and more cost-effective (

 <sub>2</sub> as mobile phase, which is environmentally friendly and green (
