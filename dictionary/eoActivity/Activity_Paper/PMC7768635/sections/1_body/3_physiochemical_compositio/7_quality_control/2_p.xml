<p>Some qualitative and quantitative methods have been used to evaluate the quality of PQR. In the past, scholars mostly used thin-layer chromatography to qualitatively identify PQR (

 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>), and immunoassay (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Morinaga et al., 2010</xref>) were used for multi-component determination and quality control of PQR. However, there are some defects in the design of these methods.
