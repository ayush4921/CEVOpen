<p>PQR has good therapeutic effect on various diseases caused by inflammation, including chondroarthritis, endotoxemia, enteritis, myocardial injury and other diseases. However, the research on the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PQR is limited to the level of inflammatory factors, lacking the in-depth exploration of its anti-inflammatory mechanism. And there is a lack of research on effective anti-inflammatory ingredients. Future scholars can establish the network pharmacology of the anti-inflammatory effects of PQR to screen its effective anti-inflammatory components, potential targets and action pathways, and verify it through animal and clinical studies, so as to improve the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PQR.</p>
