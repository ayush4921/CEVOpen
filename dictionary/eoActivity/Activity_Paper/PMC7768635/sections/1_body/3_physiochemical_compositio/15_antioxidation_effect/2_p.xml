<p>The above studies showed that PQR has good antioxidant activity. However, the current experimental research is limited to the cell level 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the future, scholars can consider using animal experiments and epidemiological methods of the relationship between antioxidant capacity in human serum and certain diseases to study the antioxidant mechanism and capacity of PQR 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, at present, few studies have explored the monomer compounds that play the antioxidant role in PQR. In the future, scholars can use the spectrumâ€“effect relationship method to screen the active substances that play the antioxidant role in PQR. Synthetic antioxidants often have some toxic and side effects, and PQR is expected to become a low-toxic and highly effective food antioxidants. In addition, the study showed that phenolic acids and flavonoids had strong antioxidant effect, phenolic acids and flavonoids accounted for a high proportion in the leaves and fruits of PQR, but the root was the medicinal part specified in the Pharmacopoeia. In the future, scholars can conduct in-depth study on the pharmacological effects of the stems, leaves and fruits of PQR, so as to provide the basis for the rational development and utilization of PQR.
