<p>In summary, PQR has anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-myocardial infarction, anti-atherosclerosis and other effects. In recent years, more and more studies have preliminarily confirmed the effect of PQR on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, PQR also has the function of anti-arrhythmia, protecting the damaged myocardium and anti-hemorrhagic shock. Although the current research on heart protection of PQR is more and more in-depth, however, there are still some problems to be further explored. For example, the key components that play a cardiac protective effect on PQR are mainly concentrated in the PQR crude extract and PF11, and there is a lack of research on the mechanism of effect on other components. Studies have shown that panaxadiol saponins and panaxatriol saponins also have cardioprotective effects (

These problems can be explored in future studies.
