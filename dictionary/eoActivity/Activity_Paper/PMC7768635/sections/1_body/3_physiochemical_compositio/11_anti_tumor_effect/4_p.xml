<p>Intestinal bacteria are fully involved in ginsenoside metabolism, and after oral administration of PQR, intestinal bacteria can gradually hydrolyze the sugar chain of ginsenoside. Under the action of intestinal bacteria, ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd were first transformed into ginsenoside F2 and then converted into compound K (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, it is not the ginsenoside Rb1, the main component of PQR, that plays an anti-cancer role, but the intestinal bacterial metabolite Compound K has significant inhibitory activity on the growth of colorectal cancer cells (

PQR could significantly enhance its anti-proliferation effect on a variety of cancer cells after being processed at high temperature, because the structure and composition of saponins were changed at high temperature, and more low-polarity saponins were produced, such as ginsenosides Rg3, 20R-Rg3, Rk1 and Rg5, etc. These components can enhance the enzyme activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9, significantly reduce the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and induce the apoptosis of cancer cells (

Other studies have shown that the contents of ginsenoside Rb1, Re, Rc and Rd are reduced, the contents of Rg2 and Rg3 are increased after processing at high temperature, the expressions of cyclin A and cyclin D1 are significantly reduced, and the antiproliferative activity of PQR is significantly improved (

And studies have shown that the PQR extract can significantly increase NK cells and prolong the life span of leukemia mice in a dose-specific manner (
