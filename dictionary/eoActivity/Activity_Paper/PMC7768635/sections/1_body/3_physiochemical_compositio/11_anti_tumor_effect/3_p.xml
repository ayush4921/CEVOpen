<p>He et al. showed that Rg 3 could inhibite colorectal cancer by down-regulating the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that ginsenoside Rh2 significantly induced colon cancer cell death by regulating phosphorylation levels of protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and H3. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies showed that ginsenoside Rh2 could inhibite the growth of tumor cells (Yang et al., 2016). In addition, the water extract of PQR root could play an anti hepatoma effect by promoting the apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells (
