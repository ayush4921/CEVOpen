<p>Third, at present, the determination of compounds in PQR is limited to saponins, volatile oil and amino acids, and the quality markers of PQR were not elucidated. The analytical methods have the disadvantages of complex sample preparation, toxic organic solvents, soil pollution, and not green enough. In the future, scholars can consider introducing integrated quality evaluation method and Internet analysis technology to find quality markers of PQR. Instead of being limited to the existing methods, they can try to adopt the UPCC and other environment-friendly methods to carry out the multi-component quality control of PQR.</p>
