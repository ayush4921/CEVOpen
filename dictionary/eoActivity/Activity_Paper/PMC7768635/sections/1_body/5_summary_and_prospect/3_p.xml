<p>Second, a large number of compounds have been isolated from PQR, but the current research on these compounds may be only the tip of the iceberg. The research on the chemical composition of PQR mainly focuses on the saponins, amino acids and trace elements while the analysis and function of organic compounds such as protein and fatty acid are relatively less. Moreover, it was found that a large amount of crude protein and crude polysaccharide could not be effectively used with the discharge of waste residue after extraction. In the future, scholars can try to develop new separation and determination methods to comprehensively measure and analyze PQR, so as to prevent its effective components from not being fully utilized.</p>
