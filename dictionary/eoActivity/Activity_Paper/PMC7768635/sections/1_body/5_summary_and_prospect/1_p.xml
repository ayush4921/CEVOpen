<p>On January 2, 2020, The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Market Regulation listed PQR as a medicinal and food homologous product. This study summarized the botany, chemical composition, quality control, pharmacological, toxicity and industrial development of PQR. At present, the components isolated from PQR include saponins, volatile oils, flavonoids, sterols, polyacetylene, phenolic acids and other chemical components as well as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, fatty acid and other essential nutrients for human body. Pharmacological studies have shown that PQR has pharmacological effects such as neuroprotection, cardiovascular protection, immune regulation, anti-tumor, anti-diabetes, anti-hypertension and so on. Studies on the safety of PQR showed that PQR was a non-toxic substance and could be used as a toxicologically safe functional food, but it also had rare toxicity and sensitization. This paper summarizes the industrial development of PQR and finds that PQR has relatively high economic and social benefits, but there are still some important gaps in the scientific literature:</p>
