<p>The proportion of polysaccharides in PQR is higher, and monosaccharides include glucose, fructose and sorbose, and the oligosaccharides include ginseng trisaccharide, maltose and sucrose (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Cui, 2002</xref>). Zhang’s study showed that the average carbohydrate content of PQR from different regions was: reducing sugar 3.70%, oligosaccharide 15.40%, polysaccharide 49.74%, total sugar 68.84%. The results showed that 11.74–19.86% of water-soluble pectin could be extracted from PQR. The water-soluble pectin was composed of galacturonic acid, galactose (Gal), glucose (Glu), arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), rhamnose (Rha) and a few unknown sugars (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Li, 1989</xref>). Liang et al. showed that the total sugar in PQR include starch, pectin, oligosaccharide and monosaccharide. The total amount is 68.2%–74.3% (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. However, there are few studies on the isolation and identification of polysaccharides in PQR. The possible reason is that the components of polysaccharides are complex and it is difficult to identify the polysaccharides by modern analytical methods. Polysaccharides from PQR have many pharmacological functions, such as immune regulation, anti-oxidation, anti-virus, anti-inflammatory, etc. In the future, researchers can develop more new instruments and methods, improve the identification system of polysaccharides, and develop monosaccharide drugs to facilitate clinical use. At the same time, the development of PQR polysaccharides into health food can also be used as a dietary supplement for human body, which can obtain a higher degree of acceptance than drugs.
