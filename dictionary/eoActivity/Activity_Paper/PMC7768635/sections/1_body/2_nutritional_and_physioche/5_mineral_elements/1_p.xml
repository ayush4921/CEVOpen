Zhangâ€™s research showed that the content of mineral elements in the aboveground part (stem, leaf and seed) of PQR was higher than that in the underground part. And the content of mineral elements in the stems and leaves which had not been used as medicine in the past was much higher than that in the taproot. Moreover, various mineral elements in PQR can promote the growth of children and other therapeutic effects, on the other hand, they can play a role in disease prevention and health care.
