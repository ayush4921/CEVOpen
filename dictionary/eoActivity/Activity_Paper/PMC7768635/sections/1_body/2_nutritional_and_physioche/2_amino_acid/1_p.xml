<p>PQR is rich in nutrients and contains a variety of amino acids, (As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which have a positive effect on the human body. Zhang et al. determined that there were 18 kinds of amino acids (12.838Â g/L) in PQR berries, among which 10 kinds were essential and semi-essential amino acids for human body (

 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">Zheng and Deng, 1989</xref>). The amino acid contents in roots, stems, leaves, buds and seeds of PQR at different ages were analyzed. The results showed that the amino acid content of PQR decreased with the increase of PQR age. The contents of total amino acids in four-year-old PQR were as follows: flower bud (13.922%) &gt; leaf (11.723%) &gt; root (5.932%) &gt; seed (5.006%) &gt; stem (3.372%) (

However, at present, the flower bud and leaf of PQR are rarely used, and it has not been deeply applied in nutrition and health care. Most of the flower bud and leaf resources are abandoned and cannot be fully utilized. In the future, the flower buds and leaves can be developed into PQR tea with health functions, or the flower buds of PQR can be made into PQR flower-cakes and biscuits, so that the resources of PQR can be better developed and utilized.
