 <p>The present study evaluated the antioxidant, cytotoxic, and larvicidal potential of the essential oil of 
  <italic>Tridax procumbens</italic> leaves, as well as identified the compounds present in the essential oil. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the sequestration method of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, the cytotoxic activity was evaluated using 
  <italic>Artemia salina</italic>, the larvicidal bioassay was performed with larvae in the third stage of development of the 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, and the identification of the metabolites was performed by gas chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The phytochemical oil analysis showed the presence of 20 compounds, with thymol and 
  <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene being the main ones. It presented antioxidant activity with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 194.51 
  <italic>μ</italic>g mL
  <sup>−1</sup>, demonstrating antioxidant activity in the highest concentrations tested. It presented low cytotoxic activity against 
  <italic>A. salina</italic>, with an LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 1238.67 
  <italic>μ</italic>g mL
  <sup>−1</sup>, demonstrating atoxicity in the concentrations tested. The essential oil presented good larvicidal activity when compared to the literature, with an LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 79.0 
  <italic>μ</italic>g mL
  <sup>−1</sup> in 24 hours and LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 69.15 
  <italic>μ</italic>g mL
  <sup>−1</sup> in 48 hours. In this way, it was possible to identify that the essential oil of the leaves of 
  <italic>T. procumbens</italic> presented potential for the development of a natural larvicide, as well as antioxidant activity satisfactory to the radical DPPH and low toxicity to 
  <italic>A. salina</italic>.
