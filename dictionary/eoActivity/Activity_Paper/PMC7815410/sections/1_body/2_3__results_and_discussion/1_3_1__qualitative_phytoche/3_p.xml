<p>In the study, the 
 <italic>Eupatorium ballotifolium</italic> Kunth, belonging to the same family as 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic>, the family Asteraceae, shows similarity in its majority compound [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the two species, thymol and 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene were identified among the major compounds of the EOs analyzed. These compounds are mentioned in the literature as promising biological agents in different activities, demonstrating the promising potential of the 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> species, which presents about 47% thymol in its composition.
