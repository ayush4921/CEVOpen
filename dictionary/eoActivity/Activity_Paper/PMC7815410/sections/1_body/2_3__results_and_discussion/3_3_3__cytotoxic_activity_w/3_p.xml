<p>It is possible to identify that EO had no toxicity in the test performed with 
 <italic>A. salina</italic> larvae. This can be reaffirmed by a study that classifies the essential oils in degrees of toxicity and according to the interval, in which the extracts with LC
 <sub>50</sub> below 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup> are considered to have high toxicity; for moderate activity, the extracts present LC
 <sub>50</sub> between 500 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and for low toxicity, the extracts present LC
 <sub>50</sub> above 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and are considered nontoxic [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this sense, the EO of the species 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> with LC50 = 1238.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL−1 can be considered as nontoxic.
