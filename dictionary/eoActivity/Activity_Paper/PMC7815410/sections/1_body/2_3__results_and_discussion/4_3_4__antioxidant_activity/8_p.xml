<p>For example, 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> has been shown to reduce inflammation when applied as a leaf plaster and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain in rodent models [

 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> extract of methanol and ethanol using DPPH and ABTS. In both assays, the extracts showed moderate free radical scavenging activity. The methanol extract showed higher antioxidant activity when compared to the 70% ethanol extract. The effects of the extracts were less potent compared to positive controls with ascorbic acid [
