<p>For each repetition of treatment, 25 larvae were used, pipetted to a 100 mL beaker containing distilled water. Then, the larvae were removed from the beaker into the test vessel, thus minimizing the time between the preparation of the first and last samples. The safety of the solvent in the employed concentration was verified, being also present in the replicates of the control. During the experiment, the average water temperature was 25°C. After 24 and 48 hours, the dead larvae were counted, being considered as all those that cannot reach the surface.</p>
