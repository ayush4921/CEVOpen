We observed that RSE is a strong inhibitory agent against PPD-induced toxicity in human keratinocytes. The results indicated that RSE pretreatment significantly could suppress PPD induced cytotoxic effects, including decrease of cell viability, accumulation in subG1 phase of cells, and relocation of phosphatidylserine on keratinocytes. Also, we found that PPD caused cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and subsequent activation of caspase and PARP degradation. However, pretreatment of RSE showed preventive activities against PPD induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and ROS production in keratinocytes. In conclusion, the results of present study suggest that RSE was able to protect the skin from several cytotoxic effects of PPD and could be a meaningful material in many industries using PPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>PPD, para-Phenylenediamine</kwd><kwd>RSE, <italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M extracts</kwd><kwd>ROS, Reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium</kwd><kwd>FBS, Fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>PI, Propidium iodide</kwd><kwd>MTT, 3-[4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide</kwd><kwd>DMSO, Dimethyl sulfoxide</kwd><kwd>DiOC<sub>6</sub>, 3,3'dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide</kwd><kwd>DCFH-DA, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwd0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M</kwd><kwd><italic>para</italic>-Phenylenediamine</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial damage</kwd><kwd>Keratinocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0005">Edited by Dr. A.M Tsatsaka</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0030"><italic>para</italic>-Phenylenediamine (PPD), aromatic amine compound, is widely used in the industrial manufactures. For example, as an ingredient in hair dye, dark henna dye, and leather dye, or as a precursor to polymers including aramid plastics and Kevlar for textile, or as an antiozonants for production of rubber products [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many people dye their hair to enhance attractiveness and to look younger. In previous research, 50.9 % of individuals had experienced hair coloring at least once during their entire lifetime, and among them 81.4 % were female in Europe [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous surveys conducted in Korea have suggested that more than 50 % of the population who have gray hair are in their early 40 s and are in the process of aging. Most of them continue to dye their hair periodically, despite side effects [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Permanent hair dye containing PPD comprise more than 70 % of the hair dye market share in Europe, United States, and East Asia [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="par0035">Dye produced during the hair dyeing procedure, is formed through chemical reaction in hair shafts. Under oxidation condition, a precursor agent such as PPD reacts with a coupler agent such as resorcinol, to produce a colored polymerized compound with high molecular weight [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, in the process of PPD oxidation Bandrowski&#x02019;s base (BB) well known as mutagenic compounds inducing allergic reaction, also could be formed by autooxidation in the presence of air, or by promoting the oxidation reaction with oxidants including hydrogen peroxide [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although, skin functions as the first line of defense system against toxic chemicals and foreign substances, PPD exposed through skin epidermal layer can be absorbed by percutaneous absorption during hair dyeing or a tattooing process, resulting in allergic contact dermatitis [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>].
