  <p>RSE could attenuate the change of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) after treatment of PPD exposure in HaCaT cells.</p>
  <p>(A) HaCaT cells were treated with RSE for 4 h, and after that PPD was exposed for 48 h. Cells were stained with 0.1 μM of DiOC
   <sub>6</sub> for 15 min at 37 °C and loss of Δψm was analyzed by flow cytometry. (B) Changes in DCF fluorescence intensity of HaCaT cells induced by PPD in the presence or absence of RSE pretreatment was measured under a fluorescence microscope. (C) Intracellular ROS levels in HaCaT cells were measured by determination of fluorescence intensity at excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. The analysis was mean of triplicated measurements ± SD of three separate experiments. The analysis was mean of triplicated measurements ± SD of three separate experiments. *
