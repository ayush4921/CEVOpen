  <p>Cytotoxic effect of PPD in HaCaT cells and protective effect of RSE on PPD- induce HaCaT cells.</p>
  <p>(A) PPD decreased cell viability of HaCaT cells in a dose and time dependent manner. HaCaT cells were treated with various concentration of PPD (0−400 μM) as indicated for 24, 48, and 72 h, repectively. (B) Morphological changes in HaCaT cells were observed using an inverted microscope after treatment of PPD for 48 h. (C) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. For cell viability analysis, HaCaT cells were seeded on a culture plate, and treated with various concentrations of RSE prior to PPD induction. (D) Cell images of after exposure to PPD with or without RSE treatment for 48 h. The analysis was mean of triplicated measurements ± SD of three separate experiments. *
