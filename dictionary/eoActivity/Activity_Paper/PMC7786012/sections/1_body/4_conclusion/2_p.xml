<p id="par0180">In conclusion, results of current study demonstrate, that RSE attenuates the cytotoxic effect of PPD on human keratinocytes. We elucidated that the mechanism of RSE protecting cells from PPD was achieved by suppressing Δψm loss, activation of caspase-3, -9 and cleavage of PARP induced by PPD. These results suggest that RSE can be used as a valuable natural substance to protect human skin from toxicity of PPD in many industries such as hair coloring, tattooing and fur dyeing, which use PPD as a constituent.</p>
