 <italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M. were obtained from the Juksangol nongwon (Jeonnam, South Korea) and identified by comparison with voucher specimen (NIBRVP0000373346), which is already deposited at the National Institute of Biological Resources. The dried and pulverized raw material (100 g) was extracted overnight with 70 % (v/v) ethanol at room temperature, and the supernatant was collected by filtration. Ethanol was removed by rotary vacuum evaporation (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) from collected supernatant. The extract was lyophilized to yield 
 <italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M. extract (2.1 g, yield 2.1 %). Lyophilized powder dissolved in DMSO at 1000-fold higher concentration of final concentration in medium.
