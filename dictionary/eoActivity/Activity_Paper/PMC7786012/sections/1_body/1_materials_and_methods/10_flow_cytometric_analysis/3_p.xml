<p id="par0090">Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) following treatment with PPD and the protective effect of RSE on PPD induced apoptosis, were measured after staining with 3,3′dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC
 <sub>6</sub>) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). After treatment, the cells were harvested and incubated with PBS containing 50 nM DiOC
 <sub>6</sub> for 15 min at 37 °C prior to flow cytometric analysis.
