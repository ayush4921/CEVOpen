<p id="par0095">For measurement of intracellular ROS, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used, which readily diffuses into cells to be used as fluorescent probe. HaCaT cells were pretreated with various concentrations of RSE for 4 h and then stained with 5 μM of DCFH-DA in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Then, 200 μM of PPD was treated for 24 h in the presence of DCFH-DA. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and fluorescence intensity was analyzed by Tecan Infinite F200 PRO (Tecan, AG, Mannedorf, Switzerland) with specific excitation/emission wavelength of 485 nm and 535 nm respectively.
