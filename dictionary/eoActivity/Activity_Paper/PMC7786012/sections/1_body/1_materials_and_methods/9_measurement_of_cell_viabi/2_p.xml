<p id="par0080">Cytotoxic effect of PPD on HaCaT cells was determined by using the 3-[4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands) assay. Briefly, HaCaT cells (6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>) were plated into 96 well plates and incubated overnight and then cells were treated with serial dilution of PPD. In order to determine the protective effect of RSE on PPD IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, cells were pretreated with various concentrations of RSE for 4 h, and they were exposed to PPD (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) for 48 h. After treatment, MTT reagent (1 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 3 h. After then the supernatant was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to dissolve the formazan crystal produced from MTT. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Epoch™ microplate spectrophotometer, BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA).
