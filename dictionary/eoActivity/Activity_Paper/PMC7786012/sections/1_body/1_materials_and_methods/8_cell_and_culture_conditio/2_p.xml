<p id="par0075">The human keratinocyte (HaCaT) was purchased from CLS (Eppelheim, Germany) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and penicillin under standard condition (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere). When cells reached approximately 80 % confluence, the cells were subcultured every 3 days. To investigate the following experiments, HaCaT cells were seeded on plastic dishes and grown to 70–80 % confluence. The cells were treated with various concentrations of RSE 2.5–10 μg/mL 4 h before PPD treatment.
