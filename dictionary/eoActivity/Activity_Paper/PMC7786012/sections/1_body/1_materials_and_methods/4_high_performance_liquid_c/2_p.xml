<p id="par0055">A Waters (Milford, MA, USA) HPLC system with a 600 Controller, 996 Photodiode Array Detector, 616 Quaternary pump, and a 717 Autosampler was used for analysis of gallic acid. Data acquisition was achieved using the Waters Empower software. All chromatographic separations were conducted on an Molecules 2015, 20 3558 ACE® 5 μM C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, ACE, UK) at ambient temperature with detection at 290 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) for 20 min.</p>
