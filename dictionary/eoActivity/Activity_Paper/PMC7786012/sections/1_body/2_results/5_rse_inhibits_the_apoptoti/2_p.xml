<p id="par0130">Morphological characteristics of apoptosis are shrinkage of cells, nuclear chromatin condensation, and finally karyorrhexis with DNA fragmentation and irregular chromatin distribution. To determine whether RSE could restore PPD induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells, we used Hoechst 33,342 dye to evaluate chromatin condensation, and Annexin V/PI dye to detect exposure of phosphatidylserine at the outer membrane leaflet as an indicator of apoptosis. 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A shows that treatment of HaCaT cells with 200 Î¼M of PPD, caused significant enhancement of early apoptosis (lower right) and late apoptosis (upper right). However, levels of early and late apoptotic cells, were decreased by RSE pretreatment. Furthermore, a higher number of apoptotic cells staining more brightly than normal cells, were observed by PPD treatment with Hoechst 33,342 staining. However, RSE pretreatment for 4 h could inhibit apoptotic morphological changes, following to PPD treatment (

 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 induced by PPD was prevented by RSE pretreatment, especially in caspase-3 in a dose dependent manner.
