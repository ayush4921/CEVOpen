<p id="par0125">PPD was known to induce cell death. To investigate whether PPD induced cell viability reduction occurred because of cell cycle alteration, the cells were treated with various concentrations of PPD for 48 h and then the DNA content of cells was stained with propidium iodide method. We observed that the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase representing apoptotic cells increased in a dose dependent manner. On the other hand, pretreatment with RSE on HaCaT cells could reduce induction of apoptotic sub-G1 phase, following exposure to PPD (
