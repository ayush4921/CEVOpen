<p id="par0140">To determine whether RSE could protect them from oxidative stress induced by PPD, HaCaT cells were pretreated with RSE for 4 h before treatment with PPD. Intracellular level of ROS production was measured by using DCFH-DA as a fluorescent dye. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, changes in fluorescence intensity was observed with the fluorescence microscope. Tecan Infinite F200 PRO was used to analyze and quantify differences of fluorescence intensity. The PPD treated group had increased fluorescence intensity to 324.5 % compared to the control group. However, fluorescence intensity of RSE pretreated groups decreased by 40.9 % and 56.0 % at the concentration of 5 and 10 Î¼g/mL, respectively, compared to the PPD treated group (
