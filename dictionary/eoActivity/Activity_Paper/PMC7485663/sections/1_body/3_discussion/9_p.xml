<p>The bioactivity of all extracts against all studied bacteria varied except for the 80% methanol extracts of both the plants against

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. These dissimilarities in activity could be linked to the disparity in solvent used for extraction purpose,[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in addition to phytochemical variations in composition and/or concentration in the respective plant extracts. The sensitivity of microorganisms to chemotherapeutic compounds can change even in different strains of a single bacterial species. Like this study, the extract of various plants inhibited the growth of selected microorganisms at different ratios in another study. The phytochemicals and their concentrations differ across plants, which explains the difference in antimicrobial effect.[
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] On the other hand, the extract from the same plant species has shown variable activity against different bacterial species, presumably because of the difference in sensitivity of the microorganisms to specific active ingredients in a plant.[
