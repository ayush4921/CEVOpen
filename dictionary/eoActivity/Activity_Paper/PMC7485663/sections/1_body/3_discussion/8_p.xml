<p>All the extracts of this study were found to inhibit growth in all three studied bacteria. This indicates that these extracts contain compounds with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, highlighting their potential as alternatives to antibiotics. In terms of the mechanism, the active ingredients in the extracts may affect the overall impermeability and integrity of the bacterial cell wall.[

 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] have been shown to have effective antimicrobial phytochemicals against various disease-causing organisms (i.e., have a wide range of bioactivities). This biological activity is because of their ability to form a complex with the bacterial cell wall and with extracellular and soluble proteins. Similarly, alkaloids and phenols, which occurred in most extracts in this study, have been recognized to have a growth suppression tendency against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[
