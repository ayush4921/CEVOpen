<p>The acetone extract of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> had only slightly lower inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains as compared with the chloroform extract. In the qualitative test, this acetone extract was found to have high alkaloid contents and phenols, which have antimicrobial properties[
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and thus may have contributed to the effectiveness against these strains. The comparable antibacterial effects of the acetone and chloroform extracts against all tested bacteria suggest that medium polar and nonpolar compounds of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> are likely responsible for its bioactivity, which is similar to the findings of Teka 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] The methanol extract had lesser activity on most tested bacteria compared with that of acetone and chloroform extracts, indicating that the active components that inhibit the growth of the studied bacteria might be dissolved better in acetone and chloroform than in 80% methanol. Nonetheless, the zone of inhibition by the 80% methanol extracts of both plants against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is similar to that of the same solvent extract of 
 <italic>P. stellatum</italic>,[
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 
 <italic>Ceterach officinarum</italic> DC and 
 <italic>Echinophora tenuifolia</italic> L. subsp. sibthorpiana (Guss) Tutin.[
