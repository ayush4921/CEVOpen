<p>Organic solvents were used in this study for extraction, as these have been reported to result in higher antibacterial activity compared with aqueous extract.[
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Acetone has been reported to be highly effective for extraction, as it dissolves a wide range of active compounds from plants including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components.[
