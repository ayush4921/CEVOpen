<p>Among the extracts of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> leaves, a maximum zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed with the chloroform extract [
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. This may be because the chloroform extract had a greater amount of the active component(s) such as flavonoids and, particularly, tannins than that in the 80% methanol extract; these components were absent or present in an undetectable amount within acetone extract [
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. Tannins enhance the therapeutic efficacy, as they are able to (a) bind proteins and thus inhibit cell protein synthesis, (b) form a complex with the microorganism membrane because of its astringent properties and (c) deprive iron through precipitation and/or its effect on bacterial metabolism through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.[
