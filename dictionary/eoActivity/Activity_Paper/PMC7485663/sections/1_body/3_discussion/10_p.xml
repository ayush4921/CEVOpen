<p>It is interesting to note that 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is less susceptible than 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to different extracts of the respective plants despite both microbes being Gram-positive, thereby suggesting that genetic variations between the two bacteria[
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] could be a factor making 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> more resistant to the extracts. Furthermore, this might be because of the more complex nature of cell wall of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> compared with that of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
