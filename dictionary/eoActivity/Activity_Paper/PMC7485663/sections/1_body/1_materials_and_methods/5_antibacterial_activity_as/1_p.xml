<p>A sterile cotton swab was implemented to remove surplus suspension by gentle rotation of the swab against the surface of the tube. It was then used to dispense the bacteria evenly over the whole surface of the Mueller–Hinton Agar (MHA). For 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, MHA supplemented with sheep blood (5%) was used. The agar well diffusion method, which is equivalent to Kirby–Bauer disc-diffusion method, was used to assess the antibacterial effects of all extracts extracted from the study plants, as described previously.[
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Wells of 6-mm diameter were formed on the inoculated agar media with a sterile cork borer. Around 100 μL of each extract solution (100 mg/ml) was added into each well. Ciprofloxacin 0.05 mg/disc was used as a positive control. The solvent (DMSO) used for the reconstitution of each extract was used as a negative control. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Antibacterial activity was interpreted by measuring the diameter of clear inhibition zones surrounding the wells according to the standards of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2015.[
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Each extract was examined in triplicate to ensure the quality and the mean value was calculated.
