<p>Five extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity by using the well diffusion method. The bacterial suspension was prepared by picking some colony of overnight agar culture of the test organism and adding it to a test tube containing 5 ml of nutrient broth; then, the turbidity was compared with that of McFarland nephelometer tube no. 0.5 (1.5∗108 cfu/ml); then, it was diluted by taking 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of suspension, and it was added to 2 ml of nutrient broth (0.5∗108 cfu/ml). The MIC is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits the growth of a microorganism after 18-24 hrs. Each extract was subjected to serial broth dilution technique to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration for all tested microorganisms. Broth microdilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> five solvents extracts. Each extract of (OA) plant was dissolved in 1 ml DMSO in a concentration of 100% for all solvent extracts (acetone, chloroform, methylene chloride, petroleum ether, and methanol). Then, the final extract concentration was 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. After that, each well was inoculated with microbial inoculums which were prepared in the same medium after dilution of standardized microbial suspension adjusted 0.5 McFarland scale. After well mixing, the 96-well microtitration plates are incubated under 37°C for 24 h. For all bacteria, we tested here, we did four controls including (1) +ve control which contains media+bacteria; (2) -ve control which contains media only; (3) extract control (extract+media): to be sure, there is no contamination and turbidity, and the changes are not occurred due to the plant extract itself (so extracts were serially diluted in this control); (4) DMSO: no DMSO used. The established tests were conducted in triplicates [
