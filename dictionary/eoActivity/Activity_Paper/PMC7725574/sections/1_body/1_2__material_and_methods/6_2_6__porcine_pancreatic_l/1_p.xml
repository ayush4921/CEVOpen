<p>E-ach extract of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> plant, a working solution (1 mg/ml), was made by dissolving 100 mg of each plant extract in 100 ml of 10% DMSO, then diluted the produced solution to obtain different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/ml). In addition, a lipase enzyme stock solution (1 mg/ml) was directly prepared before use by dissolving 25 mg of lipase enzyme powder in 25 ml of 10% DMSO then was prepared p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) stock solution by dissolving 20.9 mg PNPB in 2 ml of acetonitrile. 0.2 ml from each plant extract prepared serial dilutions was mixed with 0.1 ml of lipase enzyme stock solution and completed with Tris-HCl solution to reach 1 ml of volume. Then, incubated for 15 min at 37°C in a water bath, and after 15 min, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of PNPB solution was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The blank solution was prepared by mixing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of lipase enzyme (1 mg/ml) solution with a Tris-HCl solution up to 1 ml. Orlistat was used as a positive control and followed the same previous steps as plant fractions. The absorbance was measured utilizing a spectrophotometer (UV-Vis) at 405 nm. However, the lipase enzyme inhibitory potential (
 <italic>I</italic>%) was measured utilizing the following equation [
