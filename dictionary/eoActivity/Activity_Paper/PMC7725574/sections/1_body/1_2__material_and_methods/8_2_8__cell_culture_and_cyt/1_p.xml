<p>HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media, which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics and 1% l-glutamine. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Cells were seeded at 2.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 48 h, HeLa cells were incubated with various concentrations (6.4, 3.2, 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, and 0.0125 mg/ml) of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> five extracts for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by CellTilter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Briefly, at the end of the treatment, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MTS solution per 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of media was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The sample absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
