<p>In summary, this investigation shows that 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> plant five extracts contain valuable bioactive molecules that acted as anti-
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, antilipase, antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic potentials. The acetone extract of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> plant illustrated potent 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory comparing with acarbose, and the acetone and methanol extracts revealed potent antilipase activity comparing with orlistat. Moreover, methylene chloride extract inhibited the growth of all the tested bacterial and fungal strains and has potent cytotoxic activity comparing with the positive control doxorubicin. Therefore, 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> could have a medical significance in the future.
