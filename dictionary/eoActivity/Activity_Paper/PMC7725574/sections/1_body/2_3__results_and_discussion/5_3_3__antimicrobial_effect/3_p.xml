<p>The bacteriostatic effect of 
 <italic>Anchusa strigosa</italic> lipid fraction against selected strains of bacterial pathogens has been investigated by Al-Juobory et al. and showed that it was more effective against Gram-positive bacterial strains compared with the Gram-negatives. The antibacterial activity results against Gram-positive strains were in the flowing sequent: 
 <italic>S. faecalis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> &gt; Bacillus sp., while the effect against Gram-negative was as follows: 
 <italic>P. aeruoginosa</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. &gt; 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. &gt; 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> sp. [

 <italic>Anchusa strigosa</italic> essential oil exhibited potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially in a high concentration (2 and 5 mg/ml) [
