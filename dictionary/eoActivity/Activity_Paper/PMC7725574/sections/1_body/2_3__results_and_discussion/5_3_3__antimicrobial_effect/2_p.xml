<p>The broth microdilution assay results showed that not all extracts were effective against the studied microbial strains. In fact, the petroleum ether and acetone extracts did not show ant antimicrobial inhibition effect in the used concentration. However, the chloroform extract inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with MICs of 2.5 mg/ml, respectively. Moreover, methanol extract inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and MRSA with MICs of 12.5, 2.5, 2.5, and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively. Finally, methylene chloride extract inhibited the growth of the screened all microbial strains, particularly against the fungal strain 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with MIC of 0.313 mg/ml as presented in
