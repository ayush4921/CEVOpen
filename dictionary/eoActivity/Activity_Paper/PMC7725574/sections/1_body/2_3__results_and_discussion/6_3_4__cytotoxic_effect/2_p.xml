<p>Evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> five extracts on HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cell line showed that the methylene chloride extract has the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value followed by acetone and petroleum ether extracts with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.59, 0.9, and 0.96 mg/ml, respectively, while the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> plant was cytotoxically inactive. However, the methylene chloride extract showed potential cytotoxic activity comparing with the positive control doxorubicin (a potent anticancer drug) which has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.03 mg/ml (
