 <italic>Clerodendrum trichotomum</italic>. Through this study, it was reported that lower concentrations of 
 <italic>P. asiatica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trichotomum</italic> extract significantly reduced replication and transcription in RSV genes and in turn reduced its protein synthesis thus reducing the RSV-induced cell death.
