<p id="p0250">The research related to bringing plant-based drugs from bench to boardroom is lagging behind synthetic drugs despite the fact that phytomedicine have an enormous potential in treatment an array of ailments. The lag is especially prominent when it comes to comparing the rapidity of its availability to synthetic drugs. This is one of the most important reasons that put medicinal plants biotechnology research on a priority list. This has created a plethora of information regarding medicinal plants and their utility against different disease-causing agents. The information available are scattered throughout different databases and web sources (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Gu and Chen 2014</xref>). For this purpose, a counter approach is sought through the use of computational tools. Bioinformatic tools play an important role in analyzing the available data and thus choosing the best drug candidates aided with the wet lab research. Furthermore, Computational approaches offer their value in terms of deciphering genetic pathways that are associated with the production of antiviral secondary metabolites from medicinal plants (Sharma and Sarkar, 2013. Several databases have been developed to provide catalogue information related to scientific publications in general including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Similarly, databases like the Arabidopsis information resources (TAIR), Medicinal Plant Database for Drug Designing (MPD3), and the International Ethnobotany Database (ebDB) provide more specific and useful information about medicinal plants and their metabolic pathways. The later of these is a noncommercial repository for ethnobotanical research providing complete location information, strong searching and data export features (

Similarly, MPD3 is a free database that provides information about phytochemicals including their structure and potential activities through reference to original research papers. These databases have already helped researchers to evaluate the potential of phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds against protiens and enzymes of the novel SARS-CoV-2. For instance (
 <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">ul Qamar et al., 2020</xref>), assessed the activity of phytochemicals from a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds against the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro). Their analyses concluded at least nine hits for a potential class of drugs among the phytochemicals against the SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, molecular docking studies of stilbenoids against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have shown that stilbene based compounds (especially resveratrol) and flavonoids such as quercetin, fisetin, and kaemferol can be promising

 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Wahedi et al., 2020</xref>) (Pandey et al., 2020). Apart from stilbenoids and flavanoids studied for their in silico molecular dynamics, amongst the phytochemicals studied, essential oils have also been shown to possess potent acitivity against SARS-CoV-2. For instance, Abdelli et al. (2020) concluded that natural compounds (Isothymol, Limonene, 
 <italic>P</italic>-cymene, Thymol and Î³-terpinene) can block the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that is hampering the attachment of the virus to the cell surface.
