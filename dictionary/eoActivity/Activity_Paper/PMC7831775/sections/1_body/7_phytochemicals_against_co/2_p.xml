<p id="p0185">The pandemic caused by COVID-19 warrants search for safe antiviral compounds to treat the disease. At present, no specific treatment has been identified for COVID-19. The novelty of COVID-19 means that its behavior is very uncertain and, therefore, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of herbal products against the virus or as prophylactic agents. However, as the current COVID-19 viruses bears resemblance to the previous outbreak causing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, so the herbal compounds employed against the previous coronaviruses may prove as valuable drug candidates if researched properly. There are hundreds of different herbal products tested against the coronaviruses. Most of these products have their selectivity indexes up to 100 which hints towards their safety (

 <sub>50</sub>) is the measure of effectiveness of drugs. Higher SI values mean that the drug tested is theoretically more effective and safer during
