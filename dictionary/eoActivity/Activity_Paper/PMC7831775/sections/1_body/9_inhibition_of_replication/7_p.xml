<p id="p0240">Apart from the viral replication inhibition and anti-3CLpro activity, plant-based compounds have proved effective in blocking the activity of important enzymes such as SARS helicase. 
 <xref rid="bib154" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2012)</xref> studied the inhibitory effects of 64 purified natural compounds against the activity of SARS helicases. Among these flavonoids, myricetin and scutellarein, isolated from 
 <italic>Aglaia perviridis</italic> showed significant 
 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV activity. Studies on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based double-strand DNA unwinding assay and colorimetry-based ATP hydrolysis assay confirmed that flavonoids such as scutellarein and myricetin potently inhibit the SARS-CoV helicase protein 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by affecting the ATPase activity. Based on their lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, 2.71 ± 0.19 μM and 0.86 ± 0.48 μM, respectively, and no cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell lines, myricetin and scutellarein could thus prove as SARS-CoV chemical inhibitors.
