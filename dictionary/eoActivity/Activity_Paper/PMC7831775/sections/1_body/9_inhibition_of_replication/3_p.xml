<p id="p0220">The replication of SARS-CoV is usually inhibited by interfering with the functions of the main viral proteinase (Mpro, or 3CLpro). The 3CLpro regulates the activities of the coronavirus replication complex and has thus been one of the main targets in finding a drug against the coronaviruses (

 <italic>Rauvolfia serpentina</italic> (Indian snakeroot) and Aescin, a saponin from 
 <italic>Aesculus hippocastanum</italic> (European chestnut tree). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for Reserpine and were found to be 3.4 μM and 6.0 μM while the and CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 25 μM and 15 μM, respectively. Different assays such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays confirmed the 
 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV activity of these compounds. Reserpine and Aescin have been shown to interfere with the viral entry to the cell and also inhibit the activity of 3CLpro enzyme of the virus inside the cell (
