<p id="p0195">Coronaviruses acts against the host immune system through its proteases; papain like protease (PLpro) and 3CLpro. The PLpro of SARS-CoV antagonize the innate immune response. The host's immune response first recognizes viral RNA and then recruits adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins to transduce signals to the downstream kinase complex for activation of transcription factor, NF-κB and IRF-3. Next, these transcription factors induce the expression of type I interferons (IFN-

 <italic>β</italic>). Type I IFN induces the activation of STAT transcription factors resulting in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which establishes an antiviral state in surrounding cells. SARS-CoV PLpro acts either via deISGylating or deubiquitinating proteins or both within these pathways. This results in antagonism of the host antiviral response and thus successful evasion of immune response by the SARS-CoV (
