<p id="p0205">Viral entry inhibition by plant derived compounds is another promising area of finding the suitable drug candidate. Coronaviruses enter the cell after binding to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This entry is made possible through the attachment of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein to ACE2. Many different phytochemicals have shown a strong inhibition of the interaction of SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2. For example, anthraquinone compounds; emodin, and rhein, and a flavonoid; chrysin, derived from genus 
 <italic>Rheum</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> were tested for their activity against SARS-CoV. The study found that emodin showed the strongest effect and significantly blocked the S protein and ACE2 interaction with IC
