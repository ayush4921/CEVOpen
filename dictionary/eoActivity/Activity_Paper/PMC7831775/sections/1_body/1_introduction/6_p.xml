<p id="p0105">Apart from a primary food source, plants serve as a very important source of medicine. A thorough understanding of the pathways of plant's secondary metabolism along with their conservation status, ecology and ethnobotany is important for drug development (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Nature 2020</xref>). To focus on this aspect, medicinal plants produce many important chemical compounds through their secondary metabolism, operating as a self-defense against stress induced by environmental triggers and pathogens. From using the raw plant to extraction of important compounds, medicinal plants are centuries old source in the various traditional herbal medicine systems. For instance, their importance lies in the fact that the WHO concludes that 80% of the world population relies on them for treatment (

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Maxmen 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is no wonder that medicinal plants could be employed as a potent weapon against COVID-19. Traditional herbal medicine coming from these medicinal plants could serve at different fronts including alleviation of symptoms of COVID-19 patients as well as providing raw material for potent antiviral drugs. The current research for treatment of COVID-19 should, therefore, include on a largescale, medicinal plants as an important area of search. This review paper highlights the usefulness of medicinal plants in the fight against COVID-19 in many ways. The paper reviews the important plant derived compounds for immediate application in alleviation of symptoms, and important secondary metabolites as candidates for anti- COVID-19 drug discovery.
