<p>Another important finding from the present study is that the levels of serum osteocalcin increased while DPD decreased following

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although osteocalcin is a specific osteoblast marker and highly correlates with histological changes (Gundberg et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the level of serum OC tended to fluctuate with food intake (Starup-Linde 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Earlier work indicated that osteocalcin does not appear to be as sensitive marker as BALP (Kaddam et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Indeed, the activity of BALP remains low in the DFD rats, indicating a continuing adverse effect on mineral metabolism. BALP is the bone-specific isoform of alkaline phosphatase, synthesised by the osteoblasts for bone remodelling process, but more specifically reflects mineral metabolism (Cheung et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Of interest, the ratio between osteocalcin to DPD was nearly equal to those of the NC groups, suggesting an equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption almost achieved with
