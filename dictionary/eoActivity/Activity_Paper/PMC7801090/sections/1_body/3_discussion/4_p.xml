<p>As oxidative stress can destabilise the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activities, it provides a strong rationale for the measurement of bone turnover markers (Starup-Linde 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The present study demonstrated that serum DPD levels increased while serum osteocalcin and BALP activities decreased in the DC rats. This finding is in agreement with Zhukouskaya et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), who showed that suppression of bone turnover is the main characteristic of T1DM-associated bone disorder. These data concur with previous reports of increased serum DPD in rats with osteoarthritis (Lee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and osteopenia (Abuohashish et al.
