<p>It is well known that bone strength is determined by BMD and the spatial structure of trabecular bone (Wakabayashi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The data from the micro-CT scan showed that the DC rats had a significant decrease in BMD, TbN, and BV/TV, as well as an increase in TbSp value. Similar findings were reported by Zhou et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that STZ-induced diabetic rats are associated with trabecular loss and cortical osteopenia (Rao Sirasanagandla et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). One particularly interesting finding was that TbN and BV/TV values increased following 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A greater cortical thickness with a subsequent increase in BMD was also observed in the DFD rats. These findings suggest the possibility of 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment for delaying the progression of osteoporosis in diabetes. Consistent with our findings, it has been demonstrated that plants with antiosteoporotic activity significantly increased the thickness of cortical and trabecular bone as well as improved BMD in the rat (Kumar et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
