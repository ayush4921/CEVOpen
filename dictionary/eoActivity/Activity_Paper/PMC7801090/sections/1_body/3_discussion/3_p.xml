<p>Both clinical and preclinical studies pointed out that the pathogenesis of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis are influenced by oxidative stress (Guo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lepetsos and Papavassiliou 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therefore, it is worth further deciphering the relation between oxidative stress and bone quality. Herein, we showed that the DC rats were associated with increased levels of oxidative damage markers. A significant increase in MDA level was also observed in all treated animals, and thereby strengthened susceptibility to STZ-induced bone complications in animal studies (Yee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It has been shown that oxidative stress along with hyperglycaemia can disrupt bone metabolism and architecture by altering the function of osteoclast and osteoblast (Lee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, hypertrophic chondrocyte-like phenotype has been postulated to be a consequence of oxidative stress (Kishimoto et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This was relevant to our observations that the DFD rats, which show such a high number of chondrocyte hypertrophy, had among the highest MDA levels. What is more, high plasma MDA concentrations are related to the early stages of osteoarthritis (Martins et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), thus strengthening the hypothesis that 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> can delay the progression of osteoarthritis.
