<p>As depicted in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the DC rats showed a significant decrease in BMD, TbN, and BV/TV but TbSp was significantly increased than those of NC rats. In contrast, the TbN and BV/TV values increased following 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment. It was also noticed that TbSp returned to near-normal levels and BMD increased significantly in response to 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment.
