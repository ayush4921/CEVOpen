<p>Micro-CT is a non-invasive procedure for three-dimensional BMD measurement in small animals (rats and mice) (Ashton et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that micro-CT provides several advantages over classical histomorphometry. Ay et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) reported an increase in cellularity and lacunar density in STZ rats based on information obtained from high-resolution synchrotron micro-CT. However, several important features such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, resorption lacunae, or osteoid seams on the bone surface cannot be visualised (Burghardt et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It is reasonable to suggest that micro-CT analysis in combination with the traditional techniques can produce a reliable diagnosis of osteoporosis.
