<p>After micro-CT analysis, the samples were decalcified in 0.5 mmol/L EDTA phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 2 months (Huang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The EDTA solution was changed every week. Followed by the dehydration and embedding in paraffin, the bone specimens were sectioned at 4 µm thickness and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. All slides were examined using light microscopy (Motic BA410, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Moticam Pro 285 A, Wetzlar, Germany), under a magnification of ×200 and ×400.
