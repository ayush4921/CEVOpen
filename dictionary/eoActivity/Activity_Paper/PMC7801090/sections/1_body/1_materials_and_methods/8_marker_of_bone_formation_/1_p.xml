<p>All markers of bone formation and bone resorption were measured in serum. The osteocalcin level was determined by using Rat-Mid Osteocalcin ELISA kit (IDS, UK) whereas the rat BALP ELISA kit (Qayee, Shanghai) was used to examine the levels of BALP. To assess bone resorption DPD was measured by using Rat deoxypyridinoline (DPD) ELISA Kit (Qayee, Shanghai). All samples were run in triplicate and the optical density was read at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, BioTek, USA) as described by Abdul-Majeed et al. (
