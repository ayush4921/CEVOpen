<p>To calculate the BMD (in mg/cm
 <sup>3</sup>) of each femoral diaphysis, a calibration curve was obtained by phantom experiments. This procedure allows the conversion of Hounsfield units (HU) into BMD values. The phantom was made up of a plastic base material, polyethylene; containing five cylindrical holes with 190 ± 0.5 mm diameter. Four cavities were filled with 50, 150 and 500 mg/cm
 <sup>3</sup> solutions of K
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> in distilled water, as known reference bone substitutes, and the fifth is a fat equivalent that was filled with 60% ethanol.
