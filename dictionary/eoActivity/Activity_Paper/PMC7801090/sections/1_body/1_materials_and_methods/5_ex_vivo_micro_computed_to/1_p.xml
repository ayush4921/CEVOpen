<p>The bone tissue analyses were performed using SkyScan 1176 micro-CT scanner (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) equipped with a 1 mm aluminium filter at a voltage of 41 kV and a current of 232 μA as described by Azmi et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The rotation step size used for acquiring images was 0.6 degrees. The transverse 2 D cross-sectional images were reconstructed using NRecon software (Bruker-MicroCT). The images were then analysed for BMD, trabecular parameters (number, TbN; separation, TbSp; thickness, TbTh), and BV/TV (Bruker provides the CTAn software, ScancoMedical the IPL software).
