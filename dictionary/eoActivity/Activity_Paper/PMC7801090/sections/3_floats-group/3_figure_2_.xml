  <p>Light photomicrographs of sagittal sections of rat femur from different experimental groups. Normal control rats showing (A1) branching and anatomising thick trabeculae (T) separated by bone marrow (BM) spaces with some fatty tissue, (B1) well-developed growth plate, (C1) normal healthy articular cartilage, and (D1) cortical bone of femur diaphysis with haversian canals [indicated by green arrow] and osteocytes in their lacunae [indicated by black arrow]. Diabetic rats revealed (A2) thinning of the bone trabeculae with widening of the bone marrow spaces, (B2) disruption of the growth plate, (C2) reduction in articular cartilage quality at the femoral condyle, (D2) Multiple eroded [indicated by red arrow] areas at the endosteal surface of the cortical bone were obtained. Diabetic rats treated with metformin showing (A3) sparse and thinning trabeculae, with loss of connectivity and presence of abundant adiposity cells, containing a noticeable increased fatty tissue, (B3) wider distal femur growth plate, (C3) erosion of articular cartilage, and (D3) increase cortical porosity. Diabetic rats treated with F. deltoidea displaying (A4) larger areas covered with trabeculae and increased bone matrix density, (B4) epiphyseal plate arranged in layered array, (C4) thicker calcified cartilage component, and (D4) less cortical erosion. (A) Distal metaphysis trabecular (magnification 200×); (B) Distal epiphylseal plate (magnification 400×); (C) articular cartilage (magnification 200×) and (D) Cortical bone of femur diaphysis (magnification 200×).</p>
