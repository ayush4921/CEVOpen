<p>Lastly, 
 <bold>IF-3</bold> proved to be a completely different interface than the previous two. No RNA-binding residues are found in its pocket, but others turned out to be important for its stabilization. These are: Gly44, Arg88, Asp144 from chain A and Asp81, Asp82 from chain B. In addition, some of the best stabilizing ligands in this system, such as Cianidanol and Masoprocol, showed very weak ligand/dimer interaction in the previous two interfaces, which can be explained due to the differences between the interface-forming residues.
