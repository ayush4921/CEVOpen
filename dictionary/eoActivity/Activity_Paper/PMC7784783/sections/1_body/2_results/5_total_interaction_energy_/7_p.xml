<p>On the other hand, the number of RNA-binding residues in 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> is slightly higher. In its pocket, Thr57, His59, Arg92, Ile94, Ser105, Arg107, Tyr172 from chain B showed significant interaction with many of these compounds, especially with those that had a lower TIE value. Moreover, when comparing these results with the activities measured in Rohâ€™s work, it can be observed that the active compounds (-)GCG and (-)CG interact significantly better with these residues in comparison with the inactive molecules, (-)C and Quercetin. This result could explain the differences between their reported biological activities. Finally, similar to 
 <bold>IF-1</bold>, Glu174 shows a strong interaction with those ligands with better performance, highlighting its crucial role in the stabilization of both complexes.
