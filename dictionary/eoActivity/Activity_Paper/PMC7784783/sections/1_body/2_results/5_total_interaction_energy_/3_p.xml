<p>Correlation was found between previously known active/inactive compounds in Rohâ€™s (Roh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) work and the calculated interaction energies in 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold>. This was not the case for 
 <bold>IF-3</bold>, since this interface does not include the residues that are known to interact with RNA, which were specifically tested in the cited article. Another important aspect to notice in this comparison is that dimer stabilization was not considered in the performed biological assay, which focuses only in the inhibition of the protein function.
