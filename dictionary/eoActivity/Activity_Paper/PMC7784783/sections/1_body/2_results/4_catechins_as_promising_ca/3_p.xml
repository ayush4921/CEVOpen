<p>Molecular docking calculations of these added compounds showed that, among the 378 polyphenolic molecules in the new database, flavonoids had the lowest 
 <italic>consensus</italic> docking scores. Moreover, a good differentiation between the compounds tested as active and inactive in Roh’s work was found (Roh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), particularly considering the 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> docking score (Table S2). These results motivated the addition of (+)-Gallocatechin Gallate, (+)-Gallocatechin, (-)-Catechin Gallate for further molecular dynamics simulations. Also, (-)-Catechin and (-)-Gallocatechin Gallate were taken into account for comparison, since they had been tested in Roh’s work. Finally, despite not being a catechin itself, Gallic acid 3-O-gallate was also considered since it is a synthetic precursor of many of the molecules selected, and it had the second best 
 <italic>consensus</italic> docking score of all.
