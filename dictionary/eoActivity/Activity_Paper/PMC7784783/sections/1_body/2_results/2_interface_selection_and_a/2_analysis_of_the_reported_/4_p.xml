<p>Per-residue decomposition analysis for the ligand-free 
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> showed some key interactions between both monomers which contribute to the system stability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). A:Gly105/B:Asn68 and A:Gly103/B:Thr70 are the two strongest pair interactions and Gly103, Thr104, Asn138 of chain A and Thr134 of chain B presented significant interactions with more than one residue of the other monomer. It is important to mention that the added highly mobile amino acid sequence introduced some uncertainty to these energy calculations, and their residues were excluded in these analyses.
