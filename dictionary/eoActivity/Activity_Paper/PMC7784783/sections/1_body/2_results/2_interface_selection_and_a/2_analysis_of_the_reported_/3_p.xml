<p>This was accomplished by performing molecular dynamics simulations in the reported ligand-bonded dimers (P1/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> and P3/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold>) and the isolated interface (
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold>). All of them proved to be stable systems, since equilibrium was reached in all cases. TIE calculations correlated with the activities previously reported (P3, EC50 = 32

 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> complex proved to be more stable than the isolated dimer (see 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, in the case of P3 ligand, per-residue decomposition analysis showed also excellent correlation between the reported ligand-dimer interacting residues and the ones with the strongest interaction in our simulations. However, this was not accomplished in the case of P1, since during the trajectory the pose of the ligand changes (Figure S4). This can be understood considering the lower number of interactions reported in comparison with P3, which also explains the differences in the EC50 values.
