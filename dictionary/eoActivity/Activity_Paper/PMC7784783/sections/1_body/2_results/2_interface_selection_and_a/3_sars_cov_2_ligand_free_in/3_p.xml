<p>Molecular dynamics on the three ligand-free interfaces were performed. These simulations showed that the only stable system was 
 <bold>IF-1</bold>, with a TIE of −91 kcal/mol which is a similar value to the one obtained for the 
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> interface. On the other hand, the TIE values of 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-3</bold> were weaker than the previous ones, as expected.
