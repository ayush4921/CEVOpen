<p>Modulation of PPIs by small molecules is an emerging and versatile strategy in drug development. The direct stabilization of these type of interactions is conceptually challenging since it requires the simultaneous targeting of more than one protein within the complex. Even though there are numerous examples of small molecules (especially natural products) that relay their biological activity on this type of interactions (Andrei et al.,
