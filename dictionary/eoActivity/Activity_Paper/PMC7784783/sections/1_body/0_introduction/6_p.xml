<p>In the first part of this work, the stabilization of the reported MERS-CoV non-native nucleocapsid homodimers is analyzed using molecular dynamics and end-point MM-GBSA energy calculations, with results in good correlation with the reported experimental data. Then, a proposed protocol led to the identification of a privileged scaffold that may be used for further rational drug design. In addition, two already effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2, Ruxolitinib and Sorivudine, were also found between the potential active compounds, and therefore this alternative mechanism of action might explain part of their activity. We believe that the contributions made in this research might be useful in future drug design, not only for this particular mechanism of action, but also for any study that aims for PPIs stabilization by small molecules.</p>
