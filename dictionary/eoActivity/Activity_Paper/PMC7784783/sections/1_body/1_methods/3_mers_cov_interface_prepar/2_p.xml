<p>The published MERS-CoV homodimers PDB ID 6KL5 and 6KL6 were rebuilt for the initial analysis. Missing residues were added using 4UD1 as template. The isolated system was named 
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> whereas ligand-bonded dimers were called P1/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> and P3/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> (ligands were named as in the Houâ€™s article (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)).
