<p>In this scheme, interactions are decomposed by specific residue pairs by including only those interactions in which one atom from each of the analyzed residues is participating, following the work of Gohlke et al. (Gohlke et al.,

Further, this decomposition scheme allowed us to assign the percentage of the ligand-dimer interaction to each monomer, and thus ensure that there is a balanced distribution.
