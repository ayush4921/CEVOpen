<p>6-Hydroxyl-7-methoxyl-coumarin (
 <bold>1</bold>), isolated from the 
 <italic>Streblus asper</italic> Lour core material, had significant anti-HBV effect on HepG 2.2.15 cells [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. And the mechanism of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> on anti-HBV effect may be related to its inhibition on secretion of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg), and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> were 29.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (selective index, SI = 6.76) and 46.41 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (SI = 4.31), respectively. Esculetin (
 <bold>2</bold>) from 
 <italic>Microsorium fortunei</italic> (Moore) Ching. could not only inhibit the expression of the HBV antigens and HBV-DNA but also inhibit the expression of hepatitis B virus X(HBx) protein in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] isolated a series of phenylpropanins from the core material, bark and root of 
 <italic>S. asper</italic>, all of which had significant anti-HBV activity. Among them, Magnatriol B (
 <bold>3</bold>) showed moderate anti-HBV activity by inhibiting the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg with low cytotoxicity. Honokiol (
 <bold>4</bold>) showed significant anti-HBV activity and strong inhibition on HBsAg and HBeAg with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (SI = 21.47) and 4.74 
 <italic>μ</italic>M (SI = 14.22), respectively. The inhibition effect of honokiol on HBsAg and HBeAg was stronger than that of positive control, lamivudine. Isomagnolol (
 <bold>5</bold>) and isocarpine (
 <bold>6</bold>) from the bark and roots of 
 <italic>S. asper</italic> showed significant anti-HBV activity by HepG 2.2.15 cell assay and significantly inhibited HBsAg secretion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10.34 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 3.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. For inhibiting the secretion of HBeAg, IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 8.83 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 14.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, without cytotoxicity. Honokiol (
 <bold>7</bold>) and (7′
 <italic>R</italic>, 8′
 <italic>S</italic>, 7′
 <italic>R</italic>, 8′
 <italic>S</italic>)-erythron-Strebluslignanol G (
 <bold>8</bold>), isolated from methanol extract of roots of 
 <italic>S. asper</italic>, have strong anti-HBV activity by inhibiting the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg. In addition, compounds 
 <bold>7</bold>and 
 <bold>8</bold> could significantly inhibit the replication of HBV-DNA, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9.02 and 8.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Coumarin lignan (
 <bold>9</bold>) isolated from the stem of 
 <italic>Kadsura heteroclita</italic> could inhibit the production of HBsAg and HBeAg with concentration of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The inhibition of compound 
 <bold>9</bold> (57% and 48%) was even better than that of positive control, lamivudine (10% and 46%) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Niranthin (
 <bold>10</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic>, could inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in dose-dependent, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 16.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 25.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. The inhibition rates of 
 <bold>10</bold> on HBsAg and HBeAg were 90.4% and 83.1% with 55.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M while the inhibition rates of lamivudine were 55.6% and 44.5% with 43.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. The anti-HBV effect of compound 
 <bold>10</bold> was better than that of lamivudine. The inhibition rates of compound 
 <bold>10</bold> on DHBV-DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg were higher than that of lamivudine, and the recovery rate was smaller after drug withdrawal, indicating that compound 
 <bold>10</bold> had a good prospect in the development of new anti-HBV drugs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. (+)-Dehydrod-iconiferyl alcohol (
 <bold>11</bold>) and dehydrozingerone (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.94 mM (SI 1.06) and 0.50 mM (SI 2.88) [
