<p>3,3′,5-Trihydroxybiphenyl 
 <bold>(127</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>S. chirayita</italic>, showed activity against HBeAg secretion with IC 
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.77 ± 0.076 and 5.92 ± 1.02 mM [

 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>130</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>Tarphochlamys affinis</italic> (Griff.) could inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] isolated 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy acetophenone (PHAP) (
 <bold>131</bold>) from 
 <italic>A. morrisonensis</italic>, which could significantly inhibit the replication of HBV. The mechanism may be that PHAP was involved in regulating the expression of surface protein genes and blocks the release of virus particles by interfering with the signaling pathway of endoplasmic reticulum. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] found that PHAP and derivatives have good anti-HBV activity, and structural modification on p-HAP and its glycoside led to a series of derivatives; among them, 
 <italic>p</italic>-HAP derivative 2f (
 <bold>132</bold>) had the strongest effect on inhibiting the replication HBV-DNA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, SI = 160.3). The primary structure-activity relationships suggested that the conjugated derivatives of 
 <italic>p</italic>-HAP glycoside and substituted cinnamic acids obviously enhanced the activity against HBV-DNA replication. The chemical structures of compounds 
 <bold>121</bold>~132 are shown in
