<p>Li et al. [

 <bold>55</bold> could effectively inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg, as well as the replication of HBV-DNA, due to its aldehyde group [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] isolated a series of heptane terpenoids from the roots and rhizomes of

 <italic>μ</italic>M. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] carried out further research on

 <bold>68-70</bold> had good anti-HBV activity on HepG 2.2.15 cell, and their anti-HBV activity was positively correlated with the degree of polymerization [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the anti-HBV test, Pimelotides A (
 <bold>71</bold>) showed significant inhibition on the secretion of HBsAg, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.016 g/mL and TI up to 355.63. However, the anti-HBV mechanism of compound 
 <bold>71</bold> should be carried out for the further study [
