 <italic>β</italic>-D-xylopyranosyl]-1,8-dihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (
 <bold>29</bold>), and mangiferin (
 <bold>30</bold>) showed remarkable inhibition on HBV-DNA replication with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 0.01 mM to 0.13 mM. Compounds 
 <bold>23</bold>-
 <bold>25</bold> with three or more hydroxy groups showed significant inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.77, &gt;0.98, and 0.21 mM for HBsAg, and &lt;0.62, 0.35, and 0.04 mM for HBeAg, respectively. It was deduced that hydroxy groups in the xanthone structure were essential for maintaining the inhibitory effects on the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg. Glycosidation of hydroxy groups led to activity decreasing against HBsAg and HBeAg by comparing the activity of compounds 
 <bold>24</bold>, 
 <bold>26</bold>, and 
 <bold>27</bold>. It was concluded that two or more hydroxy groups were essential for inhibiting HBV-DNA replication, and methylation of hydroxy groups decreased or abolished anti-HBV activity. In addition, the position of the hydroxy groups of the isolated xanthones did not significantly affect the inhibition on HBV-DNA replication. The preliminary structure-activity relationships were deduced as (1) the anti-HBV activity of xanthones depends on the structure and substitution pattern of the hydroxy groups; (2) the hydroxy groups play very important roles in the anti-HBV activity; (3) the anti-HBV activity will be decreased after methylation orglycosidation [

 <bold>31</bold>), isolated from mangrove-derived aciduric fungus 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp., inhibited HBsAg secretion more effectively than that of the positive control, 3TC, in a dose-dependent manner [

 <bold>32</bold>), norswertianolin (
 <bold>33</bold>), and neolancerin (
 <bold>34</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>S. yunnanensis</italic>, had good anti-HBV effect. Among of them, compound 
 <bold>34</bold> could not only inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.21, 0.10, and 1.51, but also significantly inhibit the replication of HBV-DNA, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.09 mM, &lt;0.01 mM, and 0.05 mM. However, compounds 
 <bold>32</bold> and 
 <bold>33</bold> only showed inhibitory effect on HBV-DNA replication, which may be caused by methylation or glycoylation of the hydroxyl group of the compounds [
