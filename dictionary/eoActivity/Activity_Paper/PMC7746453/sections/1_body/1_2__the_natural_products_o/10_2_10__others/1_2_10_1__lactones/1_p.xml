<p>Two dimers of oxanthrone andiridoid lactone (
 <bold>152, 153</bold>) were isolated from 
 <italic>S. punicea</italic>, which could inhibit the secretion of HBsAg with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.25 and 0.29 mM, and the secretion of HBeAg with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.86 and 0.31 mM. In addition, compounds 
 <bold>152</bold>-
 <bold>153</bold> also could inhibit the replication of HBV-DNA, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.18 and 0.19 mM, respectively [

 <bold>154</bold>), a kind of nor sesquiterpene lactone with unique structure from the fruit of 
 <italic>Illicium henryi</italic>, had high anti-HBV activity and could inhibit the secretion of HBeAg on HepG 2.2.15 cell with IC
 <sub>50</sub>0.079 ± 0.035 mM
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
