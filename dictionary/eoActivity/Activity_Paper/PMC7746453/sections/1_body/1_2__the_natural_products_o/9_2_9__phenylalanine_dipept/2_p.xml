<p>Kuang et al. [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] used the compound MTS as lead compound; a novel MTS derivative was designed and synthesized by introducing the structure unit of veratrol acid; N-[N-(3,4-dimethoxy-benzoyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-
 <italic>O</italic>-propionyl-L-phenylalaninol (
 <bold>134</bold>), N-[N-(3,4-dimethoxy-benzoyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-4-ethoxy-L-phenylalaninol (
 <bold>135</bold>), and N-[N-(3,4-Dimethoxy-benzoyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-L-tyrosinol (
 <bold>136</bold>) were tested the anti-HBV activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. All the compounds have the significant anti-HBV activity. Subsequently, a series of MTS derivatives were designed and synthesized with compound MTS as the lead compound, by introducing fluorine or chlorine substitution, and the obtained MTS derivatives were tested for anti-HBV activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. N-[N-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-L-Phenylalaninol (
 <bold>137</bold>), N-[N-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-
 <italic>O</italic>-propyl-L-tyrosyl]-L-Phenylalaninol (
 <bold>138</bold>), and N-[N-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-
 <italic>O</italic>-isopropyl-L-tyrosyl]-L-Phenylalaninol (
 <bold>139</bold>) showed good anti-HBV activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.61, 10.53, and 6.46 mol/L, respectively [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Cui et al. [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] synthesized 20 MTS derivatives containing trifluoromethyl substitution and tested the anti-HBV activity of the synthesized target compound in HepG 2.2.15 cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Among them, N-[N-(3-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-L-tyrosyl]-L-Phenylalaninol (
 <bold>140</bold>), N-[N-(3-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-
 <italic>O</italic>-propionyl-L-tyrosine methyl ester (
 <bold>141</bold>), and N-[N-(3-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-
 <italic>O</italic>-ethyl-L-tyrosine (
 <bold>142</bold>) showed strong anti-HBV activity, and their IC
 <sub>50</sub> reached 11.74, 8.73, and 11.41 mol·L
