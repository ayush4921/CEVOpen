<p>Jang et al. [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] synthesized twenty novel 
 <italic>n</italic>-methyl derivatives of MTS, among which compounds 8n (
 <bold>143</bold>) and 8o (
 <bold>144</bold>) showed certain anti-HBV activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 52.5 mol·L
 <sup>−1</sup> and 49.2 mol·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Compounds 9 a-c(
 <bold>145-147</bold>) were triantennary cluster galactosides of MTS with potential for hepatic targeting. The anti-HBV activities of those were evaluated in HepG 2.2.15 cells. And all those compounds had inhibitory effect on HBV-DNA replication in HepG2 2.2.15 cells in a dose-response manner [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] evaluated the 20 species of marine natural small molecule compounds by HepG 2.2.15 cell lines; three kinds of compounds cyclic (glycine-L-proline) (
 <bold>148</bold>), cyclic (4-hydroxy proline-phenylalanine) (
 <bold>149</bold>), and cyclic (L-2-hydroxy proline-phenylalanine) (
 <bold>150</bold>) had anti-HBV activity on the inhibition of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV-DNA, with the treatment of index greater than 2. N-acetyl phenylalanine (
 <bold>151</bold>) had certain inhibitory effects on HBsAg and HBeAg with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 55.5, 69.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The chemical structures of compounds 
 <bold>133-151</bold> are shown in
