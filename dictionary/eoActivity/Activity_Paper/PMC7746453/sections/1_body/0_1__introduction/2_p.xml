<p>At present, there are mainly two kinds of drugs used in the clinic, namely, interferons (INFs) with antiviral and immunoregulatory functions and nucleoside analogues that can inhibit the reverse transcription of HBV [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent years, although these drugs have a certain therapeutic effect on HBV infection in the clinic, there are serious side effects and drug resistance [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, there are more and more researchers focus on natural product [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some researches report a variety of natural medicines with novel structure and anti-HBV activity, including some candidate drugs with good anti-HBV effects. However, these reports were mainly involved in isolation and identification of compounds with anti-HBV activity; the mechanisms and targets of compounds were less. The mechanism of clinical medicines (nucleoside analogues and interferon) on anti-HBV is basically clear, but the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants weakens the clinical effects. Thus, the development of safe and effective anti-HBV drugs with novel mechanism is the top priority in the current research [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this manuscript, in order to help researchers understand HBV and develop the anti-HBV drugs, all kinds of natural products (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were summarized. The types of natural products with anti-HBV activity include phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenes, glycosides, and others (such as lactones and organic acids).
