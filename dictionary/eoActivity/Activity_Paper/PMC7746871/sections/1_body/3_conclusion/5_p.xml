<p>During the course of our interviews and quality analyses, some key issues were found in the RA agriculture, processing procedures, and wholesale and retail activities that have largely been overlooked and can reduce the value of the products. Furthermore, we identified the relationship between quality of RA and stakeholder revenues among VCs: these reflected a general trend in the production system. There also seems to be situations in which poor quality and adulteration (intentionally or accidentally) occur due to poor quality control measures in the supply chain.</p>
