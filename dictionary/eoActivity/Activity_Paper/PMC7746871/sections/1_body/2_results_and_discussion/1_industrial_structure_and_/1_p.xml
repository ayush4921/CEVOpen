<p>RA cultivation began in the 1950s and was intended to mitigate the sharp decline in wild populations while meeting the demands of commercial enriches. Later on, RA was artificially cultivated in Gansu, other parts of Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi on a large scale. 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> var. 
 <italic>mongholicus</italic> is the main source of RA, and is cultivated much more than 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic>, providing 80% of the RA medicinal market. Therefore, the present study launched a series of investigations into the production of 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> var. 
 <italic>mongholicus</italic>.
