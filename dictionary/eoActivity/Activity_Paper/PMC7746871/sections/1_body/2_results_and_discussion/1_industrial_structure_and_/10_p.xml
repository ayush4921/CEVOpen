<p>VC 10 is a relatively new model based on e-commerce. Although the sales information accompanying the goods often states that the RA was “collected in the wild,” in fact this is not necessarily true. In the process of VC, the contractor (in the form of a middleman or small-scale medical processing plant) is the main participant. They procure RA with good appearance, process it into pieces or powder, and package it more attractively before selling it on the network platform. In theory, e-commerce should provide higher profit than conventional markets as operating costs are highly reduced; however, the quality control of such products sold via the network platform needs to be greatly improved.</p>
