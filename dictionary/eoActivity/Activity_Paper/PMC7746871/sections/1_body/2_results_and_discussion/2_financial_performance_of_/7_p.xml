<p>Retail is the last stage in the RA value chain shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Here, the resources flow to high-quality hospitals, traditional herbal medicine markets, export markets, and online markets. The price of the RA now ranges from 50 to 330 CNY/kg. Differentiated commodity values are reflected in the different markets, so that the selling price to the export market and high-quality hospitals is more than three times that to other retailers. Studies of the trends in prices show that they are related to the dynamic balance between demand and supply. It is thus thought that as the demand for RA products grows, progressively more and more of the RA will be harvested. Then, the prices (and farmers’ financial gains) will decline.
