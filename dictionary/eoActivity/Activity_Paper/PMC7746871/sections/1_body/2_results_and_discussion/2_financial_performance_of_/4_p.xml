<p>Procurement and wholesale of raw materials are key processes in the VCs. Some VCs use middlemen in these processes but sometimes the functions of such middlemen are omitted or replaced by agricultural cooperatives. At this point, suppliers that are closer to the processing companies and get more information about transactions are more likely to make direct contact with the contractor, without the need for involving middlemen. Procurement costs include procuring and reselling labor, traveling costs, and transportation costs. Middlemen need to invest a part of their original capital in the procurement process, so financial business credit is very important to them. Also, as the product quality of the RA from different sources varies, and considering the ease with which information can be communicated, the pricing structure of the RA is affected by the locality of the cultivation area.</p>
