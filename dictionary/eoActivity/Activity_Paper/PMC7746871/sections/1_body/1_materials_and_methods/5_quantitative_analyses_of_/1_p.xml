<p>Analysis was performed using a Waters C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (solvent A) and water (containing 0.2% methanoic acid, solvent B). Gradient elution was applied as follows: 0–20 min, 80–60% B; 20–30 min, 60% B. The injection volume was 10 μl, and the temperature of the column was maintained at 30°C. Detection was performed at a wavelength of 260 nm. Each sample was assayed in triplicate.</p>
