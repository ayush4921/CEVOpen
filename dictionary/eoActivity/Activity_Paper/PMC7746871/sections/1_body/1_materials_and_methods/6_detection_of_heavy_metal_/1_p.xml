<p>Due to the possibility of heavy metal contamination, it is necessary to determine the contents of harmful substances, thus to ensure the safety of the products. Amount of Pb, Cd, As, Hg, and Cu in RA were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">CPC, 2015</xref>). A Thermo ICE 3000 atomic absorption spectrometer with deuterium background corrector was used in this study. Pb and Cd contents in plant samples were determined by HGA graphite furnace using argon as the inert gas. Cu was assayed out in an air-acetylene flame. Other measurements were based on cyanide complex processing (
