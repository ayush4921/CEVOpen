  <italic>Equisetum myriochaetum</italic> is a semi-aquatic plant found on riverbanks that is commonly used in traditional medicine as a diuretic agent. Additionally, the genus 
  <italic>Equisetum</italic> stands out for its content of the flavonoid kaempferol, a well-known antiproliferative agent. Therefore, in this study, 
  <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> ethanolic extract was tested in vitro against a cervical cancer cell line (SiHa). Additionally, the antioxidative activity was evaluated through a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilhidrazil (DPPH) assay. Finally, a molecular docking analysis of apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin on the active site of β-tubulin was performed to investigate their potential mechanism of action. All fractions of 
  <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> ethanolic extract showed antioxidative activity. Fraction 14 displayed an antiproliferative capacity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) value of 6.78 μg/mL against SiHa cells.
