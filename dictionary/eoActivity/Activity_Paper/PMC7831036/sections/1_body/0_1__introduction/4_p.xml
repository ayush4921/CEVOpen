<p>Cervical cancer, as a gynecological tumor, remains one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments for cervical cancer. Therefore, the main aim in this study was a bio-directed extraction of flavonoids from 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> to evaluate their antioxidant activity. After that, a phytochemical characterization by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (UPLC–MS) was performed to obtain the main secondary metabolites and the antiproliferative activity was analyzed in silico and in vitro against a cervical cancer cell line (SiHa). Finally, molecular docking of the main metabolites on the active site of β-tubulin was used to investigate the potential mechanism of action.
