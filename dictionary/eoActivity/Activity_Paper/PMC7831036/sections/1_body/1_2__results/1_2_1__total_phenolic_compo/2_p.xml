<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> was separated by column chromatography into 16 fractions, which were evaluated for their antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00443-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Fraction 14 presented the highest value equivalent to Trolox (423.16 mM TE/g). For this reason, we chose to analyze its chemical composition by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC).
