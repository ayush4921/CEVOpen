<p>Analysis of the fraction by UPLC–MS allowed for the detection of three phenolic compounds: kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00443-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows a high relative concentration of apigenin but not quercetin or kaempferol. Subsequently, in silico analysis for the prediction of the biological activity of these metabolites (PASS) indicated that they may have an antioxidant and antiproliferative activity (Pa value &gt; 0.7). Commonly, in drug design, a Pa value greater than 0.7 equates to a high prediction of activity. Even tough, some authors indicate that values greater than 0.5 could indicate a good prediction [
