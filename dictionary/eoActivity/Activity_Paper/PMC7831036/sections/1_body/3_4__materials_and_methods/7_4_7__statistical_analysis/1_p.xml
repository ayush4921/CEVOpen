<p>The antioxidative capacity results were expressed as the standard error of the mean in μmol Trolox per grams of extract (TE/g) at each time point on the curve. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test were performed to compare the mean Trolox equivalents between all groups at each time point, the mean Trolox equivalents of each group against the corresponding baseline values, and the Area Under The Curve (AUC) values between groups. 
 <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses used GraphPad Prism software, version 7 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
