 <sup>18</sup> column (1.6 µm, 3.0 × 100 mm); mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid) and B (100% acetonitrile) in gradient run (0.5 min, 10.0% A, 90.0% B; 3.5 min, 50.0% A, 50.0% B; and 6 min, 10.0% A, 90.0% B), total time of execution: 6.0 min; caudal: 0.3 mL/min; injection volume: 2 µL; and column temperature: 40 °C. The identification of the main compounds was performed using a range of phenolic compounds, including kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) [
