<p>The inhibition of the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilhidrazil (DPPH) was calculated using 25 μL of the sample fraction (2 mg/mL) or a standard from a Trolox standard solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, USA), which were mixed with 975 μL of 600 µM DPPH dissolved in methanol (λ = 0.7 at 515 nm). After 30 min in the dark, the absorbance of samples was recorded at 515 nm using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (UV-6000 UV/VIS Spectrophot, Metash; China). The plotting of the absorbance values of the Trolox standard into a concentration curve was used to determine the concentration of the samples as µmol of Trolox per grams of extract (TE/g) [
