<p>Biodirected extraction of the phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> made it possible to isolate a fraction with a high content of equivalent units of Trolox. Additionally, fraction 14 presented antiproliferative activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.78 Î¼g/mL. This fraction presented the secondary metabolites kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin, which may be responsible for its antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. Molecular docking analysis suggested that the mechanism of action of these metabolites is through their preferential binding to the active site of colchicine. This confirms the importance of achieving the identification of the metabolites responsible for biological activity and their potential mechanisms of action, which may allow for the development of new pharmacological agents.
