 <caption>
  <p>Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and core genome analysis of medicinal plant endophytes (ME) belonging to the order Enterobacterales: 
   <bold>(A)</bold>
   <italic>Enterobacter</italic> and 
   <bold>(B)</bold>
   <italic>Serratia</italic>. (A) Core-gene phylogeny of ME belonging to 
   <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species. A 1912 core-gene alignment generated by Roary was used to construct a maximum likelihood tree highlighting the placement of 
   <italic>Enterobacter</italic> endophytes. Isolates ME13 and ME34 placed within the 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic> species clade, whilst ME44 placed within the 
   <italic>E. asburiae</italic> clade. (B) Core-gene phylogeny of ME belonging to 
   <italic>Serratia</italic> species. A 255 core-gene alignment generated by Roary was used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogeny highlighting the placement of isolated 
   <italic>Serratia</italic> endophytic bacteria. ME43 and ME47 were placed within the 
   <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> species clade with &gt;95% ANI to other members of the species. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with GTR model with gamma substitution and supported by 100 bootstraps. Nodes with black circles represent &gt;90% bootstrap support. Scale bar = substitutions per site.
