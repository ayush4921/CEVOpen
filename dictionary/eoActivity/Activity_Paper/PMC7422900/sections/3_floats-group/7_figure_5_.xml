  <p>Core-gene phylogeny of medicinal plant endophytes (ME) belonging to 
   <italic>Aureimonas</italic> species. A 25 core-gene alignment generated by Roary was used to construct a maximum likelihood tree highlighting the placement of 
   <italic>Aureimonas</italic> endophytes. Isolate ME7 was placed as a novel species close to the 
   <italic>A. phyllosphaerae</italic> clade. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with GTR model with gamma substitution and supported by 100 bootstraps. Nodes with black circles represent &gt;90%Â bootstrap support. Scale bar = substitutions per site.
