  <p>Community composition and rarefaction curves for the Western Ghats medicinal plant endophyte (ME) collection isolated during this study. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Composition of the bacterial endophyte collection assigned at the taxonomic genus level based on 16S rRNA genes. Each bar represents the relative distribution of each bacterial genus isolated from different medicinal plant genera. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of ME obtained from each plant genera. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Rarefaction curves for bacterial endophyte 16S rRNA gene diversity. ME were isolated from leaves of plants from the Bisle Ghat and Mangaluru regions of the Western Ghats, India. Curves were plotted for 95% similarity for 16S rRNA genes. Note, since there were only three isolates from Mysore leaf samples, this endophyte collection is not included.
