 <caption>
  <p>Genome sequence taxonomic placement of 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> medicinal plant endophytes (ME) inferred by average nucleotide identity (ANI). Heatmap generated by the PyANI script, indicating the degree of nucleotide-level similarity between 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> species ME and their closest reference strains. ME are highlighted in bold font, whilst species type strains are denoted by 
   <sup>T</sup>. Colour indicates the degree of nucleotide similarity, with red areas indicating &gt;95% ANI, and darker shades of red indicating greater similarity. Blue indicates &lt;95% ANI.
