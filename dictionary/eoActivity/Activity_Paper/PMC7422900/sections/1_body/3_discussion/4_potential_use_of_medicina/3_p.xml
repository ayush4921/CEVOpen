<p>Other BGCs of interest in the remaining isolates with clear antagonism included hybrid NRPS-PKS BGCs in 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. ME47 with no homology to characterised BGCs; and thiopeptide BGCs predicted in 
 <italic>Enterobacter asburiae</italic> ME44, 
 <italic>Serratias</italic> isolates ME43 and ME47. Most characterised thiopeptides display nanomolar potency toward Gram-positive bacteria by blocking protein translation, and the majority of them have been identified from Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Schwalen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, thiopeptides were also identified by genome mining in Proteobacteria (Schwalen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Our study shows the potential of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> and other bacterial endophytes as biological control agents of plant pathogenic bacteria, and that ME isolates could be used to produce peptide-based antimicrobial and/or other compounds for therapeutic use. In addition, this study adds support to the claims and reports that some species of medicinal plants of the Western Ghats possess antimicrobial properties and may explain their ethnomedicinal use.
