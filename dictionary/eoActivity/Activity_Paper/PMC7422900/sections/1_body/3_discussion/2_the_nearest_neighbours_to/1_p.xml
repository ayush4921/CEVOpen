<p>Core-gene analysis demonstrates that the nearest neighbours of all endophytes in this study are not limited to association with plants, but are instead ubiquitous, and able to endure a plethora of environments. This is evidenced in the analysis of 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, where the nearest neighbours to endophytes ME13 and ME34 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), namely 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> 35 669 (Doijad 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), 153_ECLO, 629_ECLO and GN04787 (Matteoli 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), were all isolated from clinical infections (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). In contrast, the nearest neighbours 
 <italic>Enterobacter bugandensis</italic> IF2SW-B1, IF2SW-P2, IF2SW-P3 and IF3SW-P2 were all recently isolated from the International Space Station (Singh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The similarity of the space station isolates to clinical isolate 153 ECLO has been commented upon previously (Singh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and is thus concordant with the analysis in this study. Members of the 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> genus also comprise species that have been reported as plant beneficial organisms and these include, plant-growth promoting endophytes of 
 <italic>Enterobacter asburiae</italic> on date palm (Yaish 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> with citrus and banana plants (Araujo 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Macedo-Raygoza

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. J49, a biofertilizer for peanut and maize (Ludueña 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
