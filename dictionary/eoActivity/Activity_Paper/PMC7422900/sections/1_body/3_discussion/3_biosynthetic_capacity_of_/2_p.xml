<p>The isolation of multiple endophytic bacterial isolates has previously been coupled to phenotypic assays of antimicrobial activity, tandem mass spectrometry analyses and PCR-based detection of conserved PKS and NRPS domains (Passari

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Future work into the identification and isolation of metabolites of the endophyte collection in this study can be guided by the genomic insight into the biosynthetic origins of potential metabolites of these bacteria. Despite the identification of BGCs with high sequence similarity to previously characterised BGCs, most of the 102 biosynthetic gene clusters possessed no homology to published BGCs, and thus represent a novel source of pharmaceutically relevant products.
