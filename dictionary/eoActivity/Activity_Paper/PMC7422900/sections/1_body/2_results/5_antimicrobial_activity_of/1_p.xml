<p>A total of five of the 26 genome-sequenced bacterial endophytes showed antimicrobial activity against the plant pathogen, 
 <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> (Figure S10, Supporting Information for examples). However, no zones of clearing were observed for the pathogens 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> by any ME tested. Isolates with clear antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacterium, 
 <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> were identified as 
 <italic>Bacillus aryabhattai</italic> (ME39), 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. (ME40), 
 <italic>Enterobacter asburiae</italic> (ME44) and 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. (ME43 and ME47). A total of four additional isolates showed weak antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>P. carotovorum</italic>: 
 <italic>Bacillus aryabhattai</italic> (ME42), 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. (ME75), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ME30) and 
 <italic>Klebsiella variicola</italic> (ME73) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Interestingly, several of the ME isolates with antibacterial activity and with predicted BGCs were obtained from medicinal plants used in traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds and/or known to have described antimicrobial activity. For example, 
 <italic>Coscinium fenestratum</italic> (isolates ME43, ME44 and ME47) and 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic> species (isolates ME30 and ME40) plant extracts have shown activity against
