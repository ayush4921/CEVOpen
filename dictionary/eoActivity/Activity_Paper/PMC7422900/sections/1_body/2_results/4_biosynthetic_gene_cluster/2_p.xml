<p>Only four hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthases (NRPS-PKS) were predicted, one of the hybrid BGCs from 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> sp. ME86 possessed similarity to the yersiniabactin BGC, while the remaining three of these represented uncharacterised BGCs. Additional known BGCs identified in the endophyte genomes included the lassopeptide genes responsible for lichenicidin synthesis in 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. ME35, and the NRPS required for acinetobactin synthesis in 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. ME27. The majority of endophyte derived BGCs lacked homology to known specialised metabolite BGCs using the MiBIG database (Medema
