<p>Core-gene phylogenetic analyses for endophytes that did not belonging to genera of interest can be found in Figures S4–S9 (Supporting Information). In addition, since only a limited number of genomes are available for the Actinobacteria genus, 
 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> full-length 16S rRNA gene phylogenies were constructed instead (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that endophyte ME12 (from 
 <italic>Terminalia paniculate</italic>) was closely related (99% sequence similarity) to the plant pathogen 
 <italic>Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens</italic> strains and that isolate ME26 from 
 <italic>Ventilago</italic> sp. was related (99% sequence similarity) to novel endophytic 
 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> sp. WXGSY8 from sugarcane and 
 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> sp. ER1/6 from 
 <italic>Citreus sinensis</italic> (sweet orange), a potential biocontrol strain (Garrido 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> as endophytes from asymptomatic citrus plants infested with the pathogen 
 <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> indicated that endophytic 
 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> species may help to resist infection (Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero
