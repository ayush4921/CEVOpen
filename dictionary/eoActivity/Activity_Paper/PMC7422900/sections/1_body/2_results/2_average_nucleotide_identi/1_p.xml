<p>Few endophytes have been genome sequenced as part of their collection and initial characterisation. A total of 26 selected medical plant endophytes were genome sequenced to increase the level to which they could be identified and characterised. The genus-level diversity of the genome sequenced endophytes as determined by genomic ANI and dDDH analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were as follows: 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9), 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), 
 <italic>Curtobacterium</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), Serratia (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), 
 <italic>Aureimonas</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), 
 <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1). A summary of the genome assembly metrics is given in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Overall identification at the genus-level by genome analysis was in agreement with classification by 16S rRNA gene identification (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figures S4–S9, Supporting Information) with the exception of isolate ME81 which was identified initially by 16S rRNA gene analysis as 
 <italic>Erwinia</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>) but subsequently classified by both genome analysis methods as 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure S7, Supporting Information).
