<p>The species-level identity provided was consistent between ANI and dDDH for all isolates, excluding five 
 <italic>Bacilli</italic>. A total of two 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> isolates, ME5 and ME78, were identified as 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (98.8%) by ANI but were identified as 
 <italic>Bacillus paranthracis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> respectively by dDDH using TYGS. The remaining isolates, ME40, ME75 and ME76 could not be assigned a species-level identity by TYGS, but were identified as 
 <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> (ME40, 95.8% identity), and 
 <italic>Bacillus aryabhattai</italic> (ME75 and ME76, 96.3% identity) respectively by ANI. A heatmap providing a visual representation of the full diversity of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> endophytes by ANI is shown in Fig.Â
