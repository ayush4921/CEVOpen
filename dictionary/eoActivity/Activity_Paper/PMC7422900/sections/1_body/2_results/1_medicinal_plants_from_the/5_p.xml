<p>Multiple ME isolates were taxonomically related (based on 16S rRNA gene similarity) to previously known endophytes or bacteria isolated from soil and rhizosphere environments (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). For example, the large collection of ME 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> (19 isolates) are closely related (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>) to endophytes from tomato, switchgrass, banana, jujube, cotton and rice paddy soils, and were isolated from a range of medicinal plants which include

 <italic>Terminalia paniculata</italic>, 
 <italic>Garcinia xanthochymus</italic>, 
 <italic>Alstonia scholaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Barringtonia acutangular</italic> sampled from both the Bisle Ghat and Mangalaru locations. Similarly, the 21 ME isolates belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> (12 different plant species and 3 locations) are related to endophytes from pine trees, sugar cane, legumes as well as insect guts (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Many of these 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> isolates (ten isolates) were closely related to soil-borne bacteria within the
