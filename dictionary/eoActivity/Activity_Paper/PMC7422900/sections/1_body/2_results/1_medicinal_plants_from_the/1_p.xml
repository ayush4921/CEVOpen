<p>A total of 26 different medicinal plant samples (Table S1 and Figure S1a, Supporting Information) were taken from two sites in the Western Ghats and one site in Mysore, India. This represented one of the largest surveys of bacterial endophytes in Indian plants used for multiple medicinal purposes (Table S1, Supporting Information). The incubation of inoculated leaf tissue samples on LB agar readily enabled the growth of culturable endophytes from medicinal plants (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). During incubation, visible colonies were easily distinguishable on the edges of the leaf sections. After further subculture and incubation, 95 plant endophyte cultures were collected. These cultures were then further purified on TSA/R2A and checked for purity using 16S rRNA gene sequencing which resulted in 75 pure cultures of medicinal plant endophytes (designated as ME isolates). The assembled pure bacterial collection included 50 ME Gram-negative and 25 ME Gram-positive bacterial isolates (Table
