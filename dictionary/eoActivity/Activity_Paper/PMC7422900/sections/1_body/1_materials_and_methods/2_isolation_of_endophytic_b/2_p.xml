<p>For molecular characterisation analysis, bacterial isolates were revived on TSA (Tryptone Soy agar; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) plates at 30°C, sub-cultured three times and checked for purity, except isolates ME7 and ME8 which grew better on Reasoner's 2A agar (R2A agar, Oxoid). Pure cultures were stored at −80°C in 8% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tryptone soya broth (TSB) or R2A.</p>
