<p>Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from isolates of interest (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26), identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, from a 3 mL overnight culture grown in TSB or R2A at 30°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm using ALC PK120 Centrifuge for 10 min, resuspended in 4M guanidinium Isothiocyanate and DNA extracted using an automated Maxwell® 16 Instrument with Tissue DNA Purification Kits (Promega UK Ltd, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer, and libraries prepared for 250 bp nucleotide paired-end sequencing using the NEBNext® Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. Genome libraries were then sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq platform.
