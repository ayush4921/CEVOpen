<p>However, whilst nearly all plants are thought to contain endophytes, very little is known about the diversity of endophytes in traditional Indian medicinal plant species. India is considered to be one of the 16 mega diversity countries in the world with around 17 500 higher plants species, of which 4050 plants are found in the Western Ghats (Pascal, Ramesh and De Franceschi

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In this study we aimed to determine the culturable diversity of bacterial endophytes present within a large collection of plant species taken from the Western Ghats region. Plants were chosen based on their ethnobotanical usage, being endemic to the region or were found growing within biodiversity rich areas (Strobel and Daisy 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Endophytes were then isolated from the leaves (the main plant part of medicinal value) from 24 plant species, initially identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis, and then followed up with whole genome sequencing for finer resolution of their taxonomy. Selected endophytes were also investigated further for their specialised metabolite potential via a genome mining and antimicrobial bioactivity analysis.
