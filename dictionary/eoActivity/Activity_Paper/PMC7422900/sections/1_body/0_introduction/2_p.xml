<p>Endophytic microorganisms (endophytes) are bacteria or fungi that colonise the intercellular and/or intracellular spaces of plants, often living in a symbiotic relationship (Hardoim

It is thought for this reason many endophytes produce a range of unique specialised metabolites, such as peptides, polyketides and alkaloids, to aid the plants immune response and prevent colonisation by pathogens and other microbes. Natural products from endophytes frequently possess bioactivities such as antimicrobial, antifungal, anticarcinogen, immunosuppressant and antioxidant (Zhang, Song and Tan
