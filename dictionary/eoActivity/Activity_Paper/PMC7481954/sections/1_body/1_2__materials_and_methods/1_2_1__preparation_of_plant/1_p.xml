 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> was collected in July 2017 from Rabat-Zaer region in Morocco. The rootstock and leaves were cleaned and were then used for further investigation. Plant material (100 g) was extracted with water using the decoction method for 1 h. The obtained extracts were then filtered on Whatman paper, and the filtrate obtained was evaporated under reduced pressure, using a rotary evaporator.
