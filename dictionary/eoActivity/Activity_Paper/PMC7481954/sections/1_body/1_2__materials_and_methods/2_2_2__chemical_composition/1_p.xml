<p>Chemical composition was determined using HPLC-DAD/TOFMS analysis of phenolic profiling according to the previous work done by Marmouzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with some modifications. In brief, an Agilent 1100 model series of liquid chromatography apparatus (HPLC, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) was consisting of binary pump (G1312-A) and autosampler (G1330-B) and equipped to diode-array detector (G1315-B). The system was coupled to a time-of-flight (TOF) and a mass spectroscopic detector (MS) equipped with an electrospray ionizer source (ESI) (Micromass Quattro Micro, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The operational conditions were as follows: negative mode; range 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 50–1200; nitrogen was used as desolvation and cone gas; cone gas flow rate at 30.0 L/h; desolvation gas flow rate at 350 L/h; cone voltage, 20 V; capillary voltage, 3.0 kV; extractor, 2 V; desolvation temperature 350°C; and source temperature 100°C. The phenolic separation was achieved on a C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm × 1.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, Eclipse, XDB/Agilent Zorbax) at a temperature set at 35°C. The mobile phase composed of A (0.1% acetic acid in pure water) and B (0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile) under a gradient elution (v/v) as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 0–18 min, 10–70% B; 18–20 min, 70–100% B; 20–23 min, 100–100% B; 20–23 min, 100–100% B; 23–25 min, 100–10% B; 25–30 min, 10–10% B at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L was injected. The identification of phenolic compounds was performed by comparing their mass spectra fragmentation and retention times with those of pure standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France), while the calibration curves were applied for their quantification. Each polyphenolic extract sample was dissolved in pure water; 10 mg of each extract was dissolved in water (10 mL) and then mixed by vortex and sonicated for 10 min; then, 1 mL was filtered at a syringe filter (PVDF, 0.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) before the HPLC-DAD/TOFMS analysis.
