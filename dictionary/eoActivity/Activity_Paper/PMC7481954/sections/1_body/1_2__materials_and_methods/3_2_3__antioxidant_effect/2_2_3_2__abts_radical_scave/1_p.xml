<p>The ABTS radical scavenging activity of the plant extracts was estimated using the previously described method [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The radical cation ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> was produced through the reaction between 2 mM ABTS and 70 mM potassium persulfate in water. The mixture was stored at room temperature in the dark for 24 h prior use. The ABTS solution was then diluted with methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of appropriately diluted extracts was added to 2 mL of ABTS solution, and the absorbance was recorded at 734 nm after 1 min incubation at room temperature. Trolox was used as inhibitor standard. ABTS radical scavenging activity was calculated as described in equation (
