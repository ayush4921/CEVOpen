<p>Radical scavenging activity of the extracts was measured using the stable-free radical DPPH [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In brief, the solution of DPPH (0.2 mM) was prepared in methanol, and 0.5 mL of this solution was added to 2.5 mL of the extract and was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was then read at 517 nm. Trolox was used as reference compound. The radical scavenging activity (RSA) was calculated using the following equation:
