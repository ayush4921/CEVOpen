<p>Recourse to the use of medicinal plants in the treatment of diseases has been common since antiquity [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The low risk of side effects allows them to be considered a good alternative to synthesized products [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nowadays, the prevalence of diabetes is constantly increasing; it is a chronic disease characterized by a deficiency of endogenous insulin secretion by pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells and/or an altered action of this hormone [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, the treatment of diabetes has attracted great interest whether in traditional medicine or scientific research. Indeed, several species of medicinal plants are scientifically evaluated and traditionally used for this purpose [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The antidiabetic properties of these plants are attributed to the presence of certain chemical compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, this activity may depend on several mechanisms aimed at stimulating the secretion of insulin by 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells, the reduction of insulin resistance, the prevention against oxidative stress, and the inhibition of sugar digestive enzymes especially 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase [
