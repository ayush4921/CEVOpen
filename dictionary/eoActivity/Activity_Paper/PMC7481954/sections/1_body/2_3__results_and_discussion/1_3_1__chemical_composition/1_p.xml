<p>The phenolic chemical compounds of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> extracts were determined by HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis. The results obtained are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As listed, thirty-two phenolic components were identified and quantified. The quantification analysis revealed important variabilities between FVLE and FVRE for all measured compounds (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Caffeic acid, quinic acid, and chlorogenic acid were the major phenolic compounds of FVLE by a percentage rate of 509203 ± 254.60, 14945.61 ± 747.28, and 13810 ± 690.53 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mg extract, respectively. Moreover, the main compound of FVRE was quinic acid (29416.42 ± 1470.82 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mg extract). Citric acid, kaempferol, and rutin were much more abundant in FVLE at concentrations of 1580.49 ± 79.02, 1208.51 ± 60.43, and 361.66 ± 18.08 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mg extract, respectively. Moreover, malic acid was more elevated in FVRE extract (4273.43 ± 213.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mg extract) compared with FVLE extracts (3240.98 ± 162.05 (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mg extract). The variability between phenolic compounds in FVLE and FVRE is attributed to the difference between organs and tissue in a plant to synthesize secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds. Indeed, the anabolism of phenolic compounds in medicinal plants is depending on tissue specific regulation. This control is mediated by epigenetic factors, in particular DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin compaction [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous works showed that 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> is rich in bioactive compounds including phenolic components [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The phenolic composition of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> is not exactly similar to those found in the literature. Indeed, Méabed et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that the predominant phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> aqueous extracts are ferulic acid, hesperidin, and chlorogenic acid. Moreover, acetone extract of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> showed the presence of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acid as main components [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. De Marino et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have isolated three phenolic glycosides compounds (one benzoisofuranone and two diglucoside stilbene trimers) from 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic>. This difference may be due to the geographical origins of the plant, environmental stimulus, climatic conditions, and extraction methods, which affect the yield of secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the contrary, Yaldiz and Camlica [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have studied the variation in phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and volatile compounds of fruit extracts of different fennel genotypes. They showed a remarkable variability which explains that genotype has an important role in synthesis and secretion of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants.
