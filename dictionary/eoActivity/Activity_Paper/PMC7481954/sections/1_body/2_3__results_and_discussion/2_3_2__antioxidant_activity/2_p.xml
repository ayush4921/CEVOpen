<p>The DPPH test is often used for the results rapidity as it is used for the screening of molecules with antioxidant activity present in plant extracts. The DPPH is a stable-free radical with a dark purple color; when a DPPH solution is mixed with a substance that can give a hydrogen atom, the color of the reaction mixture changes from purple to yellow with decreasing absorbance at wavelength 517 nm. The DPPH radical scavenging effect of the extracts is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The results reveal that the extracts tested have a dose-dependent activity. In fact, at the concentration of 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, the aqueous extracts tested reduce the DPPH radical with an important percentage of 90.94 ± 0.09% and 53.60 ± 1.44% for FVLE and FVRE, respectively. Additionally, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is inversely proportional to the antioxidant capacity of a compound. However, the lowest value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> indicates a strong antioxidant capacity of a compound. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results showed that FVLE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.16 ± 0.02 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) had better antioxidant activity than that of FVRE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.36 ± 0.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) against the radical DPPH. However, they showed a relatively lower effect than that of Trolox (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.47 ± 0.02 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). This antioxidant power of the aqueous extracts is explained by the presence of phenolic compounds including flavonoids present in the two parts studied and which are known as antioxidant substances with the ability to trap radical species and reactive forms of oxygen.
