<p>The difference between FVLE and FVRE in the antioxidant effect could be attributed to the variation in the chemical composition. Indeed, several types of bioactive compounds known for their antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are identified in FVLE with high levels compared to FVRE, including flavonoids (rutin, quercitrin, and kaempferol) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted regarding the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> rootstock extracts. However, several studies have investigated the antioxidant activity of other parts of this plant, especially the seeds [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. According to a study performed in Italy, the wild 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> seeds 
 <italic>n</italic>-Hexane extracts showed an important radical scavenging activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 31 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, Anwar et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] showed that the essential oil, ethanol, and methanol extracts of fennel seeds have excellent radical scavenging activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32.32, 23.61, and 26.75 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Also, the ethanolic and aqueous seed extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> evaluated by different antioxidant assays presented important antiradical effects [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results of this study suggest the therapeutic interest of this plant and justify the use of its aqueous extract in traditional Moroccan medicine.
