<p>According to the results found, the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> demonstrate an inhibitory capacity against two enzymes involved in sugar digestion and, consequently, a capacity to decrease the postprandial hyperglycemia and to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This confirms that the compounds responsible for the antidiabetic activity of fennel are extractable in water, which explains the use of this herb to treat diabetes in folk medicine. In fact, as mentioned above, several phytochemicals were identified in the extracts studied with different concentrations, especially phenolic acids (quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These compounds have been shown to possess antidiabetic activity attributed to several mechanisms. Effectively, Ooi et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] have reported that 3,4-di-O-caffeoyl quinic acid has an inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. Chlorogenic acid can inhibit the activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and decrease postprandial glucose [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] by reducing glucose transport in a synergistic way [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. With regard to caffeic acid, it has been able to reduce hyperglycemia and prevent certain complications related to diabetes [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that caffeic acid derivatives could inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme related to T2DM [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Overall, phenolic compounds have an inhibitory effect on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes by their protein binding property [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. According to Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the antidiabetic power of caffeic acid has been attributed to major mechanisms such as stimulation of insulin production and glucose uptake by adipocytes, reduction of hepatic glucose level, and promotion of antioxidant potential. However, herbal medicine depends on the therapeutic effect of the combination of several compounds that act most often synergistically. It can be deduced that the bioactive compounds of fennel extracts can exert their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic and antioxidant activities in synergy.
