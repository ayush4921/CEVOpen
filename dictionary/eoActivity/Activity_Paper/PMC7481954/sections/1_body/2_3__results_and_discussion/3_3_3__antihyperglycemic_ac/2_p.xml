<p>To determine the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic activity of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> leaves and rootstocks, we tested their inhibitory properties against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. Indeed, the inhibitory activity of the extracts on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase has been evaluated at different concentrations and the results are expressed as percentage inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Both extracts showed 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory effect depending on the concentration (140 to 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of FVRE was more remarkable (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 165.90 ± 1.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) than that of FVLE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 203.80 ± 1.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, the extracts showed a dose-dependent inhibitory capacity on the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Also, FVRE exhibited an inhibitory effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 194.30 ± 4.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) greater than that of FVLE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1026.50 ± 6.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and is significantly more potent (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than the reference drug acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 311.20 ± 1.38 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The differences between FVLE and FVRE in the enzymes inhibitory action can be attributed to the variations in the percentage of inhibition with respect to the chemical composition of the plant parts as well as the enzymatic sensitivity.
