<p>The present data are consistent with two recent studies evaluating the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic activity of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Indeed, Abu-Zaiton et al. [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] found that the aerial parts of this plant had an inhibitory activity of 82.26% and 82.43% on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, respectively, and the same results were noted for the seeds of three different extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
