<p>On the contrary, several studies have been conducted to evaluate antidiabetic effect of fennel in animal models. Indeed, the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> seeds showed correction of hyperglycemia, increased insulin, and improved lipid profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The essential oils of this plant have also shown a significant hypoglycemic effect in diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Interestingly, extracts from other parts of this plant have also been investigated. Indeed, fruits [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], leaves [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and aerial parts [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] were able to decrease blood glucose levels in diabetic rats and restore other parameters. All these data can explain the use of this herb to treat diabetes in folk medicine. The present study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of aqueous extracts prepared from 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> leaves and rootstocks on the activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. To our knowledge, it should be noted that the inhibitory power of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> rootstocks was studied for the first time.
