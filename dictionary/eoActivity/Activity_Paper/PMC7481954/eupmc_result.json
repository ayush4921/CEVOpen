    "<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan folk medicine to treat several diseases such as diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic bioactive compounds and to evaluate the antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities of <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> leaf and rootstock extracts. Phenolic compounds of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf extracts were determined using HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS<sup>•+</sup>) radicals. Moreover, the <i>in vitro</i> antihyperglycemic effects were tested by measuring the inhibition of <i>α</i>-amylase and <i>α</i>-glucosidase activities. HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis identified thirty-two phenolic components in both leaf and rootstock extracts. Caffeic acid, quinic acid, and chlorogenic acid were the major compounds of <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract (FVLE), while the main compound of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extracts (FVRE) was quinic acid. In the DPPH assay, <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract showed important antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.16 ± 0.02 <i>μ</i>g/mL) than <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extract (IC<sub>50</sub> = 34.36 ± 0.09 <i>μ</i>g/mL). Moreover, fennel leaf extracts revealed also the most powerful antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 22.95 ± 0.4 <i>μ</i>g/mL) in the ABTS assay. The <i>in vitro</i> antihyperglycemic activity showed that <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock extract exhibited a remarkable inhibitory capacity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 194.30 ± 4.8 <i>μ</i>g/mL) of <i>α</i>-amylase compared with <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extract (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1026.50 ± 6.5 <i>μ</i>g/mL). Furthermore, the inhibition of <i>α</i>-glucosidase was more importantly with <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock (IC<sub>50</sub> of 165.90 ± 1.2 <i>μ</i>g/mL) than <i>F. vulgare</i> leaf extracts (203.80 ± 1.3 <i>μ</i>g/mL). The funding of this study showed that <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf extracts presented several phenolic compounds and showed important antioxidant and antidiabetic effects. We suggest that the identified molecules are responsible for the obtained activities. However, further studies focusing on the isolation and the determination of antioxidant and antidiabetic effects of <i>F. vulgare</i> rootstock and leaf main compounds are required."
