<p id="p0080">Body immune system is a complex network of cells and chemical compounds that help the body to show defense against infections. Foods contain a wide range of immune supportive nutrients, so that our body is able to fight against invading pathogens, including virus, bacteria, and toxins (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Firstly, the food sources like carrots, sweet potato, oily fish, papaya, cheese, egg yolks, tofu, seeds, nuts, legumes, and whole grains contain vitamin-A, which is considered as body's first line of defense to identify pathogens by supporting T-cells. Vitamin-A maintains the structure of cells in skin, gut, and respiratory tract (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Clare-collins, 2020</xref>). Evidence showed that supplements containing vitamin-A offer protection against life threatening infections like HIV, malaria, and lung diseases (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Villamor et al., 2002</xref>). Once the body recognizes a pathogen, vitamin B in particular, B
 <sub>6</sub>, B
 <sub>9</sub> and B
 <sub>12</sub> play the body's first response by influencing the production and activity of NK cells that lead to apoptosis. Meat, fish, shellfish, milk, sesame seeds, soya beans, cheese, eggs, yeast extract, and some fruit and vegetables such as green pepper, banana, and avocado are common sources of vitamin-B-complex (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Clare-collins, 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Keil et al. (2016)</xref> reported that vitamin B
 <sub>2</sub> and UV light significantly reduced the titer of MERS-CoV in human plasma. Furthermore, vitamin-C is considered as the most popular supplement to shield against infection due to its valuable role in the immune system (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Clare-collins, 2020</xref>). Previous report suggested that vitamin-C plays an important role in immune functions to protect from infection caused by CoVs (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hemila, 2003</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Atherton et al. (1978)</xref> reported that vitamin–C increased the resistance against avian coronavirus in chick embryo tracheal organ cultures. Previously conducted three human controlled trials explored that vitamin-C supplements can significantly lower the incidence of pneumonia, which suggested that vitamin-C might prevent the susceptibility of lower respiratory tract infections in certain conditions (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Hemila, 1997</xref>). It was reported that COVID-19 caused lower respiratory tract infection, so vitamin C might be a fruitful choice to support corona affected patients. Citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables, papaya, blackcurrants, tomatoes, and peppers are some common sources of this vitamin (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">British Nutrition Foundation, 2020</xref>). Another vitamin, vitamin-D, is also essential to our health and proper functioning of immune systems. It increases the effectiveness of monocytes and macrophages to fight against pathogens. Research findings concluded that people having low levels of vitamin-D might have the great chance to be affected by upper respiratory tract infections, including influenza and allergic asthma (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Prietl et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a previous report found that calves with low levels of vitamin-D caused the infection of bovine coronavirus (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Nonnecke et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, vitamin-D could be an important immune-boosting nutrient to prevent corona symptoms.
