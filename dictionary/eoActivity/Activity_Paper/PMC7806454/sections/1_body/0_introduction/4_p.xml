<p id="p0020">From ancient times, various parts of plants and their active constituents have widely been considered as a rich reservoir and used as a conventional curative agent for many chronic infections, including viral diseases (

In the modern era, researchers across the world are endlessly trying to establish various types of foods and traditional medicines that are required for improving health, which indicate the potentiality of foods as supplementary therapies (

 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2020</xref>). In this review, we mainly focused on available traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species) that have antiviral as well as immune-stimulating properties and are biologically active against several health complications caused by viral respiratory tract infections. Our findings suggested that foods having antiviral and immune-boosting properties perhaps assist persons to overcome the viral infections by: (i) boosting up the immune system, (ii) accelerating antiviral effectiveness against the infection, and (iii) decreasing other complications associated with respiratory systems. Furthermore, the present review will offer a direction regarding the roles of traditional foods and their constituents to maintain people's general health by taking these foods in their regular diet.
