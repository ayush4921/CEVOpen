<p id="p0045">Licorice root (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>), also known as Josthimodhu in Bengali, Mulethi in Hindi and “gancao” (meaning-sweet grass) in China, has been used as a traditional Chinese remedy since ancient times. Licorice was native to Southern Asia and then it spread to the Middle East and Southern Europe before spreading throughout the continent. Licorice root is considered as a life-enhancing agent and many studies have shown that this root possesses many pharmacological activities such as antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor. Many people just chew it and make tea with it to get various remedies. Sometimes, the combination of licorice root and ginger is widely used to treat respiratory and digestive disorder as folkloric medicine. Licorice root contains more than 20 triterpenes and nearly 300 flavonoids. Among them, glycyrrhizin (GL) and 18
 <italic>β</italic>-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) are showing antiviral properties (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies highlighted that GL exhibited potent antiviral effects against SARS-Cov-2 related viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, that is why it had been suggested to treat SARS as an alternative option at that time (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adianti et al. (2014)</xref> reported that licorice root containing GL can play a vital role in treating patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C by inhibiting HCV full length viral particles and their core gene expression. Moreover, previous studies have revealed that viral infection caused by HIV can be prevented by GL treatment (
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Zhang׳s and Smirnov׳s study explained that GL can be considered as a promising antiviral agent for the treatment of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and influenza virus, respectively, where GL significantly reduces the expression of nuclear factor–
 <italic>κ</italic>B, interleukin-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and interleukin-6 cytokines for CVB3-induced myocarditis and inhibits polymerase activity of influenza virus (

 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Soufy et al. (2012)</xref> proposed that GL exhibited strong immune-stimulant properties by activating T lymphocyte proliferation against duck hepatitis virus (DHV). GL was also active against enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Laconi et al., 2014</xref>).Several studies showed that the GL was also active to inhibit rotavirus replication and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) activity by the mode of internalization, stimulating interferon (IFN) secretion, and preventing viral attachment (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, the antiviral potentiality of the licorice root that shared a similar antiviral mechanism of much possible COVID-19 therapeutics might be an important candidate against coronavirus.
