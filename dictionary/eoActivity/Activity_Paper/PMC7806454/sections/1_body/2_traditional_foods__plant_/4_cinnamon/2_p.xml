<p id="p0040">Cinnamon is a very common culinary item, which has been used as a spice as well as home remedy in several cultures for centuries. 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum and C. cassia</italic> are two herbs of this genus. Bark is the only part that is used as spice or medical purposes. Cinnamon bark contains cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin, and eugenol as the major components (

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Premanathan et al. (2000)</xref> reported that cinnamon bark was highly effective against HIV-1 and HIV-2, where they halt viral DNA replication machinery through the inhibition of HIV protease, integrase, and reverse transcriptase. They also inhibited vpr, sp1-related genes expression (cell cycle arrest), Tat, Rev, and glycosylation. Cinnamaldehyde derived from bark of cinnamon exhibited both 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> inhibitory effects against highly pathogenic influenza, Sendai virus, and HSV-1 virus by inhibiting viral protein synthesis at the post-transcriptional level (

Coumarin compounds (eleutheroside B1, and thiazolyl-coumarin hybrids) showed anti-influenza activity by inhibiting the expression of chemokine genes, POLR2A gene and gene for nucleoprotein, which control viral replication by preventing the expression of viral polymerase and viral envelope protein neuraminidase (

Cinammon also showed significant antiviral activities against the Dengue and chikungunya viral infections, where 4-thiazolidinone-coumarin derivatives potentially inhibited viral protease activity and a phytoalexin (hydroxylated derivative of coumarin) led to suppression of dengue virus replication by preventing the translocation high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein in nucleus (

Besides, a newly synthesized coumarin derivative, 7-[6-(2-methylimidazole) hexyloxy] coumarin, exhibited antiviral activity by inhibiting the entry of virus into the host cell by damaging glycoprotein. In addition, it also down-regulated the virus-induced autophagy by regulating Akt-mTOR pathway, thereby exhibited anti-viral activity (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the active constituents of cinnamon might be potential weapons for introducing as therapeutic antiviral molecules, especially anti-SARSCoV-2, where they shared the common mechanism against RNA viruses like coronavirus.
