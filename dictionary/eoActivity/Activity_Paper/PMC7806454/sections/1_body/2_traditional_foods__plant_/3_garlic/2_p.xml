 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (
 <italic>A. sativum</italic>) L. (Garlic) has a long history to be used as prophylactic as well as therapeutic and dietary plant in different cultures. In addition to other beneficial effects, antiviral activity of garlic is widely documented. Therefore, garlic has widespread usages as antiviral supplements in different parts of the world. Garlic is the main source of organosulfur compounds, especially allicin, diallyltrisulfide, and ajoene, which impart antiviral property and boost immunity (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Schandalik et al., 1992</xref>). Such organosulfur compounds can prevent host cell attachment of virus, change transcription and translation of viral genome in host cells and also affect viral assembly. Another organosulfur compound, e.g. quercetin, can inhibit viral multiplication by passing through the cell membrane (

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al. (2009)</xref> reported that garlic has potent activity against influenza virus. Previous studies revealed that garlic extracts showed antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus (
