<p>If intervention is withheld, malaria typically reduces body weight [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], temperature [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and PCV [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An effective medicinal extract is, therefore, expected to lessen or prevent these reductions. This study has indicated that the hydroalcoholic extract of the plant was not able to prevent the drop of PCV. The failure of the extract to prevent PCV reduction could probably be associated with the hemolytic effect of saponin contained in the extract [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
