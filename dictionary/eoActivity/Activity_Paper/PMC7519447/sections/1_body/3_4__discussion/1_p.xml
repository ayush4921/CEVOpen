<p>The toxicity of several medicinal plants have been well documented [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hence, the safety status of all potential medicinal plants has to be investigated before further exploration. Based on the OECD guideline 425 [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] of acute toxicity studies, the LD50 was found to be &gt; 2000 mg/kg. Since the LD50 of the plant's hydroalcoholic extract was found to be more than three times the minimum effective dose (200 mg/kg), it was taken as a good candidate for further studies [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
