<p>The third model, the prophylactic test, was conducted to see if the extract can prevent parasitemia proliferation. In this test, the extract was able to hinder the growth of parasitemia at all the doses used. The degree of the suppression was, however, smaller than seen in the two previous models. This effect may have been related with the fact that the extract is administered prior to infection establishment and hence may have been rapidly metabolized and/or excreted [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The extract, in spite of the parasitemia suppression, was not able to prolong the survival time compared to controls which points out that the degree of suppression was not large enough to maintain the overall well-being of the rodents.
