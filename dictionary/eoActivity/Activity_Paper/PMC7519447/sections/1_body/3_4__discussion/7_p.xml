<p>Without intervention, there is, unlike in humans, a continual reduction in temperature due to malaria in rodents [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The plant, at higher doses, prevented temperature reduction in both suppressive and Rane's test models. It did not, however, have an effect during the preventive model which might be associated with the lower parasitemia suppression seen in this model. Similar study results, in which plants have similar degree of suppression but failed to prevent temperature reduction, were reported in other studies [
