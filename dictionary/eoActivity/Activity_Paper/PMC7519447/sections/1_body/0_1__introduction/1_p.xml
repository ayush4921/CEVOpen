<p>Malaria is one of the major global health problems, and despite headways, it still remains one of the deadly diseases [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to resistance of malaria parasites against the well-known available drugs, the chemotherapy of malaria has become more complex and challenging [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to the clinically approved drugs, different plants are traditional used to prevent, cure, and/or alleviate symptoms of malaria. Among these plants is 
 <italic>Leonotis ocymifolia</italic>, locally called “Raskmir,” which has several ethnobotanical uses, including malaria [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], abdominal pain [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] headache [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], hypertension and asthma [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], diabetes, eczema, and purgative, [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], anthrax and wound [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, various pharmacological investigations have also indicated the plant to have antiplasmodial [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], trypanocidal, antifertility and anti-implantation activities [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated the plant to have a potential antiplasmodial effect [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it has not been as yet investigated 
 <italic>in vivo.</italic> Hence, in this study, the antimalarial effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of the plant was investigated in an effort to contribute to the discovery of new drugs with high activity and low toxicity.
