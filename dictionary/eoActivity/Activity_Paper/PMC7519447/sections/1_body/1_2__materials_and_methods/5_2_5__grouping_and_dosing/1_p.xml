<p>In the four-day suppressive test, 48 mice were randomly divided into six groups of eight mice per group and were categorized as follows: the first group (Group I) was designated as negative control and administered 10 mL/kg of 2% Tween 80 in water. The second, third, fourth, and fifth groups (Group II–V) were orally treated with 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg, respectively. One group (Group VI) was assigned as positive control and treated with chloroquine 25 mg/kg. The same grouping was used in Rane's test and the prophylactic test except that the lowest dose (100 mg/kg) was dropped after the four-day suppressive test as it was not having significant effect. In all models, the extract was dissolved in a mixture of distilled water and Tween 80. After fully dissolving it, it was given to the animals based on their weight. The treatment, which was carried out once every 24 hours (at the same time in each day), was conducted by oral means of administration using oral gavage.</p>
