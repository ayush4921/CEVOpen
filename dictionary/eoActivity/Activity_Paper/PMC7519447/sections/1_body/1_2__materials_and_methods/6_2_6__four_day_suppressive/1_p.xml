After Two-hour postinfection, the mice were randomly distributed into six groups and treated as described in grouping and dosing section. Treatment was continued for additional three consecutive days (until Day 3). On Day 4 of the experiment, blood was collected from the tail of each mouse and smear was prepared on a microscope slide to determine parasitemia. In addition, weight, temperature, and packed cell volume (PCV) were measured just before infection and at the end of the experiment. Afterwards, mice were followed for 28 days (Day 0–Day 27) so that the mean survival time for each group could be determined.
