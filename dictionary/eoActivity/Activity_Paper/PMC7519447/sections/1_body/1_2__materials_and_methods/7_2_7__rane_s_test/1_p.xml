After 72 h (Day 3), the animals were randomly assigned into five groups with eight mice in each group and treated for four days with their respective doses as described in grouping and dosing section. Weight, temperature, and PCV were measured just before the first dose and at the end of the experiment (Day 7), and parasitemia was measured daily throughout the experiment (beginning from Day 3). Thereafter, all groups were followed for 28 days and survival time was recorded.
