<p>Both the extract-treated groups and negative control showed a continued rise in the load of parasitemia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, there was a difference in the level of mean parasitemia among them, and analysis of this difference indicated that parasitemia was significantly reduced with all doses of the extract (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) as well as the standard (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to the level in the negative control. There was also significantly lower parasitemia in the groups taking the largest dose (800 mg/kg; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and positive control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the group that took 200 mg/kg. Concerning survival time, analysis of the survival time data pointed out that only the highest dose (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and the standard (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were able to significantly prolong survival time as compared to the negative control (
