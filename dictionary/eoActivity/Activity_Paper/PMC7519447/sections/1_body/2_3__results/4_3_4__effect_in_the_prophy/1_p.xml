<p>In comparison to the negative control, there was significantly lower parasitemia in all extract-treated groups (

In Vis-à-vis survival time, the extract was not able to significantly extend the survival time of the rodents beyond that of the negative control. The positive control, however, had a positive impact at extending the survival time of the rodents (
