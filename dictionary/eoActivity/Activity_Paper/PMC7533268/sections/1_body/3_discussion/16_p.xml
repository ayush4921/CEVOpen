<p>Formaldehyde-induced paw edema model is the well-known model for the evaluation of anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory potentials of natural products in sub-acute phase of inflammation. Injection of 2% formalin v/v with distilled water subcutaneously in the palm of the mice in the 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> days of observation produced progressive paw edema which was characterized by increased migration of leucocytes and phagocytes, infiltrations of neutrophils, macrophages and proliferation of fibroblasts into the surrounding of injured area.
