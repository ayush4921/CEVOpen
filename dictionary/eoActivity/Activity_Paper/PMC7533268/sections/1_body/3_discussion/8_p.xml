<p>The possibly proposed mechanism of central analgesic effects of the extract may be by activating the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) to release endogenous peptides (i.e., endorphin or enkephalin). These endogenous peptides descend the spinal cord and function as inhibitors of the pain impulse transmission at the synapse in the dorsal horn or via peripheral mechanisms involved in the inhibition of PG, leukotriene, and other endogenous substances that are key players in central pain transmission.
