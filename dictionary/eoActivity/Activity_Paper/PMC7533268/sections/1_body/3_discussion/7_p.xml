<p>The extract at all test doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) elevated the pain threshold by increasing the reaction time starting from 30 min of observation onwards as compared to the negative control. The maximum analgesic effects of the extract were observed at 120 min of observation time with their respective percentage values of 63.93%, 66.94%, 69.40% as compared with morphine (10 mg/kg) which showed a percentage analgesic value of 70.81% at this time. At all times of observation, the doses of the extract showed analgesic activities in dose dependent manner. The doses of the extract took longer time (peak time) to attain for maximal effect, which for all doses was 120 min. This delay may be due to a probable time lag for the drug to enter in to the central compartment and distribute into the target site or formation of active metabolites that are endowed with analgesic activity with better half-life. A relatively better action of 400 mg/kg at all observation time may be attributed by the presence of high concentration of active metabolites.</p>
