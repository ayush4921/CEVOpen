<p>Carrageenan-induced hind paw edema is a prototype model which is employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potentials of various natural and synthetic products as well as to determine the possible mechanisms involved in inflammation.

 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Carrageenan is a phlogistic, non-antigenic agent and is devoid of apparent systemic effect, it is also believed that the experimental model exhibited a high degree of reproducibility in acute phase inflammation. Thus, carrageenan-induced paw edema, is a frequently used method for the screening of acute inflammatory potentials of various natural products.
