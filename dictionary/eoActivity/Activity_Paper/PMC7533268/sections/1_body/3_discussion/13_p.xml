<p>The extract at all test doses employed (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) decreased the formation of edema starting from 1 hr post carrageenan induction and the effects persisted (p &lt; 0.001) till the 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr of observation. The effect of the extract started from the 1
 <sup>st</sup> phase (1 hr) and continued till the 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr (second phase) of inflammation. This observation suggested that bioactive constituents in the extract may suppress both phases of acute inflammation by interfering with the release and/or activity of the chemical mediators.
