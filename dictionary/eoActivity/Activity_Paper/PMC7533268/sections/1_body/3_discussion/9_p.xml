<p>Previous phytochemical screening on 
 <italic>EK</italic> has revealed the presence of alkaloids, polyphenols, saponins, phytosterols, carotenoids, lignans, sesquiterpene alcohols, acetylenic and thiophene compounds, terpenoids, and essential oil.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It is proved that the root extract of 
 <italic>EK</italic> contained secondary metabolites including saponin, tannin, alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, glycosides and steroids by preliminary phytochemical screening in the present study. So, it can be said that the analgesic effects shown by the extract may be due to the presence of these aforementioned and currently identified phytoconstituents.
 <xref rid="cit0034">34</xref> This suggestion is in line with the reports that stated, phytoconstituents like, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, and tannin isolated from medicinal plants have been reported to possess a significant analgesic activity.
