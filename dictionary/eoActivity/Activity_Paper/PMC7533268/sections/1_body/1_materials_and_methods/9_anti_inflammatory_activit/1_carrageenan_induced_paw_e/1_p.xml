<p>This method was carried out by inducing of acute inflammation in the paws of overnight fasted mice with free access of water. The mice were injected with carrageenan (1% w/v in normal saline, 0.05mL) into the plantar side of the left hind paw. Just before induction of inflammation, the leg of each mouse was marked on the skin over the lateral malleolus, so that it could be immersed to the same extent in the measurement chamber of the plethysmometer. Carrageenan was injected one hour after administration of the extract, the vehicle and the standard drug with the respective groups of mice. Inflammation was quantitated in terms of mL i.e., displacement of water by edema using a digital plethysmometer at time 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 after carrageenan injection. The percentage inhibition of edema was calculated in comparison to the control mice as follows;
