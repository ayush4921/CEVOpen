<p>In this procedure, 2% v/v formalin was used for the induction of sub-acute inflammation. Freshly prepared 2% v/v formalin with “distilled water (0.02mL)” was injected into the right hind paw of overnight fasted mice by sub-plantar injection at the 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> days of observations. The right hind paw of each mouse was marked at the level of lateral malleolus before formalin induction so that it could always be immersed to the same extent in the measurement chamber of the plethysmometer throughout the observation days. The extract, the standard drug and the vehicle were given as per their respective grouping 1hr prior to formalin injection for 7 consecutive days. The mice paw volume was recorded daily using Plethysmometer after 1hr of extract, drug and vehicle administration till the 7th day and the percentage of edema inhibition was calculated using the above formula.
