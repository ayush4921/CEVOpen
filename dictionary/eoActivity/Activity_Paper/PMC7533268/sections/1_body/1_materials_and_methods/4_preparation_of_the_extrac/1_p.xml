<p>The roots of the plant were washed with tape water to remove dust and any other debris present on it. The roots of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> were then air dried under a shaded area at room temperature and pulverized using a pestle and mortar to get a coarse powder. A total of 1.50 kg powdered root was macerated using 80% (v/v) methanol. The contents were shaken manually each day and allowed to remain within the solvent for 3 days. After 3 days, the extract was filtered first using gauze and then by Whatman filters paper (No. 1). The marc was re-macerated twice using the same volume of solvent to exhaustively extract the plant material. After extraction was completed, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum using rotary vapor and oven at 40°C. The resulting solution was then placed in a deep freezer operating at −20°C till it forms solid ice and then the remaining solvent (water) was removed using lyophilizer. After all a brownish gummy residue weighing 224gm of crude extract was obtained, giving rise to a percentage yield of 14.93%. Then, the resulting crude extract was kept within deep refrigerator (−20°c) till the commencement of the main procedure.
