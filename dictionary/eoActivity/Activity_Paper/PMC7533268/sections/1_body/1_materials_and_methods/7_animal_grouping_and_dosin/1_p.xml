<p>Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 20–35 g were randomly divided into 5 groups of 6 mice per group. Group I was assigned as negative control and received vehicles. Group II was served as positive control and treated with standard drugs; morphine (10 mg/kg) for hot plate test, indomethacin (25 mg/kg) for carrageenan test, ASA (150 mg/kg) for writhing test and diclofenac (10 mg/kg) for formalin test. Groups III–V were used as test groups and given the extract of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively. Doses were selected based on an acute toxicity study done previously.
