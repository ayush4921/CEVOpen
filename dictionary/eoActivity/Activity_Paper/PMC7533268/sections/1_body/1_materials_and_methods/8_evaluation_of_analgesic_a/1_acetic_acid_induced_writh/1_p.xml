<p>This method was conducted to detect the peripheral analgesic activity of the extract and was performed by randomly dividing overnight fasted mice with free water access as described in section (2.7). “Acetic acid (0.6%v/v) (10 mL/kg, i.p)” was injected to all groups of mice an hour just after the mice were given the extract, vehicle or standard as per the respective groups. Analgesic activity of the extract was assessed by counting the numbers of writhing which consists of contraction of the abdominal muscle together with stretching of the hind limbs for 30 min after a latency period of 5 min. A reduction in the number of writhes as compared to the control group was considered as evidence for analgesic potential of the extract, and it was expressed as percent inhibition of writhing as follows:
