<p>This method was conducted to evaluate the central analgesic potential of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract and was performed by introducing the mouse into an open-ended cylindrical space with a floor consisting of a metallic plate that was heated by a thermode. A plate was heated to a constant temperature of 55°C ± 1°C producing the behavioral components that were measured in terms of their reaction times, namely paw licking withdrawal of the paw and jumping. All responses were considered to be supraspinally integrated responses. Mice were individually placed on a hot plate with a cut-off time of 15 s to avoid lesions to the animals’ paws. The latency to lick the paw or jump from the hot plate was recorded as the reaction time. The reaction times were noted at 0 and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the administration of vehicle (distilled water 10 mL/kg), standard drug (morphine10 mg/kg) and 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of the extract. Percentage increase in reaction time or pain threshold inhibition, was calculated as follows:
