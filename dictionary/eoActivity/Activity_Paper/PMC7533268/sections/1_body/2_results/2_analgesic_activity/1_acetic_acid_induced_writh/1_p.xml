<p>In this test, 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract at all test doses employed (100, 200, and 400m g/kg) showed statistically significant peripheral analgesic activity in a dose dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) as compared to the negative control. All 3 test doses of the extract produced increased inhibition of the numbers of writhing with maximum inhibition observed at maximum dose (400 mg/kg) (p&lt; 0.001). The highest dose significantly decreased the number of writhing (p &lt; 0.001) than the lower dose (100 mk/kg) and the middle dose (200 mk/kg) (p &lt; 0.05). The extent of reduction of writhing in the different doses of the extract was different, i.e., significantly lower in 100 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.001) and 200 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.01) and comparable with 400 mg/kg as compared to the standard drug of 150 mg/kg ASA (
