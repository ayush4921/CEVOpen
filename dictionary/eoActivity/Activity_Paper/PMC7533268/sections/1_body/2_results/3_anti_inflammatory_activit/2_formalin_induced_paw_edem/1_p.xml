<p>Formaldehyde-induced pedal edema method in mice was conducted to detect the anti-inflammatory potential of 80% hydro methanol root extract of 
 <italic>EK</italic> in sub-acute phase of inflammation. Sub planar injection of 0.02mL of 2% v/v formaldehyde with distilled water to the mice hind paw at the 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> day of observation produced progressive increment of the paw volume of the mice which were treated with the negative control (distilled water 10 mL/kg) (

 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract at all test doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) paw edema volume in mice starting from the 1
 <sup>st</sup> day of formalin induction and then continued to the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001) post-formalin induction as compared with the negative control (
