<p>This model was conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the extract in acute phase of inflammation. Sub plantar injection of 0.05 mL of 1% carrageenan to the mice hind paw produced a progressive increment of paw thickness that reached its maximum value after 3hrs of induction in negative control (

 <italic>EK</italic> extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) produced statistically significant inhibition of paw thickness starting from 1 hr (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.001) and the effects persisted till the fourth hour of observation (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001) post carrageenan induction as compared to the negative control.
