<p>(1) The concoction of 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>Coscinium fenestratum</italic> shows a significant dose-dependent reduction of inflammation as shown in the rat paw edema model. (2) Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> mechanisms were shown to contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect: (a) marked inhibition of NO and ROS production by rat peritoneal cells, (b) absence of iNOS expression in rat peritoneal cells confirm the inhibition of NO production, and (c) significant membrane stabilizing activity. (3) The concoction of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> showed a significantly higher antibody response against specific antigens.
