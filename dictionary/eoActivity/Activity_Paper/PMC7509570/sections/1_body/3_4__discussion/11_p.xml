<p>Interestingly, the concoction or the combined extract used in the present study exhibited both anti-inflammatory as well as immunostimulatory effects showing a broad spectrum of immunomodulation. This shows the capacity of the concoction to modulate the innate immune response as well as induce an enhanced antibody response against specific antigens SRBC. These immunomodulatory effects may have direct relevance to its traditional use in treatment of inflammation and cold where it could suppress inflammation relieving the cold symptoms, while the specific antibodies raised may prevent having antiviral effects preventing viral replication and further progression of the disease symptoms. According to traditional medical practitioners, the concoction is prescribed when an individual gets first symptoms of an infection meaning during or soon after an antigen exposure. It is also one of the home remedies practiced for years for treatment at early stage in infection [

It is noteworthy that rats were orally treated with the decoction just prior to the SRBC antigen exposure and in consecutive 2 days in both immunizations (day 1 and day 7). Thus, these rats were treated in a similar manner to prescribed ailment before checking their antibody levels and a marked elevation in antibody levels was observed within 14 days (for HED of concoction). This indicates the concoction in its traditionally prescribed dose (HED) has the capacity to boost the immune system to protect against an infection or by strengthening the immune system to combat the disease effectively by elevating antibodies against the specific antigen. This also further emphasizes an adjuvant effect by this concoction on antibody production against a specific antigen preparation. In a previous study, leaf extract of
