<p>It is noteworthy that our findings on the concoction in the rat experimental system on enhanced antibody production are consistent with some of the previous studies when only the 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> extracts were used. Different preparations of aqueous and ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> had shown immunostimulant activity in mice [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], chickens [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and fish [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is possible that the immunostimulatory activity observed in the concoction of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> or 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> is attributable to the effect from 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic>. Alternately, it may be due to a combined effect of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> or 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> since some of the immunostimulatory effects observed in the present study was comparatively higher compared to those observed when 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> was used by itself. Further studies are in progress to investigate on the exact active component(s) responsible of the increased antibody production and the specific mechanisms of activation of lymphocytes in producing an enhanced antibody response.
