<p>Recruitment of phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are a characteristic feature of the late phase of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our previous studies on 
 <italic>Ixora coccinea</italic>, we have shown that inhibition of the cell migration to the peritoneal cavity or to the site of inflammation as a mechanism that makes a significant contribution to the anti-inflammatory effect [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the early stage of action, polymorphonuclear cells predominate whereas mononuclear cells are more potent at the late stage [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, the HED of the concoction which exhibited the optimum anti-inflammatory activity was used to assess its effect on production of ROS (O

 <sup>âˆ’</sup>) and RNS (NO) by peritoneal cells. The significant decrease of both ROS and RNS reflects the cellular mechanisms that support the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory action shown in the paw-edema assay. Our previous studies on methnoloic leaf extract of 
 <italic>I. coccinea</italic> and aqueous leaf extracts 
 <italic>Vitex negundo</italic> have also shown similar inhibitory activity of NO and ROS production by rat peritoneal cells [
