<p>It is noteworthy that a comparative study with ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Curcuma aromatica</italic> Salisb. and 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> have reported that 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> at a dose of 8 mg/kg exhibited 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory to a lesser extent (34% inhibition at 3 hours). The anti-inflammatory activity was attributed to the presence of tannins and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, another comparison with ethanolic extracts of fruits of 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> leaves of 
 <italic>Datura stramonium</italic> and 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> at 200 mg/kg doses has shown that 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> had the less potent anti-inflammatory activity (41% inhibition at 3 hours) compared to 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> which had the highest activity as reported in this study [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The present study used the traditional preparation of the concoction which has shown a much higher anti-inflammatory activity with half HED dose (92 mg/kg) having 84% inhibition. These differences in anti-inflammatory activity may either be attributed to the different types of extraction types having different constituents with their intrinsic potencies. It may be possible that the aqueous extract used in the present study has more potent constituents or that when used as a combination they may show a synergistic effect. This anti-inflammatory effects supports the widespread use of this combination in traditional medicinal practice in Sri Lanka and its use at the early stages of viral infections causing cold related symptoms.
