<p>Effect of oral administration of the concoction on rat antibody production was evaluated by assessing the SRBC haemagglutination titers. The sera obtained on day 0 showed no antibodies against SRBC in both groups. On day 7, the SRBC haemagglutination titers in both concoction and control groups of rats were low and comparable (

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Titers of the concoction group on days 7 and 14 increased significantly from 100 (mean) to 253.33 (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.03), whereas no significant change was observed in the control group. By day 14, the group of rats treated with the concoction showed a significant increase in their SRBC haemagglutination titers compared to day 14 sera of the control (mean value 253.3 and 66.7, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.004). This showed that after two sets of 3-day oral treatment (and with two sets of antigen exposures), the concoction was able to induce a significant increase in the specific antibody response against SRBC.
