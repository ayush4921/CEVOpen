<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, amplifications of GAPDH were observed in all three samples (RNA obtained from the rats injected with carrageenan and treated with the reference drug (prednisolone), water, and concoction). Amplification of iNOS was observed only in the control (water treated) and was absent in the concoction treated and the group treated with the reference drug. Amplification of nNOS was clearly observed for concoction treaded group, whereas amplification of both nNOS and eNOS was weak in the group treated with the reference drug.
