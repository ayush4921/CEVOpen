<p>The main objective of this study was to scientifically validate the traditional use of this concoction of seeds of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> and stem of 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> as an immunomodulator. More specifically, we investigated its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenan-induced rat paw-edema model and its effect on some of the immune cellular mechanisms including the production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by rat peritoneal cells, membrane stabilizing activity of the concoction, and its immunostimulatory activity in enhancing antibody response.
