<p>This assay was performed by heat-induced haemolysis of rat erythrocytes as described previously [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ten-fold dilution series of concoction was made using PBS for concentrations from 0.0001 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Dilutions of Aspirin was also made using PBS for the same concentrations and used as the standard drug. PBS was used as control. Rat erythrocytes washed and resuspended in PBS (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) was added to each tube containing 980 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of each concentration of test, aspirin and control samples. Samples were first incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1500
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, the supernatants were removed and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Samples were then incubated at 54°C for 25 min to initiate heat-induced haemolysis and centrifuged at 1500
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Supernatants (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) were transferred into an ELISA plate and the optical density (OD) was measured at 540 nm. Percentage inhibition of haemolysis was calculated with respect to the controls and inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values were derived. Percent inhibition of haemolysis = [(OD control − OD sample/OD control] × 100.
