<p>This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of oral treatment of rats with the concoction on their specific antibody production against SRBC antigens. The SRBC immunization was performed according to a modification of the previously described method [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Two groups of rats (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6/group) were orally treated with HED of concoction and water on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. A preparation of 0.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cells of freeze-thawed SRBC was injected intraperitoneally on days 1 and 7. Serum collected on days 0, 7, and 14 was tested for anti-SRBC antibodies using SRBC haemagglutination assay [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Day 0 (preimmune) sera were used as the negative control, while days 7 and 14 sera were collected to ascertain the levels of antibodies after the exposure to SRBC antigen. Haemagglutination plates were incubated at 37°C for 16 hours.
