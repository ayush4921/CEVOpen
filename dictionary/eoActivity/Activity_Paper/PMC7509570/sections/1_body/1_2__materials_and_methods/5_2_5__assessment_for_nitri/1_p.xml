<p>Peritoneal cells were collected as described previously [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Three groups of rats were orally treated with HED (the optimum dose selected), prednisolone as reference drug (10 mg/kg), and water as control. One hour after the oral treatment, 1 ml of 0.1% carrageenan (1 mg/ml) was injected to the rat peritoneal cavity. Two hours after this, 40 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected and approximately 35 ml of fluid was drained from peritoneal cavity. The drained peritoneal fluid was centrifuged at 500
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and total cell and differential cell counts were taken using a Neubauer's haemocytometer (Neubauer, Germany).
