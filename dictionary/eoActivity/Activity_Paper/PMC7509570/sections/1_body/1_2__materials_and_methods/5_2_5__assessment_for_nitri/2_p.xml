<p>Rat peritoneal cells as described above were used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the HED against the production of nitric oxide. Cell suspension (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/ml) was plated in 96 well tissue culture (TC) plates where 6 wells were maintained for each rat. The TC plate was incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. After 24 hours, the supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 10,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes, and stored at −20°C for quantification of nitrite levels. Griess assay was used to quantify nitrite levels in rat peritoneal culture supernatants by mixing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of culture supernatant with equal volume of Griess solution (equal amounts of 1% Sulphanilamide and 0.1% 
 <italic>N</italic>-(naphtyl) ethlenediamine hydrochloride) [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Optical density at 540 nm was measured 15 minutes after adding the Griess solution using an ELISA microplate reader (ELx 800-Universal Microplate Reader, Biotek Instruments, Canada). A dilution series of NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> standards from 100 to 0.781 
 <italic>μ</italic>M were used to prepare nitrite standard curve. The amount of nitrites in 
 <italic>μ</italic>M was computed from the standard curve plotted for NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>.
