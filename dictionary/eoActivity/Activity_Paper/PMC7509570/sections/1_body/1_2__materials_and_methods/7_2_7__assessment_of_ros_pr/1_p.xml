<p>Peritoneal cells collected as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.5">Section 2.5</xref> were used to evaluate the effect of the HED against the production of ROS. Concentration of cell suspensions were adjusted to 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml using complete RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (cRPMI) and 8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells in 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension were plated in 24-well culture plate and the final volume/well was increased to 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>l with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cRPMI added to each well. For each rat, 3 wells were maintained. Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) was used as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> positive control. For this, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension obtained from a rat treated with water was plated with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M DPI in cRPMI. Plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to allow the cell attachment. After one hour, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of supernatant was removed, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 2 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) with 12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After half an hour supernatant was removed and plate was washed twice with prewarmed (37°C) PBS. The plate was fixed using 70% methanol and allowed to dry and 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 2 M KOH and 140 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of absolute dimethyl sulphoxide were added to each well and the plate was placed on a shaker for 10 minutes. Dissolved formazan (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) was transferred into 96-well ELISA plate and absorbance was read at 620 nm. The concentration of O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> was calculated using standard NBT curve as described previously [
