<p>This study has shown the immunomodulatory activity of a concoction of 
 <italic>C. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic> by possessing both anti-inflammatory (inhibition of inflammation, nitric oxide, superoxide anion production, and membrane stabilizing activity) and immunostimulatory (enhancement of antibody production) activities. The markedly reduced nitrite levels and superoxide anion and lack of iNOS gene expression in rat peritoneal cells and increased membrane stability may be the key immune cellular mechanisms which support this anti-inflammatory activity of the concoction. Furthermore, the significant elevation of antibody levels clearly supports the immunostimulatory activity which also shows long-term protection against specific antigens. Therefore, this study for the first time scientifically validates the therapeutic claim of Sri Lankan traditional use of the concoction of coriander (
 <italic>C. sativum)</italic> and 
 <italic>veniwalgata</italic> (
 <italic>C. fenestratum</italic>) for immunomodulatory effects.
