<p id="p0020">We first performed phytochemical screening tests of methanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves. We next aimed to investigate the anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic properties of the leaves extracts of this plant. We assessed the anxiolytic activity using elevated plus-maze tests. Likewise, the sedative effects were measured using pentobarbital-induced sleeping time tests. The analgesic activity was examined using the acetic acid-induced writhing test and formalin induced paw licking test. Therefore, we assessed the presence and quantity of Copper (Cu), Arsenic (As), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn) and Iron (Fe) in our study samples.
