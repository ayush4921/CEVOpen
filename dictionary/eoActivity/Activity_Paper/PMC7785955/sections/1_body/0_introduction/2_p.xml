 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L., a member of Euphorbiaceae family of flowering plants, is a medicinal plant and widely used to treat skin infections, scabies, wounds, inflammation, pain, headache and eczema [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This plant is locally known as “Bichuti” in Bengali, “Stinging Nettle” in English. This perennial plant, with hispid herb and scattered stinging hairs, is a tropical and subtropical regional plant that has diaphoretic and duplicate root [

 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. root extracts have this plant has sedative activity [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The essential compounds Stigmasterol, Quercetin, Rutin and 3-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-2,3-dihydrochro-men-4-one have been identified and isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves, demonstrated high antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, the methanol root extract of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. was shown to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic effects of this plant are largely unknown. Previous studies suggest that presence of phytochemical components such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, steroids, tannins, saponins, antioxidants and terpenoides are primarily responsible for beneficial effects of wild plants. For example, plant derived antooxidant compounds (i.e.flavonoids and polyphenols) were shown to be effective in treating diabetes, cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that wild plants may contain secondary toxic metabolites contaminated with environmental pollutants. Because of the environmental pollutants, heavy metal in the food chain and in living organisms is an increasing concern [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Exposure to toxic materials and heavy metals may damage lipids, proteins, enzymes and DNA, resulting in organ dysfunctions and multiple diseases [
