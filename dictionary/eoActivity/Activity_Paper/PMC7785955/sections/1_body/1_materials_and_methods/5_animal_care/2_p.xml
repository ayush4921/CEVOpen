<p id="p0040">Swiss albino male mice (21 Days) weighing between 18-25 g, collected from the Department of Pharmacy, Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka-1342, were used for this study. Then, for adaptation, mice were kept 15 days in our laboratory. The animals were maintained in a room with controlled temperature (25 ± 1 °C), relative humidity (55–65%) and light: dark 12:12 h cycle in polypropylene cages with soft wood shaving. They were given a standard chow elevated by the International Centre for Diarrheal Diseases and Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka-1213 and water ad libitum. Before initiation of all experiments, all were acclimatized at least for 1 h period to laboratory conditions. All procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Jashore University of Science &amp; Technology, Jashore-7408 and laboratory animal use and care were conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted principles.</p>
