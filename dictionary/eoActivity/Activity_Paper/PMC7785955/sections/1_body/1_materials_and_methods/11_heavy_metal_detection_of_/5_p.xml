<p id="p0135">1 g of plant material was macerated with 10 mL concentrated nitric acid (HNO
 <sub>3</sub>; ultrapure 65%) and kept at ambient temperature overnight. The sample extract was then subjected to heat for 4 h at 120 °C, followed by heating in increased temperature at 140 °C and continued to concentrate to dryness at this temperature until 1 ml of acid left. The crude extract was then cooled to room temperature and transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask for filtration followed by dilution up to volume. Stock solutions of Arsenic (As), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn) and Iron (Fe) containing 1000 ppm of each were prepared by adding distill water with weighed quantity of metal salt (analytical grade) to dissolve. Calibration standard of each element was made by dilutions of the mixed stock solutions. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was used to determine the concentrations of the elements. The elements were measured by aspirating the samples into air acetylene flame and under optimum operating conditions [
