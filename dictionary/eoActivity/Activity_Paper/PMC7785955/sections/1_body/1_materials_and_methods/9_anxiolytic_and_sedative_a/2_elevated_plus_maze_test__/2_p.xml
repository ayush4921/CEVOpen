<p id="p0110">EPM test was performed to observe the anxiolytic activity of TIME, TIEAE and TIHE. Control, standard, TIME-2, TIME-4, TIEAE-2, TIEAE-4, TIHE-2 and TIHE-4 group were administered their individual dose. The maze comprised of two open arms (30 × 5 × 0.2 cm) and two closed arms (30 × 5 × 15 cm) connected to a central partition in the middle (5 cm × 5 cm) and has an elevated height of 45 cm above the floor. Each mouse was placed on the central platform of the maze facing an open arm. The number of transitions in between the open arms and closed arms and time spent in open arms were observed for a period of 5 min. Two observers were still staying beside the elevated platform to observe the activity and the behavior of the mice. The parameters that were observed include total time spent and number of fecal boli in both open arms and closed arms of the mazes [
