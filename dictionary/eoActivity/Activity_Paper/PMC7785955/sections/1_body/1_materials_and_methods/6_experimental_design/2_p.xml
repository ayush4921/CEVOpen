<p id="p0045">For each test group of sedative and analgesic activity, Swiss albino mice were divided into eight groups with 5 mice in each group. Every mouse was administered 10 ml/kg body weight (b.w) of dose solution. Control group was administered the vehicle (1% Tween 80 + Distilled Water), standard group was administered diazepam (1 mg/kg, b.w, i.p) for anxiolytic and sedative activity tests and diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg, b.w, i.p) for analgesic activity tests. Based on previous studies as well as our toxicity screening test, we considered two doses (200 and 400 mg/kg, b.w) per extract. TIME-2 group was administered 200 mg/kg (b.w) of TIME, TIME-4 group was administered 400 mg/kg (b.w) of TIME, TIEAE-2 group was administered 200 mg/kg (b.w) of TIEAE, TIEAE-4 group was administered 400 mg/kg (b.w) of TIEAE, TIHE-2 group was administered 200 mg/kg (b.w) of TIHE, and TIHE-4 group was administered 400 mg/kg (b.w) of TIHE.</p>
