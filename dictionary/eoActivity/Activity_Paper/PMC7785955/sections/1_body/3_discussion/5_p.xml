<p id="p0195">Pain is usually induced by endogenous inflammatory mediators, as like prostaglandin, serotonin and bradykinin that elevate the stimuli of peripheral nerve results in activation of nociceptors [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Among the experiments, it was found that the writhing method was effective for the analysis of peripherally active analgesics by the acetic acid induced. So, the molecules that reduce the number of writhing will express analgesic effect mostly via the interference of prostaglandin synthesis, a peripheral mechanism of pain inhibition [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this peripheral model, pain sensation is stimulated by localized inflammatory response. It was assumed in the earlier that arachidonic acid regulates the release of prostaglandins after the induction of inflammatory response by activating phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub>. It is now evident that the process of local prostaglandin production from arachidonic acid is stimulated by local interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and facilitated by cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) and membrane phospholipid. In addition, elevated peritoneal fluids of prostaglandin (PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and PGF 2α) and elevated lipoxygenase level has been found in acetic acid induced mice [

 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. may act by blocking cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) resulting in reduction of PG synthesis from arachidonic acid since the nociceptive mechanism of acetic acid induced abdominal constriction involves the prostanoid biosynthesis pathway. Another possible mechanism could be involved in neurotransmitter systems such as catecholaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, opioids, GABAergic system as well as ATP gated potassium channels. We assume that phytochemical compounds alkaloids and flavonoids (e.g: apigenin, terniflorin) may exert the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity via arachidonic acid metabolism pathway [

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the plant contains potential compounds that show analgesic effect.
