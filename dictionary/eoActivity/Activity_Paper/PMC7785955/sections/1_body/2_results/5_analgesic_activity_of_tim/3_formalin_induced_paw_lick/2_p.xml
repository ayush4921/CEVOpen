<p id="p0170">To evaluate the reliability of our initial findings in acetic acid induced writhing test, we performed another analgesic activity test known as formalin-induced paw licking test. Standard group demonstrated significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction in paw licking time both at acute phase (49.80 ± 2.52) and late phase (1.80 ± 1.80) compared to control (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). In acute phase, TIEAE-4 and TIHE-4 demonstrated a significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction in paw licking time compared to control (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C); TIEAE-4 had the highest number of percentage inhibition (74.80%) (without standard group; 95.91%) (
