<p id="p0165">We next sought to examine the analgesic effect of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves using acetic acid-induced writhing test, where oral administration of TIME-4 and TIHE-4 demonstrated anti-nociceptive activity with a significant (p &lt; 0.01) decrease in the number of writhing compared with control (25.40 ± 1.96) (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). TIEAE-4 showed the highest decrease in number of writhing (13.20 ± 1.39; p &lt; 0.001) and increased in the percentage of inhibition (48.03%) (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A-B). The standard group also showed a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.001) in the number of writhing compared with control and elevation in the percentage of inhibition (
