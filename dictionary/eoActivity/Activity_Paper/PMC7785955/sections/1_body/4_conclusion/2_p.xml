<p id="p0210">This study examined various pharmacological properties of the 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves using elevated plus maze, pentobarbital induced sleeping time, acetic acid induced writhing and formalin induced paw-licking tests. Findings from this study demonstrate that 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. has significant anxiolytic, analgesic and sedative effects. Furthermore, this study detects the presence of numerous secondary metabolites along with the presence of heavy metals in 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves that may be insightful for real-life applications. To identify the potential therapeutic agent, further investigation is required to isolate and purify the bioactive compound of the plant.
