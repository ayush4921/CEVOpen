<p>Medicinal plants have been a rich source of clinically effective anticancer agents for the past few decades. Over 60% of the currently used anticancer drugs are either directly derived from plants or inspired by their novel phytochemicals [

In spite of such success, the importance of medicinal plants as a source of leads for anticancer drug discovery was marginalized in comparison with other advanced approaches. This could be due to issues associated with intellectual property rights and securing not enough amounts of plant material which results in the slowness of working with natural products [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, despite these drawbacks, medicinal plant-based drug discovery and development has made a comeback to find potent and affordable natural products with a new mechanism of action and better toxicological profile due to structural diversity of natural product small molecules (NPSM). For instance, among small molecules approved for cancer treatment between 1940 and 2014, 49% are derived and/or originated from natural products [
