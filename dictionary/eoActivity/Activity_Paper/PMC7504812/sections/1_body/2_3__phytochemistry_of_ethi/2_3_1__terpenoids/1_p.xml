<p>Terpenoids are classified according to the number of their isoprene unit as hemi-, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and polyterpenes [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Various studies reported that the anticancer activity of terpenoids is due to the inhibition of inflammation, cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis, and induction of programmed cell death [
