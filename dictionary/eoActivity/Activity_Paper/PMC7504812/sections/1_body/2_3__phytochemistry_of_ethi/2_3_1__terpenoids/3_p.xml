<p>Several terpenoids have been isolated from Ethiopian plants that have claims of having anticancer activity, although these plants may have been collected from other sources. For example, sonhafouonic acid (
 <bold>8</bold>) from 
 <italic>Zehneria scabra</italic>, collected from Cameroon, demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against brine shrimp assay [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], while Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] showed the antiproliferative activity of euphol (
 <bold>9</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Euphorbia tirucalli</italic> from Taiwan against human gastric cancer cells. Euphol selectively promotes apoptosis by mitochondrial-dependent caspase-3 activation and growth arrest through induction of p27kip1 and inhibition of cyclin B1 in human gastric CS12 cancer cells. It also showed a selective and strong cytotoxicity against other groups of human cancer cell lines such as glioblastoma (the most frequent and aggressive type of brain tumor) [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of action of another anticancer triterpenoid, maslinic acid (
 <bold>10</bold>), isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> has been studied, which induced apoptosis in HT29 human colon cancer cells by directly inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2, increasing that of Bax, releasing cytochrome-C from the mitochondria and activating caspase-9 and then caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similarly, the leaf extract of 
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> collected from Malta was also reported for its cytotoxicity against several human tumor cells and induction of apoptosis against human breast tumors, SK-MEL-28. The monoterpenoids 1,8-cineole, camphor and α-pinene, and the sesquiterpenoid 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, isolated from 
 <italic>R. communis</italic>, also showed cytotoxicity against similar cell lines in a dose-dependent manner [
