<p>The present review reports secondary metabolites isolated from 27 plants that are traditionally used to treat different types of cancer in Ethiopia. Phytochemical investigations of traditionally used Ethiopian anticancer plants have led to the isolation of compounds that belong to different classes of natural products [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this review, we have not included plants those displayed compounds with very low cytotoxic/antiproliferative activity (i.e., IC

 <sub>50</sub> (Effective dose for 50% of the population) &gt; 50 µg/mL or &gt; 100 µM, in most cases, except few where compounds tested against a panel of cell lines) or plants from which no anticancer compounds were isolated/reported. This review compiled and discussed the potential anticancer/antiproliferative agents based on the types of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, steroids, and lignans.
