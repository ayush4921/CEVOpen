<p id="p0150">It was reported that the sedative and anxiolytic activity of the plant extract result from its high alkaloids and flavonoids, which have a stronger binding affinity with GABA-ergic complex [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Binding of flavonoids to GABA type C receptors in the CNS leads to the activity of benzodiazepine-like molecules [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A study has found that the phenolic contents in plant extract are responsible for the CNS depressant effect [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. During the quantitative phytochemical analysis of MEBJ, total phenolic content was found 718 ± 3.46 mg GAE/g, and the total flavonoid content was 116.67 ± 0.07 mg QE/g dried plant extract (
