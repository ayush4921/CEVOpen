<p id="p0140">Diazepam belongs to a class of benzodiazepine that exhibits anxiolytic-like effects along with its sedative action. In this regard, the anxiolytic potentials of MEBJ have been investigated using EPM and hole board tests. In the EPM test, drug possessing anxiolytic activity increases the percentage of entries into open arms and total time spent into open arms, whereas anxiogenic reduces in both parameters [
