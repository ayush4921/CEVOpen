<p id="p0135">Previously, an interrelation has been reported between CNS depressant activity index and enhancement of hypnosis [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Drugs that hold CNS depressant effect either shorten the time for onset of sleeping or extend the total period of sleeping or both [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In this study, thiopental sodium induced sleeping time test was employed to evaluate the hypnosis effect of the extract on the mice. According to the results, the onset of sleeping decreased expressively after the administration of MEBJ 200 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.01) and MEBJ 400 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). However, a significant (P &lt; 0.001) elevation in the duration of sleeping for both doses was recorded (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). The duration of sleeping time was increased to 65.66 ± 1.65 and 101.3 ± 1.39 min at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively when compared to the control (47.25 ± 1.94). Accordingly, it has been observed that the extract exerted its activity by reducing sleeping latency and increasing the duration of sleep. This occurrence corresponds to the features of sedative activity produced by benzodiazepines due to GABA mediated hyperpolarization of postsynaptic neurons [
