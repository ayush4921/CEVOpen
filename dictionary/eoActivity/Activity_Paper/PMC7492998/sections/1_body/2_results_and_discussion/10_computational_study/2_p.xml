<p id="p0165">A computational study (molecular docking and ADME/T study) has been performed to understand the observed pharmacological activities of MEBJ thoroughly. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> molecular docking provides information about the relative orientation of a ligand molecule when it is bound to a protein [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Such information can be used to discover novel compounds with more potency and selectivity. In this study, 10 chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Bischofia javanica</italic> leaves were subjected to molecular docking study against human estrogen receptor alpha, human gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, potassium channel, human pancreatic alpha-amylase and human tissue plasminogen activator. The docking analysis revealed that fisetin has the highest binding affinity with three receptors that are responsible for cytotoxic (-8.262 kcal/mol), sedative (-8.013 kcal/mol) and anti-diabetic (-7.653 kcal/mol) activity. On the other hand, quercetin was found to possess the highest docking score (-5.751 kcal/mol) when bound with human pancreatic alpha-amylase enzyme regarding anti-diabetic activity. Lastly, cynaroside exhibits the best binding affinity (-8.438 kcal/mol) from the interaction with human tissue plasminogen activator. Docking scores of these compounds are higher than the standard drugs used that are Tamoxifen (-4.819 kcal/mol) as cytotoxic, Diazepam (-6.84 and -3.73 kcal/mol) for sedative and anxiolytic respectively, Acarbose (-7.206 kcal/mol) as antidiabetic and Streptokinase (-4.178 kcal/mol) as thrombolytic. All docking scores are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and the best interaction figures are demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Interaction analysis of best-docked compounds, namely fisetin, quercetin and cymaroside, showed several hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds against the receptors used (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The binding analysis suggests that fisetin binds with human estrogen receptor alpha by forming three hydrogen bonds (Thr-347, Glu-353, and Arg-394) and a hydrophobic bond (Leu-346). Besides, fisetin also demonstrated four hydrogen bonds (Tyr-157, Asn-41, Thr-176, and Asp-43) and one hydrophobic interaction (Tyr-62) against human gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor whereas, interactions of fisetin with human pancreatic alpha-amylase enzyme exhibited three hydrogen bond interactions (Tyr-62, Asp197, and Gln-63) and three hydrophobic bond interactions (Tyr-62 and Trp-59). Similarly, quercetin binds with the potassium channel by three hydrogen interactions to Arg-89 and Thr-72, along with four hydrophobic bonds to Pro-83, Ala-92, and Arg-89. Finally, against human tissue plasminogen activator, the best interacted compound cynaroside binds through six hydrogen bond interactions (Asp-189, Gly-219, Asp-96, Tyr-99, and Gly-216) and three hydrophobic interactions (Cys-191, Trp-215, and His-57). The interactions between ligand and receptor showed that the isolated compounds have relatively shorter and stronger bonds. These results suggest that fisetin, quercetin and cynaroside are the best compounds for the tested pharmacological activities.
