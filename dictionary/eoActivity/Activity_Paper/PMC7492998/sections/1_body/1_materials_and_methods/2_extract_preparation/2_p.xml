 <italic>Bischofia javanica</italic> were collected from Bangladesh Forest Research Institute (BFRI), Chittagong, Bangladesh in august 2019. The collected leaves were authenticated by Dr. Shaikh Bokhtear Uddin, Professor, Department of Botany, University of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and a voucher specimen (accession: SBU 1629) has been deposited in the Herbarium center (University of Chittagong). The collected leaves were rinsed in clean water and kept on drying for 7 days. Dried leaves were then grinded in an electric blender. About 300 g of the pulverized leaves were immersed in 1.8 L of methanol and kept at room temperature along with continuous stirring for two weeks. Afterwards, the solution was filtered using a cotton plug and Whitman filter paper. Then the filtered was transferred on the water bath for evaporation for a period of 10 days at 55 °C temperature. The crude methanol extract of 
 <italic>B. javanica</italic> (MEBJ) (yield 8.05 %) was secured in a vial and stored in 4 °C for further experiments.
