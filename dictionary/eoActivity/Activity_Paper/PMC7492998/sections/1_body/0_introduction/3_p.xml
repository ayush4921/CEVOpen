<p id="p0015">At present, synthetic drugs have been broadly employed to treat several diseases, even though having various limitations, such as enormous side effects and lowest efficacy. For example, a lot of conventional drugs have been used to treat the following diseases like insomnia, anxiety, and depression where different classes of therapeutic agents like opioids, benzodiazepines, NSAID's are being prescribed for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, these drugs have a limited use due to their additional side effects in conjunction with the tolerance and dependence produced [

For this reason, exploration of medicinal plants, particularly attention on the development of a novel drug for the treatment of various diseases is increasing gradually because of their diverse chemical structure and best compatibility with human physiology. Furthermore, nowadays, computational methods are being considered the most suitable approaches to scrutinize or predict the biological activity of phytocompounds along with its safety and drug-likeliness properties since it saves not only the time but also the money [
