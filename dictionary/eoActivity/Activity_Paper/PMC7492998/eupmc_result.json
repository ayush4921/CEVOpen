    "<i>Bischofia javanica</i> (Blume), an edible wild plant, has both prospective nutraceutical and therapeutic properties. Here, we intended to explore the pharmacological potentials of the methanol extract of <i>B.Â javanica</i> (MEBJ) through integrated approaches. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of important phytoconstituents which were found to be safe during cytotoxicity analysis. The sedative potential of MEBJ (200 and 400 mg/kg) was determined by employing open field, hole cross, and thiopental sodium-induced sleeping time tests, where a significant reduction of the locomotor performance and an enhancement in the duration of sleeping have been observed, respectively. In addition, mice treated with MEBJ exhibited superior exploration during both elevated plus maze and hole board tests. In parallel, anti-diabetic potency was investigated via alpha-amylase inhibitory assay, where a dose-response increase in the percentage of inhibition has been marked. A similar response, such as an increased percentage of clot lysis, was observed during the thrombolytic test. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed with the identified compounds, demonstrated strong binding affinities to the target receptors of the experiments as mentioned above. Also, ADME/T and toxicological parameters verified the drug-like properties of the identified compounds. Collectively, these results indicate bioactivity of <i>Bischofia javanica</i>, which can be a potential candidate in the food and pharmaceutical industries."
