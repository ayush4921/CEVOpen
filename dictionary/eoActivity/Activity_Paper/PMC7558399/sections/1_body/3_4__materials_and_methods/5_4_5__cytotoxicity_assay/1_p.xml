<p>The antiproliferative activities of test compounds against normal and cancer intestinal lines were evaluated using the modified thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay developed by Mosmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The cancer (2.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>) and normal intestinal (2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate for 24 h. Cells were incubated with two-fold serially diluted test compounds (0.25–512 μg/mL) for 72 h. Plates containing 8-hydroxyquinoline were covered using EVA capmats. Next, the cells were incubated with MTT reagent (1 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) in DMEM or Hybri-Care medium for an additional 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The medium with MTT was removed and the intracellular formazan product was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 555 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 spectrometer (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland), and the percentage of viability was calculated when compared to an untreated control. Antiproliferative activity of the test compounds was represented as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (μg/mL). Three independent experiments (two replicates each) were performed for every test. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. DMSO was used as a positive control at the highest concentration with and without EVA capmats. The solvents did not affect the viability of normal and cancer intestinal cell lines at the tested concentration (≤1%).
