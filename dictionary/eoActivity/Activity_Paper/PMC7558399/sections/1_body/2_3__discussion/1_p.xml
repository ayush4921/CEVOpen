<p>The in vitro growth-inhibitory properties of the tested antibiotics have previously been reported for a number of diarrheagenic and probiotic bacteria. However, the bacterial strains tested as well as the methods with criteria used for antimicrobial activity assessment vary frequently among the previous studies. Moreover, the studies reporting the in vitro susceptibilities of probiotic bacteria deal more with clinical isolates [
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and less with standard strains [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present study, therefore, provides the data on in vitro selective antibacterial activities of these antibiotics that can be fairly compared with the same data obtained for phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs. We suggest that the reason behind the increased resistance of probiotic strains differ for particular compounds that showed a selective antipathogenic effect. The growth-inhibitory activities of fluoroquinolones against Gram-positive bacteria are reported to be lower than those against Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (Gram-positive) were generally less susceptible to ciprofloxacin than Gram-negative diarrheagenic bacteria that predominate over Gram-positive pathogens in this study. The decreased susceptibility of bifidobacteria to tetracycline might be caused by the presence of specific antibiotic resistance genes [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar to other third-generation cephalosporins [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the growth-inhibitory activity of ceftriaxone against Gram-negative bacteria was higher than that against Gram-positive bacteria. However, as a result of significant resistance of the tested Gram-positive pathogens and susceptibility of bifidobacteria, ceftriaxone showed increased toxicity to probiotic strains. The growth-inhibitory activities of some alkaloids and related structures were comparable with those of antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of 8-hydroxyquinoline alkaloids is mediated through the chelation of metals that function as co-factors in various enzymes, which results in the inhibition of RNA synthesis. We suggest that probiotic strains (mainly bifidobacteria) are more resistant to 8-hydroxyquinolines as they are able to sequester iron from the environment [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The selective antibacterial activity of 8-hydroxyquinoline against diarrheagenic pathogens seems to be enhanced with chlorine halogenation or by the presence of a nitro group and decreased with iodine halogenation and the presence of a sulfo group, as respectively observed for chloroxine, nitroxoline, and ferron in our study. The in vitro selective anticlostridial effect of 8-hydroxyquinoline with increased resistance of bifidobacteria was previously described in studies of Novakova et al. [

 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Skrivanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, data on its in vitro growth-inhibitory effects against a broader selection of diarrheagenic bacteria are limited. The present study also provides new data on in vitro antibacterial activities of chloroxine against diarrheagenic bacteria in addition to those previously published [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It has been reported that Endiaron, a chloroxine-containing antimicrobial product used for infectious diarrhea, exhibits antimicrobial activity against the pathogens and does not affect the host indigenous microbiota [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is in agreement with the increased resistance of probiotic bacteria described in the present study. Interestingly, the antipathogenic activity of nitroxoline, used to treat urinary tract infections, was higher than that of chloroxine. However, the antibacterial selectivity of nitroxoline against diarrheagenic strains was lower. Out of the intestinal bacteria tested herein, there are only data on in vitro inhibitory effects of nitroxoline against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> that have been reported before [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In spite of zinc pyrithione being only used topically for dermatological infections [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], in relation to the plant compounds and their synthetic analogs in this study, it exhibited the highest growth-inhibitory activity against diarrheagenic bacteria with lowered toxicity to probiotic bacteria. According to our best knowledge, this is the first report on in vitro selective antibacterial activities of zinc pyrithione on intestinal diarrheagenic and probiotic bacteria. Although there is limited knowledge on the mechanism underlying the antibacterial activity of zinc pyrithione, the mechanism may be similar to that of 8-hydroxyquinolines [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The weak antimicrobial activities of phenols against diarrheagenic strains are consistent with those reported in previous studies. The effectiveness of phenols in infectious diarrhea may be based on other mechanisms, such as astringent, mucosa-protective, and anti-inflammatory properties, or inhibition of pathogenic enterotoxins [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although clinical studies on extensively used phytochemical berberine have reported comparably higher efficiency than certain antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol) [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], our results did not show its significant in vitro antibacterial activity. A possible reason for this discordance is that berberine rather neutralizes diarrheagenic action of bacteria by inhibiting their enterotoxins, as described by Sack and Froelich [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The MICs of both benzylisoquinoline alkaloids against some diarrheagenic bacteria reported in this study were higher than those reported in previous studies. This may be because the inoculum density used in this study was higher than that used in previous studies [
