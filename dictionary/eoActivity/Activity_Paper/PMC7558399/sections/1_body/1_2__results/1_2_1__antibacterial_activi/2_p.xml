 <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>longum</italic> (MICs = 8–32 μg/mL), the remaining bifidobacteria were also susceptible to ceftriaxone (MICs = 1–4 μg/mL). However, considering the MIC range (MICs = 0.5–32 μg/mL) shown against lactobacilli and the low activity against 
 <italic>B. fragilis</italic> (MIC = 128 μg/mL), the variation of activities of this drug against probiotic bacteria is quite high. The exceptionally strong activities against 
 <italic>B. fragilis</italic> were revealed by metronidazole and tetracycline (MICs = 0.5 μg/mL), whereas the MIC (4 μg/mL) of nitroxoline against this bacterium was the same as in the case of chloramphenicol. In general, berberine (MICs ≥ 32 μg/mL), ferron (MICs ≥ 64 μg/mL), and phenolic compounds (MICs ≥ 64 μg/mL) did not exhibit significant antibacterial activities against any of the 21 strains.
