    "A desirable attribute of novel antimicrobial agents for bacterial diarrhea is decreased toxicity toward host intestinal microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. In this study, the selective growth-inhibitory activities of ten phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs (berberine, bismuth subsalicylate, ferron, 8-hydroxyquinoline, chloroxine, nitroxoline, salicylic acid, sanguinarine, tannic acid, and zinc pyrithione), as well as those of six commercial antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, tetracycline, and vancomycin) against 21 intestinal pathogenic/probiotic (e.g., <i>Salmonella</i> spp. and bifidobacteria) bacterial strains and three intestinal cancer/normal (Caco-2, HT29, and FHs 74 Int) cell lines were examined in vitro using the broth microdilution method and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. Chloroxine, ciprofloxacin, nitroxoline, tetracycline, and zinc pyrithione exhibited the most potent selective growth-inhibitory activity against pathogens, whereas 8-hydroxyquinoline, chloroxine, nitroxoline, sanguinarine, and zinc pyrithione exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. None of the tested antibiotics were cytotoxic to normal cells, whereas 8-hydroxyquinoline and sanguinarine exhibited selective antiproliferative activity against cancer cells. These findings indicate that 8-hydroxyquinoline alkaloids and metal-pyridine derivative complexes are chemical structures derived from plants with potential bioactive properties in terms of selective antibacterial and anticancer activities against diarrheagenic bacteria and intestinal cancer cells."
