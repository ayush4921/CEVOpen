<p>For the treatment of coronavirus infections, two different research streams could be possibly followed to search useful phytotherapeutic compounds. One option is the herbal remedies that have potential preventive effects especially boosting the immune responses, that is, 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> and 
 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (Block &amp; Mead, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Astragals has been used in TCM herbal formulation against SARS (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Immunomodulatory properties of polysaccharides and Uncaria tomentosa (from medicinal mushrooms) could also be used. The second option is the herbal remedies with therapeutic effects that have different antiviral mechanism of action. Regardless the etiology, clinical studies have proposed extract from plants, such as 
 <italic>Pelargonium sidoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> to treat the infection of respiratory system (Agbabiaka, Guo, &amp; Ernst, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Hawkins, Baker, Cherry, &amp; Dunne, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Kalus et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The anticoronaviral activities of polyphenols and pelargonium has also been studied (Michaelis, Doerr, &amp; Cinatl Jr, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Weng et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). A set of compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol, and cryptotanshinone have been identified with anti‐SARS‐CoV action (Zhang, Wu, Zhang, Deng, &amp; Peng, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Active compounds derived from medicinal plants has different antiviral mechanisms, such as viral pentation inhibition, replication inhibition or inhibiting the SARS‐3CLpro activity (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Such studies can expand the area of plant‐based products to be investigated in future experiments. Similarly, the phytotherapy can be useful in the management or prevention the adverse effects of conventional drugs (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).
