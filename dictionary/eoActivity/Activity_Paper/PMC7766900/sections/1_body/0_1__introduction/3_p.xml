<p>Naringenin is known to have poor water solubility, which affects its overall bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The pharmacological activities associated with naringenin have been attributed to its ability to suppress oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals generated during various basal metabolic conditions [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Presently, attempts are made for the de novo synthesis of pharmacologically numerous active flavonoids, including naringenin from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, in order to ensure their cost-effective high production [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this article, we attempt to review the available scientific literature on various biological and pharmacological properties of naringenin. We exploited two largely available scientific databases, PubMed and Google Scholar, for literature search. The literature was searched using keywords, such as “polyphenols”, “flavonoids”, “aglycone”, “naringin”, “naringenin”, “sources of naringenin”, “forms of naringenin”, “structure activity relationship for naringenin”, “bioavailability of naringenin”, “pharmacokinetics of naringenin”, “pharmacodynamics of naringenin”, “in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of naringenin such as anti-cancer, anti-diabetic”, “hepatoprotective”, “neuro-protective”, “cardio-protective”, “nephron-protective”, and “gastro-protective and immune-modulatory effects”. Only a few clinical trials on naringin or naringenin were registered at 
 <uri>clinicaltrials.gov</uri> [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating that tremendous efforts are required for the transition of this natural product from preclinical to clinical use. The information from different research reports was collected and presented in different relevant sections and subsections of this review.
