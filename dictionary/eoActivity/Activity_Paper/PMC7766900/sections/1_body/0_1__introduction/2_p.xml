<p>Naringenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavonone) is mainly found in citrus fruits (grapefruit and oranges) and tomatoes. It is synthesized from an aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine, and has been found in different conjugated forms, primarily as aglycone, neohesperidoside, and glycosylated forms. Each of these forms differs in its pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) properties. The richest source of naringenin is grapefruits, where it is present as an inactive glycone form called “naringin.” Chemically, naringin is a 4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavonone 7-rhamnoglucoside that is hydrolyzed by the intestinal bacterial naringinase enzyme soon after its ingestion, resulting in the production of two intermediates, rhamnose and naringenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavonone—the most active aglycone form) [
