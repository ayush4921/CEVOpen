<p>Pink grapefruit is a hybrid citrus fruit produced by cross-hybridization of sweet orange (
 <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic>) and pomelo (
 <italic>Cucurbita maxima</italic>). It is known to be rich in naringenin. It increases temporal cardiac repolarization dispersion and therefore prolongs repolarization. In patients with structural disorders of the myocardium, it may be of value because of its pro-arrhythmic actions [

Amendment of left ventricular functions has also been reported. The action mechanism is thought to be via inhibition of ERK, PI3K/Akt, and JNK signaling pathways [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) is one of the key ROSs, produced endogenously in the respiratory cascade of mitochondria and as a byproduct of basal metabolism. There are several other organs, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisome, that are thought to be its primary site of production. Due to its potent oxidative property, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> induces severe detrimental effects on cardiomyoblasts, which may be reversed by naringenin treatments. Synthesis of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and nitric oxide) decreases stress-facilitated apoptosis and lipid peroxidation with subsequent increase GSH levels. Naringenin has also shown upregulation in the transcription of Akt and Nrf2 coupled with downregulation of Caspase-3 and NF-ÎºB genes. It also prevents apoptosis in H9c2 cardiac myocytes through inactivation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and decreases the expressions of apoptosis (mitochondrial pathway) regulating proteins of Bcl-2 such as Bax and Bak [
