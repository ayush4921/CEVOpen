<p>In comparison to other body tissues, nerve cells are extremely sensitive to oxidative insults for the following reasons. (1) Brain cells are enriched in metal ions and polyunsaturated fatty acids. With the progression of time and age, the metal ions are accumulated in the brain, thus facilitating the formation of oxidative species. On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids are more liable to oxidation and therefore may be responsible for oxidative stress. (2) In comparison to other cells, neuronal cells highly rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their main source of energy. (3) There is a lack of defense mechanisms operating in brain because it contains very meager quantities of antioxidant enzymes. These factors provide distinct evidence that the oversensitivity of nerve cells towards the stress is initiated and instigated by ROS [
