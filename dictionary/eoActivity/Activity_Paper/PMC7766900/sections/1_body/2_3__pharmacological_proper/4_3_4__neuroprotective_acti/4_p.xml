<p>The increase in the concentration of free radicals in neuronal cells may inhibit Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Rats exposed to iron have exhibited diminution in AChE levels, whereas naringenin administration to iron-exposed rats revealed a significant restoration in AChE activity due to its effective antioxidant potential [

Naringenin also has the potential to protect the integrity of cells by controlling the antioxidant defense systemsâ€”both enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic ones. Therefore, naringenin can have modulatory effects on neuronal cholinergic neurotransmission resting membrane potential, directly or indirectly [
