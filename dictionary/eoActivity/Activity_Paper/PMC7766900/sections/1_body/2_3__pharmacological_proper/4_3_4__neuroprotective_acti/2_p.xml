<p>It is a well-established fact that oxidative stress is substantially enhanced during the aging process, which may play an important role in increasing the vulnerability of neuronal systems to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s [

The lesion induced by 6-OHDA in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to continuous depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) thus increasing oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B124-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The evidence in favor of neuroprotection is supported by the affinity of naringenin towards the striatum and cerebral cortex [

The rotenone-induced PD model has also reported promising results in the administration of naringenin, with significant restoration of motor skills, body weight, expression of parkin, DJ-1, tyrosine hydroxylase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in the striatum and substantia nigra [

Among the disorders of CNS, Alzheimer’s disease holds the maximum potential of negatively affecting the capability of learning and memory. It is usually characterized by amplified institution of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques. Alterations induced due to age in monoaminergic neurotransmitters (serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine) with an increase in tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase activity have also been reported. The Alzheimer rat model replicated by Aβ-injection has revealed improvement in cognitive functions through alleviation of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis on treatment with naringenin [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Studies reveal that naringenin could prove helpful in reversing the cognitive loss associated with AD by upregulating insulin signaling in the rat brain [
