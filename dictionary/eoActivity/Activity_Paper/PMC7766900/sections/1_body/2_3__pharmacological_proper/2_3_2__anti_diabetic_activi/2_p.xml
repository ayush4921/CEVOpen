<p>Hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels in the body, is the primary indication of diabetes. Glucose and maltose are the catabolic byproducts of starch [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], which are in turn catalyzed by α-glucosidase and α-amylase. It has been reported that inhibition of the activity of these key enzymes can result in the decreased levels of blood glucose. Utilization of these enzyme targets can serve as potential remedies for improving diabetes-related disorders. Naringenin has been found to possess effective anti-diabetic potential, which is attributed to its ability to inhibit α-glucosidase and α- amylase [
