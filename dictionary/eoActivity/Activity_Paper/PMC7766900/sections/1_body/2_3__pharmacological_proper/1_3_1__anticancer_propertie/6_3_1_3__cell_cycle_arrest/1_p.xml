<p>In response to growth-stimulating signals, cells progress through the various distinct stages of the cell cycle like G1, S, G2, and M, each of which is regulated by activated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are activated after adhering to a family of proteins called cyclins. For each phase of the cell cycle, there are diverse stage-specific groups of cyclins and CDKs. There are two families of CDK inhibitors, including p21, p27, and p57, which regulate the cell cycle. Mutation in any of the cell-cycle-regulating genes results in either overexpression or dysregulation of cyclins/CDKs, thus assisting the progression of cancerous cells into the uncontrolled mass of dividing cells. In vitro studies have revealed that naringenin exhibited anti-cancer activity by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase along with the induction of apoptosis [

The inhibition may be achieved via upregulation of p53-independent p21/WAF1. Suppression of cyclin E/CDK2 and Cyclin A/ CDK2 has also been reported [
