<p>The mechanism of carcinogenesis takes place in two distinct stages: initiation and progression. The progression stage of carcinogenesis involves products of several genes (especially tumor suppressors) [

Investigations have revealed that the generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) is one of the key mechanisms responsible for promoting different stages of cancer [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Naringenin, as an antioxidant, does efficiently counter such effects. Additionally, restriction to the formation of precancerous lesions via regulation of hyperproliferation has also been reported as one of the bio-effects of naringenin [
