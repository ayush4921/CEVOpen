<p>Cancers arise due to dysregulated apoptosis in addition to the change of other pathways like upregulation of growth-promoting oncogenes and downregulation of tumor suppressor genes. Similarly, cell apoptosis, like cell growth, is also tightly regulated by certain promoter and inhibitor genes. Apoptosis does involve several genes for two specific pathways, including intrinsic (
 <italic>BAX, BAK, APAF-1,</italic> and caspase family) and extrinsic (
 <italic>TRAIL, TRADD, FADD, FAS,</italic> etc.) pathways. Activation of caspases such as 3 and 9, following release of cytochrome-c, happens to be the pathway that flavonoids trace for inducing apoptosis [

The pro-apoptotic action on cell lines expressing ERα is either by the inhibition of ERα-dependent mitogenic signaling cascade activation (e.g., phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT) or by induction of ERα-dependent p38 kinase activation (a member of the mitogen activating protein kinase family) [

It has been also found that naringenin modulates cellular membrane biophysical parameters such as membrane fluidity, membrane protein and bilayer structures, lipid molecule packaging, and hydration and thereby induces mitochondrial potential and promotes apoptotic activity [
