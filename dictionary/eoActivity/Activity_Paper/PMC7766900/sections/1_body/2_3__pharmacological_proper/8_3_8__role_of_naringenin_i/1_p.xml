<p>Lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and pulmonary fibrosis are chronic airway inflammatory diseases (CAID) characterized by inflammatory response by the respiratory tract against certain external agents, including pathogens, smoke, and dust particles, resulting in increased production of inflammatory cells, mucous production, and inflammatory mediators causing impaired lung function. The inflammatory response in CAID is believed to be mediated by numerous inflammatory factors such as inflammatory cytokines, interleukins, glucocorticoid receptors, tumor necrosis factors (TNF-a), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). These inflammatory factors result in elevated oxidative stress, which stimulates immune responses, promotes hyper-responsiveness of the bronchi, and increases the secretion of mucin [
