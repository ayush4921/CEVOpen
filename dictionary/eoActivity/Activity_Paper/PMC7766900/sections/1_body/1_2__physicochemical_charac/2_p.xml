<p>Naringenin has a very low affinity for water with a water solubility near 46 ± 6 µg/mL, which limits its oral bioavailability to approximately ~5.81%. It undergoes rapid hepatic first-pass metabolism and is transformed into glucuronide intermediary products, resulting in its limited bioavailability in plasma. Sun et al. reported that the t
 <sub>1/2</sub> of naringenin is about 4.69 h, along with C
 <sub>max</sub> = 2910.6 ng/mL and area under curve (AUC)  =  40,607.9 ng/mL after oral ingestion (Zhi Zhu Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine) [

The authors suggested that, despite its fast absorption, the bioavailability of naringenin remained low due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine. After oral intake of naringin or grapefruit juice, significant concentrations of naringenin have been found in peripheral blood and urine [

These techniques include liposomes, nanoparticles, self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS), and nanosuspensions to improve its bioavailability, which would enhance its clinical applications [
