<p>In the present review, we have presented broad pharmacological aspects of naringenin reflected from the latest research. Evidence from collected literature has revealed that naringenin has several notable pharmacological properties, e.g., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, and anticancer. There are many molecular mechanisms fundamental to the pleotropic activities of naringenin, which involve the amalgamation of cellular signaling pathways at numerous levels of different diseases. Despite its tremendous potential in augmenting different diseases, naringenin is limited by a bioavailability problem, like other polyphenols. Methods to enhance the bioavailability of naringenin must be investigated to enhance the efficiency of naringenin as a therapeutic. Further active research is warranted to discover the promising therapeutic potentials of naringenin with respect to the promotion of better human health. Parallel research is also needed to enhance its bioavailability, which is instrumental in exerting the effective pharmacological effects of naringenin.</p>
