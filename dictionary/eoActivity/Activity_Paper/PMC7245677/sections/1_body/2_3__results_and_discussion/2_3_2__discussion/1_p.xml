<p>Among the tested extracts and essential oils, there were four crude extracts (
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum morifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Tagetes erecta</italic>, and 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale)</italic> and three essential oils (
 <italic>A. conyzoides, A. vulgaris,</italic> and 
 <italic>H. annuus</italic>) indicating the antimicrobial activity against nine bacteria and three yeast strains. While the crude extracts only had effects on bacteria, the essential oils had effects on both bacteria and yeast strains. There are many reports about antiseptic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and insecticidal activities of essential oils [

Chemical constituents represented in essential oils are usually derived from terpenes, phenolic compounds, and aromatic or aliphatic acid esters, which can partition into the lipids of bacterial and mitochondrial membrane resulting in disturbing the cell structures. The death of cells is caused by leakage of a large number of essential molecules and ions from the bacterial cell [
