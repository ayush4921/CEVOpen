<p>DPPH screening test showed the good antioxidant effects of all crude extracts and essential oils. Free-radical scavenging activity of total ethanol extracts was quantitatively determined using a DPPH assay. IC
 <sub>50</sub> value represents the concentration of tested extract, at which the inhibition of test activity reached 50% (

 <sub>50</sub> values of essential oils were too large (3000–6000
