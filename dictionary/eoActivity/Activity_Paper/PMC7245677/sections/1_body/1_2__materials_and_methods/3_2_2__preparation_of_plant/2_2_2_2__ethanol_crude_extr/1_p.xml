<p>Plant materials (50 g) were extracted by cold soaking with 500 ml of 96% ethanol (Xilong Chemical) for 24 hours at 10 : 1 solvent-to-sample ratio (v/w). Then, the mixtures were filtered through Whatman filter paper. The extracts were allowed to evaporate at a temperature of 45–50°C with water bath WNB 29 (Memmert). These steps were repeated three times to achieve maximal extraction of compounds. Dried crude extracts were weighed and kept at −35°C till further use (not more than one month). These extracts had been screened for antimicrobial activity with well agar diffusion method to choose the good antimicrobial extracts for the next step.</p>
