<p>The antimicrobial activity of the samples was initially evaluated by the well agar diffusion assay for the extracts and disc diffusion assay for the essential oils [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The growth medium was poured into Petri dishes at 45–50°C, approximately 4 mm depth, and they were left to solidify in the laminar-flow hood. Subsequently, a sterile cotton swab was dipped into overnight microbial suspensions (adjusted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard). Agar plates were inoculated by evenly streaking cotton swab over the agar medium.
