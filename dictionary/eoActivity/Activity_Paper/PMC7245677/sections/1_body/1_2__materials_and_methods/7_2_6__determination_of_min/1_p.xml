<p>Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the extracts and essential oils was done using the agar dilution method [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Stock solutions were diluted with melted agar to a concentration range so that the following concentration is equal to half the previous concentration. Subsequently, the agar was poured into Petri discs and waited for them to solidify in the laminar-flow hood. Microorganism suspensions at 0.5 McFarland were diluted by 0.85% NaCl solution to reach 1–1.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/ml for bacteria and 1–5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. These suspensions were spotted (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) on the agar surface. Bacterial or yeast colonies growth at the spot after incubating at 37°C for 24–48 hours indicated for the assay. The MIC is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits growth. The experiment was replicated three times.
