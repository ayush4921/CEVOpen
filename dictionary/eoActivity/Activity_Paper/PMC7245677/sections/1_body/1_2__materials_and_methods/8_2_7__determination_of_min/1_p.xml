<p>To determine the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the spots at MIC, 2MIC, 4MIC, and 8MIC were washed with 1 ml of 0.85% NaCl. The 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the washing suspension was spread evenly over BHA agar. After 24–48 hours of incubation at 37°C, the number of surviving bacteria was determined. The MBC was defined as the lowest extract concentration at which 99.9% of the bacteria have been killed. The experiment was replicated three times.
