<p>We conducted investigations on antimicrobial activities of nine Asteraceae species collected from Southern Vietnam, following 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In particular, after pretreating and extracting herbal samples to obtain crude extracts and essential oils, we evaluated the antimicrobial effect by applying the diffusion method. The extracts which show activity were fractionated by 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate, respectively. The well-agar-diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial capacities of fractions. Fractions which indicated inhibitory zone were evaluated with MIC and MBC. DPPH free-radical scavenging assays were carried out on crude extracts [
