 <p>Asteraceae species were widely applied in traditional medicines in Asian countries as sources of natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to evaluate DPPH-scavenging capacities and antimicrobial activities of nine Asteraceae species collected from Southern Vietnam. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were determined by standard protocols. Essential oils from 
  <italic>Ageratum conyzoides, Helianthus annuus,</italic> and 
  <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic> indicated significant inhibitory effects on 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
  <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Crude extracts and fractions from 
  <italic>Taraxacum officinale, Chrysanthemum morifolium</italic>, 
  <italic>A. conyzoides,</italic> and 
  <italic>Tagetes erecta</italic> showed inhibitory ability on at least one testing bacterial strains including 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. In a study on clinical isolates, ethyl acetate fraction from 
  <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> flower displayed the most potent effect on uropathogenic 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
  <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with MIC at 1.25–10 mg/ml and 5–12.5 mg/ml, respectively. DPPH-scavenging assay indicated that 
  <italic>T. erecta</italic> extract had the lowest IC
  <sub>50</sub> (17.280 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and is 2.4 times higher than vitamin C (7.321 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). This study revealed that 
  <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> has good potential against uropathogenic 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
  <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> and therefore could be applied for prophylactic treatment of urinary infection.
