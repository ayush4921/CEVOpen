  <italic>Muehlenbeckia volcanica</italic> (Benth.) Endl. (
  <italic>M. volcanica</italic>), native to South America, is a traditional Peruvian medicinal plant that has multi-therapeutic properties; however, no phytochemicals have been identified from it yet. In this study, a five-step polarity-stepwise elution counter-current chromatography (CCC) was developed using methanol/water (1:5, 
  <italic>v</italic>/
  <italic>v</italic>) as the stationary phase and different ratios of 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate, and 
  <italic>n</italic>-butanol as mobile phases to separate the compounds from the 70% methanol extract of 
  <italic>M. volcanica,</italic> by which six compounds with a wide range of polarities were separated in a single run of CCC and were identified as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid, rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. Then, two compounds from the fractions of stepwise elution CCC were separated using conventional high-speed CCC, pH-zone-refining CCC, and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and identified as shikimic acid and miquelianin. These compounds are reported from 
  <italic>M. volcanica</italic> for the first time. Notably, except for shikimic acid, all other compounds showed anti-diabetic potentials via antioxidant, antiglycation, and aldose reductase inhibition. The results suggest that the polarity-stepwise elution CCC can be used to efficiently separate or fractionate compounds with a wide range of polarities from natural products. Moreover, 
  <italic>M. volcanica</italic> and its bioactive compounds are potent anti-diabetic agents.
