<p>A 96-well plate-based AR inhibition assay was used in this study, which was modified from a previous method [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In principle, the rate of the absorbance decrease of NADPH at 340 nm (OD340 nm) was used for evaluation of the AR inhibitory activity. In brief, 110 µL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0), 20 μL of AR homogenate, 20 μL of NADPH (2.4 mM in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.0), 10 μL of sample (extract 12.5–200 μg/mL; compounds 0.98–1000 μM), and 20 μL of ammonium sulfate solution (4 M in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0) were sequentially added into a 96-well plate. Then, as soon as 20 μL of the substrate (DL-glyceraldehyde dimer, 25 mM in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0) was added, the absorbance of the reaction solution at 340 nm was measured for 6 min using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Highland Park, IL, USA). Quercetin was used as a positive control. The samples were first prepared at high concentrations in DMSO or in a mixture of DMSO and water and then diluted using water shortly before the experiment. The concentration of DMSO was kept within 0.2% (
