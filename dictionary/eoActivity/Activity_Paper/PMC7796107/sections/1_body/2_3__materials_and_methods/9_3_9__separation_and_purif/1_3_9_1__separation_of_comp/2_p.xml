<p>Compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was concentrated by polarity-stepwise elution CCC as a mixture of compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>, which was further separated by pH-zone-refining CCC. Briefly, the HSCCC coil was first filled with the stationary phase; then, the rotation speed of the apparatus was adjusted to 900 rpm. About 165 mg of the mixture of compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> was dissolved in 15 mL of the stationary phase and loaded in the sample loop (maximum 20 mL). Then, the separation was initiated by introducing the mobile phase at 3 mL/min. Notably, the eluate was monitored and automatically collected according to UV absorbance at 250 nm rather than according to pH detection.
