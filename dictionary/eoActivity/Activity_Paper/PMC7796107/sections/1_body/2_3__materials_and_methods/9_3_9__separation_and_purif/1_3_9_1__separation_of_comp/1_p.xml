<p>Equal volumes of 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol and water (each 1 L) were thoroughly mixed in a separating funnel and then separated after settling. The partitioned upper layer was acidified by trifluoroacetic acid at a concentration of 26 mM (pH = 1.5) and selected as the stationary phase, while the partitioned lower layer was basified by ammonia solution at a concentration of about 45 mM (pH = 11) and used as the mobile phase. Both the stationary and mobile phases were degassed by sonication for at least 20 min before use.
