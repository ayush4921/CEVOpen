<p>The HPLC detection of the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic>, its fractions, and its compounds was carried out using Dionex equipment (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with a P850 pump, an ASI-100 automated sample injector, an STH585 column oven (maintained at 30 °C), and a UVD170S detector. The gradient elution of samples (10 µL) was carried out using acidified water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, A) and methanol (B) at 0.7 mL/min, as follows: 5–25% B from 0–15 min; 25–60% B from 15–40 min; 60–100% B from 40–43 min; 100–5% B from 43–45 min; and 5% B from 45–55 min. The eluate was monitored at 225, 250, and 300 nm. The samples were mainly analyzed using a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP 80 Å column (150 × 4.60 mm, 4 µm), except the two samples shown in

 <bold>7</bold> (300 nm) and a high-purity compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (300 nm), which were analyzed using an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 80 Å column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 µm).
