<p>The polarity-stepwise elution CCC separation was conducted using a tail-to-head elution mode. In brief, the CCC coil was first filled with the stationary phase, solvent methanol/water (1:5,

 <italic>v</italic>), and then, the rotation speed of the apparatus was adjusted to 900 rpm. Then, the mobile phase I was pumped in at 3 mL/min until a hydrodynamic equilibrium was achieved, as indicated by a steady elution of the mobile phase from the column outlet line. After that, about 2 g of sample was prepared in 17 mL of a solvent system composed of the stationary phase and the mobile phase I and loaded to the sample loop (maximum 20 mL) for separation. Five mobile phases were used to sequentially elute the compounds with polarities from low to high at 3 mL/min as follows: mobile phase I, 350–600 mL; mobile phase II, 600–970 mL; mobile phase III, 970–1340 mL; mobile phase IV, 1340–1480 mL; and mobile phase V, 1480–1890 mL. The eluate was monitored at 225 and 250 nm and automatically collected according to 250 nm. After the separation was completed, the stationary phase was then pumped out by air and collected by a graduated cylinder for calculation of the stationary phase retention ratio as
