<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was concentrated by polarity-stepwise elution CCC as a mixture of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, which was then separated by conventional HSCCC. In brief, the HSCCC coil was first filled with the stationary phase, and the rotation rate of the apparatus was then adjusted to 900 rpm. After that, the mobile phase was introduced at 2 mL/min until a hydrodynamic equilibrium was reached, as indicated by a steady elution of the mobile phase from the column outlet line. Then, about 1 g of the mixture of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> was dissolved in 14 mL of diphasic solvent system and loaded to a sample loop (maximum 20 mL) for separation at an elution speed of 2 mL/min. The eluate was monitored at 225 and 250 nm and collected according to 250 nm.
