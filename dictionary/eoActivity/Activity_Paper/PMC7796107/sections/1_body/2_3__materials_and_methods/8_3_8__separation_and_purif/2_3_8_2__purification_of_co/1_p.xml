<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> separated by conventional HSCCC was found to be impure by HPLC analysis at 225 nm, which was further purified by a preparative HPLC (LC-908; JAI, Japan) using a pre-column (Φ20 × 500 mm; JAIGEL-GS310). Briefly, about 190 mg of the impure compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was dissolved in 1.6 mL of water and loaded to the sample loop (maximum 2 mL) for purification. The water was acidified with 13 mM of trifluoroacetic acid and used as the mobile phase to elute compound 
 <bold>2</bold> at 3 mL/min, with the monitoring wavelength set at 225 nm.
