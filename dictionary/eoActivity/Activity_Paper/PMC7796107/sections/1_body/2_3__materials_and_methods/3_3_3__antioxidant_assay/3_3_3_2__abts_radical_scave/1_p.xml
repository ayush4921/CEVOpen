<p>The ABTS radical scavenging assay was carried out using the same EL800 microplate reader [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, 0.2 mM of ABTS diammonium salt was prepared in 3.5 mM of potassium persulfate aqueous solution, and the mixture solution was then diluted 10 times using distilled water. The diluted solution was allowed to stand for 24 h in the dark at room temperature (about 25 °C) to produce ABTS radical cations (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>). For reaction, 290 μL of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution was mixed with 10 μL of sample (dissolved in methanol, extract 62.5–125 µg/mL; compounds 20–250 µM) in a 96-well plate, and the mixture solution was allowed to react for 10 min at 25 °C in the dark. Then, the absorbance was measured at 750 nm. Trolox was used as a positive control, which showed a linear radical inhibition curve within a final concentrations of 0.13 µg/mL (0.52 µM) and 4.17 µg/mL (16.67 µM). Results are expressed in µg Trolox equivalents/µg extract or µM Trolox equivalents/µM compound. The ABTS radical scavenging activity (%) is calculated using Equation (1) where
