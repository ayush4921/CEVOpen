<p>All activity assays were conducted with at least three repetitions, with the results given as mean Â± standard deviations (SD). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) of antiglycation agents and AR inhibitors were calculated through either linear regression or logarithmic analysis, which should satisfy each regression coefficient with more than 0.95 (r
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.95). The statistical analyses of the bioactivities of the separated compounds were carried out using SPSS software (Version 25; IBM, New York, NY, USA). A significant difference exists when
