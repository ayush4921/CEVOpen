 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> showed good dose-dependent AR inhibitory activities and, especially, the latter showed higher AR inhibitory activity than the former by giving IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.37 µg/mL and 1.18 µg/mL, respectively.
