<p>DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) assays have been widely used to determine the antioxidant activities of natural products as they are simple to operate, rapid to obtain results, and low-cost, whereas ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assay combines both inhibition percentage and time of the free radical action by antioxidants in a single quantity [

Since no single method is sufficient to evaluate the antioxidant activity of samples, therefore, these three methods were performed in this study. The results were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC, µg Trolox/µg extract), which were calculated with the equations obtained from the calibration curves of Trolox standards (final concentrations) versus their DPPH and ABTS radical inhibition (%) and the net area under the curve (AUC) value (ORAC assay). A larger TEAC value indicates that the sample tested has higher antioxidant activity. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, a strong radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS radicals was found in the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic>, which exhibited about half the antioxidant activity of Trolox (0.48–0.49 µg Trolox/µg extract), and this is consistent with a previous study (documented as synonym 
 <italic>Muehlenbeckia volcanica</italic> Meisn.) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, for the first time, the extract was found to have higher peroxyl radical scavenging (ORAC assay) activity than Trolox by showing a TEAC value of 1.10 µg Trolox/µg extract.
