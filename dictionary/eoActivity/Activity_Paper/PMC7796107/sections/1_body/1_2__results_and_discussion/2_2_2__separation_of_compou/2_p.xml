<p>The methanol/water (1:5,

 <italic>v</italic>) solvent was selected as the stationary phase of the polarity-stepwise elution CCC, since the settling times and phase ratios (upper phase to lower phase) of the newly paired solvent systems composed of the stationary phase, methanol/water (1:5, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), and individual mobile phases with polarities from low to high (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), were within the range of the recommended values: their settling times were less than 30 s, and the phase ratios were close to 1 (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A short settling time usually facilitates the retention of the stationary phase in the HSCCC column and a rapid settling time is recommended to be shorter than 30 s [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. That the phase ratios of each newly paired solvent system were close to 1 might help maintain the retention of the stationary phase. Thus, all the solvents shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> are acceptable as alternative mobile phases for the stepwise elution CCC separation.
