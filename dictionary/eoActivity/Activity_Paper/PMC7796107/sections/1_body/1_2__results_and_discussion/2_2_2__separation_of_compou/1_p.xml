<p>As a versatile separation technique based on fast solvent-solvent partition, HSCCC has many advantageous properties such as high separation efficiency, high sample loading capacity, absence of irreversible absorption, and low risk of sample denaturation, and, therefore, it has been widely used for the separation of bioactive compounds from natural products [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A successful separation by conventional HSCCC usually relies on the selection of a suitable biphasic solvent system that offers ideal partition coefficients (
 <italic>K</italic> values) (0.5 ≤ 
 <italic>K</italic> ≤ 2.0) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or “sweet spot” 
 <italic>K</italic> values (0.4 ≤ 
 <italic>K</italic> ≤ 2.5) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and suitable separation factors (
 <italic>α</italic> values) (
 <italic>α</italic> ≥ 1.5) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We first tested a series of isocratic 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethyl acetate/
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol/methanol/water solvent systems developed by Ito [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to determine the 
 <italic>K</italic> values of the compounds in the extract. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00224">Table S1</xref>, the compounds from the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> were found to have a wide range of polarities; however, more than six runs of conventional HSCCC could be required for the separation or fractionation of those compounds, which would be time- and solvent-consuming. Therefore, a more efficient solvent polarity-stepwise elution CCC separation strategy was proposed.
