<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, quercitrin showed the most potent AR inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.17 µM), followed by rutin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.51 µM), miquelianin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 9.04 µM), quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 16.57 µM), and 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 47.00 µM), whereas shikimic acid, gallic acid, and protocatechuic acid showed weak activity against AR within the concentrations tested (6.25–50 µM). Results indicated that the 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of quercetin with D-glucuronide (miquelianin), D-rutinoside (rutin), and particular L-rhamnose (quercitrin) could increase the AR inhibitory activity of quercetin, which was also observed in previous studies [

 <italic>n</italic>-induced diabetic cats possibly through the inhibition of AR [

However, compounds 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid and miquelianin are reported to have AR inhibitory activities for the first time in this study. Nevertheless, considering that miquelianin exhibited greater AR inhibitory activity than quercetin, miquelianin, similar to quercetin, also has the potential to prevent or treat diabetic complications. Furthermore, in addition to the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications, AR inhibitors also have the potential to suppress oxidative stress-induced inflammatory complications [
