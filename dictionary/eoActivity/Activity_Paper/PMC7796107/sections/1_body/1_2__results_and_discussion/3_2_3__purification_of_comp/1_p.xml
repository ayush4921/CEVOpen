<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, concentrated by stepwise elution CCC, could not be easily separated by column chromatography due to their close HPLC retention times, and then, the conventional HSCCC was used to separate compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, four solvent systems were tested, and 26 mM of the trifluoroacetic acid-modified solvent system 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was selected to separate compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> by conventional HSCCC, since the 
 <italic>K</italic> and 
 <italic>α</italic> values of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> offered by this solvent system were acceptable by giving 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.59, 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.39, and 
 <italic>α</italic> (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) = 1.52. Then, the HSCCC separation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) was carried out using this solvent system as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot8dot1-molecules-26-00224">Section 3.8.1</xref>. About 732 mg of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) was separated from 1 g of the mixture of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> could not be found in any of the HSCCC fractions or in the solvent remaining in the coiled column. Then, about 190 mg of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) was further purified using preparative HPLC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), and about 152.8 mg of high-purity compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>E) was obtained.
