 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>G), compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was concentrated by stepwise elution CCC as a mixture of compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>, however, they might be difficult to separate using column chromatography due to their close HPLC retention times. So, we decided to separate compound 
 <bold>7</bold> using HSCCC. Considering that the Î± value between compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>, offered by the solvent system (ethyl acetate/
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol 4:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>)/(methanol/water 1:5, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) 1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, was less than 1.5 (

 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>8</sub>/
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>7</sub> = 1.17/0.80), then a small amount of trifluoroacetic acid was added to this solvent system to modify the 
 <italic>K</italic> values of 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>. Surprisingly, the 
 <italic>K</italic> value of 
 <bold>7</bold> increased dramatically after the solvent system was modified by trifluoroacetic acid, indicating that 
 <bold>7</bold> might be an acid compound. Thus, we decided to separate 
 <bold>7</bold> using pH-zone-refining CCC, which is a technique for the separation of ionizable compounds [
