<p>Possessing advantageous properties of high separation efficiency, high sample loading capacity, and absence of irreversible adsorption, etc., high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) has been widely used for the separation of bioactive compounds from natural products [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the separation of multiple compounds with a wide range of polarities from a complex natural product could not be satisfactorily achieved by using a single solvent system. In contrast, the stepwise elution counter-current chromatography (CCC) approach is more powerful to separate the compounds with a wide range of polarities from natural product extracts, which can offer a broader range of polarities to be covered in one run than in isocratic mode, and, therefore, improves the separation efficiency and minimizes the use of solvents and time [
