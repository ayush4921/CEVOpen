<p>Natural products are important resources of anti-diabetic agents, among which medicinal plants play an important role. The use of medicinal plants to treat diabetes and its complications has a long history, and it is still an important alternative medicine therapy for the treatment of diabetic complications and has been recommended by the World Health Organization [
