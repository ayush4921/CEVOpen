<p>Since the discovery of penicillin and its derivatives nearly a century ago, the world’s population has grown, and deaths caused by bacterial infections has fallen dramatically. However, in recent years inappropriate and overuse has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, resulting in the need to find novel antibiotics. Extracts of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> have been tested against a range of bacterial strains, and it has been shown to have effective antibiotic activities against Gram-positive strains, including 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus, Bacillus globigii, Bacillus subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. However, it was not effective against Gram-negative strains such as 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], presumably due to the difference in the cell wall made up of Gram-positive and negative bacteria. The rhinacanthin-rich ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> leaves has been shown to have activity against the ulcer and cancer-causing Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 0.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Further studies have been carried out on RnC extracted from 
 <italic>Rn</italic>, showing that the MIC
 <sub>50</sub> for RnC against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are two, eight, two and eight µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies, including RnN and RnQ, showed that the MIC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 4.9 to 19.53 µg/mL for Gram-positive bacteria but had no anti-biotic effects on Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly RnN was shown to be more potent than gentamycin in the inhibition of the Gram-positive bacteria [
