<p>Oxidative stress plays a major role in aggravating the progression of diabetic complications (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-12-03776-f002">Figure 2</xref>), as the metabolic abnormalities occurring during the process induces the generation of superoxide radicals. This toxic phenomenon further exaggerates the generation of AGE and induces the expression of its receptor [

Additionally, they could also reduce the level of lipid peroxidation and improve the levels of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), indicating the effect of the plant in reducing oxidative stress [
