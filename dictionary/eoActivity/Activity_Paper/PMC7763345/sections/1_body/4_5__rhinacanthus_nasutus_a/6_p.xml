<p>Pioneering studies suggest the relationship between chronic inflammation and the pathophysiology of diabetes, and immunomodulatory drugs have been advised in the treatment of individuals with type II diabetes [

Rhinacanthins-rich extract and RnC administration reduced the levels of free fatty acids and cholesterol, thereby attenuated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL6 in diabetic rats. In addition, the renal concentrations of caspase-3 and cytochrome C were also reduced in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Diabetes induced histological changes in the kidney such as thickening of the basement membrane of the renal tubules and necrosis of renal tubules were also reduced by the treatment of extract, indicating that the plant extracts can also be used as immunomodulatory agents in alleviating the complications of diabetes [
