<p>Among the several antidiabetic mechanisms, inhibition of α-glucosidase has been reported as the main event in exhibiting the effect, and α-glucosidase inhibitors have been widely prescribed for treating type II diabetes. α-glucosidase is involved in the conversion of starch and disaccharides to simple sugars, thereby increasing the glucose level in circulation [

In vitro studies have demonstrated that a rhinacanthin rich extract and its active constituent RnC exhibit noncompetitive inhibition against the α-glucosidase enzyme. In silico studies also showed the positive interaction and binding between RnC and α-glucosidase by hydrogen and hydrophobic bonding [
