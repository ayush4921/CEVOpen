<p>There is increasing evidence to suggest that neurodegenerative disease is not restricted to a neurological component; rather, there is a strong interaction with immunological mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, diseases such as Alzheimer’s [

 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] have evidence for immunological components. Recent work investigating the neuroprotective effects of RnC (one of the major active compounds found in 
 <italic>Rn</italic>) has shown that RnC is able to attenuate neuroinflammation brought on by LPS, Aβ, and interferon-γ in BV-2 and primary rat glial cells [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In particular, this study showed that RnC was able to reduce the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from BV-2 cells in response to LPS, Aβ, and interferon-γ, as well as reducing NO production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), IL-1β, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL-2), and CCL-5 mRNA levels in primary rat microglial cells. Furthermore, the Chuang et al. 2018 study showed that RnC could prevent damage to primary rat neurons caused by Aβ suggesting that RnC may be a potential in Alzheimer’s disease treatment. The findings from this study are in line with other studies investigating RnC on neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Chang et al. 2016 study showed that RnC could prevent increases in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA expression in animals subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study suggests that RnC may be of benefit to patients who have suffered from delayed ischemic neurologic deficit following an aneurysm by preventing neuroinflammation, and could explain the neuroprotective effects of

 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The neuroprotective effects of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> could further be explained by the finding that RnS has acetylcholinesterase activity [
