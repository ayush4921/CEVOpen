<p>Treatments for neurodegenerative diseases fall into three general categories; preventative, restorative, and regenerative. The restorative category covers most drugs available for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as levodopa for Parkinson’s and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer’s disease. These drugs are often prescribed after symptoms have begun to show, long after the initial neurodegeneration has taken place, with the aim of replacing neurotransmitters that are lost from the neurodegeneration. These treatments often only improve the symptoms but do not slow or reverse the progression of the disease in any way. Regenerative treatments are the holy grail of neurodegenerative diseases, drugs that stimulate the growth of new neurons to replace those that have been lost, thus restoring function or the implantation of stem cells that would grow and differentiate into the desired neuronal cells to replace those that were lost. For now, despite advances in the field, these kinds of drugs and therapies are still a long way from being brought to clinical trials [

Examples of preventative measures that can reduce the relative risk of developing Alzheimer’s include not smoking, maintaining an active lifestyle, maintaining a healthy weight, and treating diseases such as depression and diabetes.
