<p>There have been several studies investigating the effects of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> and its constituent compounds on tumor cell growth. The early studies showed that the crude extracts from either the leaves or the roots and some of the extracted compounds could prevent the growth of tumor cell lines (
 <xref rid="nutrients-12-03776-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) such as KB, HEP-2, MCF-7, HepG2, HeLa, SiHa, C-32, LLC, Colon-26, P-388, A-549, HT-29, HL60 and Vero [

 <italic>Rn</italic>, was found to be cytotoxic to MCF7 breast cancer cells (50 % inhibition concertation (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 8.79 μM), and RnN was cytotoxic in NCI-H187 cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.24 μM) and Vero cells (IC
