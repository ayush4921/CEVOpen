<p>In normal healthy cells, there are signals that prevent programmed cell death (apoptosis). There are also signals that lead to apoptosis, for example, when a cell is damaged or has reached the end of its lifespan. There are two classes of genes, which under the right circumstance can cause cancers. The first group is the oncogenes, with roles in the promotion of cell division and cell survival. Well-studied examples include the GTPase Ras [
