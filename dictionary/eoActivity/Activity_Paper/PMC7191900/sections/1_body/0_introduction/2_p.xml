<p>Tumour refers to the local mass formed by abnormal proliferation of local tissue under the action of various tumorigenic factors. It is one of the worldâ€™s five terminally ill diseases including motor neuron disease, AIDS, leukaemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. Cancer cells have unique properties of invasion and metastasis. Tumours disrupt cell junctions and cell signalling, leading to important gene dysfunction

At present, the main methods for treating tumours are still traditional treatments such as surgical treatment, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, which usually have strong toxic side effects and are prone to drug resistance. With the development of related disciplines such as molecular biology, research on anti-tumour drugs has also shifted to new anti-tumour drugs targeting multiple links in the mechanism of tumour development. These drugs, for example, targeting cell signalling molecules: including protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway inhibitors, cell cycle regulators, etc., are localised to target cell-specific bio-macromolecules, thereby inhibiting the growth and metastasis of tumour cells, rather than killing cells directly. Among them, FTIs are one of the hotspots in recent years, which have attracted the attention of many famous research institutions at home and abroad.
