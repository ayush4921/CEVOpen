<p>Lactone refers to the organic matter produced by dehydration of both carboxyl group and hydroxyl group in the same molecule, which is mainly classified according to the size of the ring. We summarise the inhibition of FTase by natural products and their derivatives isolated from 
 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> L., unidentified fungus, and 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. In such compounds, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the natural product as a function of side chain groups varies widely. When the groups are the same, the activity of the compounds which are isomers will also vary greatly. For example, the compounds 
 <bold>71</bold>, 
 <bold>72</bold> and the compounds 
 <bold>74</bold>, 
 <bold>75</bold> are positional isomers, but their activities differ by more than 100-fold (
