 </xref> isolated some compounds from 
 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> and obtained the corresponding chemical structure through experiments in 1998. They renamed the arteminolide (
 <bold>65</bold>) as arteminolide A, and the other compounds were named arteminolide B (
 <bold>71</bold>), arteminolide C (
 <bold>72</bold>), arteminolide D (
 <bold>73</bold>), artanomaloide A (
 <bold>74</bold>), and artanomaloide C (
 <bold>75</bold>). Among them, compounds 
 <bold>74</bold>, 
 <bold>75</bold> are regioisomers. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> enzyme assays and kinetic experiments revealed that compounds 
 <bold>71</bold>–
 <bold>73</bold> have strong inhibitory effect on recombinant human FTase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.7 to 1.1 μM. However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of artanomaloides are all over 100 μM. Arteminolides and artanomaloides have almost no inhibitory activity against rat squalene synthase and recombinant rat GGTase.
