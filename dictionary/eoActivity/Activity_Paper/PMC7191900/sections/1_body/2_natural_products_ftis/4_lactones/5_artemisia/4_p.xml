 </xref>, it was confirmed that the five compounds were artanomaloide (
 <bold>66</bold>), 8-acetylarteminolide (
 <bold>67</bold>), arteminone (
 <bold>68</bold> and 
 <bold>69</bold>), and dehydromatricarin (
 <bold>70</bold>). All the five belong to sesquiterpene lactone. Among them, compounds 
 <bold>68</bold> and 
 <bold>69</bold> are identified as stereoisomers. The inhibitory effects of five compounds on FTase were examined by scintillation proximity assay (SPA). The results show that compound 
 <bold>67</bold> selectively inhibited recombinant rat FTase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.8 μM) and weaker inhibitory activity against recombinant rat GGTase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≫ 100 μM). Compounds 
 <bold>66</bold>, 
 <bold>67</bold>, 
 <bold>68</bold>, and 
 <bold>69</bold> also had some inhibitory effects on FTase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22, 85, 82, and 300 μM). This result is important for studying the pharmacological activities of sesquiterpene lactones. Due to the special structure of 8-acetylarteminolide, Lee et al. speculated that it might be a useful lead compound for the development of anticancer drugs. Subsequent studies show that 8-acetylarteminolide does have an inhibitory effect against tumour cells
