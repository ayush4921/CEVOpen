 <bold>79</bold>, 
 <bold>80</bold>, 
 <bold>81</bold>) of chaetomellic acids A and B, together with C-12 chain compound chaetomellic acid C (
 <bold>82</bold>) and its isomers (
 <bold>83</bold>, 
 <bold>84</bold>). They also found chaetomellic acids D (
 <bold>85</bold>) and E (
 <bold>86</bold>) from a mycelial broth. These compounds all have strong or weak FTase inhibitory abilities, but no inhibitory activity against GGTase. The results of their work show that the cisoid orientation of the dicarboxylic acid and the alkyl chain of the appropriate length play an important role in the inhibitory activity against FTase. The 
 <italic>trans-</italic> and 
 <italic>vinyl-</italic>diacids reduce the inhibitory activity of the compound, and the 
 <italic>cis-</italic>diacids consisting of a shorter alkyl chain were inactive against FTase.
