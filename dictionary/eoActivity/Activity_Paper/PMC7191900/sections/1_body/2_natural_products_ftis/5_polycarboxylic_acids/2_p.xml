<p>Polycarboxylic acids are a class of carboxylic acids containing a plurality of carboxyl groups. We summarises the inhibition of FTase by polycarboxylic acids isolated from 
 <italic>Chaetomella</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Amaumarcus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Mollisia</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Phoma</italic> sp. The inhibitions of these natural products are significant. After analysing the activity and structure of each compound, it was found that several polycarboxylic acid compounds in this review had groups similar to FPP and could compete with FPP to inhibit FTase, so almost all these polycarboxylic acids compounds had good inhibitory activity. The side chain groups of polycarboxylic acids have a great influence on the activity. For example, the cis-orientation of dicarboxylic acid and the CH on the alkyl side can make the inhibitory effect more significant, while the cis-diacid composed of shorter alkyl chain can make the compound lose its inhibitory activity (
