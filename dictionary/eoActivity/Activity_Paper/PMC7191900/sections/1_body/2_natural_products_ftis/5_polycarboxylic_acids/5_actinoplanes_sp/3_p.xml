 </xref> originally extracted actinoplanic acid A (
 <bold>94</bold>) from 
 <italic>Actinoplanes</italic> sp. and determined its structure. Compound 
 <bold>94</bold> was found to compete with FPP and was also a selective inhibitor of FTase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 230 nM). Subsequently, actinoplanic acid B (
 <bold>95</bold>) was extracted from 
 <italic>Actinoplanes</italic> sp., which also exerts selective and competitive inhibition of FTase and has stronger inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 nM)

 </xref>. When analysing the structure, we found that compounds 
 <bold>94</bold> and 
 <bold>95</bold> carried more groups similar to FPP, just as Singh et al. found that they could compete with FPP to inhibit FTase, with strong inhibitory activity.
