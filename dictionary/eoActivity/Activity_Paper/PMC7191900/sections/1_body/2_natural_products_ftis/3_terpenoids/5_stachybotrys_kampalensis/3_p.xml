 </xref> isolated kampanol A-C (
 <bold>54</bold>–
 <bold>56</bold>) from 
 <italic>Stachybotrys kampalensis</italic> and synthesised a derivative of 
 <bold>56</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>54</bold>, 
 <bold>55</bold> are found to have inhibitory activity against human recombinant FPTase by biological activity assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7 and 13 μM). Nevertheless, 
 <bold>56</bold> and its derivative (
 <bold>57</bold>) have weak inhibitory activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 560 and 460 μM). Besides, none of the four compounds have inhibitory activity against GGTase.
