<p>Terpenes take isoprene unit as the basic structural unit, and are mainly classified into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. This article summarises the inhibition of FTase by natural products and their derivatives isolated from 
 <italic>Aplidium conicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Stachybotrys kampalensis,</italic> and plant essential oils. Most of the natural products and their derivatives extracted from 
 <italic>Aplidium conicum</italic> have strong FTase inhibitory activity, and the activity varies with the side chain, whereas some monoterpenoids extracted from plant essential oils are weak. Derivatives with side chains of farnesyl group generally have good inhibitory activity. Triterpenoids 
 <bold>51</bold>â€“
 <bold>57</bold> are all derived from mildew, and their activities vary greatly with the groups. Some of the monoterpenoids extracted from plant essential oils contain the least amount of isoprene unit and possess the weakest activity. Although terpenes take isoprene unit as the basic structural unit, they are mostly closed-loop structures, and only groups with chain isoprene groups or similar structures can help to inhibit FTase (
