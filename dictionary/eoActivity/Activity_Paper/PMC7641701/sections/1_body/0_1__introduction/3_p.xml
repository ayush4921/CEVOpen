<p>Despite the long history of sepsis, a significant improvement in its morbidity and mortality rate is yet to be observed. Sepsis was estimated to affect 30 million people worldwide, with up to 8 million fatalities each year [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In fact, the number of fatalities is expected to be greater since the epidemiological data on sepsis incidence and mortality rates from low- to middle-income countries was scarce [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the United States alone, an estimated 1.7 million of sepsis cases occur among adults, resulting in more than 250 000 deaths each year [
