<p>Among the plants discussed in this review, there are relatively fewer studies on 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> flower buds has been shown to inhibit lung inflammation in LPS-induced mice [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], but the active constituent responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unknown. Biflorin, an active compound isolated from the butanol-soluble fraction of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> flower buds, however, has been shown to improve the survival rate of LPS-induced endotoxemic mice [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that there is other active constituent present in the flower buds of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> that may also have antisepsis potential. Unlike the other active constituents mentioned, biflorin was originally isolated from 
 <italic>Capraria biflora</italic>, a perennial shrub distributed in North and South America [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. In contrast to the other plants, 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> has the least evidence to support its antisepsis potential. In particular, the lyophilized powder of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>, given in the form of supplemented food pellets, has been shown to have 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects in LPS-induced mice [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Although this may imply that 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> may treat sepsis by suppressing the inflammatory response and associated liver damage, further studies using different models of sepsis are required. Furthermore, the active compound responsible for the therapeutic effects is yet to be identified.
