<p>Among the herbal plants discussed in this review, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> are natively found in Malaysia, whilst others are naturalized species since years ago. Based on the literature, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, or ginger, seems to show the highest potential to be developed for therapeutic use in sepsis. This is evidenced by promising results from different experimental models, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, which involved different forms of ginger—alcoholic extract of ginger, dried ginger water extract, 6-gingerol, and zingerone [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The greatest effect was demonstrated by zingerone, a phenoline alkanone isolated from ginger. Zingerone was able to enhance the survival rate and attenuate injury in organs commonly affected by sepsis, which are the kidney, liver, and lung, at a low dose of 0.72 mg/kg in CLP-induced mice [

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, there is an ongoing clinical trial in China that evaluates the efficacy of “
 <italic>Si-Ni-Tang,</italic>” a traditional Chinese medicine formulation comprising of ginger, in treating sepsis [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. This further supports the potential use of ginger for sepsis. Other than 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, this traditional remedy is composed of processed 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Aconitum carmichaeli</italic>, based on the rationale that the simultaneous use of herbal plants with different pharmacological activities is likely to be more effective as a treatment for septic shock patients [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. This is also one of the traditional remedies used to treat sepsis or septic shock as documented in the ancient medical collection called “
 <italic>Shanghan Lun</italic>” [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>].
