<p>Sepsis is a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The current approaches in managing sepsis patients include initial resuscitation, early diagnosis to allow prompt treatment using specific antibiotics, and identification of infection source and control measures [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These have improved the outcomes of sepsis patients; however, the mortality rate remains unreasonably high [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the reliance on antibiotics may exacerbate the global threat of multidrug-resistant organisms, leaving no treatment option for sepsis [
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. An alternative approachâ€”a specific antisepsis treatment, is urgently needed to ease the global burden of sepsis due to the tremendous costs incurred in the management of patients [
