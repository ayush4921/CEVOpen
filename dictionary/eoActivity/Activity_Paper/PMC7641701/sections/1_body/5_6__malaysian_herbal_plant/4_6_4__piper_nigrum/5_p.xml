<p>Besides piperine and pellitorine, a few studies have also identified other active compounds isolated from 
 <italic>P. nigrum.</italic> Although some of these compounds showed more potent anti-inflammatory activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, their activity in sepsis animal models has not yet been reported. For example, Ngo et al. [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] reported that there are five alkaloids including pellitorine that significantly inhibited NO production in LPS-induced macrophages but chabamide was the most potent among them. Another study reported that some new amide alkaloids isolated from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production by macrophages [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Amongst the isolated amide alkaloids, pipernigramides E-G were shown to exert anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan-induced paw edema test [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>].
