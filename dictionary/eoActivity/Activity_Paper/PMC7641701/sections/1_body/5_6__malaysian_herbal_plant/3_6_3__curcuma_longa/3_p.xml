<p>Curcumin is a major compound found in the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and has been extensively studied for its antisepsis potential. Intravenous injection of curcumin rescued mice from CLP-induced lethality, lowered the levels of tissue injury markers, such as ALT, AST and lactate, and inhibited the production of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Intraperitoneal injection of curcumin also improved the survival rate and attenuated blood-brain barrier dysfunction in CLP-induced mice [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Apart from that, curcumin, administered via intranasal, intraperitoneal, and oral routes, exerted protective effects against organ dysfunction in LPS-induced endotoxemia, including acute lung injury and liver injury [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Notably, a more recent study by Kumari et al. [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] found that intraperitoneal, but not intranasal, administration increased the survival of LPS-induced mice and decreased TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production. The failure of curcumin to yield reproducible results via intranasal administration suggests that it might not be an appropriate route of administration for curcumin because there are many factors that affect the bioavailability of intranasally administered drugs including their volume and concentration, and the absorptive surface of nasal mucosa [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and thus an optimal formulation should be determined beforehand. Last but not least, curcumin also demonstrated beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system as intragastric injection of curcumin has been shown to prevent myocardial injury in CLP-induced septic mice [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], while intraperitoneal injection of curcumin has been shown to improve vascular function in LPS-challenged mice by maintaining a normal heart rate and blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Based on these reports, it is evident that curcumin may prevent organ damage due to sepsis and thus have promising potential for the treatment of sepsis.
