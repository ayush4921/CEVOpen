<p>Some studies have also identified other active compounds from

Some examples include turmeronol A and B, (6S)-2-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-(3-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-heptene-4-one, (6S)-2-methyl-6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-heptene-4-one, and 4-methylene-5-hydroxybisabola-2, 10-diene-9-one which have been shown to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory responses

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Further studies are required to determine whether these constituents may be the lead compound for further development to treat inflammatory diseases including sepsis. It is also worth noting that since curcumin is recognized as the most pharmacologically active constituent isolated from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, many studies have also been conducted to improve the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin through structural modifications [
