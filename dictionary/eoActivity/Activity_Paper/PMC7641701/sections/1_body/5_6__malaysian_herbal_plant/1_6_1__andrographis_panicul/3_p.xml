<p>Apart from andrographolide, several studies have demonstrated that other bioactive compounds isolated from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> also possess anti-inflammatory activity. For example, isoandrographolide and neoandrographolide are two andrographolide derivatives which have been reported to have the capability to inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, in LPS-induced macrophages [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Two other bioactive compounds, namely, skullcapflavone-1 and 7-O-methylwogonin, were also reported to exert 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effect against LPS-induced NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production in macrophages [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Besides that, andrograpanin which was reported by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in LPS-induced macrophages and other bioactive compounds which were reported by Chao et al. [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] to inhibit NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B transcriptional activity are other active constituents from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> that should be further studied for their antisepsis potential.
