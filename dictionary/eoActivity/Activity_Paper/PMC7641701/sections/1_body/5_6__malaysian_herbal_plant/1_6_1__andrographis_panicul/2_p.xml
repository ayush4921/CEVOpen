<p>The ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> was previously found to have anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-/IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>-induced macrophages and LPS-treated mice [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. An oral administration of the ethyl acetate extract (0.78–1.32 mg/kg) improved the survival rate of endotoxemic mice and reduced the serum levels of NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, all of which play proinflammatory roles in sepsis [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A bioassay-guided fractionation study revealed that eight bioactive compounds contributed to the inhibition of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B transcriptional activity of the ethyl acetate fraction, with the two most abundant compounds in the fraction being andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In particular, andrographolide has been shown to exhibit barrier protective effect in HMGB-1-induced endothelial cells by decreasing permeability and monocytes adhesion and transmigration. Furthermore, andrographolide administered via intravenous injection was able to reduce sepsis-induced HMGB-1 production, inhibit vascular leakage, and improve the survival rate of CLP-treated mice [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Other studies have also reported similar 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protective effect where intraperitoneal injection of andrographolide attenuated acute lung injury (ALI) and acute liver injury in LPS-induced and LPS-/D-galactosamine-induced mice, respectively [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that andrographolide possesses strong antisepsis potential.
