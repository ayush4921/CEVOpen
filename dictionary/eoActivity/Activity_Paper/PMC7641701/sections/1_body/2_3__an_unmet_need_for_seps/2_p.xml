<p>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign had yielded positive outcome in the survival rate of sepsis patients; however, the mortality rate remained high at 27.2% and 36.7% for ICU and in-hospital patients, respectively [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One possible reason could be the lack of a sepsis-specific treatment that targets the hyperinflammatory state of the patients. As described earlier, sepsis is a hyperinflammatory disease, with pathogen as the causative agent. While eradication of the pathogen using antimicrobial therapy may be effective in reducing the mortality rate of sepsis, a combined therapy with anti-inflammatory agents may further improve the survival rate of sepsis patients. Nevertheless, another challenge to pursue this alternative is the fact that anti-inflammatory drug specific for sepsis is lacking.
