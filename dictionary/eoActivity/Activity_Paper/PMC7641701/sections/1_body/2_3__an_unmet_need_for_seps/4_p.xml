<p>Prior to entering clinical trials, potential therapeutic agents for sepsis would be evaluated for their efficacy in the preclinical studies using different experimental models. Sepsis animal models are generally divided into three categories: endotoxemia model (e.g., LPS infusion), bacterial infection model (e.g., 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infusion), and host-barrier disruption model (e.g., cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP)) [
