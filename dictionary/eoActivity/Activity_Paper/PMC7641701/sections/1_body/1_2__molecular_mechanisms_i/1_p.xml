<p>Sepsis could be caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is initiated when the initial host response to an infection becomes amplified and dysregulated, resulting in the loss of the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The recognition of PAMPs, such as bacterial endotoxins and fungal 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucans, by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by the immune cells is considered the first event that triggers the innate immune responses [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Innate immunity reacts immediately to the invading pathogens and thus plays a major role in the initiation of sepsis [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The binding of LPS, a well-recognized PAMP on the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) will activate intracellular signaling pathways that promote the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide (NO) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is mainly mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor-
 <italic>κ</italic>B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) that plays a crucial role in modulating inflammation by activating the transcription of various proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
