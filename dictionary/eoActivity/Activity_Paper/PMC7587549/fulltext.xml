However, scientific evidence for the antioxidant effects against lipid peroxidation and the potential effects in cancer of this plant are lacking. In our experiments, 70% ethanolic extracts of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> leaves (LPP) and stem bark (SPP) were evaluated for their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. Both LPP and SPP inhibited Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated LDL by increasing the lag time of conjugated diene formation and inhibiting the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in a dose-dependent manner. In cancer cells, LPP and SPP triggered the most potent cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells, CRF-SBA and HL-60, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 118.5 to 157.2 &#x000b5;g/mL. SPP exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MIA PACA2, A549, and KG cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 167.5, 244.1 and 255.0 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, LPP showed cytotoxic activity against KG with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 228.1 &#x000b5;g/mL. SPP mediated cytotoxicity in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells through the activation of the apoptosis pathway, including the activation of caspases 3, and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that SPP may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis and leukemia in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Peltophorum pterocarpum</italic></kwd><kwd>anti-oxidant</kwd><kwd>LDL</kwd><kwd>human leukemia cancer cells</kwd><kwd>caspases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-25-04800"><title>1.

This plant is a popular ornamental tree, grown around the world. The leaves of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> are bipinnate, the flowers are yellow, and the fruit is initially red, then ripens to black, containing one to four seeds [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Traditionally, the bark of this tree was used for the treatment of dysentery, as an eye lotion, and as an embrocation for pains and sores. The leaf decoction was used to treat skin disorders; the stem bark was used to treat dysentery, for gargling applications, as a tooth powder, and to treat muscular pain. Its flowers were also used to cure or relieve intestinal disorders [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Chinese traditional medicine, this plant has been used for the treatment of several ailments, including stomatitis, insomnia, skin troubles, constipation, ringworm, insomnia, dysentery, muscular pains, sores, and skin disorders [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> is known to be a rich source of aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, amino acids, terpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, and steroids [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

A 70% ethanolic extract of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> leaves displayed hepatoprotective effects in paracetamol-induced acute liver damage in albino Wister rats. This ethanolic extract (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased tissue lipid peroxidation in rats. These results suggest that the <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract might have value for the treatment of paracetamol-induced hepatic damage and some liver diseases, via its antioxidant effects [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> and <italic>Morinda lucida,</italic> combined, were evaluated for their cognitive enhancing potential in scopolamine-induced amnesic animals; the two ingredients resulted in the considerable enhancement of cognition in mice [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The aqueous extract of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> wood also exhibited inhibitory effects against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Raji cells and melanogenesis in &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH)-stimulated B16 melanoma cells, and demonstrated potent free radical-scavenging activity. Additionally, bergenin and gallic acid, isolated from <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>, exhibited potent inhibitory effects against EBV-early antigen activation and skin tumor promotion in an in vivo, two-stage, mouse skin carcinogenesis test, using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene as an initiator and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) as a promoter [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In our search for antioxidant and anticancer agents derived from Vietnamese natural and medicinal plants, we have found that extracts of the leaves (LPP) and stem bark (SPP) of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> show significant activities [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Results</title><p>The oxidative modification of LDL is thought to be an essential factor for the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Because the formation of conjugated dienes represents the initial phase of LDL oxidation, lag time represents an indicator of the oxidation-resistant capacity of LDL [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our experiment, the effects of LPP and SPP on the lengthening of the lag time were measured, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f001">Figure 1</xref>. When the LDL was incubated with Cu<sup>2+</sup> alone, the lag time was recorded at 30.3 &#x000b1; 2.5 min. However, treatment with LPP extract (10, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL) significantly increased the lag period for LDL oxidation to 45.5 &#x000b1; 3.8, 112.2 &#x000b1; 5.7, and 127.6 &#x000b1; 4.5 min, respectively. Interestingly, different SPP extracts, at doses of 10, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL, inhibited the oxidation in LDL by retarding the lag time to 50.2 &#x000b1; 2.2, 155.6 &#x000b1; 5.8, and 212.7 &#x000b1; 4.6 min, respectively. In this experiment, quercetin (5.0 &#x000b5;M) and caffeic acid (5.0 &#x000b5;M), which were used as positive controls, extended the lag time to 205.5 &#x000b1; 6.5 and 137.0 &#x000b1; 3.8 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To quantify LDL oxidation, oxidation was initiated by incubation with Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) was assessed using the TBARS assay [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both LPP and SPP reduced the formation of TBARS in dose-dependent manners, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 67.5 &#x000b1; 3.6 and 48.0 &#x000b1; 5.2 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. Quercetin, caffeic acid, and &#x003b1;-tocopherol were used as reference antioxidants, which showed inhibitory effects against Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated LDL oxidation, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.8, 5.7 &#x000b1; 1.4, and 25.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 &#x000b5;M, respectively (<xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A variety of other factors also promoted the lipid oxidation of LDL. In this study, we used another mediator, 2,2&#x02032;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), a hydrophilic peroxyl radical, as a second activation source. AAPH is a thermo-labile radical initiator and water-soluble azo agent that is used extensively as a free radical generator, particularly in the study of lipid peroxidation and the characterization of antioxidants. The formation of MDA by AAPH (<xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was reduced by LPP and SPP treatment in the TBARS assay, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 112.7 &#x000b1; 4.5 and 40.5 &#x000b1; 3.2 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. Quercetin, caffeic acid, and &#x003b1;-tocopherol showed inhibitory effects against AAPH-mediated LDL oxidation, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.5 &#x000b1; 1.0, 40.7 &#x000b1; 1.8, and 20.4 &#x000b1; 1.0 &#x000b5;M, respectively.</p><p>Two human pancreatic cell lines, MIA PACA2 and PANC-1, a human lung cancer cell line, A549, an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR8, and three leukemia cancer cell lines, KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA, were used in this study. To determine the cytotoxic effects of LPP and SPP in cancer cell lines, a cell proliferation assay was performed using a cell counting kit. The results in <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that SPP exhibited cytotoxicity against the MIA PACA2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 167.5 &#x000b1; 5.6 &#x000b5;g/mL; in contrast, LPP showed very weak cytotoxicity, with an IC<sub>50</sub> greater than 500 &#x000b5;g/mL. SPP also inhibited the growth of A549 cells, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 244.0 &#x000b1; 11.5 &#x000b5;g/mL. LPP and SPP showed very weak cytotoxic activity against PANC-1 and OVCAR8 cells. However, both LPP and SPP showed potent cytotoxicity against human leukemia cancer cells, such as KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA cells, demonstrating IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging below 255.0 &#x000b1; 8.1 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). SPP showed the most potent cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 118.5 &#x000b1; 3.8 &#x000b5;g/mL. This result supported the reported traditional use of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> for the treatment of leukemia. Additionally, neither LPP nor SPP demonstrated cytotoxicity in normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, data not show).</p><p>SPP was, consequently, selected for additional enzymatic experiments in HL-60 leukemia cancer cells, due to its cytotoxicity potential. SPP (50&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) was added to HL-60 cells, followed by incubation for 12, 24, and 48 h. Then, caspase 3 activation was measured according to the levels of Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-8-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Av-DEVD-AFC). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f002">Figure 2</xref> show that SPP (50 &#x000b5;g/mL) activated caspase 3, increasing the cleaved enzyme level by 2.5- and 4.5-fold after 12 and 24 h, respectively, and the cleaved, activated form of caspase 3 by five-fold compared to the control (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f002">Figure 2</xref>). SPP treatment (250 &#x000b5;g/mL) increased the level of activated caspase 3 between 3- and 6-fold after 12, 24, and 48 h of incubation compared with the levels in controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). SPP treatment (500 &#x000b5;g/mL) increased activated caspase 3 levels between 4- and 8-fold after 48 h of incubation compared with the levels observed in the control (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These results suggested that SPP could increase the activated form of caspase 3, in a dose- and time-dependent manner.</p><p>To determine the cell apoptosis signaling pathway that is triggered by SPP, we investigated alterations in mitochondria-associated signal proteins, such as caspases 3, 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Caspase 3 is a known member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, which exists as an inactive, pre-enzymatic precursor form of 32 kDa in size. When activated, caspase 3 cleaves multiple structural and regulatory proteins, leading to death by triggering the apoptosis pathway via the cleavage of proteins into heterozygous substances [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While caspase 3 is considered the executioner of cells, caspase 9, the other cysteine-aspartic acid protease found in humans, and which is encoded by <italic>CASP9</italic>, is an initiator of cell death [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our experiment, SPP was added to HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells and incubated for 48 h, after which the levels of the apoptotic proteins caspase 3 and caspase 9 were detected in HL-60 and KG cells by western blotting analysis. SPP (0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) cleaved and activated caspase 3 and caspase 9 into their cleaved forms. The results showed that SPP significantly inhibited the expression of these caspase enzyme proteins in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f003">Figure 3</xref>). To further evaluate whether SPP could induce apoptosis in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells, the levels of cleaved PARP were measured after treatment with SPP (0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) using western blot analysis. PARP represents a protein family that plays a vital role in many cellular processes, such as DNA repair, genomic stability, and programmed cell death [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Catalyzing caspase-3 activation generally leads to the cleavage of PARP, a process that plays a positive regulatory role in the apoptosis of several cells. It is considered to be a biomarker for the detection of apoptosis [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f003">Figure 3</xref>, SPP (0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) induced HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, associated with PARP cleavage.</p><p>We further investigated the effects of SPP (0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) on the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and the mitochondrial-damage associated protein cytochrome c (Cyt-c) [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cyt-c is discharged from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, triggering the apoptotic progression in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cancer cells. The pro-apoptotic Bax and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins belong to the Bcl-2 protein family, which controls the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we observed that SPP (0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL) treatment increased Bax protein expression levels and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression levels in both HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results were also confirmed by western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the protein expression level of Cyt-c in the mitochondria was dose-dependently decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-25-04800"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>In recent years, studies have been performed to examine various plant-derived natural extracts, which are safe to use as antioxidant, anticancer, and other disease treatments, with fewer side effects than pharmaceutical products.

Previously, <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> was found to contain many substances, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroids [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Leaf and bark extracts of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>, collected in Thailand, were tested for their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ABTS, and galvinoxyl radical-scavenging activities, phenolic contents, &#x003b1;-glucosidase, &#x003b1;-amylase, and aldose reductase inhibition, and the inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation. These extracts showed significant antiglycemic activity, and the main active compound in the leaf was determined to be quercetin-3-O-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Bergenin, a C-glycoside of 4-<italic>O</italic>-methyl gallic acid isolated from <italic>P.&#x02009;pterocarpum</italic>, showed antioxidant activity against DPPH and hydroxyl and nitric oxide scavenging activities. Bergenin was identified as a mild antioxidant, which could be used as a natural antioxidant [<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Bergenin and gallic acid were also isolated from the ethyl acetate (AcOEt)-soluble fraction obtained from <italic>P.&#x02009;pterocarpum</italic> collected in Japan; they exhibited inhibitory effects against EBV-early antigen activation and against skin tumor promotion in in vivo, two-stage, mouse skin carcinogenesis tests.

The physiological effects of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract, such as antioxidant, antihepatitis virus, antibacterial, and anticancer activities, have been reported. However, studies on antioxidant efficacy using LDL and anticancer in human leukemia cells have not been widely published.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first report describing the inhibition of LDL oxidation by both the leaves and stem bark of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>. Oxidation represents an important biochemical process, and is involved in the production of cellular energy for all biological processes in the human body. In atherosclerosis, the LDL oxidation process represents a type of liquid lipid peroxidation due to an excess of free radical and other oxidant species derived from oxygen, nitrogen, and other chemical elements in the body. The oxidation of LDL is thought to promote atherosclerosis by accelerating inflammatory reduction and changing immunologic mechanisms, resulting in lipid dysregulation and foam cell formation. The oxidation of LDL results in the formation of a complex between LDL, beta 2 glycoprotein I, and C-reactive protein in the intima of atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, the inhibition of LDL modification is thought to be an essential target for the prevention of atherosclerosis. Our results showed that LPP and SPP could retard the lag time associated with the lipid peroxidation of LDL induced by Cu<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, SPP strongly inhibited oxidation by reducing the conjugated diene in LDL, which may be associated with the higher phenolic contents in the stem bark than in the leaves of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>.</p><p>The effects of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> on cancer cells were examined. Two human pancreatic cell lines, MIA PACA2 and PANC-1, a human lung cancer cell line, A549, an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR8, and three leukemia cancer cell lines, KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA, were treated with a range of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract concentrations. Biocompatibility was evaluated using a cell counting Dojindo kit. As shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, both the LPP and SPP demonstrated cytotoxicity against human leukemia cancer cells. However, SPP showed the most potent activity against HL-60 cells compared with the other cells and compared with LPP. SPP was selected to investigate the effects at the molecular protein level in leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells. Caspases 3 and 9 represent members of the cysteine-aspartic protease enzyme family and play essential roles in apoptosis. Caspases 3 and 9 are generally associated with the arrest of cell growth and development, and are called the &#x0201c;executors&#x0201d; of both normal and cancer cells. Activated caspase 9 then activates caspase 3, which releases cytochrome-C (Cyt-C), a mitochondrial-damage associated cytochrome, resulting in cell death through apoptosis and necrosis pathways [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Caspases are also responsible for cleaving numerous cellular targets, including members of the PARP family. PARP proteins are involved in several cellular processes, such as DNA repair, genomic stability, and programmed cell death. Recently, the importance of natural and medicinal plants and their novel, small-molecule compounds in cancer chemotherapy has been well-recognized. Several natural extracts and phytochemical compounds can induce apoptotic cancer cell death and could be employed for anticancer therapies. SPP activated caspase 3 and caspase 9, resulting in an increase in the cleaved forms, in a dose-dependent manner. The cleaved form of PARP also increased in both HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells. The western blotting results showed that SPP, in a dose range from 50 to 500 &#x000b5;g/mL, was able to remarkably increase the protein levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and cytosolic Cyt-c expression, but significantly decreased the protein levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Bax and Bcl-2 are members of the Bcl-2 family and act as core regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the mitochondrial regulation pathway.</p><p>Since <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> was found to contain many phenolic compounds, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, these secondary metabolites may be largely responsible for the anticancer activity of this plant. The isolation of potent active components and leukemia cell-based assays to identify the detailed mechanisms will be further explored. In addition, in vivo experiments will be performed to confirm the functionalities of these extracts will contribute to the development of <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> and its phytochemicals as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of human leukemia cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-25-04800"><title>4.
