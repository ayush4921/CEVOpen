    "<i>Peltophorum pterocarpum</i> is regarded as one of the most important medicinal plants in the traditional medicine system of Vietnam. However, scientific evidence for the antioxidant effects against lipid peroxidation and the potential effects in cancer of this plant are lacking. In our experiments, 70% ethanolic extracts of <i>P. pterocarpum</i> leaves (LPP) and stem bark (SPP) were evaluated for their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. Both LPP and SPP inhibited Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated LDL by increasing the lag time of conjugated diene formation and inhibiting the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in a dose-dependent manner. In cancer cells, LPP and SPP triggered the most potent cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells, CRF-SBA and HL-60, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 118.5 to 157.2 µg/mL. SPP exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MIA PACA2, A549, and KG cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 167.5, 244.1 and 255.0 µg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, LPP showed cytotoxic activity against KG with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 228.1 µg/mL. SPP mediated cytotoxicity in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells through the activation of the apoptosis pathway, including the activation of caspases 3, and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that SPP may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis and leukemia in humans."
