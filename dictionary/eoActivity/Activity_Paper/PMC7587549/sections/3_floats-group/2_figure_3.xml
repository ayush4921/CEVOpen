  <p>Influences of SPP on regulation of apoptotic signal proteins in HL-60 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and CCRF-SBA (
   <bold>B</bold>) cells. All experiments were repeated at least three times, obtaining similar results. Both cells were treated with SPP (0–500 µg/mL) for 48 h. β-Actin was used as a control, (–), 0.1% DMSO-treated cells. The experiments were carried out in three replicates.
