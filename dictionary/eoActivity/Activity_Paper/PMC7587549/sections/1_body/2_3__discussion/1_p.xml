<p>In recent years, studies have been performed to examine various plant-derived natural extracts, which are safe to use as antioxidant, anticancer, and other disease treatments, with fewer side effects than pharmaceutical products. In our experiment, ethanolic extracts of both the leaves and stem bark of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> were found to be active in lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity. Previously, 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> was found to contain many substances, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroids [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Leaf and bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>, collected in Thailand, were tested for their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ABTS, and galvinoxyl radical-scavenging activities, phenolic contents, α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and aldose reductase inhibition, and the inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation. These extracts showed significant antiglycemic activity, and the main active compound in the leaf was determined to be quercetin-3-O-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Bergenin, a C-glycoside of 4-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl gallic acid isolated from 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>, showed antioxidant activity against DPPH and hydroxyl and nitric oxide scavenging activities. Bergenin was identified as a mild antioxidant, which could be used as a natural antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Bergenin and gallic acid were also isolated from the ethyl acetate (AcOEt)-soluble fraction obtained from 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> collected in Japan; they exhibited inhibitory effects against EBV-early antigen activation and against skin tumor promotion in in vivo, two-stage, mouse skin carcinogenesis tests. Bergenin also exhibited melanogenesis inhibitory activities in α-MSH-stimulated B16 melanoma cells [

 <italic>P. pterocarpum,</italic> together with several Malaysian plants, showed potent antioxidant activities but were not cytotoxic activity against 3T3 and 4T1 cells, even at concentrations as high as 100 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The physiological effects of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract, such as antioxidant, antihepatitis virus, antibacterial, and anticancer activities, have been reported. However, studies on antioxidant efficacy using LDL and anticancer in human leukemia cells have not been widely published.
