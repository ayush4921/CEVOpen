<p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first report describing the inhibition of LDL oxidation by both the leaves and stem bark of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>. Oxidation represents an important biochemical process, and is involved in the production of cellular energy for all biological processes in the human body. In atherosclerosis, the LDL oxidation process represents a type of liquid lipid peroxidation due to an excess of free radical and other oxidant species derived from oxygen, nitrogen, and other chemical elements in the body. The oxidation of LDL is thought to promote atherosclerosis by accelerating inflammatory reduction and changing immunologic mechanisms, resulting in lipid dysregulation and foam cell formation. The oxidation of LDL results in the formation of a complex between LDL, beta 2 glycoprotein I, and C-reactive protein in the intima of atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, the inhibition of LDL modification is thought to be an essential target for the prevention of atherosclerosis. Our results showed that LPP and SPP could retard the lag time associated with the lipid peroxidation of LDL induced by Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>. In addition, SPP strongly inhibited oxidation by reducing the conjugated diene in LDL, which may be associated with the higher phenolic contents in the stem bark than in the leaves of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>.
