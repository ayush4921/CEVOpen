<p>The effects of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> on cancer cells were examined. Two human pancreatic cell lines, MIA PACA2 and PANC-1, a human lung cancer cell line, A549, an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR8, and three leukemia cancer cell lines, KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA, were treated with a range of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract concentrations. Biocompatibility was evaluated using a cell counting Dojindo kit. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, both the LPP and SPP demonstrated cytotoxicity against human leukemia cancer cells. However, SPP showed the most potent activity against HL-60 cells compared with the other cells and compared with LPP. SPP was selected to investigate the effects at the molecular protein level in leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells. Caspases 3 and 9 represent members of the cysteine-aspartic protease enzyme family and play essential roles in apoptosis. Caspases 3 and 9 are generally associated with the arrest of cell growth and development, and are called the “executors” of both normal and cancer cells. Activated caspase 9 then activates caspase 3, which releases cytochrome-C (Cyt-C), a mitochondrial-damage associated cytochrome, resulting in cell death through apoptosis and necrosis pathways [

PARP proteins are involved in several cellular processes, such as DNA repair, genomic stability, and programmed cell death. Recently, the importance of natural and medicinal plants and their novel, small-molecule compounds in cancer chemotherapy has been well-recognized. Several natural extracts and phytochemical compounds can induce apoptotic cancer cell death and could be employed for anticancer therapies. SPP activated caspase 3 and caspase 9, resulting in an increase in the cleaved forms, in a dose-dependent manner. The cleaved form of PARP also increased in both HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells. The western blotting results showed that SPP, in a dose range from 50 to 500 µg/mL, was able to remarkably increase the protein levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and cytosolic Cyt-c expression, but significantly decreased the protein levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Bax and Bcl-2 are members of the Bcl-2 family and act as core regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the mitochondrial regulation pathway.
