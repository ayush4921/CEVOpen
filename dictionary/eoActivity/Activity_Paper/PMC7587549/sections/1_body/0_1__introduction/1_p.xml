 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This plant is a popular ornamental tree, grown around the world. The leaves of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> are bipinnate, the flowers are yellow, and the fruit is initially red, then ripens to black, containing one to four seeds [

Traditionally, the bark of this tree was used for the treatment of dysentery, as an eye lotion, and as an embrocation for pains and sores. The leaf decoction was used to treat skin disorders; the stem bark was used to treat dysentery, for gargling applications, as a tooth powder, and to treat muscular pain. Its flowers were also used to cure or relieve intestinal disorders [

 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> leaves displayed hepatoprotective effects in paracetamol-induced acute liver damage in albino Wister rats. This ethanolic extract (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased tissue lipid peroxidation in rats. These results suggest that the 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> extract might have value for the treatment of paracetamol-induced hepatic damage and some liver diseases, via its antioxidant effects [

 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> and 
 <italic>Morinda lucida,</italic> combined, were evaluated for their cognitive enhancing potential in scopolamine-induced amnesic animals; the two ingredients resulted in the considerable enhancement of cognition in mice [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> wood also exhibited inhibitory effects against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Raji cells and melanogenesis in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-stimulated B16 melanoma cells, and demonstrated potent free radical-scavenging activity. Additionally, bergenin and gallic acid, isolated from 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic>, exhibited potent inhibitory effects against EBV-early antigen activation and skin tumor promotion in an in vivo, two-stage, mouse skin carcinogenesis test, using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene as an initiator and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) as a promoter [
