<p>For malondialdehyde (MDA) detection, LDL (100 μg/mL) in PBS was pre-incubated with LPP and SPP (10, 50, 100 mg/mL) as described above, and then 5 μM CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to initiate the oxidation. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and the reaction was terminated by adding 250 μL of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 250 μL of 1% thiobarbituric acid (TBA). After boiling at 95 °C for 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of supernatant was measured at 532 nm (Shimadzu UV-1240, Tokyo, Japan). Quercetin and caffeic acid were used as reference antioxidants [
