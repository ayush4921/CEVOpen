<p>Venous blood was collected individually from healthy, normolipidemic volunteers. The plasma was centrifuged at 43,800 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C in Beckman T8M ultracentrifuge (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and then chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein floating to the top of tube was removed. Other supernatants were collected, and adjusted to

The top layer of LDL was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Sephacryl S4000HR column (16 mm × 600 mm, Marlborough, MA, USA) using 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl as the eluting solvent in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. The LDL was dialyzed against 50 μM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 μM EDTA for 24 h. EDTA was removed by a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with PBS. The purity of LDL evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis was &gt;97%. The LDL protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard [
