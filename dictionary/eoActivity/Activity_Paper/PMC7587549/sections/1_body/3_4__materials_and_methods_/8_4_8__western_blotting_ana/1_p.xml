<p>Cancer cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were treated with extracts (5–50 μg/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in 100 µL of lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the protein contents in the supernatant were measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein extracts (50 µg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% (

 <italic>v/v</italic>) Tween-20 (TBS-T) at 4 °C overnight and incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1.5 h. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and blotted with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1.5 h, followed by washing three times in TBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and exposed to X-ray films. Protein contents were normalized by reprobing the same membrane with anti-β-actin antibody. For β-actin detection, previously used membranes were soaked in stripping buffer (Gene Bio-Application Ltd., Hanagid, Israel) at room temperature for 20 min [
