<p>Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured by proteolytic cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC by counting on a fluorescence plate reader (Twinkle LB970 microplate fluorometer, Berthold Technologies, Baden Württemberg, Germany). Cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5 </sup> cell/well) were treated with indicated samples at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 μg/mL. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS. The pellets were lyzed using 15 μL of lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100] at room temperature for 10 min, and then placed on ice; 100 μL of assay buffer [100 mM Hepes (pH = 7.5), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (

 <italic>v/v</italic>) Chaps, 0.1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) BSA], and 10 μL of substrate solutin (200 μM substrate in assay buffer) were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, fluorescence was measured with an excitation at 370 nm and an emission at 505 nm [
