<p>The oxidative modification of LDL is thought to be an essential factor for the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Because the formation of conjugated dienes represents the initial phase of LDL oxidation, lag time represents an indicator of the oxidation-resistant capacity of LDL [

 <sup>2+</sup> alone, the lag time was recorded at 30.3 ± 2.5 min. However, treatment with LPP extract (10, 50, and 100 µg/mL) significantly increased the lag period for LDL oxidation to 45.5 ± 3.8, 112.2 ± 5.7, and 127.6 ± 4.5 min, respectively. Interestingly, different SPP extracts, at doses of 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL, inhibited the oxidation in LDL by retarding the lag time to 50.2 ± 2.2, 155.6 ± 5.8, and 212.7 ± 4.6 min, respectively. In this experiment, quercetin (5.0 µM) and caffeic acid (5.0 µM), which were used as positive controls, extended the lag time to 205.5 ± 6.5 and 137.0 ± 3.8 min, respectively (
