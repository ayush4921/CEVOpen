<p>Two human pancreatic cell lines, MIA PACA2 and PANC-1, a human lung cancer cell line, A549, an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR8, and three leukemia cancer cell lines, KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA, were used in this study. To determine the cytotoxic effects of LPP and SPP in cancer cell lines, a cell proliferation assay was performed using a cell counting kit. The results in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that SPP exhibited cytotoxicity against the MIA PACA2, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 167.5 ± 5.6 µg/mL; in contrast, LPP showed very weak cytotoxicity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> greater than 500 µg/mL. SPP also inhibited the growth of A549 cells, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 244.0 ± 11.5 µg/mL. LPP and SPP showed very weak cytotoxic activity against PANC-1 and OVCAR8 cells. However, both LPP and SPP showed potent cytotoxicity against human leukemia cancer cells, such as KG, HL-60, and CCRF-SBA cells, demonstrating IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging below 255.0 ± 8.1 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). SPP showed the most potent cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 118.5 ± 3.8 µg/mL. This result supported the reported traditional use of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> for the treatment of leukemia. Additionally, neither LPP nor SPP demonstrated cytotoxicity in normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, data not show).
