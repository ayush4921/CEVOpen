<p>To quantify LDL oxidation, oxidation was initiated by incubation with Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, and the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) was assessed using the TBARS assay [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both LPP and SPP reduced the formation of TBARS in dose-dependent manners, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 67.5 ± 3.6 and 48.0 ± 5.2 µg/mL, respectively. Quercetin, caffeic acid, and α-tocopherol were used as reference antioxidants, which showed inhibitory effects against Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>-mediated LDL oxidation, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.5 ± 0.8, 5.7 ± 1.4, and 25.8 ± 2.5 µM, respectively (

In this study, we used another mediator, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), a hydrophilic peroxyl radical, as a second activation source. AAPH is a thermo-labile radical initiator and water-soluble azo agent that is used extensively as a free radical generator, particularly in the study of lipid peroxidation and the characterization of antioxidants. The formation of MDA by AAPH (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was reduced by LPP and SPP treatment in the TBARS assay, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 112.7 ± 4.5 and 40.5 ± 3.2 µg/mL, respectively. Quercetin, caffeic acid, and α-tocopherol showed inhibitory effects against AAPH-mediated LDL oxidation, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10.5 ± 1.0, 40.7 ± 1.8, and 20.4 ± 1.0 µM, respectively.
