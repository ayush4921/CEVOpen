<p>Lambs received the oral doses of plant extracts continuously for 75 days during which daily feed intake and weekly body weight changes were monitored. At the end of the trial period, blood samples were drawn from all the forty animals via the jugular vein puncture. Five mL blood samples were collected into BD vacutainer tubes (BD-Plymouth UK), one which contained ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for haematological analysis and another without EDTA for biochemical analyses which include the concentration of urea nitrogen, glucose, cholesterol, total serum protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The samples were immediately transferred to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Onderstepoort, South Africa, for processing and analysis. Complete blood analysis was done using a multi-parameter automated haematology analyser (ADVIA 2120i, Siemens, South Africa) and blood chemistry was analysed using the Cobas Integra 400 Plus (Roche, South Africa).</p>
