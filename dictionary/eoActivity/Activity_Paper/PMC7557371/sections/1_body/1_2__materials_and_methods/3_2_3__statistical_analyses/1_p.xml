<p>Data obtained from this study were analysed using the general linear model procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The statistical model included treatment effect, block and random error as follows:
 <disp-formula>y
  <sub>ijk</sub> = μ + Block + P
  <sub>i</sub> + ε
  <sub>ijk</sub>
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where y
 <sub>ijk</sub> = observation ‘k’ at four extract P (i; control, MO, JC, and AV); μ = overall mean; Block = effect of blocking, P
 <sub>i</sub> = plant extracts; and ε
 <sub>ijk</sub> is the effect of random error. Where F-test revealed significant difference, means were separated using the Tukey test.
