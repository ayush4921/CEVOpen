<p>Serum enzymes are indicators of feed quality as they help to detect abnormal changes in response to drugs and phytonutrients long before the death of an animal. The concentrations of total serum protein and cholesterol in the blood are regulated to balance physiological functions that cater for immunity, coagulation, small molecule transport and inflammation, and any huge variation in the concentration of these serum variables might indicate impaired physiological function [

 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our study, however, none of these tested parameters were affected by JC extract. In contrast to the finding of this study for MO extract, Moringa leaf meal supplementation reduced creatinine concentration in West African Dwarf goats but did not affect ALP, AST and ALT concentrations [
