<p>Blood urea nitrogen values are used to determine kidney functionality because urea is a waste product, which is removed during glomerular filtration unless re-utilised in the rumen via the urea cycle. Furthermore, ruminal fermentation ensures that little or no glucose originates from dietary carbohydrate but through hepatic glycogenolysis and therefore, serum glucose concentration may be indicative of liver function in ruminants [

 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Supplementation of SAMM lambs with Moringa, Jatropha, and

 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> having lower ALP compared to lambs in the control group. Nevertheless, the concentration of these enzymes is indicative that no significant metabolic disorder occurred in the lambs.
