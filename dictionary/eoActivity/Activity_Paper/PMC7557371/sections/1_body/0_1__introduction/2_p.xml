<p>However, while some of these PSMs are capable of binding to specific receptors in neurons, intestines, and other cells and exhibit favourable physiological effects [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], others may be antinutritional and exert toxic effects on animals consuming them, depending on the type of plant or parts, or amount consumed [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even though the use of methanolic extracts of Moringa, Jatropha and 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> has been validated in vitro [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], nevertheless, a great deal of consideration should be given to the impact of these ‘natural alternatives’ on the health of animals before being recommended for wider application. For example, the phorbol esters in 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> at a concentration above 1.45 mg/kg body weight (BW) in ruminants were found to exert reduced performance, physiological toxic effects and cause eventual death [

 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Equally, high doses of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> were associated with diarrhoea, kidney failure, phytotoxicity and hypersensitive reactions in some animal species [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and this was associated with the inherent anthraquinones and phenolic compounds. In contrast, previous studies on the feeding of moringa leaves to goats did not report any toxicity symptoms [
