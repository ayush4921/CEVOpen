 <italic>C. longa</italic> displayed its potency in regulating the oxidant/antioxidant disparity and exhibiting hepatoprotective effects. These pharmacological effects might be activated through the regulation of CYP2E2 and Nrf expression, antiapoptosis, and detoxification of protein generation in microsomes of the liver. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> significantly altered steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and inflammatory reactions which occurred in the hepatobiliary system. Furthermore, it could markedly suppress fibrosis, tumorigenesis, and cholestasis by inhibiting TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signaling, the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway, and CYP7A1 activity (
