<p>With regard to the four compounds belonging to the noncurcuminoid group obtained from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, the hepatoprotective effects were commonly observed when all four constituents were administered. In particular, ar-turmerone and bisacurone protected hepatic parenchymal cells from alcohol-induced damage. Germacrone and 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene were found to exhibit hepatoprotective actions against D-GalN and CCl
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively. In addition, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene, germacrone, and ar-turmerone promoted the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and ar-turmerone inhibited the proliferation of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. The combination of 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene and conventional anticancer drugs has been suggested because it was found to suppress H22 cell proliferation by activating the histone H1 protein and elevating the sensitivity of anticancer drugs in MHCC97H cells. 
 <italic>β</italic>-Elemene has been approved as a Class II noncytotoxic therapeutic antitumor agent by the China Food and Drug Administration because of its low toxicity, high efficacy, and immune-enhancing effects [
