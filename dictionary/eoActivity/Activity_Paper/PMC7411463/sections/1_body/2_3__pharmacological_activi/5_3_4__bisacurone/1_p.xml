<p>Bisacurone (

 <sub>15</sub>H

 <sub>3</sub>, 252.354 g/mol) is more separated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> than its radix [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated the superior pharmacological effects of bisacurone compared to curcuminoids and other active ingredients in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>. For example, curcumin did not cause significant cell viability at a low concentration of 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, while bisacurone at the same concentration caused high cell viability following ethanol treatment in hepatocytes isolated from SD rats [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, bisacurone was more effective at promoting bile secretion and produced more total bile acids than curcuminoids and ar-turmerone in Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A significant decrease in the ALT level in rat serum, which was increased by ethanol administration, was observed after a single intake of bisacurone [
