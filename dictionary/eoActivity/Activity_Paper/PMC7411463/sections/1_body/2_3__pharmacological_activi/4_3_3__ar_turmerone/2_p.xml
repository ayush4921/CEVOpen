<p>Ar-turmerone exhibited hepatoprotective, anticancer, and cholagogic effects against hepatobiliary diseases. Ar-turmerone improved the ethanol-induced reduction in the cell viability of hepatocytes isolated from SD male rats [

In particular, ar-turmerone induced both regulation of Bax and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway [
