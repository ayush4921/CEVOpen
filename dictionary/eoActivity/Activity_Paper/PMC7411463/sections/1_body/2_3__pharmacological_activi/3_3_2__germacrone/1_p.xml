 <italic>C. longa</italic>. The pharmacological activities of germacrone in hepatobiliary diseases can be classified into two categories, namely, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects. Two 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in Japan demonstrated that the intake of germacrone reversed the increase in the serum level of AST and ALT induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice [

In particular, germacrone exhibited the induction of apoptosis similar to the control group in the normal liver cell line, LO2 cells, and significantly induced the apoptosis of HepG2 cells. These findings suggest that germacrone displays less toxic hepatoprotective effects and has strengths as it is only toxic to tumor cells [
