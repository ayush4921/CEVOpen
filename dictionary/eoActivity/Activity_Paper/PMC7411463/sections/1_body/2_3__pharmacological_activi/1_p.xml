<p>The main constituents that contribute to the bioactive effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> on hepatobiliary disease are largely grouped as curcuminoids and noncurcuminoids [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Curcuminoids, which are lipophilic polyphenols, account for approximately 5% of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>. However, their efficacy has been constantly reported. In particular, curcumin, the principal curcuminoid, has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antifibrotic, and anticancer effects against hepatobiliary diseases [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, extensive studies focusing on noncurcuminoids, such as elemene, germacrone, turmerone, and bisacurone, have recently accumulated [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, this review presents the pharmacological actions of the 4 noncurcuminoid constituents from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> which might have therapeutic effects against hepatobiliary diseases (
