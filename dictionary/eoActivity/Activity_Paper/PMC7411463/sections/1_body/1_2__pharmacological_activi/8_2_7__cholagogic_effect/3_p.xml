<p>In summary, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> exhibited cholagogic effects by increasing the production and secretion of total bile acids in high-fat diet-induced rats. However, there are no animal models induced by bile duct ligation or related to liver cirrhosis for evaluating the efficacy of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>. Therefore, different models stimulated by drugs, alcohol, autoimmune inflammation, viral infections, etc., are required to assess the pharmacological effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> in the treatment of cholestasis-induced dysfunctions.
