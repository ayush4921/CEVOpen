 <italic>C. longa</italic> exerted hepatoprotective properties against liver injury induced by heavy metals, such as lead [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and mercury [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and toxic pesticides, such as carbofuran [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and endosulfan [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], by lowering the serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and TB, improving hepatic protein synthesis, and preventing toxicity-induced weight loss in rats and chickens. Specifically, oral supplementation of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (500â€‰mg/kg daily for 28 days) led to a significant reduction of the elevated AST, ALT, and ALP in Wistar albino rats, which are abnormal markers associated with the hepatocellular damage. Treatment with 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> attenuated a significant increase of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and elevated the level of glutathione (GSH), which suggest that the possible molecular mechanism of pharmacological effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> against lead-induced hepatotoxicity might be involved in reducing oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, the ethanol extract of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> upregulated the expression of hepatic microsomal proteins that play a critical role in detoxification, which may contribute to its beneficial activity against HgCl
 <sub>2</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in SD rats [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
