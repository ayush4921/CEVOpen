<p>These pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> were mainly based on the decrease in inflammatory cytokine production by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation through its antioxidant actions. In a liver injury model induced by valproic acid and paracetamol, the water extract of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> lowered the intrahepatic MDA levels by increasing antioxidant enzymes, resulting in the suppression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> activity in the liver of male SD rats [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> augmented SOD and CAT levels and reduced the levels of intrahepatic MDA and serum TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in a TAA-induced liver cirrhosis model [
