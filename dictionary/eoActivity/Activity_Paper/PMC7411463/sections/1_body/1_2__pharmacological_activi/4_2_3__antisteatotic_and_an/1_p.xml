<p>The liver is in charge of lipid homeostasis by controlling the uptake and breakdown of dietary fatty acids for energy production, synthesizing de novo lipogenesis, or excretion from the liver [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Simple hepatic steatosis is defined as the intrahepatic accumulation of at least 5% of triglyceride (TG) of liver weight due to fatty acid surplus. Intrahepatic fat infiltration is itself the cause of NASH and accelerates the oxidative damage of hepatocytes, which makes the liver vulnerable to inflammation or fibrosis progression. In addition, hepatic steatosis is regarded as an independent risk factor of metabolic syndromes, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, and it has been reported to be more closely associated with metabolic syndromes than obesity [
