<p>Hepatobiliary disease includes a wide spectrum of hepatic and biliary disorders which are caused by damages induced by toxic chemicals, drugs, alcohol consumption, viral infection, carcinogen, and obesity. Recently, acute and chronic diseases of the liver and biliary system have become a major public issue as current hepatobiliary diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gallbladder, and biliary tract cancers are closely related to recent lifestyle changes [

Unfortunately, most hepatobiliary diseases are diagnosed at the advanced stage where they have already progressed as most patients experience few signs or symptoms. Hence, the prevalence, mortality, and the health care burden of hepatobiliary diseases are steadily increasing. Approximately 2 million liver-related deaths occur every year worldwide [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the true global burden could be higher than expected. Although there has been evident breakthrough with curative agents over the last decades to manage hepatobiliary diseases, an optimal preventive and therapeutic strategy has yet to be established because of the several stages of the disease itself, complicated pathogenesis, low efficacy at long-term use, drug resistance, and undesirable side effects.
