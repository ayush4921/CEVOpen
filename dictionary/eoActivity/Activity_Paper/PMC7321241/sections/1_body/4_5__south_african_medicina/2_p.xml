<p>Herbal tea made from the aerial parts of Rooibos 
 <italic>Aspalathus linearis</italic> has been shown to have multiple health benefits. These health benefits have been mainly attributed to the C-glucosyl dihydrochalcone aspalathin, which is especially enriched in the fermented tea. In vitro studies have shown that aspalathin and aspalathin-enriched green tea improved lipid metabolism in adipocyte-derived 3T3-L cells [

Further studies showed that an aspalathin-enriched green Rooibos extract was also able to inhibit hepatic insulin resistance in vitro in hepatic cells and in vivo in obese insulin-resistant rats, through mechanisms that involved the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, amongst others [
