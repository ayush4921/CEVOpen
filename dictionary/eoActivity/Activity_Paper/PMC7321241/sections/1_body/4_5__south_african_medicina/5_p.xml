<p>In a study in which we fed rats a high-fructose diet, it was shown that methanolic leaf extracts of

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic>, hepatic lipid accumulation was decreased in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, possibly through mechanisms which involved the upregulation of genes associated with lipid hepatic metabolism and the suppression of hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression [

 <italic>Opuntia ficus</italic> seed extract (DWJ504) when fed to rats in the last four weeks of a 10-week high-fat diet, prevented hepatic steatosis, induced macrophage polarization, and suppressed inflammatory signaling pathways associated with Toll-like 4 receptors, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 6 [
