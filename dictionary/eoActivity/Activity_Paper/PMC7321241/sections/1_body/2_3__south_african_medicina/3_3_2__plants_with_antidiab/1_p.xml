<p>Extensive work has been done in South Africa in the screening of plants with antidiabetic action. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02669-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the list of plants identified to possess antidiabetic activity in South Africa. The list is not exhaustive, and it is possible that some of the plants used in South Africa remain unreported because of an existing gap in communication between the African traditional medicine system and modern medicine. Depending on the geographical location, different plants and/or different parts of the same plant are reportedly used for treating diabetes. Genetics and environmental factors, e.g., soil types, climate, types of vegetation, and presence of other organisms, affect the presence and levels of phytochemicals which in turn are responsible for most of the bioactivity of medicinal plants. Plants containing high levels of phenolic compounds have a high antioxidative capacity; hence, they may be useful in the treatment of diabetic complications that result from high oxidative stress [
