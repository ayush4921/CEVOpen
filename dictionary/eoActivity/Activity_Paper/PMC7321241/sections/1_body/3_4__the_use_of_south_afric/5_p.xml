<p>Phytochemical constituents in anti-hypertensive medicinal plant preparations also target the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), a key signaling pathway fundamental in blood pressure regulation. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the development of hypertension by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II [

Several in vitro studies were done on South African medicinal plants to investigate their ACE inhibition potential. It has been shown that aqueous and ethanolic extracts of
