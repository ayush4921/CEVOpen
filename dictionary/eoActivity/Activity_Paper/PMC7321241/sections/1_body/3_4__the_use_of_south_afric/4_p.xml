 <italic>Opuntia megacantha</italic> crude leaf extracts have been shown to reverse the inability of kidneys to excrete sodium in a streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rat model [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. This suggests that the plant extracts may have beneficial effects in the management of hypertension through its influence on kidneyâ€™s ability to regulate the blood volume. The other South African medicinal plants that are popularly used in the management of hypertension due to their vasorelaxant, bradycardiac, and cardioprotective effects include 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (phenols and flavonoids) [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], 
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic> (flavonoids and triterpenes) [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], 
 <italic>Ficus thonningii</italic> (anthraquinones, flavonoids, and saponins) [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], and 
 <italic>Olea europea</italic> (triterpenes, flavonoids, and glycosides) [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The phytochemicals isolated from wild African olive leaves (
 <italic>Olea europea</italic>) from Cape Town exhibited diuretic, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-hypertensive effects [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Experimental animal studies using an insulin-resistant rat model showed that six-week treatments with 
 <italic>O. europea</italic> extracts prevented the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis, demonstrating the potential of this medicinal plant in the management of hypertension in the African population [
