In the meantime, in the other parts of the world, unsafe blood transfusion and unhealthy injection practices contribute to the development of HCV infection [

At present, no vaccine against HCV is available, and the presence of a high diversity of viral isolates will possibly make it very hard to develop a vaccine. Over the last five years, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of HCV infection with their specific mechanism of action [

DAAs were introduced in 2014, provided effective interferon-free therapy combinations for all HCV genotype, and have very few safety considerations. Serious adverse events are rare, but drug-drug interactions are considered a major issue regarding the choice of DAA regimen, which needs drug-drug interaction assessment before starting therapy [
