<p>Among viral infections, the viruses of the influenza viral infection have the ability to mutate their genome and become resistant to drugs [
 <xref rid="B206-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Thus, the discovery of phytochemicals against the influenza virus is more challenging compared to other viruses. Among the phytochemicals, alkaloids have shown superior activity against flu virus. It is believed that the alkaloids have the ability to kill virus by the induction of interferon of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Some alkaloids can increase the phagocytosis by macrophages activity, whereas some can inhibit viral protein synthesis [

 <xref rid="B210-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>] was well documented. In 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04878-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, we have mentioned the compounds that exhibited inhibitory activity on viral inhibition with an IC
