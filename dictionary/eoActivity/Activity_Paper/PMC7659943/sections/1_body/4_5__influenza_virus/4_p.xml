 <xref rid="B184-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. This approach was based on the two mechanisms that induce viral replication in host immune reactions [

 <xref rid="B190-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. These folk drugs were developed as an alternative to synthetic drugs. The exploration of plant-based antivirals against the influenza virus is hopeful, as several plants have been shown to have anti-influenza action. Therefore, the current review paper summarizes the previous findings and efforts of some studies on discovering anti-influenza medications from medicinal plants. A list of plant species with inhibition studies is summarized in
