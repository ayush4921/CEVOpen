<p>Influenza virus mainly targets the columnar epithelial cells in the respiratory tract [

Firstly, the hemagglutinin (HA) present in the receptor binding site of virus attached to galactose bound sialic acid on the surface of the host. This receptor binding is the determining factor for turning part of an organism in a particular direction of infection in response to a virus stimulus. To achieve this receptor binding, the virus undergoes tremendous efforts to bypass host immune responses, mucociliary clearance, and genetic diversification of the host receptor. Then, after the binding, viron enters the host cell by an endocytosis mechanism with the protease cleavage of hemagglutinin. Then, the viron produces a vacuole membrane, which releases the viral RNA and proteins into the cytosol. These proteins and RNA form a complex (vRNA/RdRP), which reaches the nucleus [

 <xref rid="B180-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Then, the viral RNA is translated into newly synthesized proteins, which are secreted via the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus to bind viral RNA to form a viral particle. Later, the RNA particle and viral proteins accumulate to form a new viron and buds off from the cell membrane (
