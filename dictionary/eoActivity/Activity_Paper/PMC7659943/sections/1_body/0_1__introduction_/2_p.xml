<p>Viral infections and associated diseases are responsible for a substantial number of mortality and public health problems around the world. Each year, infectious diseases kill 3.5 million people worldwide [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Even though there are different therapeutic strategies available in the clinical practice, a lack of specificity toward the virus, and the limited efficacy of drugs makes the vaccines a gold standard prophylactic to viral infections. Moreover, the synthetic drugs often do not meet the treatment expectation via either unwanted drug side effects or drug resistance to nucleoside analogues via mutation [

The drug failure and resistances have led to a growing interest in natural products, especially plants, and investigation into antiviral agent discovery. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 65% of the world population is in the practice of using plants and herbs as part of the treatment modality [
