<p>A virus is a tiny parasite that has no capacity to replicate itself. Once infected in a host agent or living cell, it produces more viruses using host machinery. With their complexity and diversity, it survives for a long time in the host, bypassing the treatments, and it causes devastating issues such as pandemics [

Acute infections happen in an out of balance way; for instance, it is a non-equilibrium process whereby the virus and host change its process until the destruction of the host or control over the infection. The ineffective function of specific genes related to the immunity of the host or effective reduction of host immunity by the viral genes is a niche in this infection and leads to the development of overwhelming consequences [
