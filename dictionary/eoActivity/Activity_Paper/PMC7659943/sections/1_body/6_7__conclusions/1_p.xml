<p>Viral infections and pandemic have been recorded as a potential risk for human survival. The lack of proper prophylactic vaccines and drugs for many viruses makes the situation worse in health management. There is a great need for novel antiviral compounds for drug development. This review provides in-depth and insightful information about different species of plants and their families with significant secondary metabolites with evidence-based antiviral properties. Based on the literature, we provided very promising drug candidates that have been investigated through in vitro screening, and cellular targets have been observed. In the current review, we have selected HIV, HSV, HCV and Influenza virus. Looking at the spectrum of plants and isolated compounds, we have seen that there is no significant selectivity among the plants and their compounds in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus. We have found that a similar class of phytochemicals can inhibit both types, but with the ability to inhibit different sites of mechanism. However, these compounds need a lot of further investigation to make them appropriate for clinical use. The pace of new antiviral drugs from natural origin has experienced a substantial upsurge in the last decade. Natural products directly or indirectly support the drug discovery against viruses. Many anti-viral drugs has been discovered from a synthetic source, but originally modeled on a natural product parent structure. Most of the plants we have identified in this review hold other pharmacological benefits, proven long ago, together with their safety profile. This promotes the acceptance of these plants and their phytochemicals for antiviral drug discovery and development programs. Nevertheless, a thorough purification process for identifying new lead compounds and their preclinical and safety testing is a prerequisite. The current COVID-19 pandemic has taught us a more significant lesson: it is difficult to survive in this earth without accepting the probability of more pandemics in the future. Hence, taking the facts in a very comprehensive manner, a cohesive and focused drug discovery approach is warranted.</p>
