<p id="Par53">Nine species were recorded as predictors of climatic and environmental changes: the “totopito con chilaquil” (
 <italic>Aegolius acadicus</italic> (Gmelin, 1788)), the roadrunner, the “tecolote,” two species of swallows (
 <italic>Hirundo rustica</italic> Linnaeus, 1758
 <italic>; Stelgidopteryx serripennis</italic> (Audubon, 1838)), three species recognized as “saltapared” (
 <italic>Catherpes mexicanus</italic> (Swainson, 1829); T
 <italic>roglodytes aedon</italic> Vieillot, 1809; 
 <italic>Thryomanes bewickii</italic> (Audubon, 1827)), and the owl (
 <italic>Tyto alba</italic> (Scopoli, 1769)). In the case of peasants and salineros (people extracting salt from mines), these ECPs help them to interpret rain announcements that allow them to prepare actions; for instance, the salineros rush the collection and protection of salt in the face of this rain forecast.

  <p id="Par54">Also, the one who sings is the saltapared, sings also when is going to rain. Ah! also the roadrunner warns, that almost does not sing, that, when it is very hot and the time is already set then he sings and it is going to rain, yes—Man, 73 years.</p>
