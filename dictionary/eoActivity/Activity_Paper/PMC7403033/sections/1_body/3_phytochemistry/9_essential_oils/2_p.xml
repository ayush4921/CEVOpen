<p id="p0235">Most genera of Hyptidinae include aromatic species that have been attracting interest from researchers for a long time. The first study found on essential oils of a species of this taxon dates from 1935, and deals with the obtaining of essential oil from 
 <italic>Cantinoa mutabilis</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis mutabilis</italic>) (
 <xref rid="bib262" ref-type="bibr">Werner, 1935</xref>). Subsequently, since the 1980s, a number of articles have been published, focusing on obtaining essential oils from several species, both from the fresh or dried leaves. The main compounds (&gt;5%) present in the composition of these oils are summarized in
