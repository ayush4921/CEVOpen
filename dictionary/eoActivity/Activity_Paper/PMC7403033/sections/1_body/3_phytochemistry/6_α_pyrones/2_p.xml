<p id="p0180">Hyptolide (
 <bold>149</bold>) was the first 
 <italic>α</italic>-pyrone isolated from Hyptidinae (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). The compound was obtained from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) in 1920 (
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Gorter, 1920</xref>), but its structure was completely elucidated only in 1964 (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Birch and Butler, 1964</xref>). Further studies were developed with this species, allowing the isolation of pectinolides A – C (
 <bold>150</bold>–
 <bold>152</bold>) (
 <xref rid="bib200" ref-type="bibr">Pereda-Miranda et al., 1993</xref>) and D – H (

 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Fragoso-Serrano et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, five 
 <italic>α</italic>-pyrones were isolated from the same species and named as pectinolides I – M (
