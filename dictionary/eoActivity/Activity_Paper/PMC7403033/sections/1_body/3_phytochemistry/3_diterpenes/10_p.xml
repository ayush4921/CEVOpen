<p id="p0110">Recently, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Bridi et al., (2020)</xref> have reported the presence of 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurane diterpenes in three 
 <italic>Cantinoa</italic> species. Kaurenoic acid (
 <bold>73</bold>) was isolated from 
 <italic>Cantinoa heterodon</italic> (Epling) Harley &amp; J.F.B.Pastore (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis heterodon</italic> Epling) and characterized by GC-MS in the species 
 <italic>Cantinoa stricta</italic> (Benth.) Harley &amp; J.F.B.Pastore (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis stricta</italic> Benth.) and 
 <italic>Cantinoa mutabilis</italic> (Rich.) Harley &amp; J.F.B.Pastore (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis mutabilis</italic> Rich.). The occurrence of this type of diterpenes in Hyptidinae is rare and as far as it is known, this is the only report of the presence of 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurane diterpenes in species from this taxon. This type of structure is more frequent in species that belongs to Asteraceae family (
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Garc√≠a et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib260" ref-type="bibr">Villa-Ruano et al., 2016</xref>). The restricted occurrence of kaurane diterpenes in species of 
 <italic>Cantinoa</italic> is interesting and other species should be studied to determine whether they could be taxonomic markers of the genus.
