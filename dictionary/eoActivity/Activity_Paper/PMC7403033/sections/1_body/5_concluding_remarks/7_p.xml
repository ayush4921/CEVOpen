<p id="p0645">Against this backdrop, even considering that relatively few species have been investigated from the chemical and pharmacological point of view, the available information indicates that the subtribe Hyptidinae is a fruitful source for future discoveries. In addition to the possibility of finding many important compounds, such as diterpenes and

Thus, there is a wide-open door for future investigations, both to support the popular uses of the plants and to find new compounds and activities in this large number of species not yet explored.
