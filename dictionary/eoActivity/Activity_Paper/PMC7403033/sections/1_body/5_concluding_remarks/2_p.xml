<p id="p0620">Approximately 20 species of Hyptidinae have been cited in the ethnobotanical studies presented in this review. Besides the value as pest repellents, the main uses of these species are as wound healing and pain-relief agents, as well as for the treatment of diseases of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In these studies, the most cited species are 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cantinoa mutabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyptis crenata</italic>. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate their effectiveness and establish the nature of the active constituents. An exception is 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> that has been more extensively investigated in both ethno and experimental scientific approach and, as it can be seen in this review, the results corroborate some of the traditional use.
