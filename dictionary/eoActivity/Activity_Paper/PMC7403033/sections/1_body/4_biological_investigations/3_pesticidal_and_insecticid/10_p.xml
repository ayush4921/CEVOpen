<p id="p0335">Among the pests that affect agriculture in the Neotropical region, leaf cutting ants such as 
 <italic>Acromyrmex balzani</italic> Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), cause damages that can reach billions of dollars per year (
 <xref rid="bib179" ref-type="bibr">Montoya-Lerma et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the essential oils of 
 <italic>Eplingiella fruticosa</italic>, from four genotypes with different levels of monoterpenes, were investigated concerning its toxicity on 
 <italic>Acromyrmex balzani</italic> populations. The results demonstrated LC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 4.54 to 6.78 μL/L, being the genotypes with higher contents of monoterpenes the most active. In order to reinforce the data obtained with the essential oils, the isolated compounds 1,8-cineol (
 <bold>250</bold>), camphor (
 <bold>252</bold>), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (
 <bold>262</bold>) and caryophyllene oxide (
 <bold>284</bold>) were also tested. The data corroborate the former results, indicating that the activity was principally provided by the monoterpenes 1,8-cineol (
 <bold>250</bold>) and camphor (
 <bold>252</bold>), whose LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 1.05 μL/L and 2.46 μL/L, respectively (
