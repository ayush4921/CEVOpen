<p id="p0315">In the context of agricultural losses, more than 100 insect species are known to live and feed on stored peanuts, some of them with economic importance, being the cadelle (
 <italic>Tenebroides mauritanicus</italic>), one of the most commonly reported pests (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Coskuncu and Kovanci, 2005</xref>). Searching for insecticidal agents, the essential oil from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>), constituted mainly by 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>250</bold>) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (
 <bold>262</bold>), was tested against this pest. The results revealed that a concentration of 0.5 μL of essential oil/g of peanut is enough to cause 100% of mortality after 24 h, indicating the potential of this oil in the protection against 
 <italic>Tenebroides mauritanicus</italic> and reduction of post-harvest losses (
