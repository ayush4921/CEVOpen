<p id="p0605">In another study, with 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>), the essential oil and the infusion of dry leaves were tested against 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>. The main components of the essential oil were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (
 <bold>262</bold>) (18.6%), sabinene (
 <bold>246</bold>) (15.9%) and spathulenol (
 <bold>291</bold>) (11.1%) while the leaf infusion showed caffeic acid as the major constituent (12.76 mg/g). While the essential oil caused impairment of the locomotor behavior of flies and toxicity with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.5 and 49.2 μg/mL in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>
 <italic>melanogaster</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>, respectively, the infusion had no effect in the organisms (
