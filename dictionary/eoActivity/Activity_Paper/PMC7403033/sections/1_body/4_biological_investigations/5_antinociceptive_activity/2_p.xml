<p id="p0460">The first study with this purpose was carried out with 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) using the writhing test. The oral administration of leaves extracts (hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate) (100, 200, 400Â mg/kg of body weight in mice) significantly reduced the number of writhing induced by acetic acid and increased the response to thermal stimuli in hot-plate test (

 <italic>Eriope</italic>
 <italic>blanchetii</italic>, showed capability to inhibit capsaicin evoked acute nociception due to mechanisms possibly involving opioid receptors, nitric oxide, and K
