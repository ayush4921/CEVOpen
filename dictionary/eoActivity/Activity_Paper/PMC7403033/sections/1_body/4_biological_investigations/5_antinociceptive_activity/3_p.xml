 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) (100, 200, 400Â mg/kg of body weight in mice), was investigated using abdominal writhing induced by acetic acid and hot plate tests. The results demonstrated that the essential oils from all genotypes have antinociceptive effect, in both models used. These results are relevant facing the demonstration of peripheral (writhes reduction) and central antinociceptive effects (hot plate) (
