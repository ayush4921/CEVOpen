<p id="p0485">The ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum sidifolium</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis umbrosa</italic>) was assessed concerning its antinociceptive (acetic acid-induced writhing model, formalin, glutamate or capsaicin) and anti-inflammatory actions (peritonitis induced by the intrathoracic injection of carrageenan to quantify the total number of leukocytes) (100, 200 or 400Â mg/kg of body weight in mice). The results demonstrated that the treatment with all doses produced a significant analgesia in the acetic acid-induced writhing model and in the glutamate and capsaicin tests. Furthermore, the extracts efficiently inhibited the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity. Therefore, the authors suggest that the tested extracts hold peripheral analgesic action and showed potential in reducing the spreading of the inflammatory processes (
