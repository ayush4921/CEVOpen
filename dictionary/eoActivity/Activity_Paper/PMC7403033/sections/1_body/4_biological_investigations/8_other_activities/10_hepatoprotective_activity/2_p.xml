<p id="p0590">Among the various studies carried out with species of Hyptidinae there is an investigation of the effect of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Hyptis crenata</italic> in models of liver dysfunction during early sepsis (
 <xref rid="bib157" ref-type="bibr">Lima et al., 2018</xref>). Despite of continuous efforts concerning sepsis treatments, this condition remains as the main cause of deaths in the intensive care units. In the above-cited study, the sepsis was induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) experiments and the essential oil was administered 12 and 24 h after surgery (300 mg/kg). The outcomes from this study revealed that this essential oil played a protective effect against liver injury induced by sepsis.
