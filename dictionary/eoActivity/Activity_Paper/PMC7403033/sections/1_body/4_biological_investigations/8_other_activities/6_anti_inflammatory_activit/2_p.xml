<p id="p0555">Regarding anti-inflammatory potential, the effects of a chloroform extract of 
 <italic>Condea albida</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis albida</italic>) on inflammatory responses in mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced peritoneal macrophages were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the extract was able in inhibit LPS-induced production of TNF-α and interleukin-6, signaling molecules in the inflammatory cascade (
