<p id="p0575">In this sense, the potential of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Eplingiella fruticosa</italic> in a model of Parkinson disease (reserpine) in mice was evaluated. In this study, a complexation of the oil with β-cyclodextrin was performed and the results demonstrated that the essential oil presents potential neuroprotective effect probably mediated by an antioxidant response. This effect was enhanced by the complexation with β-cyclodextrin, suggesting a novel technological approach to carry lipophilic samples (

 <italic>Medusantha martiusii</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis martiusii</italic>) and its main component, 1,8-cineole (
