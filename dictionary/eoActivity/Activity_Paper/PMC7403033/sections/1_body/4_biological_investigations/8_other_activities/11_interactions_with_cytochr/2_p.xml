<p id="p0595">More recently, the potential herb-drug interactions was assessed in order to verify the influence of some Hyptidinae species on the enzymatic complex cytochrome 
 <italic>P</italic>-450. 
 <xref rid="bib204" ref-type="bibr">Picking et al. (2018)</xref> analyzed the impact of 
 <italic>Condea verticillata</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis verticillata</italic>) extracts on activities of key cytochrome 
 <italic>P</italic>-450 enzymes (CYPS 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 3A4 and 2D60). The dried plant aqueous extracts showed potent inhibition on the activities of CYPS 1A1 (7.6 μg/mL), 1A2 (1.9 μg/mL), 1B1 (9.4 μg/mL). Furthermore, ethanolic extracts from dry and fresh plants demonstrated a potent inhibition of CYP1A2, in concentrations of 1.5 and 3.9 μg/mL, respectively. Other authors have demonstrated the inhibition of cytochrome 
 <italic>P</italic>450 enzymes caused by an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>), finding the subtype CYP1A2 (3.68 ± 0.10 μg/mL) as the least inhibited when compared to CYP2D6 (1.39 ± 0.01 μg/mL) and CYP3A4 (2.36 ± 0.57 μg/mL) (
