<p id="p0510">The first study of cytotoxicity involving a species from Hyptidinae, published in 1979, reports the activity of the ethanolic extract from

 <sub>50</sub> 2.6 μg/mL) and the P-388 lymphocytic leukemia system (140–200 mg/kg). After a positive result exhibited by the extract, isolated compounds were tested against the KB cells, showing promising results: deoxypodophyllotoxin (
