<p id="p0400">The antifungal activity of an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Hyptis crenata</italic> was investigated against several leveduriform fungal species. The most promising activities were found against 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> species (MIC 125 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="bib261" ref-type="bibr">Violante et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, hexanic (96.9% inhibition) and chlorophormic (96.9% inhibition) fractions from the leaves of 
 <italic>Hyptidendron canum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis cana</italic>), as well as ursolic acid (

 <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic> (

 <italic>Medusantha martiusii</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis martiusii</italic>) ethanolic extract was tested against this some 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains and did not exhibit antifungal activity (MIC ≥ 1024 μg/mL) (
