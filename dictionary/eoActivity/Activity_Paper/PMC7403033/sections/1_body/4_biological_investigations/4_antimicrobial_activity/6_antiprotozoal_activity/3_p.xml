 <xref rid="bib263" ref-type="bibr">WHO (2018)</xref>, only in 2017, approximately 435 000 malaria deaths occurred worldwide due to 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections. Therefore, studies aiming at finding antimalarial agents are highly relevant. In this context, some species of Hyptidinae were investigated. The results showed that the ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) displayed high antiplasmodial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive strain of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.9 μg/mL)(

 <italic>epi</italic>-dioxiabiet-8(14)-en-18-ol (
 <bold>6</bold>), isolated from the same species, exhibited antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 100 μg/mL) (
