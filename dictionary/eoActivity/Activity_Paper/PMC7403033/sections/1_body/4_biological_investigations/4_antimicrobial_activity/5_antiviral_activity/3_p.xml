<p id="p0420">There are few reports about the antiviral activity of Hyptidinae extracts, essential oils or isolated compounds. The anti-HIV activity of oleanolic acid (

 <bold>88</bold>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 23.3 μg/mL), isolated from 
 <italic>H. capitata</italic>, was demonstrated (

 <italic>Cantinoa mutabilis</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis mutabilis</italic>), containing 1,8-cineole (

 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (
