<p id="p0445">Chagas disease is another serious public health problem. An estimated 8 million people are infected with 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> worldwide, mainly in Latin America, causing more than 10 000 deaths per year. Nowadays, chemotherapy is the only available treatment for this disease, and the drugs currently used present high toxicity levels (
 <xref rid="bib265" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019b</xref>). Therefore, the discovery of new drugs is very important. In this sense, the essential oils of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) and 
 <italic>Hypenia salzmannii</italic> demonstrated to be effective against all 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> forms, epimastigote (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 56.1 μg/mL; 42.13 μg/mL), trypomastigote (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.6 μg/mL; 36.27 μg/mL) and amastigote (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.5 μg/mL; 35.25 μg/mL). Besides, the selectivity index for amastigotes and epimastigotes were suitable to the development of promising products with trypanocidal activity (
