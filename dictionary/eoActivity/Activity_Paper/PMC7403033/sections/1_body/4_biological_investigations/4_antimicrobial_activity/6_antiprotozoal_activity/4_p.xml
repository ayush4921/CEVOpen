<p id="p0440">Other parasite with high mortality rates is 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> that is endemic in more than 98 countries on five continents (
 <xref rid="bib264" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019a</xref>). Thus, efforts must be pursued in order to diminish the incidence of this parasite. In this backdrop, as species of Hyptidinae are used as leishmanicidal agents, some of them were investigated demonstrating promising results. An ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Hyptis lacustris</italic> A.St.-Hill ex Benth revealed interesting activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μg/mL) against amastigote forms of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (

 <italic>Leishmania</italic> effect, 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) extracts (hexanic, ethyl acetate, ethanolic and hydromethanolic), and the isolated compounds 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl-rosmarinic acid (
 <bold>223</bold>), sambacaitaric acid (
 <bold>225</bold>) and 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl-sambacaitaric acid (
 <bold>226</bold>) exhibited leishmanicidal activity against the promastigote forms of 
 <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> (

 <italic>Leishmania</italic> activity of an aqueous extract of the last cited species in the 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (100 μg/mL) and amastigotes (10 μg/mL) (
