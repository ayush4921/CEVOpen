<p>Natural products such as plants and endophytic fungi are the source of various anticancer drugs [

 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> was of interest because reports have shown that its chemical constituents affected cancer growth [

 <xref rid="B80-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Moreover, we were interested in its endophyte due to the possibility of producing the same metabolites as the host plant and novel metabolites of pharmaceutical importance [

 <xref rid="B81-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Different solvents yielded different metabolic profiles [
 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Thus, biosensor cells were used to preliminarily determine the bioactive metabolic profiles from 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> leaves in ethyl acetate and ethanol. Our results demonstrate that the ethyl acetate-derived crude metabolites possessed dose-dependent biological activity toward biosensor cells (

 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> leaves, which induced 41 isolated endophytes. Our results show that 41 isolates had the same hyphae and spore morphology. Thus, one isolate was used as a representative and was later identified to belong to 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. The ITS1-4 sequence identity was between 
 <italic>Phyllosticta ampelicida/Guignardia bidwellii</italic> and the isolate was 95%.
