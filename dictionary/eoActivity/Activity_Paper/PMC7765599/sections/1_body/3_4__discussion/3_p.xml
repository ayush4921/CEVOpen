<p>We determined the subnuclear focus formation of γH2AX, 53BP1, RAD54L, and RAD51 to observe DNA damage and repair at the molecular level [
 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Our results showed that the biosensor cell had the same phenotype as the wild type. In terms of quantity, the biosensor clone had the same focus formation of γH2AX (

We used the RAD51 antibody to confirm the HR activity of RAD54L in biosensor cells since no antibody against chicken RAD54L was commercially available. RAD54L is a helicase and interacts with RAD51, facilitating the strand invasion [
