<p>Two representative proteins were selected because studies have reported the use of the targeted knockin of FP. Pedersen et al. and Oestergaard et al. tagged FP to the C-terminus of 53BP1 to study the functions of TopBP1 and RNF8, RNF168, and HER2 during DNA damage, respectively [

 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Eppink et al. and Agarwal et al. attached green FP to the C-terminus to study the function of RAD54 in HR [

 <xref rid="B76-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Thus, it was conceivable that the fusion of two fluorescent proteins, mCherry and mVenus, would not disrupt the repair function. Our results showed that biosensor cells grew at a slower rate compared to the wild type. However, in the viability assay with ETP and CPT, DNA-damaging agents, the viability profiles of both clones were comparable with the wild type. Both clones showed the same phenotype in the cell growth and viability assays, so we selected clone #1 for further experiments.
