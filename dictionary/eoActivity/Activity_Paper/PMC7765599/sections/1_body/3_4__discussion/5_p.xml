 <italic>Guignardia bidwellii</italic> is a fungal plant pathogen that produces phytotoxic metabolites, for example, phenguignardic acid, guignardic acid, alaguignardic acid, and guignardianones A, E, and F. Guignardic and phenguignardic acids have no toxicity against HeLa S3 or Jurkat cells. No mechanistic study on DNA damage and repair has been considered, probably because of the unavailability of DNA repair biosensors. Our results demonstrate that both extracts from 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 caused mild DSB, which was validated by Î³H2AX increment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f008">Figure 8</xref>). 53BP1 was also higher in the crude metabolite-treated group, showing that the damaged DNA activated NHEJ repair.
