<p>We used DT40 cell lines to develop a biosensor based on the DSB repair pathways. The repair activity of the biosensor was analyzed, and it was used to screen the crude metabolites from 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy leaves and its endophyte, 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. Crude extracts from the ethyl acetate fraction induced DNA damage and the repair process. Thus, our biosensor could be used as an effective tool for bioassay-guided purification.
