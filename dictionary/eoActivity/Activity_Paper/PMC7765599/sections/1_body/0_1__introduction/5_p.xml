<p>In this study, we created a biosensor based on DSB repair pathways from the DT40 cell line. DT40 has been well documented as a cellular model to study DNA damage and repair [

 <xref rid="B52-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. DNA repair-deficient DT40 cell lines are widely used in high-throughput screening to evaluate the genotoxicity of substances or find compounds affecting DNA repair [

 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The lack of p53 in DT40 causes the cell to pass through the G1-S checkpoint, thereby allowing DNA damage accumulated through the cell cycle and repair mechanism to be investigated. In our experiment, fluorescent protein (FP) was tagged with 53BP1 C-terminus, a protein representing NHEJ, and RAD54L C-terminus, a protein representing HR. The biosensor was validated for the repair activity and was used to test the crude extracts from
