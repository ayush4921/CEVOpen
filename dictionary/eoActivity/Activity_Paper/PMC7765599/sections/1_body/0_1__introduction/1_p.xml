<p>It is well known that conventional chemotherapy relies on inhibiting cell proliferation. Although this mode of action can target cancer cells, the side effects are frequently intolerable and treatment is not optimally effective in all patients [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the past decade, new therapies have been developed that use the molecular profiling of the patientâ€™s tumor to tailor the treatment, so-called targeted therapy [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Targeting DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways has proved to be effective in cancer treatments [

 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Two major DNA DSB repair pathways are homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Olaparib is the well-known example of targeted drugs to treat ovarian or breast cancer patients with

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, targeted drugs are expensive and the choice is often limited [
