<p>Because targeting DSB repair pathways is a promising target for cancer treatment, several researchers have developed the DSB biosensor to study the preference between HR and NHEJ. Mao et al. developed three fluorescent reporter assays to study the contribution of HR and NHEJ in each cell cycle phase of a human cell line [

Despite these two biosensors being valuable to investigate the pathway choice in human cells, they might not be suitable for screening compounds due to the genome of cancer cell lines being mostly unstable over longer periods. Thus, a model with a more stable genetic background is of interest.
