<p>We further explored whether the crude extracts affected the downstream level of NHEJ, since 53BP1 is the initial player in the NHEJ pathway. LIG4 is the major protein in the last step of NHEJ by which it ligates the broken ends of DSBs [

 <italic>53BP1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> and 
 <italic>LIG4</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> treated with 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> extract were similar to the wild type. Thus, 53BP1 and LIG4 did not seem to play a role in 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> extract-induced DNA damage repair (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f009">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast to 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 treatment, both 
 <italic>53BP1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> (36.52%) and 
 <italic>LIG4</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> (27.31%) had a lower viability than the wild type (57.75%) at 25 µg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Consequently, 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41-induced DNA damage appeared to contain metabolites participating in NHEJ. The potency of the crude extract from 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 was higher than that of 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy, as was evidenced by the fact that the viability was almost obliterated for 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extract at 50 µg/mL, whereas for 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy extract, it was significantly diminished at 100 µg/mL.
