<p>We designed plasmids to replace the stop codon of DNA repair genes with the fusion fluorescent proteins mCherry and mVenus in the 
 <italic>53BP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RAD54L</italic> genes, respectively. Heterologous targeted knockin of both genes at the endogenous 3′-end was confirmed by Southern blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The accomplishment of 
 <italic>53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus</italic> targeted knockin was indicated by the presence of two bands at 3.6 kb (WT) and 5.4 kb (mCherry) for 53BP1 and at 6.4 kb (WT) and 10 kb (mVenus) for RAD54L. Two clones of the 
 <italic>53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus</italic> DNA repair biosensor cell were selected and the proliferative rates of both clones were significantly slower than those of the wild type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The doubling times of the wild type, 
 <italic>53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus#C1, 53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus#C2, 53BP1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup>, and 
 <italic>RAD54L</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> were 7.95 ± 0.02, 10.07 ± 0.08, 9.75 ± 0.15, 10.09 ± 0.23, and 8.99 ± 0.13 h, respectively.
