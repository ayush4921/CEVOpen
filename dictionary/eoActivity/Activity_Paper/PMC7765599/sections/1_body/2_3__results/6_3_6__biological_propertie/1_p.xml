<p>The viability assay was used to determine the effect of ethyl acetate crude extracts from 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41. The result demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extracts from both 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 and 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> affected biosensor cell viability (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The viability of the biosensor treated with 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE4 ethyl acetate crude extract was reduced to 74%, 14%, and 0.02% when the cells were treated at 20, 40, and 80 μg/mL, respectively (
