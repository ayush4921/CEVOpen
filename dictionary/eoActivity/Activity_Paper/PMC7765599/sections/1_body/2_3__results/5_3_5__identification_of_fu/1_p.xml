<p>Forty-one microbial isolates were obtained from the healthy leaves of 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). The gross morphology and microscopic appearance were all identical. They appeared as a green fluffy growth on the PDA plate with shuttle-shaped spores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,c). We selected one isolation for further experiments. Genomic DNA was extracted and the fungus was identified using ITS1-4 as the standard primers. The ITS1-4 sequence was 95% identical with the 
 <italic>Phyllosticta ampelicida</italic> or 
 <italic>Guignardia bidwellii</italic> isolate G17 ITS sequence (HM049170.1). Therefore, we denoted endophyte as 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41.
