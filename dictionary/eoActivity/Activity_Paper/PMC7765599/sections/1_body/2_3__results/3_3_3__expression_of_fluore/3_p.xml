<p>After incubation with 100 nM CPT for 1 h or 1 µM ETP for 2 h to introduce DNA damage, the 
 <italic>53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus</italic> clone had a similar percentage of γH2AX positive cells as the wild type, with 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.2695 (CPT) and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0343 (ETP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The similarity of foci formation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) indicated normal DSB repair activation in the biosensor cells [

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1461) when staining with the 53BP1 antibody, and the number of overlapping foci in the biosensor cells in endogenous 53BP1 (antibody staining) and 53BP1-mcherry was &gt; 90% in both the no-drug and the ETP-treated group (
