<p>To confirm the expression and localization of biosensors, we tested cells with CPT and ETP to detect HR and NHEJ activities, respectively. CPT, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is a topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor and specifically generates DSBs during the S-phase, which requires error-free HR [
