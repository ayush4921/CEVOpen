<p>The 
 <italic>53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus</italic> cells were treated with 100 nM CPT for 1 h to verify RAD54L-mVenus as a biosensor of HR. The result showed that RAD51 foci overlapped with RAD54L, indicating sites of HR, and the number of overlapping RAD51 and RAD54L foci was &gt; 90% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). These showed that our HR and NHEJ biosensors performed similarly in terms of localization and quantitation to endogenous proteins after DNA damage.
