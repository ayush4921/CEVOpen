<p>The biosensor cells were continuously treated with either 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> or 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 for 8 h. During the treatment, the cells were collected to observe the focus formation according to each time point represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f008">Figure 8</xref>. In this experiment, CPT and ETP were included in the assay as positive controls, and DMSO was used as a negative control. The result showed that 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extracts induced moderate DSBs. The values of Î³H2AX-positive cells at 8 h were 21% and 24%, respectively, whereas the value for the DMSO control was 5%. The values of 53BP1 positive cells at 8 h were 28% for 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 27% for 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41, and the value for the DMSO control was 11%. There was no RAD54L focus formation observed from either the 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extracts. The focus formation of 53BP1 and RAD54L suggested that the damage caused by the extracts activated NHEJ rather than HR.
