<p>The isolation of endophytic fungi from the 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> leaf was adapted from Wiyakrutta et al., and Potshangbam et al. [

 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Briefly, the leaves were cleaned with running faucet water and sterilized by sequentially soaking in 4–6% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 min, 70% ethanol for 1 min, and sterile distilled water three times. The leaves were cut into small pieces, which were placed on half-strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) and yeast malt agar (YMA) with 100 µg/mL 
 <italic>chloramphenicol</italic> (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 14 days until hyphal growths were observed. To identify the fungal species, genomic DNA was sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1–4 primers (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea), and subsequently analyzed by NCBI blast (
