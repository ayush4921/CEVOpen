<p>To prepare the seed inoculum, 10 pieces of 1 cm × 1 cm actively growing hyphal were transferred to potato dextrose broth and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h with shaking. Then, 10% of seed inoculum was transferred to modified Wickerhams Antibiotic Test Medium and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days [
 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The fungal mass was filtered to obtain the cultured medium (secretory metabolite). Both secretory and mycelia crude extract metabolites were obtained using ethyl acetate and dried using a rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The dried crude extract was later solubilized in DMSO before use.
