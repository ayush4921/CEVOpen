<p>To construct the targeted knockin, the 3′- and 5′-arms of 
 <italic>53BP1</italic> (Gene ID: 415589) were amplified from the genomic DNA. Then, the fluorescence tag mCherry was amplified from the pPB_FoxM1b D-box-116 del Mut No.6 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Sampattavanich) and designed to have a stop codon at its C-terminus. Both amplicons (the 53BP1 and mCherry) were later assembled with the pre-restriction cut (SpeI and KpnI) pBluescript II SK(+) using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Then, the assembled construct was inserted with a selectable marker cassette: puromycin acetyltransferase (Pur,

 <italic>RAD54L</italic>-mVenus (Gene ID: 424611) was also constructed using a similar approach (

Furthermore, 0.5 and 25 µg/mL puromycin dihydrochloride (Toku-E, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) and blasticidin S HCl (Toku-E) were used to select the transfected clones. Targeted knockin clones were screened using Southern blotting with the PCR probe, designed within the XbaI to detect positive clones in the transfected
