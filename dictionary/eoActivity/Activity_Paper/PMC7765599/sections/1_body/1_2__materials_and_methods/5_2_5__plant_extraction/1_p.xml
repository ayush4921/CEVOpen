 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy (Cha-Muang) leaves were harvested from Pitsanulok Province, Thailand in October 2018. The leaves were identified by visually comparing the specimen with the herbarium database (

Then, 30 mL of either ethanol or ethyl acetate was added and incubated for 7 days in the dark to obtain the crude metabolites. The leaves were filtered and the plant-crude extract was dried using a rotary evaporator at 45 Â°C. The dried-crude extract was later solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before use.
