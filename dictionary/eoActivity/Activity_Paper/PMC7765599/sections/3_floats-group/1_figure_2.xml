  <p>Cell proliferation of biosensor clones was slightly lower than wild-type DT40. Two clones of targeted knockin were generated and they demonstrated the same phenotype. Data are shown as the mean Â± standard deviation of three biologically independent experiments. Definitions: 53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus#C1, tumor protein p53 binding protein-monomeric Cherry-RAD54-like-monomeric Venus knockin clone 1; 53BP1-mCherry-RAD54L-mVenus#C2, tumor protein p53 binding protein-monomeric Cherry-RAD54-like-monomeric Venus knockin clone 2; 
   <italic>53BP1</italic>, tumor protein p53 binding protein 1;
