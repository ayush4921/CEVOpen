<p>Andoğan et al. (2002) found citronellol (10.3–46.7%), geraniol (2.8–23.3%), nerol (1.3–11.9%), and linalool (0.6–0.8%) to be main components in 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. essential oil of Turkish origin. They observed the antimicrobial activities of some of the individual substances and proved that citronellol, geraniol, and nerol have more potent antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> individually (with inhibition zones of 20 mm, 21 mm, and 19 mm, respectively) than in a mixed form (8 mm). The essential oil was not active against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Özkan et al. (2004) investigated its antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion method of two methanol (MeOH) extracts: from fresh flowers and spent flowers collected in Turkey at different concentrations (10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 1%). The extracts from the fresh flower (10%) showed a low effect against 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as did the spent flower at the same concentration against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus feacalis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Yersinia. enterocolitica.</italic> Both extracts exhibited low antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and were not active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The 5% MeOH extract from the fresh flower showed a low effect against all tested microorganisms, except 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the extract from the spent flower did the same except for 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. Both 2.5% and 1% extracts from the fresh and spent flowers showed low effects or were not active against all tested microorganisms including 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Gochev et al. (2008) compared 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. oils of Bulgarian, Moroccan, Chinese, Turkish, and Iranian origin. The Bulgarian oil showed the highest antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms: 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, followed by the essential oil of Turkish origin. Essential oils from Morocco and China showed weaker effects compared to oils from Turkey and Iran against all strains studied. The pure substances geraniol, nerol, and linalool showed the same activities as the Bulgarian rose oil against Gram-positive bacterial strains (the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) varying between 128 and 256 µg/mL), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 512 µg/mL and MBC = 1024 µg/mL), and the tested fungi from the type 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (MIC = 1024 µg/mL and MBC = 2048 µg/mL). Citronellol was less effective (MIC = MBC from 256 to 512 µg/mL). In addition, the phenylpropanoid eugenol was characterized with the highest antimicrobial activity against all tested Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (with MIC = MBC between 64 and 128 µg/mL), as well as against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (food spoilage strain, isolated from minced meat), 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and clinical isolates of the testfungi (with MIC = MBC from 512 to 1048 µg/mL) [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. and 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. of Bulgarian origin showed low antifungal activities against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
