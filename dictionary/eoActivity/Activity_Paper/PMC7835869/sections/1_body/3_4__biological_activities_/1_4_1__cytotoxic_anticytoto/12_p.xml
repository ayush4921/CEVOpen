<p>Briefly, the analyzed extracts and oils of these roses demonstrated an effective cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and a weak effect on normal cells when applied at low concentrations. The rose extracts show weak genotoxic activity and do not cause DNA injuries, whereas the oils possess significant concentration-dependent and/or individual genotoxic activity. Both rose extracts and essential oils possess well-expressed antimutagenic and anti-genotoxic potentials against different chemical mutagens. In this way, the oils and extracts of these representatives of the Rosaceae family could be used as promising chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer, to deal with the secondary neoplasmic processes resulting from chemotherapy.</p>
