<p>The essential oil possesses cytotoxic and genotoxic activity, clearly dependent on the concentration applied and the cell type treated (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00127-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The oil of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill.from Iran is safe at a low dose (10 μg/mL) both in normal NIH3T3 and cancer cells (A549), but the higher concentrations in the range of 50–200 μg/mL increase cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, assessed by micronucleus assay [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A549 cells show a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub>, indicating their higher sensitivity to rose oil than the normal fibroblast cellsNIH3T3. Concrete and absolute oil of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> var. 
 <italic>trigintipetala</italic> Dieck exhibited cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines HepG2 and MCF7, where IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the concrete was 16.28 and 18.09 μg/mL and for absolute was 24.94 and 19.69 μg/mL, respectively [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> oil showed clear dose-dependent cytotoxic activity in cancer cell lines A549, PC-3, and MCF-7, as well as antibacterial effect in

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> (1%) induced a lethal effect in human lymphocytes in vitro after incubation for 1 h. The same effect was observed with 0.1% after 24 h [
