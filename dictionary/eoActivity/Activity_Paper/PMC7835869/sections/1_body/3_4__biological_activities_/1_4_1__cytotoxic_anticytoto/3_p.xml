<p>With regards to 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> extracts and oil, 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. aqueous, aqueous-alcoholic, ethanol, and methanol extracts were tested (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00127-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The cytotoxic activity of these extracts was found to be directly dependent on the type of extraction, the concentration applied, and the cell sensitivity. Normal animal and human cells, as well as different cancer cell lines, show different sensitivity to aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> [
 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The aqueous extract possesses cytotoxic activity against human HeLa tumor cell line NCBI and human lymphocytes with increasing concentrations assessed by MTT analysis (Test for cell viability as a function of redox potential). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for cancer cell lines is 0.0045 and for lymphocytes 115.7 mg/mL, respectively. The highest concentration (0.5 mg/mL) reduces the viability of HeLa cells and lymphocytes by 94.72% and 47.08%, respectively. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. reduce the viability and proliferative activity of human gastrointestinal cell lines (AGS) and are able to induce apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The aqueous extract shows a lower inhibitory effect than the alcoholic one, probably due to its different composition. The cytotoxic effect of the alcoholic extract increases with the incubation time in HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B73-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for this cell line when treated with the alcoholic extract are 2135, 1540, and 305.1 Î¼g after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively.
