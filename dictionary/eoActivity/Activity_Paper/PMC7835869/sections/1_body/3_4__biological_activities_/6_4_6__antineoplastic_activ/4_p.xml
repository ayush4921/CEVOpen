<p>Ethanol extract (70%) of Armenian rose petals was separated into two coumarin and three phenol glycoside fractions and together with the water extract they were examined by a trypan blue exclusion test. Two of the three phenol glycoside fractions significantly inhibited mice Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells by approximately 95% and 85%, respectively, while the other fractions were inhibited by approximately 50–70% [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> 50% hydroglycol extract induced apoptosis in the epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 at 10 μg/μL, as established by Hoechst fluorescent staining dye [

It is important to note that the vapor phase of the essential oil was cytotoxic to gastric cancer cell line MKN45, to colon cancer cell line SW742, and normal human fibroblast cells, and even the viability of the inner control (untreated wells in the plate) decreased to less than 10%. Apoptosis was the main mechanism of cytotoxicity. On the contrary, the water-soluble phase of the oil increased the cell viability of all cell lines. Considering the inner control as 100%, doses from 1 μL to as high as 60 μL increased the viability of MKN45 in a dose-dependent manner to about 150%. Additionally, when 10 μL was added to the other cell lines the viability increased by about nine-fold. Lower extract volumes (2 or 3 μL) acted as a potent growth factor for the normal fibroblast cells. All of this was revealed by microscopic studies with inverted microscope, MTT assay and flow cytometry [
