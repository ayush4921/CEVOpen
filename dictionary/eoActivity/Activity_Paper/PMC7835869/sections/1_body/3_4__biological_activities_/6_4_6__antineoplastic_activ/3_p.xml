<p>There are several studies of the anticancer activities of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> from Iran and other countries. Sleep disorders are among the most common medical complaints in cancer patients. A randomized, single blind-controlled clinical trial was carried out, in which patients smelled essential oil for 20 min. Sleep quality was significantly improved with 5% and 10% oil in comparison to the control group with regard to sleep latency and duration. This effect could be due to the previously reported anti-anxiety and anti-stress properties of rose oils [

Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs) loaded with essential oil were about three times more cytotoxic, compared to the pure oil, and were preliminary attributed to enhancements in the solubility of the extracts. Apoptosis was also enhanced as shown by a TUNEL assay. SNEDDSs were prepared from a mixture of castor oil, tween 80, polyethylene glycol, and water [

Alpha 1,2-mannosidase is a key enzyme in N-glycan processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and has been one of the enzymes targeted in the development of anticancer therapies. An enzyme assay showed that methanol and aqueous extracts from floret exhibited a 57% noncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme and the aqueous extract inhibited it by 26% [
