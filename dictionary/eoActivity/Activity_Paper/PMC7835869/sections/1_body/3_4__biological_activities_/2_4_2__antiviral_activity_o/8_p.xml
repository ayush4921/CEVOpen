<p>Several substances that effectively inhibit HIV were isolated, such a rosamultin, isolated from the root of 
 <italic>R. rugosa</italic>, which inhibits by 53% the HIV-1 protease at a concentration of 100 ÂµM. Nine compounds isolated from 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> methanol extract showed anti-HIV activity, with a different mechanism of action being established. Tetrahydroxyflavanone (kaempferol 1) selectively inhibits viral protease, and two 3-substituted kaempferol derivatives as well as pentahydroxyflavone (quercetin, 2) inhibiting HIV infection by preventing the binding of gp120 to CD4. Irreversible interaction with gp120 also produces 2-phenylethanol-O- (6-O-galloyl) -beta-D-glucopyranoside [
