<p>According to the findings of Nazarenko et al. (1983), the genus Rosa, to which the oil-bearing species belongs, originates from the ancient evergreen lianas of the Sundarbans in India, called “the pharmacy of the world” as more than a quarter of the drugs known today in medicine are based on plants from these forests [

At present, about 1000 genotypes of roses are known; they are classified and grouped based on botanical characteristics: hybrid teas, grand floras, polyanthus, floribundas, miniatures, climbing, shrub, but only a few of them exhibit the marked fragrance which is preferred by perfumers [

Species affiliation is a determining factor of the quality of commercial products: essential oils, hydrolates, and the concrete and absolute. Essential oils and hydrolates are products of distillation, the concrete is an extract with a non-polar solvent, and the absolute is a subsequent product which is formed after the extraction of concrete with ethanol [

The use of rose essential oils, aqueous and alcoholic extracts of rose petals, flowers, and heads, not only as fragrances or for aromatherapy, but also for the treatment and prevention of various diseases and disorders is very popular in folk medicine. Thus, the search for new biological activities of plant extracts is in many cases based on data from recipes from folk healers. On a scientific basis, the empirical knowledge from folk medicine is an important aspect of more and more in vitro and in vivo studies, including preclinical and clinical trials. These trials explore and explain the therapeutic efficacy of rose products and their ingredients, including: antidepressant effects, psychological relaxation, improvement of sexual dysfunction, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, probiotic and antipyretic effects, smooth muscle relaxation, lipid-lowering content, antiulcerogenic effects, etc. [

Rose oils are recommended not only for inhalation and topical application (in aromatherapy and dermatology) but also for oral administration at physiologically applicable doses. A number of studies have shown the anticancer activity of rose oils and their potential to be used as adjuncts in adjuvant therapy of tumors [
