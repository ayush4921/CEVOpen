<p>The present review of the scientific literature provides a systematic summary of the chemical composition and different pharmacological activities of four old rose species: 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L., 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> L., and 
 <italic>R. gallica</italic> L. Despite their common ancestors, the four species differ in color, the morphology of colors, and the content of their essential oils and extracts, as well as their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant effects. What they have in common is that they all are important raw materials for producing cytotoxically and genotoxically safe commercial products. The analysis of the scientific literature in this review shows that essential oils, hydrolates, and extracts of these four rose species, as well as their main compounds, have a promising biological potential to act as natural healers. Natural products have always played a pivotal role in new drug discovery. Due to their valuable therapeutic properties, the studied old rose species are able to act as symptomatic drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of many diseases. A great challenge for future research in pharmacology and medical fields could be the study of roses from farms in preclinical and clinical trials.
