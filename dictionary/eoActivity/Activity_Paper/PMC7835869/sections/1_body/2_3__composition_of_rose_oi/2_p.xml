<p>Perfumery is the main consumer of rose oil. It is a product of double distillation and its composition varies within certain limits. The international standard ISO 9842 sets limits on the main ingredients for rose oil from

Due to the complexity of the composition, the standard is a necessary but insufficient quality criterion and serves rather as a rough guide in characterizing the oil. Chemically, it is a mixture of almost 300 compounds such as terpene and phenol derivatives of hydrocarbon compounds [
