<p>In the case of the white rose, different dynamics are observed in the ingredients, from a typical citronellol [
 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] to a categorically geraniol model [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is probably due to variability in the population itself [
 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In summary, the level of terpene alcohols approaches that of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. Geraniol is known to carry pharmacological effects in rose oil [

 <xref rid="B68-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A low content of methyleugenol and a high content of geraniol guarantees safe application with proven biological effects of 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. essential oil.
