 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The yield and composition of rose oil obtained from the rose flowers have been known to be strongly affected by the geographic area, the soil, the climate, the moment of the picking, the storage conditions, and the technology parameters. The genotype is decisive for the chemical profile when all other conditions are constant.
