<p id="p0105">Forty two male albino Wistar rats weighing between 120 and 140 g was used for this study with modification to previous method [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Fifteen rats were randomly selected into five groups (n = 3) and used for the Minimum Haemorrhagic Dose (MHD) determination. These groups consist of a normal control and four envenomed groups. Twenty seven rats were divided randomly into nine groups (n = 3) for the anti-haemorrhagic study consisting of a normal control, venom control, antivenom group and the six extract treated groups. MHD was determined by injecting intradermally, 0.1 mL of varying concentrations of the venom from a serial dilution (5.0, 2.5, 0.25 and 0.625 mg) of 10 mg venom in normal saline into the rats. MHD was defined as the least amount of venom which when injected intradermaly, (i.d.) rats showed a hemorrhagic foci of 10 mm diameter in 3 h. Anti-hemorrhagic activity was carried out by mixing 0.2 mL of a fixed amount of venom (2 × MHD in saline) with 0.2 mL of different amount (300 and 600 mg/kg
 <sup>−1</sup> in 1 mL of saline) of each extract partitions and antivenom (0.2 mL) separately. The mixtures of venom/partitions and venom/antivenom were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and 0.1 mL of the mixture was injected intradermaly into rats. The hemorrhagic foci was measured after 3 h and expressed as percentage inhibition [
