<p id="p0110">Anti-haemolytic study was carried out using 20 mL of citrated bovine erythrocytes. Centrifugation of blood was done 10 times at 2400 rpm for 10 min using 5 mL of saline (0.9%) to obtain free packed cells. Thereafter, a 10% cell suspension was prepared. Exactly, 0.2 mL of 2 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the venom (0.05 mg/kg dissolved in 2 mL of normal saline) was mixed with 10 mL of 10% cell suspension. Thereafter, 0.2 mL of the mixtures were added to 0.2 mL of varying dose of the extract partitions of

The reaction was terminated by adding 3 mL of chilled phosphate buffer saline (PBS pH 7.2) to the tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 2400 rpm for 10 min and absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. Supernatant treated with 3 mL distilled water was taken as 100% lyses and serves as control [
