<p id="p0050">Consequently, most locals make use of medicinal plants as alternative therapy for treatment of snake envenoming. Medicinal plants have been used traditionally to effectively manage various cases of snake envenoming since ages [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Several studies have investigated the reputation of plants in neutralizing the toxic effects of snake venoms with positive outcomes [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. Earlier studies have documented the effectiveness of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, a medicinal plant in neutralizing several snake venom induced toxicities [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>]. Despite the available information on the use of medicinal plant in the management of snake bite, no empirical data exist on the effect of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract on 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> envenoming. Accordingly, this study evaluated the efficacy of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaf partitions on the antioxidant and inflammatory pathways against 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom intoxication in albino rats.
