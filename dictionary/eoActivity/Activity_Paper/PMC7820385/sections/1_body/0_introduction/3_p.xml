<p id="p0040">Venom components of 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> are capable of altering a steady physiological state of the body system in several ways in envenomed victims which may lead to a diseased state. Some of these components include phospholipase A2 (PLA2) â€“ an hydrolytic enzyme that destroys the cell membrane and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) which have been reported to promotes inflammatory response leading to tissue damage [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>]. PLA2 is a major enzyme present in 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom which causes cardiotoxicity, myotoxicity, neurotoxicity, blood lyses, hypotension, inhibition of platelet aggregation and coagulopathy [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. PLA2s enzymes has Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> as co-factors and hydrolyses 2-acyl ester bonds of membrane glycerol-phospholipids generating free fatty acids including lyso-phospholipids which are important precursors of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies have reported that PLA2 may affect the mitochondrial respiratory functions, blood lytic effects or increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. Undoubtedly, excessive generation of ROS can activate multiple signalling pathways of vascular disease, resulting in dysfunctions of antioxidant system such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which are associated with elimination of ROS [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, snakes venom are capable of modulating the immune system as venom component can act directly on leukocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells to stimulate inflammatory cytokine proliferation [
