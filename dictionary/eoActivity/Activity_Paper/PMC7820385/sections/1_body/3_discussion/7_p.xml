<p id="p0215">Cobra venom contains cytotoxic lytic activity in synergy with phospholipase enzymes which may alter cell membranes of erythrocytes thereby resulting to haemolysis [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>]. In this study, 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom showed direct haemolytic activity on citrated blood but antivenom and extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> protected erythrocytes from hemolytic effect of the venom in a dose dependent manner. High dose of ethyl acetate partition of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> showed the strongest anti-haemolytic activity however, the observed effect of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> is in tandem with previous study against cobra venom [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom exhibited haemorrhagic effects as it contains snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), and haemorrhagic enzymes which damage blood vessels wall resulting in systemic bleeding [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although, extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> countered the haemorrhagic activity of the venom as high dose (600 mg/kg) of ethanol partition recorded above 70% inhibition but total inhibition was not achieved. This result supported earlier report on anti-haemorrhagic activity of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom showed anti-coagulant activity as venom control clotted at 720 s, however, antivenom and high dose (600 mg/kg) of ethyl acetate and ethanol partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract showed a strong pro-coagulant activity to counter this effect.
