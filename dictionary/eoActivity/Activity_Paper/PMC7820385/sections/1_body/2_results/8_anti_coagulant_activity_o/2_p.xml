<p id="p0170">Normal control samples clotted in 44 s but samples of 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom which served as venom control clotted in 720 s. However, various extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> exhibited anticoagulant activities, as samples treated with high dose (600 mg/kg) and low dose (300 mg/kg) of ethyl acetate and ethanol partition of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract inhibited the anticoagulant activity of the venom which was dose dependent. Samples treated with 600 mg/kg of ethyl acetate partition recorded the strongest inhibitory effects at 74 s. Anti-venom samples clotted at 60 s (
