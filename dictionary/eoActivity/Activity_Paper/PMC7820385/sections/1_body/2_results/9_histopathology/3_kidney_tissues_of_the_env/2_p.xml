<p id="p0180">Kidney of normal control showed unaffected tissue whereas untreated rats showed foci of tubular degeneration caused by interstitial haemorrhage. Envenomed group treated with 300 mg/kg of ethanol partition revealed degeneration of few tubules as well as envenomed rats treated with polyvalent anti-venom. Moderate congestion of renal cortex was seen in envenomed rats treated with 300 mg/kg of ethyl acetate partition. Nephrotoxic effect was fully ameliorated in envenomed groups treated with 600 mg/kg of N-hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol partitions of
