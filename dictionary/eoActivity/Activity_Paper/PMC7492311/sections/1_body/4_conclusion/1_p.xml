<p id="Par25">Melatonin features unraveled functions and has exhibited novel physiological applications. In this study, melatonin found to be the most abundant in flowers and leaves of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L., indicating the regulation of the spatial distribution with a tissueâ€“organ differential expression. In contrast to the circadian rhythmicity of melatonin in animals, the melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> peaked in the middle of the subjective day for alleviating possible environmental stresses. Melatonin levels in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> exhibited notable photoperiodic responses, which could be regulated by light wavelength and intensity. Although hypericin is an effective natural photoactive pigment or fluorophore in 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. (Kazemi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012</xref>), the data on photoreceptors related to melatonin regulation in this herb are limited. Here, we speculate that this process might involve certain blue photoreceptors, such as cryptochrome and phototropin. We also compared interspecific differences in melatonin concentration in eight 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> spp.. The melatonin-rich species of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> is a highly valuable finding from our study. Taken together, we elucidated the potential functions of melatonin in the circadian system of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> and provided future directions for melatonin-oriented research and applications in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries and their related fields.
