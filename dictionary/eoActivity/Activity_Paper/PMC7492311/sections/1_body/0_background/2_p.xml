<p id="Par5">Melatonin has been found to be involved in numerous different processes in all organisms investigated so far. It exhibits pleiotropic biological activities in phylogenetically diverse species. Some of these activities are mediated by G-protein-coupled and nuclear receptors (Reppert

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1999</xref>; Imbesi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>), whereas others are receptor-independent, such as melatoninâ€™s interactions with free radicals and activities mediated by its bioactive metabolites (Reiter

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2002</xref>; Schaefer and Hardeland 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2009</xref>). A common characteristic in all the pleiotropic functions of melatonin is that it is involved in setting the timing of all processes (Cassone and Natesan
