<p id="Par18">Circadian clock mechanisms have been investigated in single neurons (Michel et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>), and higher plants (Greenham and McClung 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>; Greenham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). All components of this endogenous clock occur at the cellular level. This complex temporal program is a prerequisite for specialization, fitness, and survival within the chrono-ecological niches of the “temporal–space” day and enables organisms to thrive by integrating environmental changes with endogenous circadian systems (Roenneberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1995</xref>).
