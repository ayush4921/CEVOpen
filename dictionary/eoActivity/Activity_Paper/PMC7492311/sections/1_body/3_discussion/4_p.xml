<p id="Par21">Melatonin levels are subject to circadian control in human (Czeisler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Lockley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>) and other animal (Tosini and Menaker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1996</xref>; Heigl and Gwinner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>) systems as well as in the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate 
 <italic>Lingulodinium</italic> (Hardeland 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1993</xref>; Hardeland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>) and numerous chlorophycean microalgae (Kolář and Macháčková 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>). However, only a few plants, such as 
 <italic>Chenopodium rubrum</italic> (Lecharny and Wagner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1984</xref>) and rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) seedlings (Byeon and Back 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>), demonstrate this phenomenon. Our results demonstrated that the circadian melatonin rhythm in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> peaks at approximately CT6 in the middle of the subjective day. Because of their sessile nature, plants encounter more environmental challenges than animals. Phytomelatonin is a multi-regulatory molecule with diverse functions in growth and development; protection against stresses, such as reactive oxygen species and other free radicals, high ambient temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; and photosynthesis inhibition (Arnao and Hernandez-Ruiz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>; Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2019</xref>). Our findings might coordinate the circadian maximal amplitude of melatonin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> and yield potentially protective effects against daily rhythmic environmental stresses.
