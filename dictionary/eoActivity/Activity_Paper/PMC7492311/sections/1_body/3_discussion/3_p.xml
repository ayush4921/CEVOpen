 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> is higher than that in most of the other plants (Murch et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). In this study, reliable measurements of melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> were determined qualitatively and quantitatively through HPLC (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2). Melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> was the highest in the flowers, followed by that in the leaves—thus indicating a tissue–organ differential expression. This also reflects both spatial distribution and regulation of the signaling hormone and conventional usage of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> as “materia medica” for treating minor or moderate forms of depression and a range of mood disorders (Heinrich and Anagnostou

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>; Sack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2000</xref>); it exerts clinically beneficial effects on circadian rhythm–related sleep disorders, jetlag, and even Alzheimer disease (Zisapel
