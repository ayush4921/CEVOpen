<p id="Par10">Plant materials were harvested at designated stages for the experiments (for Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the cultivating days approximately 180 days till plants in bloom; the average fresh weights of the root, stem, leaf, and flower parts after harvesting were approximately 4, 8, 8, and 0.5 g, respectively; the plant age was approximately 60 days before harvest for the others); they were separated into root, stem, leaf, and flower parts and maintained at −60 °C for further measurement of melatonin concentration. Melatonin standard and butylated hydroxytoluene were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MI, USA). Other organic solvents were obtained from Merck. Plant parts for various treatments were weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder using a glass rod. The powdered material (0.3 g) was first extracted in 10 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 5 µM butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant through ultrasonication (Branson 1200) for 45 min in darkness with minimal shaking. The insoluble material was further washed twice with 1 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8). The eluant was combined with the aforementioned extracts. The supernatant was obtained through centrifugation (Universal 32 R; Hettich, Germany) at 4 °C at 5000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered (90 mm, No. 1; Advantec, Japan) in vacuum to prepare for further purification. Extracts were purified twice using 12 mL of ethyl acetate through phase partition. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness in vacuum. The dry residue was redissolved in 1 mL of methanol retained in a 2-mL brown Eppendorf tube. The supernatant was obtained through centrifugation (5415D; Eppendorf, Hamburg) at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and then passed through a Millipore membrane (0.2 μm, PL-6054540; PALL) for further analysis (Guerrero et al.
