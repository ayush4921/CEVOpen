<p id="Par13">Established reliable measurements (see inset, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9987) for melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. were qualitatively and quantitatively determined through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Melatonin concentration in different tissues and organs of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. was then analyzed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Melatonin concentration was the highest in the flowers (approximately 100 μg/g FW), followed by that in the leaves (approximately 20 μg/g FW), with the stem and roots having the lowest concentration (&lt; 10 μg/g FW; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
