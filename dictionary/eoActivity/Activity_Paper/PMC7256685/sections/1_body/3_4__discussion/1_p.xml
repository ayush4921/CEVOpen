 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">5</xref>). A number of studies have characterized the antimalarial properties of some herbal extracts; however, only a few studies have reported the effects that long-term administration of varying concentrations of herbal products have on the malaria parasite [

 <sub>50</sub> values as well as evaluated the long-term effects of exposing malaria parasites to varying doses of the selected herbal extracts on artemisinin-sensitive and artemisinin-resistant malaria in order to determine whether prolonged herbal extract could enhance gametocyte production as well as access their effectiveness against artemisinin-resistant parasites.
