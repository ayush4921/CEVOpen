 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Although some previous studies have reported the phytochemical composition of these two plants, it was important to repeat the analysis on the extracts used in this study because different species of the same plant [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], as well as certain growth conditions, have been noted to influence the phytochemical content of medicinal plants. Phytochemical analysis of herbal extracts obtained from plants grown in different geographical settings reveals vast differences in phytochemical content [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], with soil from the rainforest suggested to be capable of increasing the phenol content of some plants [
