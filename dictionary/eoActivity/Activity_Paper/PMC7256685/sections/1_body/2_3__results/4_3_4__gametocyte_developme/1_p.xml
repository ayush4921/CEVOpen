<p>Seven days of continuous culturing of NF54 parasites 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with daily medium change without RBC supplementation led to differential gametocyte densities in the treated and untreated cultures (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> was the only product that exhibited a gametocytocidal activity; the three other products all enhanced gametocyte production. At 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> exhibited 99% gametocyte inhibition, which was significantly higher (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">4</xref>) than the inhibition exhibited by similar concentrations of the other three extracts. 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> produced significantly higher numbers of gametocytes than the untreated cultures even at 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (
