<p>This assay was replicated from Amoah et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with some minor modifications. Briefly, each stock herbal product was diluted in CPM to obtain a working solution of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Untreated CPM (no added supplement) was used as a negative control, and 5 ng/ml artesunate was used as a positive control. One hundred microliters of the working concentrations of each herbal product and the control were added to individual wells in a 24 well plate. One hundred microliters of parasite culture at 1% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit was added to the medium-filled well of the plate and placed in a Modular® incubating chamber. The chamber was gassed for 6 minutes with mixed gas (92.5% nitrogen, 5.5% carbon dioxide, and 2% oxygen) and placed in an incubator set at 37°C. The media on the cultures in the plate were changed daily with the initial starting medium (CPM supplemented with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of herbal extract) throughout the assay. Thin-film smears were prepared alongside the daily medium change every day for 7 days. The smears were fixed in absolute methanol and stained with 10% Giemsa for 15 minutes. Daily smears were processed and observed under a compound light microscope using a 100x oil immersion objective lens; however, only Day 7 smears were counted against 1000 RBCs for asexual parasites and 5000 RBCs for gametocytes. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and repeated at least twice.
