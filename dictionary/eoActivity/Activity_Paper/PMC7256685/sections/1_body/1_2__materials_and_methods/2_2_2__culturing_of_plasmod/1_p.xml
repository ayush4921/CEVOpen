<p>Asexual cultures of NF54 (MRA-1000: chloroquine sensitive), CamWT_C580Y (MRA-1250: artemisinin sensitive), and IPC 4912 (MRA-1241: artemisinin resistant) were maintained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using a modified method of Zirihi et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and similar to Amoah et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, the parasites were individually cultured at 4% hematocrit (O+ red blood cells (RBCs)) in complete parasite media (CPM: RPMI 1640 supplemented with HEPES, L-glutamine, NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, glucose, gentamycin, and AlbuMAX II) in a T75 culture flask. The cultures were maintained in an incubator set at 37Â°C with daily medium change with CPM and exchange of gas (92.5% nitrogen, 5.5% carbon dioxide, and 2% oxygen).
