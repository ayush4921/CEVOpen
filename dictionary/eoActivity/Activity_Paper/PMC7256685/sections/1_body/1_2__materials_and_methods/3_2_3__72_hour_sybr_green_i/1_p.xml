<p>A protocol similar to that described by Quashie et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Smilkstein et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with some revisions was used to determine the inhibitory effects of the aqueous extracts on the different 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites. Briefly, a 96-well tissue culture plate was filled with five replicates of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 20 mg/ml of two herbal extracts serially diluted 10-fold for 6 additional concentrations until 0.02 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The first 2 of the quintuplicate wells were supplemented with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of uninfected RBC (RBCs) set at 2% hematocrit in CPM; the last 3 wells were supplemented with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of infected RBC (iRBCs) set at 2% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit in CPM. The last set of duplicate wells were filled with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of infected RBC (iRBCs) set at 2% hematocrit and 2% parasitaemia (ring-stage parasites) in CPM and supplemented with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of artesunate (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/
 <italic>μ</italic>l) serially diluted 10-fold for 6 concentrations with CPM until 0.2 ng/ml (schematic of plate set up in Supplementary file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">1</xref>). The plate was then placed into a Modular incubating chamber and gassed for 6 minutes and then incubated for 72 hours. The plate was then wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at -80°C overnight, after which the plate was thawed at room temperature. Two technical replicate plates were set up for each herbal extract. To each culture-containing well, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of buffered SYBR Green (2x SYBR Green 1 dye in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 0.08% Triton X-100, and 0.008% saponin in PBS) was added and mixed up and down. The plate was wrapped again in aluminum foil and stored in an incubator at 37°C for 1 hour. Fluorescence was then read on a microplate reader at 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission.
