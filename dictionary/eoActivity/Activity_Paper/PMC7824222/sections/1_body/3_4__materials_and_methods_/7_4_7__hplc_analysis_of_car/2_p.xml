<p>HPLC determination of quinic, malic, ascorbic, succinic, citric, α-keto-glutaric, oxalic and tartaric acids was performed on Agilent 1220 HPLC system (Agilent Technology, USA), equipped with binary pump and UV-Vis detector. Wavelength of 210 nm was used. Organic acid separation was performed using Agilent TC-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at 25 °C. The mobile phase was 25 mM phosphate (K
