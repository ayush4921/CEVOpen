<p>The method developed by Ou et al. was used with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This method measures the ability of an antioxidant to neutralize peroxid radicals. It is based on the inhibition of the decline of fluorescence of fluorescein during its oxidation in the presence of an antioxidant. The thermal decomposition of 2,2’-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) is used as a peroxid radical generator. The results are expressed in μmol Trolox equivalents per gram of extract. Measurements are performed on FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorometer (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). The excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm were used.
