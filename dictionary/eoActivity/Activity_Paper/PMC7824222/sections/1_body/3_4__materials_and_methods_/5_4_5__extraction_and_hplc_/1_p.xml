<p>Two percent solutions of plant material in distilled water, 70% ethanol, 96% ethanol and methanol, respectively, were prepared. The extraction was performed via maceration at room temperature 25 °C for 24h. The obtained extracts were filtered through a microfilter (0.25 μm) and injected into the HPLC system. Verbascoside, scutellarin, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, luteolin and chrysin were determined using the previously developed and validated HPLC method [
