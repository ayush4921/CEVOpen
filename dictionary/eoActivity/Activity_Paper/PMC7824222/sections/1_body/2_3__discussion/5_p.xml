<p>The climatic specifics of the area where the medicinal plants grow inevitably affect the synthesis of biologically active substances. It is important to note that the flavonoids scutellarin, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogoniside and a caffeoyl phenylethanoid glycoside - verbascoside, responsible for the therapeutic action of 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> (Baikal skullcap) and 
 <italic>Scutellaria lateriflora</italic> (American skullcap) are found for the first time in species of the genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> growing in Bulgaria. A consequence of the high polyphenolic and flavonoid content is the pronounced AOA of the studied species. Based on the shown antioxidant activity, pharmacological effects of extracts of some of the studied species can be sought, related to the reduction of oxidative stress. In order to obtain a more complete phytochemical profile of the studied 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species, in addition to determining the amounts of secondary metabolites contained in them, a comparative study of some primary metabolites, such as organic acids and carbohydrates, was performed.
