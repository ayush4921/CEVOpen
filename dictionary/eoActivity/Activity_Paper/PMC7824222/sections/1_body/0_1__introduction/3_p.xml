<p>The purpose of this study is to enrich the information on the composition of the Bulgarian 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species in terms of both total polyphenolic and flavonoid content as well as primary metabolites such as mono- and oligosaccharides and organic acids. An aerial part of three 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species was used: 
 <italic>S. albida, S. altissima</italic> and 
 <italic>S. galericulata</italic>, growing in four low mountain regions of Southern Bulgaria. A comparative study of the composition of aqueous, methanol and ethanol extracts of the above 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species was made. The species-specific scutellarin, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside have also been identified and the antioxidant activity (AOA) of the extracts has been evaluated by three methods: Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity (ORAC), Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity (HORAC) and electrochemical method.
