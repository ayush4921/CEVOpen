The synthesis of non-natural nature-mimetic small molecules could be an opportunity of giving Nature a helping-hand in generating new bioactive agents and enlarging chemical-biological space. Following the idea of mimic Nature, a common approach of most medicinal chemistry programs it is crucial: (i) the choice of scaffolds, and (ii) the choice of strategies for molecular modifications. From our point of view, bioinspiration is very useful for selection of molecules and scaffolds as well as for selection of synthetic strategies.
