<p>Xanthones are not frequently mentioned as marine natural products due to the relatively late interest on marine microorganisms as providers of bioactive secondary metabolites comparing with terrestrial sources. For this reason, marine-derived fungi have emerged as a potential source of marine natural products and similar to their terrestrial counterparts, marine-derived fungi also produce xanthones. Many xanthones sharing the same structure can be found, for example, from both marine and terrestrial fungi while structures that are more complex have been found only in marine-derived fungi and actinomycetes. Comparing with other chemical families we can say that the number of xanthones isolated from marine sources is quite scarce. Xanthones were found predominantly in marine-derived fungi from the genera

From these data we can infer that the “marine xanthones” obey the same rule as their terrestrial analogues concerning the large variety of biological activities, with greater emphasis on antimicrobial and antitumor activities. More recently, a review from our group (between 1989 and 2018) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], emphasizes the anti-infective activity (antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, and antiviral) of 53 xanthones from the marine environment; furthermore, molecular descriptors, biophysicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for three sets of compounds (xanthones, hydroxyxanthones, and glycosylated derivatives) and the chemical space occupied by marine xanthone derivatives was compared with marketed drugs. From our data it can be inferred that xanthone derivatives have a good compliance with the drug-likeness chemical space. Hydroxyxanthones and glycosylated derivatives exceed the desired values and a poor pharmacokinetic behavior may be predicted [
