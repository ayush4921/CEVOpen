<p>Many products from marine origin have been described, and every year hundreds of new compounds are being discovered. The main sources of marine secondary metabolites with interest in medicinal chemistry are marine invertebrates such as sponges, tunicates, mollusks, and bryozoans, as well as algae and marine microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria and fungi. The designated “marine-derived fungi” must grow and sporulate in a marine environment, while facultative marine fungi are from terrestrial or freshwater habitats, but may also grow in the marine environment [
