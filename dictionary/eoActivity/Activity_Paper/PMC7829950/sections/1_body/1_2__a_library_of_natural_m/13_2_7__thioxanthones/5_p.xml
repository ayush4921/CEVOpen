<p>As the most potent compound on the four tested tumor cell lines was 
 <bold>80</bold>, this compound, along with its hydrochloride salt, 
 <bold>80·</bold>HCl, were further investigated to discover its cellular mechanism of action. An MTT assay using MCF-7 cells showed that 6 h treatment with 
 <bold>80·</bold>HCl was sufficient to interfere with the cellular metabolic activity, cell survival and proliferation; and for longer periods no recovery was observed, suggesting that the effect is irreversible. Besides, 
 <bold>80·</bold>HCl was acting preferably as a cytotoxic rather than as a cytostatic compound. At 10 μM and higher 
 <bold>80·</bold>HCl concentrations there were alteration in cellular morphology which were suggestive of apoptosis.
