<p>Thioxanthones are isosters of xanthones. Structurally, they are 
 <italic>S</italic>-heterocycles with a dibenzo-Î³-thiopyrone scaffold, being described as an important class of molecules for their diverse biological properties, particularly their antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Their tricyclic scaffolds and the biological activities profile have led to the definition of thioxanthones as privileged structures, similarly to what happens with xanthones [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The first thioxanthones described as potential antitumor agents were hycanthone [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] and lucanthone [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], used as antischistosomal drugs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f019">Figure 19</xref>). They were also described as antitumor agents with several mechanisms of action: DNA intercalation, inhibition of nucleic acid biosyntheses, inhibition of topoisomerases and apurinic endonuclease 1 [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Nonetheless, they were promptly withdraw due to mutagenicity [
 <xref rid="B154-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] caused by the methylene linked to C-4 [
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Thereafter, other thioxantones such as SR233377 [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] and SSR271425 [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>] were tested in clinical trials as antitumor agents but were found to be cardiotoxic [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f019">Figure 19</xref>). Despite that, the photoinitiator 1-chloro-4-propoxy-9
 <italic>H</italic>-thioxanthen-9-one was described as being safe and not genotoxic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f019">Figure 19</xref>), according to GHS and to Directive 67/548/EEC. Consequently, our group considered that the design of thioxanthones without a methyl group or a methylene bridge at C-4 (lucanthone, hycanthone, SR233377, and SR271425), but with a propoxyl group at C-4, such as 1-chloro-4-propoxy-9
 <italic>H</italic>-thioxanthen-9-one, would be a suitable starting point for the discovery of new potential anticancer drugs.
