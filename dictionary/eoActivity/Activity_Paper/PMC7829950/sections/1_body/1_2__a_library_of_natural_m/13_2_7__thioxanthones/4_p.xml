<p>Thus, our aim was to design new dual ligands that would have anticancer activity and simultaneously avoid MRD trough P-gp inhibition, by hybridizing a thioxanthone scaffold (antitumor activity) and an amine (group present in P-gp inhibitors). In fact, next generation of drugs will focus on more than one target, because this will really accelerate progress against complex diseases [
 <xref rid="B169-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. A docking study was performed using a dataset of approximately 1000 virtual C1 aminated thioxanthones and two human P-gp models. Lipinski rule of five and other features described as important for P-gp inhibition, such as logP value of at least 2.92 or higher [

 <xref rid="B165-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] were applied as queries to the initial library of aminated thioxanthones. The molecules that passed through these filters were docked into the transmembrane domains (TMD) and nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of P-gp. Twenty-seven thioxanthones with the highest affinity towards P-gp were then synthesized by C(1)-N Ullmann cross coupling using conventional heating at 100 °C for 48h or MW-promoted heating at 205 °C for 50 min, in presence of K

 <xref rid="B170-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Secondary thioxanthonic products of the performed reactions without an amine at C-1 were also included in the in vitro studies. After purification and structural elucidation, a rhodamine-123 (P-gp substrate) accumulation assay [
 <xref rid="B171-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] was performed in order to detect which thioxanthones were modulating P-gp activity. In this assay, two chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines were used, a sensitive cell line (K562) and a resistant cell line that overexpresses P-gp (K562Dox). The most potent P-gp inhibitors were 
 <bold>71</bold>, 
 <bold>72</bold>, and 
 <bold>73</bold>, which increased the accumulation of Rh123 similarly to the known P-gp inhibitor quinidine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f020">Figure 20</xref>). In order to determine how those compounds were interacting with P-gp, the measurement of their effect on the rate of P-gp ATP hydrolysis was performed to differentiate between thioxanthones that were increasing the P-gp-mediated ATP hydrolysis (competitive inhibitors or substrates) and thioxanthones that were diminishing P-gp-mediated ATP hydrolysis (non-competitive inhibitors) [

 <xref rid="B173-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. From the compounds that had caused accumulation of rh123 in the cells, 25% were acting as competitive and 75% as non-competitive inhibitors of P-gp (some examples are represented on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f020">Figure 20</xref>A). Thioxanthones 
 <bold>72</bold>, 
 <bold>73</bold>, and 
 <bold>76</bold> were the best non-competitive inhibitors of P-gp, blocking the ATPase activity, whereas 
 <bold>77</bold> and 
 <bold>78</bold> were the best competitive inhibitors of P-gp, stimulating the ATP hydrolysis and being themselves transported by the pump [

In order to access the antitumor activity against tumor cell lines, a cell growth inhibitory effect (sulphorodamine-B assay) of 27 thioxanthones was performed on K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia cell line) [
