<p>A TUNEL assay and a flow cytometry analysis following Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) showed that treatment with 10 μM 
 <bold>80·</bold>HCl induced apoptosis in approximately 50% of the cells analysed [

 <bold>80</bold> decreases the viability of melanoma cells by modulation of autophagy, causing accumulation of autophagosomes and the formation of autophagolysosomes at the GI
 <sub>50</sub> concentration. An increase in LC3-II levels was also observed, which was reverted by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (an early stage autophagy-inhibitor) but further increased by E-64d/pepstatin (late-stage autophagy inhibitors). Lastly, 3-MA also reverted the effect of 
 <bold>80</bold> in cellular viability; and may, therefore, serve as a lead compound for the development of autophagy modulators with antitumor activity [
