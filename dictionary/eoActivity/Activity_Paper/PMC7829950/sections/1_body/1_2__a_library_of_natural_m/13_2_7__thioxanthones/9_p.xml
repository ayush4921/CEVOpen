<p>As a large number of studies indicated that other ABC transporters besides P-gp are involved in the efflux of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics out of the cell, our group decided to investigate the interaction of thioxanthones with other transporters, such as the multidrug-resistance associated transporter 1 (MRP1 or ABCC1), MRP2 (or ABCC2, cMOAT), MRP3 (or ABCC3) and the breast cancer associated protein (BCRP or ABCG2, MXR) [

 <xref rid="B180-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>], as these pumps share structural and functional similarities. A colorimetric-based ATPase assay using membrane vesicles from mammalian cells overexpressing a selected human ABC transporter protein (P-gp, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, or BCRP) was performed by our group. Thioxanthone 
 <bold>78</bold> was able to inhibit all the tested pumps, and 
 <bold>71</bold> was able to inhibit all the pumps except MRP2 [
