<p>In addition to anticoagulant effect, xanthonosides 
 <bold>58</bold> and 
 <bold>59</bold> were also endowed with antiplatelet effects. Their antiplatelet activity was attributed to the inhibition of arachidonic acid and ADP-induced platelet aggregation [

The dual antiaggregant behaviour of these small sulfated molecules affords an opportunity to discover different molecules from the known antiplatelet agents with possibly different pharmacological profile. Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetyl salicylic acid (inhibitor of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation) and a thienopyridine (inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation) is often recommended for high-risk patients. On the other hand, molecules such as xanthones 
 <bold>58</bold> and 
 <bold>59</bold>, which simultaneously target the antiplatelet and anticoagulant pathways, could be useful to prevent and treat both venous and arterial thrombosis. In the past decade, dual anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents have been persuaded, although such dual agents have not yet achieved clinical development [
