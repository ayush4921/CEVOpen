<p>In contrast to the biocide ECONEA, which caused 100% mortality of the marine shrimp

 <bold>59</bold> was not significantly different from filtered seawater, revealing no toxicity even at 250 μM. The nontoxic nature of xanthone 
 <bold>59</bold> was also confirmed by the lack of light radiation inhibition on the 
 <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> luminescent assay (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1000 μg/mL). Adding to the low ecotoxicity potential, the bioactive sulfated xanthone is highly water soluble, suggesting also a low bioaccumulation potential, which was proven by in silico calculations of logKow (octanol-water partition coefficient). In conclusion, the first synthetic xanthone with AF effects was disclosed by our group in 2017 [

This work was the starting point for the development of new optimized and/or diverse xanthones with AF activity (
