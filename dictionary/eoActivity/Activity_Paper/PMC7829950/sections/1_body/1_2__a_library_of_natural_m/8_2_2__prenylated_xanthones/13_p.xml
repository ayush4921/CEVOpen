<p>To sum up, 50 new prenylated xanthones were synthesized by our group using classical and non-classical methodologies. Notably, MAOS and the combination of heterogeneous catalysis (K10 clay) with MW irradiation were described for the first time for the synthesis of prenylated xanthones. The majority of prenylated derivatives were studied for their in vitro growth inhibitory activity against tumor cell lines. The pyranoxanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> emerged as the most promising in vitro growth inhibitor, being this effect associated mostly with a MDM2-p53 inhibitory effect. Nevertheless, other 26 compounds had also good outcomes against tumor cell lines; the results obtained allowed us to establish structure-activity and structure-solubility relationship considerations which will allow in the future the design of new prenylated xanthones with improved antitumor activity.
