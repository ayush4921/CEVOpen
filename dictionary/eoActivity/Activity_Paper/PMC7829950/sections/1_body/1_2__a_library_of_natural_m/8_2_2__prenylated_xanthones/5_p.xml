<p>The synthesis of a library of prenylated xanthones was shown to be fruitful with many of the synthesized compounds presenting encouraging antitumor activity in different cell lines. The first research work of our group concerning the synthesis of bioactive prenylated xanthones, comprised the synthesis of a small library of 
 <italic>O</italic>-prenylated xanthones using 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylxanthone (
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) as building block, previously identified by us as a promising in vitro growth inhibitor of human tumor cell lines [

 <italic>nor</italic>-derivative 1,3-dihydroxyxanthone (

 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Among synthesized compounds, xanthones 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> with isoprenyl and 1,1-dimethylallyl groups and xanthone 
 <bold>11</bold> with a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran group, showed improved in vitro growth inhibitory activity against the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, if compared with their parent compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>, while the growth inhibitory activity against the other cell lines was lost, suggesting some selectivity to MCF-7 cells [
