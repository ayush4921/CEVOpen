<p>In 2020, to further explore the mode of action of 
 <bold>22</bold> in cells, as well as other structure related(thio)xanthones with antitumor activity, the transcriptional response of the filamentous fungus 
 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> to these compounds using high throughput RNA sequencing was evaluated. These compounds showed to induce genes which express ABC transporters in 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic>, particularly atrb and cdr4, and to repress genes that are evocative of genes downregulated during oxidative stress [
