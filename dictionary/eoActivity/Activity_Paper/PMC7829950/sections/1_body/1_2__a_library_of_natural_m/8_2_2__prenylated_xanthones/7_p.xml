<p>Aiming to pursue the study of the influence of prenylation in the antitumor activity of xanthones, in 2010 the synthesis of both open-chain and fused prenylated derivatives of 3,4-dihydroxyxanthone (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was accomplished [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. All the synthesized compounds reduced cell viability of K-562 cell line, derived from a blastic phase of human chronic myelogenous leukemia, using a trypan blue exclusion assay, being 12-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f007">Figure 7</xref>) the most potent compound. Additionally, 
 <bold>22</bold> decreased cellular proliferation, induced S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, being this effect associated with an increase of cleaved PARP and Bid, as well as a decrease in Bcl-xL in K-562 cells. Further studies in K-562 leukemia cells also revealed that 
 <bold>22</bold> can act as a non-competitive P-gp inhibitor, pointing out its potential to act in MDR cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <bold>22</bold> showed promising in vitro growth inhibitory effect in estrogen-dependent ER (+) MCF-7 (breast) cells [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Interestingly, an enhancement in the antiestrogenic effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen was also observed in ER (+) MCF-7 cells treated with the xanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Considering that the pyranoxanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> was shown to exhibit potent antiproliferative activity in leukemia [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and breast cell lines [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], this hit compound was selected for further investigation concerning the mechanism of action at a molecular level and the optimization of potency through chemical and nanotechnology approaches.
