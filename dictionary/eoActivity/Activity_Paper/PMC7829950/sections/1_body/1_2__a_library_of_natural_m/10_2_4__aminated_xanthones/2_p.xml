<p>Another example of hybridization approach was also explored by us regarding the potential of aminated xanthones to disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction using an yeast cell-based assay [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Previous studies developed by our group disclosed two xanthone derivatives, pyranoxanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f007">Figure 7</xref>) and 1-carbaldehyde-3,4-dimethoxyxanthone 
 <bold>7</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) as MDM2-p53/TAp73 inhibitors. Hence, xanthone 
 <bold>7</bold> was used as starting material for the synthesis of a series of eleven aminated xanthones via reductive amination. From this study, xanthone 
 <bold>52</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f012">Figure 12</xref>) was identified as a putative p53-activating agent, inhibiting the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma HCT116 cell line, being this effect associated with cell cycle arrest through activation of the p53 pathway. Although further studies are required to confirm the mechanism of action of 
 <bold>52</bold>, these results demonstrated the potential usefulness of coupling amine-containing structural motifs of known MDM2-p53 disruptors into the 3,4-dioxygenated xanthone scaffold, which may lead to the identification of a novel xanthone derivative with promising antitumor activity.
