<p>Our group performed a complete SAR study through the analysis of various xanthone derivatives with multitarget activity against Alzheimer Disease (AD) [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. It was found that the presence of a methoxy group at C-3 increased the inhibition of MAO as well as the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the presence of a hydroxyl group on the xanthone scaffold was important for antioxidant activity. Based on this study and considering the potential of tricyclic amine drugs for CNS diseases, our group designed and prepared several xanthone derivatives to be used as dual agents for AD with AChE inhibitory and antioxidant activities [

 <bold>45</bold> was obtained from 1,8-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-9
 <italic>H</italic>-xanthen-9-one by Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and dimethylamine (

 <bold>45</bold> emerged as a hit compound exhibiting interesting dual AChE inhibitory effect and antioxidant activity (ferrous and copper ions chelating properties).
