<p>Later, another series of eleven aminated xanthones, together with xanthone

 <italic>H</italic>-xanthen-9-one and the aminated xanthone 
 <bold>52</bold> previously studied for their ability to disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction, were also screened for their antimicrobial activity against five fungal and seven bacterial (including two multidrug-resistant) strains [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The results of antimicrobial screening revealed the potential of compounds with halogen atoms as the most promising in terms of antibacterial activity, with some of the representatives (
 <bold>53</bold>, 
 <bold>54</bold> and 
 <bold>55</bold>) being highly active against either Gram-positive or Gram-negative strains. Regarding to antifungal activity, compound 
 <bold>54</bold> revealed a potent inhibitory effect on the growth of dermatophyte clinical strains (
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> FF5, 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> FF1 and 
 <italic>E. floccosum</italic> FF9). The fungicidal activity was observed for compound 
 <bold>55</bold> with 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> FF5. Also, 
 <bold>54</bold> showed a potent inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10,231 germ tube and biofilm formation, important virulence factors. Due to low solubility, conversion to the corresponding hydrochloride salts increased the potential of the studied aminated xanthones as antibacterial or antifungal agents [
