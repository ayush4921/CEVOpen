<p>Our group provided a significant contribution synthesizing a bioinspired library of CDXs, through a very convenient synthetic strategy, and exploring the enantioselectivity in biological activities for this class of compounds. Some CDXs proved to act as blockers of sciatic nerve transmission, as inhibitors of growth of human tumor cell lines and cyclooxygenase enzymes; in some cases, being the activity dependent on the stereochemistry. Additionally, enantioseparation studies and enantiomeric purity evaluation of the CDXs have been conducted using different types of CSPs, namely Pirkle-type, macrocyclic glycopeptide-based, polysaccharide-based, and HSA CSPs. Besides the potential as new drugs, CDXs present structural features with interest as chiral selectors for CSPs in LC. Analytical application for these small molecules as chiral selectors for LC was discovered by your group for the first time.</p>
