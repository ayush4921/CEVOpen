<p>Recently, from the development of new CSPs for cLC based on the most promising CDXs as chiral selectors, twelve new CSPs were successfully prepared starting from suitable functionalized small molecules including xanthone and benzophenone derivatives. The chiral selectors comprise one, two, three, or four chiral moieties. The evaluation of the new CSPs was done with different classes of chiral compounds, including a library of CDXs. Specificity for enantioseparation of some CDXs was observed. Besides, assessment of chiral recognition mechanisms was performed by molecular docking approach, which were in accordance with the chromatographic parameters. X-Ray analysis was also used to establish the structure of a chiral selector 3D. Excellent values of α (5.08) and Rs (3.13) were obtained for 4-methoxy-α- methylbenzylamine, in reversed-phase mode, using CH
