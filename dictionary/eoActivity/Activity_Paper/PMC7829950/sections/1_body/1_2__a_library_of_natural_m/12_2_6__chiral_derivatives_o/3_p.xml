<p>Synthetic kielcorins C-E were evaluated for their in vitro effect on the growth of three human tumor cell lines, MCF-7 (breast), TK-10 (renal), UACC-62 (melanoma), and on the proliferation of human lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The growth inhibitory effect was moderate but in a dose-dependent manner and influenced by the isomerism. The most active compounds were 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorins C (
 <bold>61</bold>) and D (
 <bold>62</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f016">Figure 16</xref>). The inhibition of human lymphocyte proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was identified [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The high potency and selectivity observed for these compounds suggested that kielcorins might be an important model for developing potent and isoform-selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. Kielcorins C-E revealed an effect compatible with PKC inhibition similar to that exhibited by chelerythrine, a well-established PKC inhibitor [

 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isokielcorin B were evaluated and demonstrated protective effect against 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroperoxide-induced toxicity in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], although in a less extension than their simple oxygenated precursors.
