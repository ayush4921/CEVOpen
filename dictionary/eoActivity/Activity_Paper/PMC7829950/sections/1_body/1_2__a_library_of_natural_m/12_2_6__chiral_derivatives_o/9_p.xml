<p>Regarding that some CDXs have molecular moieties structurally very similar to some kind of local anaesthetics, the ability to block compound action potentials at the isolated rat sciatic nerve was also investigated [

 <sup>+</sup> ionic currents. It was also investigated if the CDXs could prevent hypotonic haemolysis on rat erythrocytes. However, these data suggested that all tested CDXs caused no significant protection against hypotonic when applied in concentrations high enough to block the sciatic nerve conduction in the rat [
