<p>Recently, the SER, the chiral recognition mechanisms, and binding of CDXs on human serum albumin (HSA) CSP were also investigated (values of Î± and Rs ranged from 1.40 to 9.16 and 1.51 to 4.97, respectively). Percentages of binding ranged from 79.02 to 99.99%. The highest affinity values were achieved for the CDXs bearing bulky alkyl or aryl groups in the chiral side chain, suggesting that the hydrophobicity of the CDXs was important for HSA binding process. A good agreement (71%) between docking studies and experimental results was achieved, indicating that CDXs fit within the hydrophobic pocket of subdomain IIIA [
