<p>More recently, in 2012, our group explored another approach to acquire synthetic CDXs in an enantiomerically pure form by binding diverse chiral moieties to an appropriate xanthone scaffold (

Generally, the synthetic strategy used involved the coupling of suitable functionalized xanthones with both enantiomers of commercially available chiral building blocks, using a coupling reagent in the presence of a catalytic amount of triethylamine (TEA) and tetrahydrofuran as solvent. Through this “chiral pool” strategy, we currently have a large library of CDXs including eighty-six compounds described in literature [
