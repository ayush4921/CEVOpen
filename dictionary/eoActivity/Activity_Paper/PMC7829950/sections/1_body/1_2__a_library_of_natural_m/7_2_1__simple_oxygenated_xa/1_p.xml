<p>Simple oxygenated xanthones are xanthones with simple substituents such as hydroxyl, methoxy or methyl. This group is abundant in many natural products [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and are starting points for many synthetic xanthones [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As simple phenolic compounds, naturally-occurring simple oxygenated xanthones have been described for their antioxidant properties that have been implicated in their hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and cancer chemopreventive actions [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The influence of these substituents in the xanthone stability is important to understand the biological effects of these compounds [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our group has been gathering physical-chemical-biological properties of these simple derivatives to use this information in drug design of more complex xanthones.
