<p>Beyond pharmacological applications, the antifouling (AF) activity of this collection of simple oxygenated xanthones was tested following our previous results concerning the AF activity of a sulfated and glycosylated xanthone (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-molecules-26-00431">Section 2.4</xref>). This screening highlighted 3,4-dihydroxyxanthone (
 <bold>9</bold>) among this collection with in vivo activity toward the settlement of 
 <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> larvae (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.53 µM) and low toxicity to this macrofouling species (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 µM and LC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43) and to a non-fouling species, the brine shrimp 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> (&lt;10% mortality at 50 µM). Xanthone 
 <bold>9</bold> induced alterations in the mussel plantigrade larvae proteome, particularly toward the functions of cytoskeleton, chaperone-mediated regulation of protein activity, and cell redox status [
