<p>The tricyclic scaffold and the chemopreventive activity of naturally-occurring xanthones were also the reason to investigate this collection of simple oxygenated xanthones on antitumor screening activity. The in vitro effect of 27 xanthone derivatives on the growth of human cancer cell lines, led to select the naturally-occurring 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylxanthone (
 <bold>3</bold>) that was further investigated in nanoparticle formulations to improve its activity [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. One other hit that emerged from this study was 1,2-dihydroxyxanthone (
 <bold>4</bold>), which was initially considered promising for its effect against melanoma [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to its catechol structure 
 <italic>peri</italic> to carbonyl, this compound was the most promising antioxidant agent within this collection, that was further characterized for its chelating properties, its stability, phototoxicity, cytotoxic effect on a human keratinocyte cell line [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and its modulatory effects on the activity of the THP-1 macrophage cell line, namely cytokine production [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The efficacy and safety profile of xanthone 
 <bold>4</bold> with potential for skin care application deserves to be further explored. The investigation of tyrosinase as a molecular target, led to discover very recently, 1-methyl-3,4,6-trihydroxyxanthone (
 <bold>5</bold>) as a potent tyrosinase uncompetitive inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and to stablish a QSAR model in which the partial negative surface area, the relative number of oxygen atoms, and the substitution pattern of the xanthonic core, were found to contribute to the tyrosinase inhibitory activity.
