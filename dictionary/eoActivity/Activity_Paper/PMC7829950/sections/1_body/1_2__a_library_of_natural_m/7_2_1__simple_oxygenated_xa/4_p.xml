<p>The ethnopharmacological relevance of 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> extracts as antidepressant envisioned a first screening of simple oxygenated xanthones on targets related to central nervous system (CNS) disorders. On MAO studies, among 53 simple natural and synthetic xanthones, most of the compounds acted preferentially as MAO-A competitive, reversible inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the micro- to nanomolar range. Compound 1,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (
 <bold>1</bold>) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 40 nM for MAO-A emerged as the most active inhibitor. A surprising result was the strong activity and selectivity noted for the unsubstituted xanthone while hexasubstitution was an unfavourable feature for this effect. With this data, it was possible to build a 3D-QSAR model, which revealed the importance of the distance between two H-bond-acceptor groups in modulating this activity. Similar working hypothesis was made to investigate the hepatoprotective of xanthonolignoids (detailed in a following section), inspired in the hepatoprotective lignoid sylibin [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Along with xanthonolignoids, their synthetic intermediates were also investigated and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-methoxyxanthone and 2,3-dihydroxy-4-methoxyxanthone (
 <bold>2</bold>) were found to be even more potent than the investigated lignoids.
