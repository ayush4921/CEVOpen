<p>X-Ray diffraction data are an important tool, not only for structure elucidation but also to help in understanding the mechanism of action of the wide range of biological and pharmacological activities showed by xanthone derivatives. The crystal structure of 9
 <italic>H</italic>-xanthen-9-one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f001">Figure 1</xref>) was first reported in 1982 [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and later, using more accurate experimental techniques, the data have been improved [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Considering the molecule of xanthone itself in solid state, it is essentially planar due to the conjugated ring systems, except for the O(11) atom, which deviates 0.13 Ã… from the plane, with the central pyranoid ring with partial aromatic character. Due to the tricyclic-fused ring system, free rotation is limited. The rigidity of this scaffold contributes to the stability of the compound. For xanthone derivatives, slight differences can be found dependent on the nature of the substituents and their localization on the scaffold. The three-ring system can be slightly twisted along its longitudinal axis due to steric factors associated with the substituents, especially for bulky groups [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chemically, the xanthone core looks very simple but can display a very rich reactivity profile, which results mainly from the resonance forms (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-26-00431-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>). The oxygen atoms belonging to the biaryl ether group and the carbonyl group are involved in those forms; the planar tricyclic system, associated with a zwitterionic form, contributes for the poor solubility of the xanthone itself, which can be changed by adding substituents, concurring to higher solubility.
