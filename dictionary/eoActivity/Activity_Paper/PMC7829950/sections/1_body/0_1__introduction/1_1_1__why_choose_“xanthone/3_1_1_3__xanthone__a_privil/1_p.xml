<p>According the concept of Evans et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] the xanthone nucleus could be considered as a “privileged structure”, taking into account its binding to multiple, unrelated classes of protein receptors as high affinity ligands. Following, several authors associated the “xanthone” to the “privileged structure concept” [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This ability of xanthones to interfere with a variety of biological targets is related with some special molecular features such as the presence of a heteroaromatic tricyclic ring system predominantly planar and rigid, a carbonyl group at the central ring able of several interactions, a biaryl ether group contributing to the electronic system, and the xanthone core that accommodates a vast variety of substituents at different positions.
