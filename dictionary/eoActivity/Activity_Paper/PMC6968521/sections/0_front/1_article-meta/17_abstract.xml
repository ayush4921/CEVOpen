 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>A novel series of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibitors, which play critical roles in the cell cycle control and regulation of cell transcription, were synthesised. A systematic study of enzymatic and cellular assays led to the identification of compound 
  <bold>X22</bold> with a nanomolar potency against CDK4 and CDK9 and potent antiproliferative activities against a panel of tumour cell lines. 
  <bold>X22</bold> could induce cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in cancer cell lines. 
  <bold>X22</bold> dose-dependently inhibits signalling pathways downstream of CDKs in cancer cells. 
  <italic>In vivo</italic> antitumor activity assays, oral administration of 
  <bold>X22</bold> led to significant tumour regression in mouse model without obvious toxicity. Superior anti-cancer efficacy 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> of 
  <bold>X22</bold> demonstrated combined depletion of cell cycle and transcriptional CDK all contributed to antitumor activity. Taken together, concomitant inhibition of cell cycle and transcriptional CDK activities provided valuable guide for further structural optimisation.
