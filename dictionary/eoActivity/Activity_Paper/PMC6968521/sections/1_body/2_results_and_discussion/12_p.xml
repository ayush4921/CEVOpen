<p>To further verify the inhibitory effect of compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> on CDKs, western blotting analysis was performed. We found that 
 <bold>X22</bold> treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of Rb at CDK4/6 specific site Ser 780 and CDK9 specific sites Ser 807/811 in MCF7 and A549 cells respectively, which confirmed that 
 <bold>X22</bold> targeted on CDKs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). We also detected the level of phosphorylated Ser2 (Ser2-P), a well-established cellular target of CDK9 on the RNAPII CTD during transcription elongation. Compared to cells treated with DMSO, 
 <bold>X22</bold> effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 at 0.5 µM in MCF7 cells and 1 µM in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, the results above revealed that 
 <bold>X22</bold> could specifically target CDKs, thus further regulating their downstream signalling proteins in cancer cells.
