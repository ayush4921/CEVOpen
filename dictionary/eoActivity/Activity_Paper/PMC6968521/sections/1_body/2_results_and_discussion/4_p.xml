<p>Firstly, we explored the 
 <bold>R</bold> position with various substituents, such as H, CH
 <sub>3</sub>, OCH
 <sub>3</sub>, CF
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <bold>X1</bold>–
 <bold>X4</bold>, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results showed that H and CH
 <sub>3</sub> could only maintain the potent against CDK9 compared with ribociclib, while the OCH
 <sub>3</sub> and CF
 <sub>3</sub> groups were not tolerable at all because of the cliff loss potency on all the three kinases. In total, all the optimisation on 
 <bold>R</bold> position would decrease enzymatic inhibitory activity on different levels, especially for CDK4/6. We presumed whether the joint position 
 <bold>L</bold> between the isothiocyanato tail and phenyl ring affected the activity. Thus, 
 <bold>X4</bold> as a candidate for its poor potency on activity was selected to be oxidised to 
 <bold>X5</bold> and 
 <bold>X6</bold> structurally characterised as sulfoxide and sulphone, all of which were tested together to confirm the importance of the joint position 
 <bold>L</bold> as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As expected, 
 <bold>X5</bold>–
 <bold>X6</bold> displayed more notable increasing inhibitory activity than 
 <bold>X4</bold> against all of three kinases. Oxidation state of sulphur at the joint position 
 <bold>L</bold> might be superior than sulphur, that was also be confirmed in the example of 
 <bold>X1</bold> versus 
 <bold>X7</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Further, the derivatives bearing oxidation state of sulphur were tested the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against CDK4 and CDK9 due to the high inhibition at 1 micromolar concentration (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Compared with ribociclib, 
 <bold>X7</bold> exhibited excellent potency against CDK4/9 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 7 and 26 nM, respectively). At the same time, a derivative (
 <bold>X8</bold>) with different space between isothiocyanato and phenyl ring was synthesised to determine the changing the activity produced by the length of the tail. The results indicated that the length of the tail could cause changing on the enzymatic inhibitory activity, but still need to be explored the rules of the changing in detail.
