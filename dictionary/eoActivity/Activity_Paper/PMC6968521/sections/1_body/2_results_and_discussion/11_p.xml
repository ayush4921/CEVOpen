 </xref>, CDK4/6 preferentially bind D-type cyclins to form complexes. Activations of these complexes are responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which allows cell cycle to proceed from G
 <sub>1</sub> to S phase and further results in cell proliferation. In contrast, CDK9 is not a typical Cdc-2-like kinase and does not participate in cell cycle regulation. It can form the P-TEFb complex, which is capable of phosphorylating the CTD of the largest subunit of RNAPII and regulate the RNA transcription elongation.
