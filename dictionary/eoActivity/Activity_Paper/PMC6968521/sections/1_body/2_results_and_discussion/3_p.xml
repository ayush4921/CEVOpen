<p>The results of the enzymatic-inhibition assays are listed in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> with ribociclib as the positive control. We expected to explore an optimisation strategy for improving the inhibitory activity against cell cycle as targeting on CDK4/6 and simultaneously targeting CDK9 for cell transcription. The structureâ€“activity relationships were discussed based on the optimisation at the R, L substituents and the carbon tail length (shown as Formula I and II in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
