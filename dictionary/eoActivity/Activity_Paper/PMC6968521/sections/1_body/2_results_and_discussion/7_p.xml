<p>Since our goal here is to discover CDKs inhibitors with cell cycle arrest and transcription blockade activities having high potency for cancer treatment, we screened compounds exhibiting better kinase inhibitory to do the cytotoxicity assays. The selected compounds, including 
 <bold>X7</bold>, 
 <bold>X19</bold>, 
 <bold>X20</bold> and 
 <bold>X22</bold> were carried out using standard CCK8 assay and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <bold>X8</bold> and 
 <bold>X12</bold> with selective CDK9 inhibition and ribociclib as CDK4 inhibitor were assess the cancer cell inhibition assays as control. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were detected on compounds against breast cancer cell lines (4T1, T47D and MCF7) and lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299 and H460). The best tumour cell potency of these analogues was obtained for molecule 
 <bold>X22</bold>, which was also rational inhibitor of CDK9 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10 nM and CDK4 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30 nM. The CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib alone was not potent in these solid tumour cells. 
 <bold>X22</bold> displayed higher inhibition potency than selective CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and selective CDK9 inhibitor 
 <bold>X8</bold> and 
 <bold>X12</bold>. This result demonstrated that dual-target compound had more efficient inhibition at the cellular level. As the results of enzymatic and antitumor activity in cell lines showed that 
 <bold>X22</bold> is the best in this class, we performed further in-depth 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biological studies using this compound.
