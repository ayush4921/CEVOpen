<p>Cells at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL were seeded in six-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations for 48 h. The cells were then harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. Then the cells were subjected to an Annexin V/PI Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences) for staining according to manufacture’s instructions, and finally analysed by flow cytometry (Modfit, BD).
