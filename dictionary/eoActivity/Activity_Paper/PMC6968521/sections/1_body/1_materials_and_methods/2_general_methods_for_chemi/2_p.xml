<p>The commercially obtained chemicals were used directly without further purification. Solvents were purified and distilled following the standard procedures. All the reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker AV-400 MHz spectrometer (400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 101 MHz for 
 <sup>13 </sup>C) and chemical shifts were expressed in ppm downfield using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were performed on a VG ZAB-HS mass spectrometer under electron spray ionisation (ESI). All the derivatives for testing bioactivity were purified to &gt;95% purity which was determined by HPLC analysis on a Shimadzu Prominence-i LC-2030C 3D system (column, InertSustain C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μM; mobile phase, gradient elution of methanol/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10); low rate, 1.0 ml/min; UV wavelength, 190 − 800 nm; temperature, 40 °C; injection volume, 10 μL). The detailed synthesis of compounds is presented in
