<p>To date, selective CDK inhibitors have produced only modest activity against solid tumours. In this article, we discovered and studied the medicinal chemistry of multi-CDKs inhibitors to assess their relative activities against the cell cycle and transcriptional CDKs. Several compounds inhibited CDK4 and CDK9 at low nanomolar levels and exhibited good antiproliferative activities in a panel of tumour cells. The most potent analogue 
 <bold>X22</bold> potently inhibited CDK4 and CDK9 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 30 and 10 nM, respectively, which showed marked antitumor activity. In 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cellar assays, 
 <bold>X22</bold> was capable of blocking the cell cycle at G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase resulting in decreased S-phase populations. Compared with CDK4 depletion alone, combined depletion induced apoptosis in cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot assays confirmed substantial apoptosis after 
 <bold>X22</bold>-induced CDK4 and CDK9 depletion. Meanwhile, 
 <bold>X22</bold> reduced RNA polymerase II expression and CTD phosphorylation. In 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay, oral administration of compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> once-daily at 15, 30 or 60 mg/kg for 18 days led to tumour regression without obvious toxicity. Thus, reduced CDK4 activity in concert with depleted CDK9 activity may enhance the antiproliferative effects. This study suggest combined depletion of cell cycle and transcriptional CDK activities may be worthy of clinical further development for solid tumour therapy.
