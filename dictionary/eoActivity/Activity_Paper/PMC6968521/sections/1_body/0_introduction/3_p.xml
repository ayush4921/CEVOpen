<p>Out of numerous kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are protein kinases involved in important cellular processes due to the complexity of their roles. They regulate the cell division, apoptosis, transcription and differentiation, which involved in a number of pathological conditions such as human cancer

 </xref>. CDK4/6 binding to cyclin D forming CDK4/6-cyclin D complex, is an important component of cell cycle activation and mediates the transition from G
 <sub>1</sub> to S phase, where cells grow and synthesise proteins in preparation for DNA synthesis

 </xref>. Among the transcriptional CDKs, CDK9 has attracted major interest of many groups. CDK9 forming heterodimeric complex with subunit cyclin T or cyclin K phosphorylates the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to control the transcription progression
