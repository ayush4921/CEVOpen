<p>Water soluble salts that could present in the extract may interfere with the urinary excretion of electrolytes. The result revealed that there were very low amounts, ie, 7.69, 8.3, and 10.4 mmol/L of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> respectively, with the higher (400 mg/kg) dose of aqueous extract whereas the concentrations of these electrolytes in 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg were 4.7, 6.9, and 5.4mmol/L and 3.4, 6, and 7 mmol/L, respectively. The quantitative determination of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, Cl
 <sup>−</sup> in these same doses of 80% methanol extract showed nondetectable levels.
