<p>The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> produced dose-dependent diuresis, albeit insignificant across the first three time points (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It showed significant urine output starting from the fourth hour with the middle dose (45.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and higher dose (59.6%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Besides, all three doses continued to be significant until the fifth hour, FSAE200 (56.3% 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and FSAE400 (72.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Unlike the middle and higher doses of extract, FASE100 produced apparent urine output at the last time point only (40.4%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Inter and intragroup analysis also revealed that, FSAE400 showed a significant difference in urine output at the fifth hour compared to FSAE100 (22.6%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), FSME100 (27.4%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and FSME200 (24.6%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Likewise, FURO10 treated rats exhibited a significant increment in urine volume setting in the third hour (61.8%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and onward. In addition, it displayed a significantly greater effect against FSAE100, FSME100 and FSME200 (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) at the fifth hour.
