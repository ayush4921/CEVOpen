<p>As for the trend, the urine of rats treated with aqueous extract showed an increase in pH from 7.70 (FSAE100) to 8.10 (FSAE400). In contrast, treatment with 80% methanol extract increased pH from 7.60 (FSME100) to 8.00 (FSME400). Group comparison revealed that the pH of urine from rats treated with the higher doses of both extracts (FSAE400 and FSME400) displayed a significant (
