<p>Urinary Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> concentrations of the plant extracts, control, and standard groups were analyzed using Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) analyzer (AVL 9181 Electrolyte Analyzer, Roche, Germany). The instrument was automatically calibrated prior to analysis with different standard solutions. The ratios of electrolytes, Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>+Na
 <sup>+</sup>, were calculated to evaluate the saluretic activity of the different extracts. In addition, urine pH was directly measured on fresh urine using a pH meter. Furthermore, the salt content of the extract was determined to rule out its contribution on urinary electrolyte concentration.
