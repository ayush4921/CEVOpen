<p>The U251 cell line was seeded in 10 mm
 <sup>3</sup> Petri dishes at 200,000 cells per dish in 10 ml media. After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with the extract by replacing the media with the one containing the extract of 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic> (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic> (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic> (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). This was incubated for 24 h including control (DMSO 0.05% v/v) dishes. Collagen V was kept at room temperature to be warmed and diluted with equal volume of sterile PBS to reduce the stock concentration to 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. For each chamber, 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of collagen was dispensed and kept at room temperature in sterile condition overnight. This was to allow collagen to be coated on the chamber. Treated cells and controls were then harvested and seeded in collagen V coated inserts at 300,000 cells in 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 0.1% FBS media (serum-free media). The normal (serum) media (600 
 <italic>μ</italic>l, 5% FBS) was aliquot into the lower chamber as chemoattractant as described by Guessous et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After 8 h of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the coated inserts were gently removed and their content discarded and rinsed with tap water and avoid touching the outer bottom. In a 12-well plate, 0.5 ml of 0.5% crystal violet was placed, and the inserts were immersed in the stain for 5 minutes. These were allowed to dry at room temperature overnight, viewed under the computer-aided N-180M biological microscope, and photomicrograph taken at x40 objectives. Cells within 5 different fields of equal dimensions per treatment were counted.
