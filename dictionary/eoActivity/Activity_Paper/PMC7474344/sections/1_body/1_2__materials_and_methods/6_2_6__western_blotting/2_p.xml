<p>The western blot was performed as described by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded and separated in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 140 V (initial setting at 60 V for 20 minutes) for 1.5 h at room temperature and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 35 V for 1.75 h at 4°C. The membrane was rinsed in TBST and then blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-PARP, anti-cleaved PARP, and anti-actin) in fresh 5% skimmed milk TBST at 4°C overnight on a slow shaker. The antibody-bound membranes were washed 3 times in TBST each for 10 minutes. They were then treated with the specific secondary antibody in 5% skimmed milk TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a slow shaker followed by washing 3 times. The immunoreactive signals were detected with super signal ultrachemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
