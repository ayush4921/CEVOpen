<p>The U87 cell line was seeded in 10 mm
 <sup>3</sup> Petri dishes at 200,000 cells per dish in 10 ml media. After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with the extract by replacing the media with the one containing the extracts: 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic> (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic> (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). It was incubated for 24 and 48 h including control dishes. Cells were harvested, and protein contents were extracted using the RIPA buffer (1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS). Extracted proteins were kept at −20°C for further use. Protein concentration was determined using Comassie plus reagent (Bradford assay), and absorbance was taken using the ELISA reader.
