<p>Brain tumor cell lines (U87 and U251) were obtained from Dr Abounader's laboratory, University of Virginia Health System, Chalotesville, U.S.A. The U87 cancer cells were cultured in minimal essential medium-
 <italic>α</italic> (MEM-
 <italic>α</italic>) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% sodium pyruvate, 2% sodium bicarbonate, 1% nonessential amino acid, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin while the U251 cell line was cultured in (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The culture condition for all cells was 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells at 60–90% confluence were passaged.
