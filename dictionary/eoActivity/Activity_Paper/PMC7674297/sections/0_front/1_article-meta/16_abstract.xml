 <p>Curcumin, a secondary metabolite from the turmeric plant is one of the most promising natural products, which has been studied extensively for decades. It has demonstrated several pharmacological activities 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic>. Various studies have indicated that the pharmacological activity of curcumin is contributed by its metabolites.
 </p>
 <p>The aim of this review is to present an overview of metabolic products of curcumin produced upon its reduction like di, tetra, hexa and octa-hydrocurcumin. In addition, this paper has systematically analyzed the current information regarding medicinal use of reduced metabolites of curcumin and identified the limitations which have hindered its widespread usage in the medical world. Several diverse therapeutic effects have shown to be exhibited by reduced metabolites of curcumin such as antioxidant, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities. The potential underlying molecular mechanisms of the biological activities of reduced metabolites of curcumin have also been highlighted, which may provide insight into the principle of effectiveness of curcumin.</p>
