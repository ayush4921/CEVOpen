<p id="p0050">Curcumin transformed into DHC, THC, and subsequently converted into glucuronide conjugates [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In Liver, Kidney, and intestinal mucosa, the conjugative enzyme activity for glucuronidation and curcumin sulfation had also been discovered. Further, a study reported that a significant portion of orally administered curcuminoids were conjugated to glucuronide in the intestine after that, they entered into the portal vein as glucuronide conjugates and further conjugated to form glucuronide/sulfate in the liver. In contrast to intravenously injected curcuminoids, orally administered curcuminoids could not reach the liver in the free form. Concisely, orally administered curcuminoids entered the overall blood circulation in rats and were present primarily as glucuronide and glucuronide/sulfate conjugates [
