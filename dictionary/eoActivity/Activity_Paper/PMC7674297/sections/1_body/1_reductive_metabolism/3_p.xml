<p id="p0035">Curcumin is one of the very well-known natural products, known for its various pharmacological activities. However, from the therapeutic perspective, not that much effort has been made in terms of its metabolism. The study of curcumin metabolism may uncover other unexplained advantages of curcumin. Curcumin itself has poor chemical stability, low absorption, and also results in various metabolites and degradation products, which are also less studied areas. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that curcumin's degradation products and its metabolites may be responsible for its immense therapeutic effects. However, this still needs to be adequately validated [
