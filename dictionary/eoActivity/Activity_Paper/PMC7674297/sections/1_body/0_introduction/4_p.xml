 <italic>in vivo</italic>, mainly by reduction and conjugation. Di-, tetra-, hexa- and octahydrocurcumin are formed upon consecutive reduction of the double bonds in the heptadienedione chain of curcumin [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among reduced metabolites, tetra- and hexahydrocurcumin, form the largest portion of curcumin metabolites detected. The diverse biological properties of curcumin are contributed by these reductive metabolites rendering the study of these metabolites critical [
