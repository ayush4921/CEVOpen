<p id="p0025">This review aims to elucidate the potential relevance of reductive metabolites of curcumin in various diseases and their possible molecular targets (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>) and mechanisms underlying curcumin biological effects. Curcumin forms reduced products which are equally important to its pharmacological effects, even in some cases reduced products show more potential than parent compound curcumin, but they are less studied as compare to curcumin [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence there is need of more comprehensive research in this area to unfold relevant questions like specificity, effectiveness, mechanism of actions, comparative studies of reductive metabolites of curcumin.
