<p id="p0090">THC exhibited anti-fibrotic and anti-diabetic cardiomyopathy effects by suppressing hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress through the modulation of the SIRT1 pathway. In fact, THC upregulated SIRT1, deacetylated SOD2 expression, and inhibited ROS-induced TGFÎ²1/Smad3 profibrotic pathway [

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The anti-aging activity of THC was shown to be mediated via inhibition of protein kinase B/Akt kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, THC increased the lifespan of Drosophila by suppressing oxidative stress response through the FOXO and Sir2 dependent pathway [
