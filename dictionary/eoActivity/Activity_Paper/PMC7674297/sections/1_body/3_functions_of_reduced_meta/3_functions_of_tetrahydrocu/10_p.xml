<p id="p0115">Antitumor activity of THC had been found superior to curcumin in H22 induced ascites tumor mice model. The possible underlying mechanisms that have been suggested were the induction of mitochondria apoptosis pathway, activation of p53, and inhibition of MDM2 [

It inhibited tumor growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation, which was likely to happen through the inhibition of COX-2, EGFR, and p-ERK1&amp;2, and p-AKT [
