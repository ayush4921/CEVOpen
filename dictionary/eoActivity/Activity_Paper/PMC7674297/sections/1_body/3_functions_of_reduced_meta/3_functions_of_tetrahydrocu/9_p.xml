<p id="p0110">Up to 400 mg/kg THC was regarded as safe in rats, as stated in preclinical safety research [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. THC is widely known as an anticancer agent [

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. As a radiosensitizer, it could stimulate G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by suppressing cyclin D1 and PCNA in glioma cells [

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. THC showed lower inhibitory activity against inflammation-associated carcinogenesis in mice [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. THC, as a known antitumor compound [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], induced autophagy that was found associated with the suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in A549 lung cancer cells [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. THC inhibited human breast cancer MCF-7 cell proliferation. The underlying mechanism was that THC accelerated the ROS-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Antitumor activity of THC is mediated by inhibition of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α that is associated with increased autophagy and downregulation of Akt/mTOR and p38 MAPK in human osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor cell lines. It indicated a relationship between autophagy and tumorigenesis. THC led autophagy induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition and inhibited angiogenesis through HIF-1α. However, the role of other signalling pathways like ERK and JNK needs to be explored [
