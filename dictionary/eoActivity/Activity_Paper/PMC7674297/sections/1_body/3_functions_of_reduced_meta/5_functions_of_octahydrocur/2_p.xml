<p id="p0135">OHC (Octahydrocurcumin) possesses many functions similar to curcumin, in some cases superior to curcumin, like in its properties as antitumor, anti-inflammation [

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. OHC, a final reduced derivative of curcumin, has also been a less studied molecule due to its less accessibility and poor systemic bioavailability. The research suggested that OHC has more superior antitumor activity than its parent compound curcumin [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The antitumor effect of OHC and its molecular mechanistic pathway has been investigated in Mouse hepatoma 22 (H22)-induced ascitic tumor-bearing model. OHC targeted major proteins that are involved in cancer cell apoptosis-like p53, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), Bcl-2, Bcl-xl [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A study indicated that OHC works via enhancing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. OHC enhanced the survival rate of the tumor-mouse model more than that of curcumin. Major morphological characteristics that appear during tumor growth were found to be reduced by OHC. OHC had a more profound effect on H22 cellular apoptosis than curcumin, and it successfully increased the expression of p53, pro-apoptotic molecule Bax, and Bad. Further, OHC was found to inhibit the expression level of MDM2 and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl [
