<p>Ganoderic acids (GAs) are among the main active ingredients of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> with immunomodulatory effects. GAs belong to the triterpenoid secondary metabolites. Genome sequence analyses and functional studies showed that the terpenoids in 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> are synthesized through the Mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Several genes in this pathway in 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> have been cloned and their functional roles confirmed, including those encoding 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPs). Genome sequence data mining also identified the putative genes involved in the modification of the triterpene backbone, such as those involved in cyclization and glycosylation, which are very important for the synthesis of the diversity of GAs in 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>.
