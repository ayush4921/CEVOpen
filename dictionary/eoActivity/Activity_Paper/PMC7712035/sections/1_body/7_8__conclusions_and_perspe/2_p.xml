<p>Aside from the above described compounds, other compounds from edible and medicinal mushrooms may also have great potentials. One such group is chitin and chitin-related compounds. Chitin is the most common aminopolysaccharide polymer in nature and the main material that gives strength to the fungal cell walls (as well as to the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects). Through deacetylation, either chemically or enzymatically, chitin can be converted to chitosan, a well-known derivative. Through hydrolysis, both chitin and chitosan can be converted to chito-oligosaccharides. Several fungal chitin, chitosan, and chito-oligosaccharides have shown promising benefits to humans and human health [

 <italic>Mucor rouxii</italic> and other organisms have been used in plant protection and food processing; chitosan in diagnosis, drug delivery, infection control, molecular imaging, and wound healing; and chito-oligosaccharides in antimicrobial and antitumor activities [

 <xref rid="B196-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. At present, none of those tested chitin, chitosan, and chito-oligosaccharides for human effects have come from edible or medicinal mushrooms yet. However, due to the similar chemical structures of chitin from different groups of organisms, itâ€™s highly likely that this group of natural products from edible and medicinal mushrooms will have similar effects and they represent a promising area of future development for edible and medicinal mushrooms.
