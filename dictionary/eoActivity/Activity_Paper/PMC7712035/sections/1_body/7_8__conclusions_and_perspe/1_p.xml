<p>Many edible and medicinal mushrooms contain compounds with significant immunoregulatory activities. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review on the types of these compounds; their distributions, structures and functions; and their potential mechanisms of actions. These compounds have shown their activities through in vitro, ex vivo, tissue cultures, and/or in vivo studies. Some of these compounds have been commercialized and licensed for clinical use.</p>
