<p>FIPs typically exist in low quantities in their native mushrooms. The low yield/production has been a major limitation of their research and application. Therefore, techniques are being rapidly developed to enhance the production of recombinant FIPs in other organisms such as the yeast 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and the bacterium 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. For example, the LZ-8 gene of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> has been expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> to produce a recombinant LZ-8 protein (rLZ-8). While the recombinant protein lacks the carbohydrate moiety of the native protein, it shows similar bioactivity for IL-2 induction as the native protein. The FIP-fve protein has also been successfully expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
