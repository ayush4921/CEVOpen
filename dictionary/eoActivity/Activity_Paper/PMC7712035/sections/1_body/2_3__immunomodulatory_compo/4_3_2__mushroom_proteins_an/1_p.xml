<p>Mushroom proteins and proteinâ€“conjugate complexes are also well-known as immunomodulatory compounds. Similar to the polysaccharide-based compounds, these protein-based immunomodulatory compounds in medicinal mushrooms can also be grouped into different categories. Here, these compounds are grouped into two major categories: fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) and lectins. FIPs differ from lectins by having no conjugate while each lectin contains specific carbohydrates conjugated to a polypeptide.</p>
