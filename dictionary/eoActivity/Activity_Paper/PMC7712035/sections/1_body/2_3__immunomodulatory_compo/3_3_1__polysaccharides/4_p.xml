<p>Two other well-known polysaccharide–protein complexes produced by 
 <italic>Macrocybe gigantea</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Tricholoma giganteum</italic>) and 
 <italic>Agaricus brazei</italic>, respectively, have also shown immunomodulatory effects. A polysaccharide-protein complex (PSPC) isolated from 
 <italic>T. giganteum</italic> showed that it could help restore and improve the phagocytic function of macrophages in tumor-bearing mice [

 <italic>A. brazei</italic> contains diverse polysaccharide–protein complexes with different chemical linkages such as β-1,6-glucan, α-1,6- and α-1,4-glucan, glucomannan and β-1,3-glucan. AbM has been shown to have immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties [
