<p>Terpenes are a large and diverse class of hydrocarbon compounds derived biosynthetically from units of isopentenyl pyrophosphate. They are widespread in nature, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers, some insects, and fungi, including mushrooms. The addition of functional groups (usually oxygen-containing) to terpenes produce terpenoids. Both terpenes and terpenoids from a number of medicinal mushrooms have shown immunoregulatory activities with medical significance. 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the types of terpenes and terpenoids that have been isolated from medicinal mushrooms, including evidence for their specific immunomodulatory activities. For example, 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> sp. are known for their high content of triterpenoids and these triterpenoids have shown high immunomodulating and anti-infective activities [
