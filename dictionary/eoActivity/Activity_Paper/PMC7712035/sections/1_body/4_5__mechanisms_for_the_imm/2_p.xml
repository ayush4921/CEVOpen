<p>It is well known that the human immune system can be modulated by foods, supplements or endogenous bioactive agents [

 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> present the specific components isolated from different mushroom species that have shown significant immunomodulatory activities, including their (potential) mechanisms of action. For example, two polysaccharides from two different mushroom species have shown significant immunoenhancing activities. In the first, a glucuronoxylomannan TAP-3 obtained from 
 <italic>Naematelia aurantialba</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Tremella aurantialba</italic>) showed marked immune enhancement activity and promoted NO, IL-1β and TNF-α secretions from macrophages [

 <italic>Craterellus cornucopioides</italic> strengthened the phagocytic function of macrophages, increased the expression of cytokines, upregulated the expression of cell membrane receptor TLR4 and downstream protein kinase products through activation of the TLR4–NFκB pathway [
