<p>NPs, especially those from African sources deserve more attention as they have been proven to be underrepresented, unexplored and understudied for drug discovery. NPs have been reported to contribute strategically in the drug discovery process either as new drug molecules or the relevant scaffold for the synthesis of novel bioactive molecules. In this study, we are continuing our effort to provide an online free database of NPs from African sources.[

 </xref>] The current collection herein represents the most comprehensive collection of NPs from the Eastern Africa region covering the period 1962 to 2019. This collection contains relevant details such as possible modes of action, as well as predicted toxicity, compound SMILES, 3D models computed physico‐chemical properties to estimate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties, and literature reference of source data. It was shown that a significant portion of the molecules is not annotated in the PubChem database as well as the relatively few references found in PubMed. Additionally, just like the well‐known NP databases, comparative studies indicated that the EANPDB can be a good starting point for virtual screening based on the DMPK and Toxicity predictions made. Substructure searching starting from the methylthiol group (as a case study) for the identification of new HDAC inhibitors yielded molecules that were mostly latrunculins A and B derivatives. Latrunculins A and B have been reported to possess antitumour activity and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> evaluation of these molecules show typical characteristics of good drug candidates.
