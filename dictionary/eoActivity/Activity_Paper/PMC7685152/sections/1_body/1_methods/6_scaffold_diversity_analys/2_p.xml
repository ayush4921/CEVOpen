 </xref> In order to evaluate the scaffold diversity within the published NP datasets from Africa, scaffolds for the unique molecules found in the EANPDB were analyzed in comparison to those of the updated NANPDB using the Platform for Unified Molecular Analysis (PUMA) platform.

 </xref> This platform makes use of integrated metrics to characterize compound databases including the visualization of scaffold content, fingerprint diversity among others from the user input file (a comma‐separated value (.csv) file having three columns; SMILES, database names, and compound IDs). In this study, both the Cyclic System Recovery (CSR)
