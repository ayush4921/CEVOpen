 </xref>] The unified ANPDB is constantly being updated based on inputs from journal articles and MSc/PhD. thesis from African university libraries of various regions. In the current study, emphasis was laid on data published on compounds identified from source species harvested in the Eastern African region (including the countries; Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda). The data for the source species, compounds, literature references and the use of the plant species were compiled on spreadsheets, following our previously described methodology.
