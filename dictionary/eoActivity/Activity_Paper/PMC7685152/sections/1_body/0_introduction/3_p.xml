<p>One of the magnificent beauties of the African continent is its richness in flora and fauna. This richness offers the African population diverse traditional means in treating ailments based on what nature has presented to them. However, due to poor documentation, some of this traditional information is being lost nowadays. This is one of the main factors behind the scientific exploration of the known traditional methods as well as the source species (bacteria, fungi, plants or animals). Accordingly, several NPs have been identified and collected into several public and commercial databases and repositories.[
