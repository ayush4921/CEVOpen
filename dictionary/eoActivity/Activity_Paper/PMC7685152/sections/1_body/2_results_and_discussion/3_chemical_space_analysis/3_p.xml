<p>An analysis of the three most important principal components demonstrated that approximately 95 % covariation of the global information could explain the content of the various datasets, As observed in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the three datasets clustered around at the centre, an indication of the molecules occupying similar chemical space. However, portions of each dataset tend to deviate outwardly in different directions. Thus, an indication of molecules that are chemically different from those represented at the centre. As observed, the top section of the scatter plots in the figures is highly represented by molecules from NuBBE, while the left part of the plot is occupied more by the EANPDB and the lower part of the figure shows an overwhelming presence of NANPDB molecules. Thus, the content of the EANPDB, NANPDB and NuBBE dataset molecules used in this study are observed to occupy diverse chemical spaces.
