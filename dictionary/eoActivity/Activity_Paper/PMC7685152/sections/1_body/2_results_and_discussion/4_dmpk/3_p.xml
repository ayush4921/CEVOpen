<p>As observed in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, the data indicate that the distribution of 
 <italic>mol_MW</italic> generally followed a Gaussian‐like curve with maximum peaks around 300 Da. While molecules with 
 <italic>mol_MW</italic> &lt;500 Da dominated the EANPDB, NANPDB, DrugBank and NuBBE datasets, the StreptomeDB dataset rather demonstrated an almost level distribution in the number of molecules with ∼200 Da&lt;
 <italic>mol_MW</italic>&lt;∼550 Da. Approximately 85 % of the molecules contained in all the datasets analyzed had MW less than 500, thus meeting one of the Rules of Five for oral drugs. Similarly, the distribution of molecules concerning the predicted 
 <italic>QPlogP</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o/w</italic>
 </sub> below 5 also dominated (∼85 %). All calculated 
 <italic>QPlogP</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o/w</italic>
 </sub> for molecules in the different datasets used in this study for comparison followed a similar distribution pattern (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B).
