<p>An evaluation of the computed physicochemical properties of the violation of the “Rule of Five” is summarized in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The molecular enumeration showed that a majority of molecules in the EANPDB (∼65 %) had no Lipinski's (Rule of Five) violation, while approximately 85 % of all the molecules in the analyzed datasets had &lt;= 2 Lipinski's violation (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). Additional investigation of how lead‐like the content of the three NPs datasets (EANPDB, NANPDB and NuBBE; mainly from plant sources) was performed (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B). It was observed that about 55 % of the NPs from the Northern and Eastern parts of Africa had no lead‐like (Rule of Three) violation while ∼60 % of the Brazilian collection (NuBBE) had no lead‐like violation.
