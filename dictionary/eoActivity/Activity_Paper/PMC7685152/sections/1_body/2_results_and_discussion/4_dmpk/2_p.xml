<p>A drug‐likeness study to show the distribution of the EANPDB molecules (Table 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was further carried out using common druglikeness filters like molecular weight (
 <italic>mol_MW</italic>), logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient (
 <italic>QPlogP</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o/w</italic>
 </sub>), number of H‐bond donors (
 <italic>donorHB</italic>), number of H‐bond acceptors (
 <italic>accptHB</italic>), as well as an evaluation of the ratio of molecules violating the lead‐like rule of 3 (
 <italic>RuleOfThree</italic>) and the Lipinski rule of 5 (
 <italic>RuleOfFive</italic>) for orally available drug molecules. The variation in terms of percentages of these physicochemical properties among the selected datasets for comparison is shown in Figures
