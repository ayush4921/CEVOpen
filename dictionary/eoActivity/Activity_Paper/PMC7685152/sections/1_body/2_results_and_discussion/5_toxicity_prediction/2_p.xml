<p>The application of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods such as virtual screening and toxicity prediction have continuously gained grounds to complement resource expensive wet laboratory experiments in the drug discovery pipeline. This is especially the case when it comes to NPs that are normally available only in low yields. A good proportion of the molecules were predicted as negative (complied) with the AMES mutagenic test in bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A negative prediction with the AMES text indicates that the compound in question is not mutagenic and may not act as a carcinogen. On the other hand, almost all the molecules in EANPDB (99.7 %) were predicted as not interfering with the inhibition of the potassium ion (K
 <sup>+</sup>) channels (encoded by hERG I). About 85 % of the content of the EANPDB were predicted to have no hepatotoxic or skin sensitization effect. The human maximum tolerated dose (Max. tolerated dose in log mg/kg/day) extrapolated from animal data that gives an idea of the maximum recommended starting dose in phase I clinical trials (the toxic dose threshold of chemicals in humans) has been predicted for each molecule. The maximum (Max), minimum (Min) and Average (Avg) of the 
 <italic>Max. tolerated dose</italic> (human) alongside the Oral Rat Acute Toxicity (LD
 <sub>50</sub>), 
 <italic>Oral Rat Chronic Toxicity</italic> (LOAEL), 
 <italic>Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity</italic> and 
 <italic>Minnow toxicity</italic> have been summarized in Table
