<p>In order to evaluate the application of the African NP database, we applied a substructure search for molecules having a methylthiol moiety (chemical formula; CH
 <sub>3</sub>SH and canonical SMILES; CS). The existence of several thiol based HDAC inhibitors such as romidepsin and largazole (both prodrugs that generate the thiol 
 <italic>in vivo)</italic> supports our idea to find molecules that possess sulphur containing functional groups from our database that can be used as a ZBG in the development of HDAC inhibitors (Figure
