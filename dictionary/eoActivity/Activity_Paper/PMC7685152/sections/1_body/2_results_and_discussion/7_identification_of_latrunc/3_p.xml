 </xref> The previously reported biological activity is antitumour activity, with mode of action proposed as binding reversibly to actin monomers, forming a 1 : 1 complex with G‐actin and disrupting its polymerization. Interestingly, latrunculins A and B both had no Lipinski's violation and their toxicity prediction showed that they can be good clinical candidates. It was interesting to observe that these molecules possess antitumour activity and possess a thiazolidin‐2‐on group that might act as a ZBG or may be activated to function as HDAC inhibitors. Moreover, HDACs have been reported to be new and interesting drug targets in the search of novel cancer/tumour related drugs.[
