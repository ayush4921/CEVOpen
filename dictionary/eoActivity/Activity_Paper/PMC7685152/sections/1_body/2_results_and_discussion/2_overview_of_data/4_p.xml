<p>Interestingly, this trend of the top compound class occupiers is very similar to what was observed in the Northern African NP database.

 </xref> Additionally, about 44 % of the molecules in the EANPDB have at least one reported biological activity from a broad list of activities curated from the literature. These reported activities have been grouped into 40 classes. Anti‐malarial/anti‐plasmodial evaluations were the most reported (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This is following the fact that malaria and other parasitic diseases remain serious burdens to the people in this region.

 </xref> Thus, the scientific validation of most of the traditional application of medicinal plants goes into confirming the usage of such plants in treating parasitic diseases such as plasmodial related ailments. Also, a few molecules from East African sources with interesting anti‐viral (HCV and HIV) activities were reported and are present in this version of the database. To further validate some of the reported activities, mechanism of action (MOA) for 3 of the molecules have been confirmed and has been curated in the EANPDB. These molecules include nitidine (
