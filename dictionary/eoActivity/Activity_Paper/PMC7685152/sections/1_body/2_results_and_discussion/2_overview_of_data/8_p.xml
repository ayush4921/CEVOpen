<p>In a nutshell, EANPDB was combined with NANPDB to form ANPDB and can be accessed via http://african‐compounds.org/. With ∼6500 unique molecules isolated from about 1000 source species, ANPDB represents the most extensive collection of African NPs available at the moment. The platform is built with an array of search fields that can be used on the entire African collection or narrowed down to specific regions, for example, the EANPDB. Some of the search methods include biological activity, compound name, source species, families and authors/reference. Similarity search and substructure search procedures are also implemented on our online platform. The structural similarity search makes use of the Tanimoto coefficient of similarity to measure the 2D similarity between the query molecule and the database entries. This tanimoto coefficient represents a number between 0 and 1; with 1 being the highest and referring to an exact match. The fingerprints used for the structural similarity search are pre‐calculated for all database entries and stored as blob objects in the PostgreSQL‐database. For each query structure, calculations are made during the search. We also provide users of our platform with an option to download the entire content as 2D or 3D SDF files or SMILES. Additionally, there is a help page to guide new users through our platform which also answers technical questions that might arise.</p>
