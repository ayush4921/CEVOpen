<p>Approximately 40 % of the molecules had no PubChem ID (CID). Additionally, &gt;500 of the molecules at the time of isolation and characterization were being reported for the first time. Giving the chance, several other new molecules can still be isolated from some of the less explored plant families (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We observed a total of 70 compound classes, with the major contributors being terpenoids, flavonoids, quinones, alkaloids and phenolics (summing up to &gt;80% of all the molecules currently in EANPDB, Figure
