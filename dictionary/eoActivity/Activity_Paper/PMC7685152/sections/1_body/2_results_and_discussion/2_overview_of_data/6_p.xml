<p>In brief, this opens another corridor of scientific research on NPs from this area, which can be focused on the evaluation of the MOA of isolated NPs from this region, since very little has been done in this regard. Furthermore, PAINS investigation of the molecules present in EANPDB revealed that only 241 molecules (∼13 %) had scaffolds that could be predicted with an endpoint for the presence/manifestation as a PAINS. The list of matching PAINS and the number of scaffolds containing them are summarized in Table SI_1. In a similar way as previously reported by Baell,

 </xref> the majority of the molecules (∼95 %) from our dataset filtered as PAINS were molecules having the catechol(s) or quinone(s) scaffolds/fragments. Based on reports obtained from literature sources, it is confirmed that catechols and quinones can interfere in bioassays via different mechanisms such as metal chelation, redox cycling, redox activity as well as covalent reaction with biological targets and protein reactivity – which has been attributed to some observed toxic effects.
