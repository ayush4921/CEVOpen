  <p>Putative targets of taro-derived components in metabolic pathways. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms can be modulated, mainly, by taro mucilage, arabinogalactan, monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDG) and A-1/B-2 proteins, which may act in conjunction to control glycemia, lipidemia, and downstream effects such as body weight, glucose tolerance, and glycosuria, hepatic function, atherogenesis, and coronary risk. Inhibition of human lanosterol synthase (hOSC) affects the cholesterol synthesis of pancreatic lipase (PL), reducing triacylglyceride hydrolysis to monoglycerides (MG) and free fatty acids (FA), down-regulation of salivary α-amylase, glucose release by α-glucosidase, glucose absorption, reduction of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) formation, and enhancement of muscle glucose uptake. Mucilage can entrap mutagenic/carcinogenic agents, 1,8 dinitropyrene (DNP) and heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (IQ), avoiding their absorption and consequent effects. HMG-CoA—β-Hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A; IDL—intermediate-density lipoprotein.</p>
