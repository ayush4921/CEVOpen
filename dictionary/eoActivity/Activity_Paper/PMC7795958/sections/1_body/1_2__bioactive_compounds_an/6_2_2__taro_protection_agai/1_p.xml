<p>Antimutagens or anticarcinogens can decrease or even prevent the deleterious effects of physical, chemical, and biological agents that cause genome modifications or mutations, triggering the carcinogenesis process when a mutation occurs in somatic cells (

A variety of plant compounds exhibit this ability, including those found in taro such as antioxidant molecules belonging to polyphenol classes or not, dietary fiber, luteoline-derivatives, gallic acid, vitamins (ascorbic acid, b-carotene, and a-tocopherol), anthocyanins, catechins, flavonoids, and others [

Extracellular mechanisms include the inhibition of mutagen uptake, complexation, and/or deactivation, inhibition of endogenous mutagen formation, and favoring the absorption of protective agents. Intracellular mechanisms involve the blocking of reactive species, transmembrane transport modification, metabolism modulation, DNA metabolism and repair modulation, signaling pathway regulation, apoptosis enhancement, genomic stability maintenance, and trapping and detoxification stimulation in non-target cells [
