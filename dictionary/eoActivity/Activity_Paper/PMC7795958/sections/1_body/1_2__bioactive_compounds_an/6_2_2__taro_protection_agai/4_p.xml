<p>Other evidence do not ascribe antimutagenic activity to taro dietary fibers, attributing it to different compounds in taro. A heptane extract from cooked taro prevented the deleterious mutations caused by the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), which is a potent mutagenic and carcinogenic agent formed during meat and fish cooking [
