Flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins are generally associated with the reduction of starch digestion due to the inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities, as mentioned previously. In the end, a reduction in glucose release and absorption can occur, controlling post-meal glycemic levels. Lipid digestion may also be regulated by phenolic compounds through the inhibition of pancreatic lipase, followed by excretion in feces, consequently reducing body mass. Both effects have been demonstrated in clinical trials, being considered adequate for diabetes and obesity control, since they share similar mechanisms of action with many drugs currently in use [
