<p>Taro should be included in the earliest ancient crops in the world, because the first evidence of taro consumption is dated between 28,700 and 20,100 years BP in Salomon Islands, Oceania, where taro starch remains were found in stone tools possibly used to cut raw corms, indicating that taro may have been consumed at Kilu Cave, and probably it was part of the prehistoric diet [

Over time, these populations have identified several health benefits from consuming taro, many of which are empirical observations that were confirmed in animal models and/or in cell lines testing for its effectiveness and no toxicity to healthy tissues. However, to date, there is a scarcity of clinical studies leaving gaps in the translation of the positive health effects identified in preclinical studies to human beings. The better exploitation and understanding of taro bioactivities, following dietary interventions in humans could be helpful in developing new functional compounds.
