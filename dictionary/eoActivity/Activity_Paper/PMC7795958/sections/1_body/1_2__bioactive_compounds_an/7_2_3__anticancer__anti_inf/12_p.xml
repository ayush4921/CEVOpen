<p>Considering that tarin is found in the edible part of 
 <italic>C. esculenta</italic>, the regular intake of this tubercle could be a useful dietary intervention to boost the immune system in healthy individuals or to accelerate the recovery from leukopenia in immunosuppressed patients, including those under chemotherapy. Tarin immunomodulatory potential has been evidenced by the administration of the purified protein (200 Âµg/animal) to cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice, where BM cells were stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into granulocytic cell lineage, promoting a faster recovery from leukopenia. Tarin also protects the BM erythroid progenitors from the cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity [
