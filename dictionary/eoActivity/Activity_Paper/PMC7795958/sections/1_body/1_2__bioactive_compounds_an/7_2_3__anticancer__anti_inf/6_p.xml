<p>This lectin has become a notorious molecule after being extensively studied and fully characterized as an anti-tumoral and immunomodulatory effector [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-00265" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-00265" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,

 <xref rid="B117-ijms-22-00265" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Not surprisingly, glycan microarrays indicate that this protein binds to specific glycan chains that are part of antigens found in many types of cancer cells, such as CA-125 in ovarian cancer, paucimannose in human cancerous cells, Lewis-y epitope, a typical antigen found in the colon, stomach, ovary, breast, pancreas, prostate and lung cancer, hematopoietic progenitor cells, peripheral blood granulocytes, and to the antigen H2, which is found in leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors [

Although binding recognition has not yet been tested in culture cells, these data profoundly reinforce that tarin may contribute to the antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and immunomodulatory responses observed upon taro extract intake as aforementioned and further discussed.
