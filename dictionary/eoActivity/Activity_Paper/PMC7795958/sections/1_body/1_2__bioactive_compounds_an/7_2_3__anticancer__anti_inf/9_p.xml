<p>The selective downregulation of COX-2 by taro lectin seems to be very promising in cancer treatment, since the reduction in PGE2 synthesis attenuates pro-tumorigenesis. Further studies are required in order to understand the molecular mechanisms behind COX-2 regulation by tarin, which can occur in different ways, considering that the COX-2 promotor region harbors multiple binding sites for enhancers, including NF-κB, β-catenin, interleukins, and Hu antigen-R, among others [
