<p>Polyphenols and other antioxidants present in taro, besides acting as common free-radical scavengers, other molecular and enzymatic mechanisms triggered by polyphenols, are considered complementary for health promotion. Few mechanisms of action delineate how polyphenols participate in inflammatory cascades by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Subsequently, inflammation can, for example, activate the NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) transcription factor and stimulate the production of TNF-α, two critical factors that, when upregulated, may participate in cancer development. Thus, polyphenols could aid in controlling cancer progression due to their anti-inflammatory effects, including the activation of antioxidant enzymes, inhibition of pro-oxidant enzymes, and prevention of free radical attacks [
