 <xref rid="ijms-22-00265-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarize the available studies concerning the antioxidant capacity of taro per geographic region, as well as the compounds supposed to be involved in the activity. Most investigations have been carried out in Asia, Oceania, and Africa, where taro plays a vital role as a staple food. However, the restricted distribution of taro-related studies reinforces the claims that taro is still a neglected crop worldwide, even though it displays a rich composition concerning health-influencing compounds (

Nowadays, this number has increased, and more science institutes are carrying research on taro and its potential benefits for human health, although it is still concentrated in under-developed areas and not worldwide, as it should be. In the next section, each traditional claimed health benefit was harbored in the experimental evidence observed in cell cultures or animal models.
