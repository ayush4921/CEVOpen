<p>Concerning personal individualities, endogenous agents may affect cell proliferation mechanisms and genome integrity triggered by biological aging, genetic susceptibility (heritable cancer genes), hormone and growth factor levels, metabolic dysfunctions, chronic inflammatory status, oxidative stress, and compromised immunological competences. Exogenous agents contribute to about 70% risk of cancer development compared to endogenous factors, by causing new mutations, the activation of oncogenes, or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes [

 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is associated with gastric cancer, human papillomavirus (HPV), with cervical, head and neck cancers, and hepatitis virus B and C, with hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutagens/carcinogenic agents comprise environmental physical or chemical agents such as UV radiation, air pollution substances (benzene, radon), and tobacco (containing 69 types of carcinogenic chemicals), which, if avoided, can prevent DNA damage. Many other substances are related to specific work environments (wood dust, nickel compounds), secondhand tobacco smoke, food (aflatoxins), and hormone therapy (estrogens), and they should be avoided or minimized when possible. Other exogenous agents can be grouped in the lifestyle category, including smoking, alcohol, and dietary habits [
