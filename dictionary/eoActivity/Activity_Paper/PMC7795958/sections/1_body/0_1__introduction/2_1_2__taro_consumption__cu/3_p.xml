<p>The most significant taro producers are the West African countries, i.e., Nigeria, Cameroon, and Ghana, followed by China, which contribute respectively 6.7 and 3.9 million tons of taro, corresponding to 83.6% of the worldwide taro production [

Brazil has not yet been internationally recognized as a taro producer country, since less than 1000 ha are planted and dispersed, which is probably due to the vast Brazilian territory, where relevant producers are spread throughout the Mid-South region (

However, Southeast Brazil boasts a germplasm bank, named INCAPER, which is used to collect and conserve taro cultivars, maintaining the diversity and characteristics of the Brazilian varieties, which include T37 (Macaquinho), T38 (Chinês), T39 (Japonês), T40 (Chinês Regional), T41 (Cem em Um), T42 (São Bento), and T43 (Branco) [

For example, in 2018, approximately 12.6 million tons of taro per annum were produced worldwide against 64.7 million tons of potato (

Taro is a healthy alternative of carbohydrate source, as the cooking process does not interfere with their nutritional composition, causing only minimal modifications in nutrient contents, according to Food Data Central from the United States Department Agriculture (USDA) (
