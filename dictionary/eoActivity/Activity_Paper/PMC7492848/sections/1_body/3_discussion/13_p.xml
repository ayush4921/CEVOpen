<p id="p0280">Comparing the anti-inflammatory activities of the herbal formulations with the extracts, the gels exhibited lower inhibitory activity as compared to the extracts. This could be due to poor release from the carbopol base. F1 formulation contained 2% 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> only, while F5 contained 2% 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> only and therefore presented as individual herbal gel formulations. Further, Formulations F2, F3 and F4 contained mixed ratios of the two extracts and therefore presented as polyherbal gels. Polyherbal formulation F3 which had equal proportions of the extracts (50:50) i.e. 1% of each extract combined, exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities on COX-2, IL-10, TNF-α and PGE compared with the other four formulations as presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. Therefore, enhanced inhibitory activities were achieved by these polyherbal formulations. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were observed between the means of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory of the herbal gels F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and the control commercial diclofenac gel.
