<p id="p0095">To carry out the anti-inflammatory assay, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/mL of the 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> extracts were prepared using absolute methanol as the solvent. The positive control solution was prepared by dissolving 50 mg of diclofenac in 10 mL, methanol. The in-vitro anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts and diclofenac were assayed by measuring its inhibition of the enzyme-substrate reactions involving the chemokines; TNF-Î±, Cox-2, IL-10 and PGE-2.
