<p id="p0120">The spreadability of gel formulations was determined by measuring the spreading diameter of 1 g of gel between two horizontal plates (20 × 20 cm) as reported by 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Meera et al. (2010)</xref> with slight modifications. The horizontal plates weighed 125 g each, 1 g of the formulated gel was weighed and kept carefully on the horizontal glass slide. The second glass slide was placed on top of the gel and the time taken for the gel to spread in 1 min was recorded. A measuring rule was used to measure the diameter of the gel and the readings were taken from the three sides of the circle. The mean of the diameters was recorded. This test was repeated for all the formulations in triplicates.
