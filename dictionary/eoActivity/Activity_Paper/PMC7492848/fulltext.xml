Inflammation is the tissue's immunologic response to injury, characterized by mobilization of white blood cells and antibodies, swelling, and fluid accumulation according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Merskey and Bogduk, 1994</xref>). Various cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and mediators such as prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are released which mediate the inflammatory process and tissue damage (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shinwan et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major pain enhancing inflammatory mediator can be induced by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in the process of inflammation. <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">NIH, 2013</xref>, cited pain as the most common reason for access to healthcare systems (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">NIH, 2013</xref>). It has been identified as a major cause of disability and a major influence of healthcare costs. Approximately 76.2 million, one in four Americans, have suffered from pain that lasts longer than 24 h and millions more suffer from acute pain.</p><p id="p0015">The human skin is a barrier between the human body and the external environment. It is a protective organ with three layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Lipids of the cornified layer are important in selective absorption of compounds from the skin surface. Drug absorption occurs through the epidermis and through the skin appendages. The primary route is through the epidermis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boer et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Topical analgesics are pain medications applied to the skin. They work in different ways for different conditions but are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal and some types of neuropathic pain (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kraychete et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Oral analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs are usually prescribed for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and inflammation. These agents often have adverse systemic effects which are sometimes severe. Topical analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs provide the same relief with reduced adverse systemic effects (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brayfield, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Herbal medicines are natural remedies derived from plants. However, they elicit concerted pharmacological intervention of several compounds that interact with multiple targets instead of a single compound that interacts with a single target (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). The medical systems in developing countries involve both traditional herbal systems and orthodox medicine. Due to the poor economy, the people resort to the traditional herbal system for primary health care. Up to 80% of the population use traditional medicine due to cost especially in African and Asian countries (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ekor, 2014</xref>). Another report gave justification for low- and middle-income countries where Physicians are insufficient to meet the health care needs of the country. Traditional Medical Practitioners (TMPs) are considered an important resource for population health (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Oyebode et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). The World Bank data on African development indicators 2018 showed that the statistics of Physicians per 1000 people in Nigeria was 0.381 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">The World Bank Group, 2020</xref>). The resurgence of interest in herbal medicines is backed by several reasons which include the increasingly expensive and unavailability of orthodox drugs to average income earners (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Linus, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Drug formulations of herbals can be with the use of one drug extract or the use of two or more drug extracts. The latter is referred to as polyherbal formulations. Single plants may not attain the desirable therapeutic effects due to the inadequacy of its active phytochemical constituents. However, polyherbals in combined ratios of multiple herbs, may give an enhanced therapeutic effect and decrease the toxicity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Karole et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, adopting lower doses of more than one herb may exhibit improved safety (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benzie and Wachtel-Galor, 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Anti-inflammatory agents derived from natural sources are chosen over orthodox anti-inflammatory agents due to lower risks of side effects (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Juni et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Several plants like <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> (Menispermaceae) and <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> (Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae) have therapeutic properties. These plants are used locally to treat variety of ailments including pain and inflammation. Earlier reports confirmed their anti-inflammatory activities individually (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Onabanjo et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">TrivellatoGrassi et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Calado et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). These reports supported the safety and efficacy claims of Nigerian traditional bone setters who use <italic>C.&#x000a0;dependens</italic> and <italic>C.&#x000a0;ambrosioides</italic> in pain management and fracture healing. <italic>C.&#x000a0;ambrosioides</italic> leaves have been used traditionally in West Africa as flavorings in soup, pounded leaves are applied to sores, or to swellings on the body and to areas of pain (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Okhale et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). The aromatic smell of <italic>C.&#x000a0;ambrosioides</italic> is inhaled for headache. Due to increasing number of people that suffer pain yearly, traditional medical practitioners make use of herbal formulations that are mostly not standardized.</p><p id="p0040">Earlier reports had shown that the extracts and essential oil of <italic>C.&#x000a0;ambrosioides</italic> and its fractions showed cytotoxic potential (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Nowak et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Another report on the toxicity of aqueous extract of <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> leaves, showed that no animals from either acute or sub chronic trial exhibited any signs of toxicity; however, slight hepatotoxic lesions in the rats were produced (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). An earlier report opined that for <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic>, dose corresponding to 120 g wet weight kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> did not produce acute toxicity or lethality in mice, which suggested its safety when taken orally (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Onabanjo et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">The availability and safety of the herbal extracts in the traditional management of pain and inflammation backed up by previous scientific studies necessitated the formulation of topical single and polyherbal gels as investigated in this research.

The viscosity measurements remained in this range since 1% carbopol was used as the base for all the formulations prepared.</p><p id="p0275">Spreadability test results presented in <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;7</xref> with values between 16 &#x000b1; 0.5 and 19 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm which showed that the gels were easily spreadable due the optimum values obtained. Extrudability test results presented in <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;7</xref> showed the gels had good extrudability with values between 917.43 and 1086.95 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0280">Comparing the anti-inflammatory activities of the herbal formulations with the extracts, the gels exhibited lower inhibitory activity as compared to the extracts. This could be due to poor release from the carbopol base. F1 formulation contained 2% <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> only, while F5 contained 2% <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> only and therefore presented as individual herbal gel formulations. Further, Formulations F2, F3 and F4 contained mixed ratios of the two extracts and therefore presented as polyherbal gels. Polyherbal formulation F3 which had equal proportions of the extracts (50:50) i.e. 1% of each extract combined, exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities on COX-2, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1; and PGE compared with the other four formulations as presented in <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;8</xref>. Therefore, enhanced inhibitory activities were achieved by these polyherbal formulations. Significant differences (p &#x0003c; 0.05) were observed between the means of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory of the herbal gels F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and the control commercial diclofenac gel.</p><p id="p0285">These results demonstrate the potentials of the gel formulations from <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> leaves extracts against mediators commonly associated with pain and inflammation. For long term use, it may be preferable to use herbal drugs as a safer alternative treatment for pain relief over nonsteroidal drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0290">This present study demonstrated the effectiveness of carbopol based herbal gels containing methanol extracts of <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> leaves in inhibiting COX-2 enzymes, PGE-2 mediators, IL-10 and TNF &#x003b1; inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the formulated individual and polyherbal gels incorporated with <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> extracts show great promises in the management of pain and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0295">A.T.
