<p>Ethanolic bulb and leaf extracts of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> were tested for their anti-diabetic properties. The glucose uptake of the 3T3 adipocytes was determined as described previously [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Briefly, before the measurement, adipocytes were transferred to low-glucose serum-free media. After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with bulb or leaf ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> for 1 h. For negative control, adipocytes were treated with the vehicle only. Insulin at a concentration of 100 nM was used as a positive control. After the 1-h incubation, the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(
 <italic>N</italic>-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) was added for 30 min. The cells were then rinsed with PBS, and the fluorescence of intracellular 2-NBDG with excitation at 467 nm and emission at 538 nm was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (POLARstar Omega, BMG LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany).
