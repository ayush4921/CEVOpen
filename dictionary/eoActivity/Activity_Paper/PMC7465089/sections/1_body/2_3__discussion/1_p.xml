<p>Taking into account the therapeutic properties of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> known from folk tradition, we expected to discover anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities in 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> extracts. It is important to emphasize here that senescent cells (HPFs and HDFs) are one of the most widely used models for studying inflammatory processes. Accumulation of senescent cells in an organism leads to disruption of tissues and cellular structure and function [
