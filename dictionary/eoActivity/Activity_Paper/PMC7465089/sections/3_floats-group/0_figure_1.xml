  <p>Chemical structures of compounds isolated from 
   <italic>L. candidum</italic>. A computerized GC-MS (GC-6890N) equipped with a mass selective (MS)—5973 network (electron ionization 70 eV) detector from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used. Component recognition was performed by a comparison of the retention time index (RI) of the components to commercial standards and the samples’ mass spectrum with GC-MS libraries: Adams 2001, NIST 98, and QuadLib 1607.
