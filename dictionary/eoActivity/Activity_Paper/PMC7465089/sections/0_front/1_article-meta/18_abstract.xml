  <italic>Lilium candidum</italic> L., known as Madonna, meadow, or white lily, is a bulbous plant from the Liliaceae family, originating in the Middle East. 
  <italic>L. candidum</italic> has been abundantly used in folk medicine since ancient times to relieve a variety of ailments, including age-related diseases, burns, ulcers, and coughs. The aim of this article is to investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities of 
  <italic>L. candidum</italic> extracts and its active phytochemicals. Some active volatile phytochemicals were identified using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) anti-diabetic properties of the extracts kaempferol, linalool, citronellal, and humulene were demonstrated by an elevation in glucose uptake by adipocytes. The significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) effect of the plant extracts kaempferol, citronellal, and humulene on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) was demonstrated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Altogether, 
  <italic>L. candidum</italic> and its rich collection of phytochemicals hold promising medicinal potential, and further investigations of its therapeutic prospects are encouraged.
