<p>Only one plant extract (
 <italic>T. chebula</italic>) was found to be active against enterovirus. EV71 infections can cause mild hand, foot, and mouth disease but also lead (more rarely) to severe fatal neurological complications. The anti-enterovirus activity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> could be due to the presence of hydrolyzable tannin (chebulagic acid), since Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] showed that chebulagic acid treatment reduced the viral cytopathic effect on rhabdomyosarcoma cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Furthermore, in mice challenged with a lethal dose of EV71, treatment with chebulagic acid substantially reduced mouse mortality and relieved clinical symptoms through the inhibition of viral replication. 
 <italic>Dichrocephala integrifolia</italic> root and flower extracts are effective in the control of human herpes simplex virus [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Another study conducted by Ojha et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] isolated (using bioassay-guided purification) luteolin, which was active against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).
