<p>The major limitation while working with crude plant extracts is that they contain complex mixtures of phytoconstituents, which may act individually or synergistically, or sometimes in an antagonistic way, resulting in varying bioactivities. Nevertheless, screening anthelmintic activity of crude extracts will help to find new anthelmintic drug lead compounds, which is a pressing need at present as there are only a limited number of anthelmintic drug classes available, and parasitic diseases have major socioeconomic consequences for humans as well as for livestock. Furthermore, the excessive use of commercially available anthelmintics (benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles/tetrahydropyrimidines, macrocyclic lactones, and amino-acetonitrile derivatives) has led to drug resistance, and these treatments are no longer as effective as they were initially.</p>
