<p>A search for new antiparasitic drugs has been underway over the past several decades. However, despite the abundant literature, more work is needed to yield potent, commercially available drugs based on natural products [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, no anthelmintic activity has been reported previously from 
 <italic>A. tomentosa</italic> and 
 <italic>B. albiflora</italic>; however, insecticidal compounds coumarin, murraxocin, jayantinin, and murralongin have already been isolated from 
 <italic>B. albiflora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Consistent with our study, Takaishi et al. [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] have characterized different isoforms of coumarin from the plant 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> via bioassay-guided purification, and they were found to be active against a phytopathogenic nematode: 
 <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.</italic> Furthermore, in a later study, the same research group has also chemically synthesized different derivatives of coumarin and found 5-ethoxycoumarin having the highest nematicidal activity, which was comparatively harmless against both the brine shrimps, 
 <italic>Artemia Salina,</italic> and the Japanese killifish, 
 <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> [
