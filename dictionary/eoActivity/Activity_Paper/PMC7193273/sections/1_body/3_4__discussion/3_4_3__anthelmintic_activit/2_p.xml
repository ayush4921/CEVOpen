<p>Furthermore, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] investigated the anthelmintic activity from 
 <italic>Paris polyphylla</italic> and found two steroidal saponins: dioscin and polyphyllin D, obtained from its methanolic extract, that exhibited significant activity against 
 <italic>Dactylogyrus intermedius</italic> with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.44 and 0.70 mg/L, respectively. These were more potent than the positive control, mebendazole (EC
