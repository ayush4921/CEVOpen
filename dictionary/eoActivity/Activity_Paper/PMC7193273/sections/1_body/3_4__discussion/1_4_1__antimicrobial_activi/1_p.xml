<p>In the area of infectious disease, of the 141 small molecules approved between 1981 and 2014 as antibacterial agents, 82, or 58%, originated from natural sources [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, there is a huge potential for discovering new compounds with anti-infective properties from natural sources. Some of our findings are corroborated by Tantry et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], who isolated oleanadien-3
 <italic>β</italic>-ethan-3-oate from 
 <italic>Rhododendron</italic> species, and this compound inhibits 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> (MTCC 53) (inhibition zone of 18.6 mm) at a concentration 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL. Similarly, Pradhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] observed an MIC of 78.12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>J. adhatoda</italic> against 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>, in agreement with our findings. In our study, we could not find noteworthy antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>K. pinnata</italic> and 
 <italic>Dichrocephala integrifolia.</italic> In contrast, Tatsimo et al. [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum pinnatum</italic> (synonym 
 <italic>K. pinnata</italic>) on a wide panel of bacteria and yeast and found noteworthy antimicrobial activity in a crude methanolic extract, with MICs ranging from 32 to 512 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Likewise, earlier researchers have shown inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>D. integrifolia</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> in a dose-dependent manner from all crude extracts, mostly in nonpolar solvents except ethanol [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Several factors may explain these discrepancies: differences in the plant part or variety, soil or climate, collection or postharvest treatment, extraction procedure, etc. Furthermore, in our study, we only found moderate activity of 
 <italic>Clerodendrum serratum</italic> against 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> (MIC of 882 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). A large number chemical constituents (∼283 compounds) have been reported from the genus 
 <italic>Clerodendrum</italic> (monoterpenes and derivatives, sesquiterpenes, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, phenylethanoid glycosides, steroids and steroid glycosides, cyclohexylethanoids, anthraquinones, and cyanogenic glycosides), showing a multitude of biological activities [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Arokiyaraj and colleagues measured the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Clerodendrum siphonanthus</italic> against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis, S. typhi, S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and observed inhibition zones of 30, 16, 16, 12, 11.5, and 10 mm, respectively [
