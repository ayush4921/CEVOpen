<p>Amongst our 18 plants, the family Asteraceae is represented the most, with three plants. Despite the discovery of numerous secondary metabolites in Asteraceae, this family has received little attention in ethnopharmacological research, resulting in few systematic explorations and few commercialized products [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. However, in the present study, one Asteraceae plant: 
 <italic>Cirsium wallichii,</italic> did not show antimicrobial property against any tested microbe when we fix our cutoff at 50% inhibition. In addition, two other plants do not show antimicrobial activity: 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic> (Crassulaceae) and 
 <italic>Phragmites vallatoria</italic> (Poaceae).
