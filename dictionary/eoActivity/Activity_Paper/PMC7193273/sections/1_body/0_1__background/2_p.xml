<p>Asia represents one of the important centers of knowledge about plant species for the treatment of various ailments. Within this region, Nepal is rich in (medicinal) plant biodiversity, and linking this with the indigenous knowledge on medicinal and aromatic plants provides an attractive approach for the development of novel (e.g., anti-infective) drugs. “Medicinal plants have a long tradition, but ethnopharmacology as a well-defined field of research has a relatively short history, dating back about 50 years only” [

Ethnopharmacological selection combined with testing on a range of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) is a more efficient way of identifying new bioactive molecules than testing randomly selected plants. Therefore, we tested the antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic activities of 18 medicinal plants of Nepal, selected based on ethnobotanical evidence for their use in infectious disease.
