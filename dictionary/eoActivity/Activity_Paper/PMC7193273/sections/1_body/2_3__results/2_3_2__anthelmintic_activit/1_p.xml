<p>We already reported the antiprotozoal activities of crude extracts of select medicinal plants of Nepal and found three active species: 
 <italic>Phragmites vallatoria</italic>, 
 <italic>Ampelocissus tomentosa</italic> (for which no antiprotozoal activity had been reported previously), and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, nonselective antileishmanial activity was shown for 
 <italic>P. polyphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pinnata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Encouraged by these findings, and also by the traditional use of the plants as anthelmintics [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], we tested the effects of these plant extracts on the motility of the L4 stage of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>elegans.</italic> We used this nonparasitic free-living nematode and model organism to test anthelmintic activity due to its low cost and easy availability of mutant and transgenic strains for functional genomics and proteomics studies as well as to investigate key signaling events and drug interactions and its amenability to laboratory culture methods. Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is taxonomically closely related to the suborder Strongylida, which comprises several economically important animal parasites, such as 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and 
 <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis,</italic> that cause both human and animal disease [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Drug screening in the natural hosts for every helminthic disease is almost impossible and a costly process. So, based on the hypothesis that plant extracts affecting 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> may also have effects on other (including parasitic) nematodes, we screened our plant extracts on the surrogate parasitic nematode 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To monitor worm viability, we used the WMicrotracker, a device that monitors the movement of helminths in real time using infrared light beams. The advantage of using the WMicrotracker over other methods is that it enables screening of a large number of compounds in a fully automated way that is easy, fast, label-free, and highly reproducible. Interestingly, four plants were found to be active out of 18 plants tested: 
 <italic>A. tomentosa, B. albiflora, K. pinnata</italic>, 
 <italic>and D. integrifolia.</italic> These four plants significantly reduced 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> motility, comparable to the positive control (&gt;50%)

 <bold>)</bold>. Moreover, plants such as 
 <italic>B. diffusa, P. polyphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> showed moderate inhibition using the WMicrotracker, but under the microscope, these extracts showed clear paralytic activity. The average inhibition was lower; however, very good activity was seen during the last four hours of WMicrotracker movement recordings, revealing that many extracts appear to have a slow onset of action.
