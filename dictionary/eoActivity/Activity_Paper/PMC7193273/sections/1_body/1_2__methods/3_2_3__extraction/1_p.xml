<p>The collected plant materials were washed thoroughly with tap water and shade-dried at ambient temperature. Dried samples were ground to a powder with an electric blender and subjected to Soxhlet extraction using polar solvents (ethanol and methanol). The extracts were evaporated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure till a solid mass was obtained. All the extracts were kept in sealed vials, labelled with appropriate code, and transported by airmail from Nepal to the KU Leuven, Belgium, for integrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screening. The dried extracts were kept at 4Â°C until analysis.
