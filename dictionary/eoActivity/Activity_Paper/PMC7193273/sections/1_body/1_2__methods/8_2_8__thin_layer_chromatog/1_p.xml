<p>Phytochemical analysis by means of TLC was carried out for all crude extracts, as previously described by Panda et al. [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The TLC plate (dimensions 2.5 × 7.5 cm, coated with silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Germany) was developed with methanol : dichloromethane (95 : 5, v/v) at ambient temperature (approximately 20°C) and dried in an oven at 90°C for 5 minutes to evaporate the solvent. The plate was visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light at 254 and 360 nm. Later, the same plate was used for visualization of the spots by spraying with 5% sulphuric acid in ethanol, followed by heating at 100°C for 5 minutes. Phytochemicals were tentatively identified by comparison of Rf values and spot colours with literature data.
