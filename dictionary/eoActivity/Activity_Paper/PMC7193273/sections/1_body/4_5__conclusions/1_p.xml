<p>The purpose of the current study was to investigate the antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelminthic activity of select medicinal plants of Nepal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic report on the use of plants selected based on ethnobotanical surveys (information gathered from local healers or already available in the literature) and their testing for different anti-infective bioactivities. Further work will be needed to identify the bioactive compounds from the active extracts, as well as their drug target or mode of action.</p>
