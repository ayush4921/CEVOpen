<p>Our sample was more active than the water fraction of an ethanolic extract of pomegranate peel tested by Sakivin and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, at the same concentration (100 Î¼g/mL), the ethanolic extract inhibited the enzyme by 27.9% compared to 44.2% in the case of our studied aqueous extract. However, further work is needed to identify the molecule(s) responsible for this activity.
