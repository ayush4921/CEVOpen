<p>Meanwhile, functional foods are potential sources of compounds that can prevent and/or treat many diseases, such as neurodegenerative, by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Few previous studies have reported the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of pomegranate peel extracts, even if their healthy and antioxidant proprieties are well-documented [

In our study, the LEP extract showed a good activity compared to positive control. In fact, the extract, at concentration of 250 µg/mL, inhibited at 99.0% the enzyme and galanthamine reached maximum activity (inhibition of 94.2%) at the highest concentration of 10 μg/mL.
