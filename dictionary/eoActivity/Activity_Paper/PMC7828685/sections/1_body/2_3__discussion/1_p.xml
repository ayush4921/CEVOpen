<p>The antimicrobial activity of the LEP extract confirmed the previous results [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], showing the antibacterial effects of different pomegranate peel extracts against other pathogenic bacteria such as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> both in vitro and 
 <italic>in situ</italic>. Orak and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] studied the antibacterial activity of pomegranate peel extracts against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> and the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic>, showing that all tested extracts showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activities against all tested bacterial and fungal strains. In addition, food-borne diseases caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> have been inhibited effectively by pomegranate peel methanolic extracts [
