<p>The bactericidal activity was evaluated by the disc diffusion method [

 <italic>B. megaterium</italic> and 
 <italic>C. michiganensis</italic>. All tested bacteria were conserved in the collection of School of Agricultural, Forestry, Food and Environmental Sciences (SAFE) and re-activated on nutrient agar media at 30 ± 2 °C. Briefly, twenty µL of suspension were inoculated at the two following concentrations (10 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL), and the plates were incubated at 30 ± 2 °C for 48 h. Tetracycline and kanamycin were used as positive controls (C+ve) at 160 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively. The diameter of inhibition zone was measured. Then, the antibacterial activity was expressed as the growth inhibition percentage using the following Equation (1) [
