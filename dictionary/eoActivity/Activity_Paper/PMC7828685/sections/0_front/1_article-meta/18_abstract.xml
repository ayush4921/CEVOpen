 <p>Pomegranate (
  <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L.) fruits are important sources of vitamins and minerals and widely used in the dietary supplement industry. An aqueous extract of its leathery exocarp (LEP) was obtained by a solid-phase micro-extraction method. The antifungal activity was examined against the phytopathogenic fungi, 
  <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
  <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic>, 
  <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> and 
  <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, and the antibacterial activity was evaluated against 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Xanthomonas campestris,</italic>
  <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> and 
  <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic>. The antimicrobial assays showed, in some cases, a promising antimicrobial effect compared to the synthetic drugs. The possible anti-acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant activities of the LEP extract were investigated by the Ellmanâ€™s assay and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test, respectively, and their results showed that the LEP extract has an effective anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect and an antioxidant activity. Thus, the LEP extract could be valid as a candidate for further studies on the use of pomegranate in neurodegenerative diseases as a food preservative and a suitable substitute to control several phytopathogens.
