<p>TNF-α is a well-characterized, proinflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in host defense and the inflammatory response. TNF-α has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, we also examined the effects of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> on the activation of macrophage in vivo. Oleanolic acid aglycon and compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were administered orally using an oral gavage technique for 4 days before macrophage activation in vivo with LPS (

 <bold>1</bold> or 
 <bold>2</bold> in saline (1% Tween 20) before LPS injection (i.p.) to cause sepsis, the levels of TNF-α in the blood were diminished markedly relative to those of TNF-α in the blood of sham-treated mice. In contrast, the treatment with oleanolic acid aglycon caused no significant decrease.
