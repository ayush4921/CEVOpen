 <bold>2</bold>, and oleanolic acid aglycon, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with serially diluted concentrations of individual molecules for 3 days and examined the numbers of cells in the culture by an MTT assay. The results showed that none of the molecules exerted noticeable cytotoxicity even at 20 μM (
