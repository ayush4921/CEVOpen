<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator for the inflammatory response and pathogenesis. We examined the inhibitory activities of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> for the activation of macrophage RAW 264.7, leading to the production of NO. When RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 24 h with either compound 
 <bold>1</bold> or 
 <bold>2</bold> before incubation with LPS, the levels of NO produced by those cells decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The extent of inhibition caused by 
 <bold>2</bold> was noticeably higher than that caused by 
 <bold>1</bold> and oleanolic acid aglycon at the same concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03699-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The difference in the extent of inhibition caused by 
 <bold>1</bold> and oleanolic acid aglycon was marginal, if at all.
