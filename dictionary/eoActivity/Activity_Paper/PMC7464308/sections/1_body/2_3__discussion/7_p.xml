<p>Considering that traditional oriental medicines are generally prepared by simmering medicinal herbs in water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and administered orally, it is likely that saponins play more important roles than their aglycons in the actions of traditional oriental medicines. It is possible that the pharmacological properties of the sapogenin core may change depending on the composition and arrangement of the sugar moieties to be attached. Thus, further research is warranted to understand the structure-activity relationship between the sugar moieties in saponins and their pharmacological properties, particularly in vivo. Our study suggests that oleanane triterpene saponins from
