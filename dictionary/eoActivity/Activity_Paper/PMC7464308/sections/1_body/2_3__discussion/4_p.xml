<p>It is well accepted that saponins have superior pharmacological activities relating to their aglycon [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In line with this notion, compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed a somewhat more potent inhibition of the activation of the RAW 264.7 cell line in vitro than oleanolic acid aglycon. The difference in the extent of the inhibition by 
 <bold>2</bold> and oleanolic acid aglycon seemed more conspicuous at the higher concentrations (i.e., 3.3 and 10 Î¼M) than at lower concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03699-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, however, the difference was, at most, about 15%. These results indicate that oleanolic acid aglycon can fully exert immunomodulatory activities and that the sugar constituents may have only some additive effect.
