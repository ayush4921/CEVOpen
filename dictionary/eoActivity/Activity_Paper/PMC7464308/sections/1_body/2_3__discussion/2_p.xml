<p>Previous studies demonstrated that the extract of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> leaves has an anti-inflammatory effect through suppression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A phytochemical investigation of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> led to the isolation of two compounds, 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-[
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→2)-
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinopyranosyl] oleanolic acid-28-
 <italic>O</italic>-[
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl] ester (
 <bold>1</bold>) and 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinopyranosyl oleanolic acid-28-
 <italic>O</italic>-[
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl] ester (
 <bold>2</bold>). Their structures were determined by the analysis of their spectroscopic data, IR, NMR, ESI-MS and chemical reaction. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of their compounds were first time reportedly. The potential anti-inflammatory effects of isolated compounds were also reported by the in vitro and in vivo study. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) in triterpenoid saponins may be deduced from anti-inflammatory effects. Consideration of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these triterpenoid saponins suggested that the presence of the sugar units at C-3 and/or C-28 of the aglycon might play an important role in the anti-inflammatory inhibitory activity of these compounds. Thus, in this study, the preliminary comparison anti-inflammatory activity of these saponins with their aglycon was also discussed.
