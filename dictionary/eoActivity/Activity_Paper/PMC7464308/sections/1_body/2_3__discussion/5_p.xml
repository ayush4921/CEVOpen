<p>Given the results from the in vitro assay, it was rather surprising that the in vivo assay results indicated that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> exerted much stronger macrophage activation inhibition than oleanolic acid aglycon. The difference between the in vitro and in vivo assay results is not readily reconciled. However, it is postulated that the poor solubility of oleanolic acid aglycon in aqueous solution may be responsible for the poor pharmacological activities shown in the in vivo assay. It is known that the addition of sugar moieties to a triterpene compound increases its solubility. As the molecules were given orally during the in vivo assays, it is conceivable that the poor aqueous solubility of oleanolic acid aglycon resulted in poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
