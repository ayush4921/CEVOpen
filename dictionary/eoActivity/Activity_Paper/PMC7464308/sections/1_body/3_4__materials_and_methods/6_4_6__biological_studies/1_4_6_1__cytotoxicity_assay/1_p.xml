<p>RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cell cytotoxicity was evaluated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells suspended in DMEM medium (10% FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were seeded onto a 96-well culture plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/100 μL. The next day, 100 µL of the fresh medium was supplemented to the culture, and then 2 µL of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, oleanolic acid and dexamethasone in DMSO were added to the culture at 20 μM, 5 μM, 1.25 μM, 0.32 μM and 0.08 μM, respectively. Three days (72 h) after culture with the compound at 37 °C, MTT assays were performed as described previously. The assays were run in triplicate.
