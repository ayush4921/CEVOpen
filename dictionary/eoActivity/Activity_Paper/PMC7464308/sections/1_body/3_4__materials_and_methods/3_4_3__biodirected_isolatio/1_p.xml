<p>The dried leaves of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> (2.0 kg) were extracted with 95% aqueous EtOH (10 L Ã— 3 times) under reflux condition. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave the EtOH extract (700 g). The EtOH extract was suspended in H
 <sub>2</sub>O and successively separated with dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) to yield the CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> extract (300 g), EtOAc extract (210 g) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O layer, respectively. Low-range polarity fraction (DCM and EtOAc extracts, notably contained chlorophyll, essential oil and fatty substances). Furthermore, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O fraction showed potent NO inhibitory activity, which was greater than that in the presence of the EtOH extract. Thus, this H
 <sub>2</sub>O fraction of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> leaves was chosen for subsequent study.
