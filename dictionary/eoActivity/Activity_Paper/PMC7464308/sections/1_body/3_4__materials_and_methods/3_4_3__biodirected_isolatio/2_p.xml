<p>The H
 <sub>2</sub>O layer was separated using a Diaion HP-20 column and was eluted with a gradient solvent mixture of MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O (from 25:75 to 50:50, 75:25 and pure MeOH, stepwise) to yield four fractions (W-1 to W-4, respectively), based on the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. The fraction W-4 showed stronger NO inhibitory activity than the fractions W-1-W-3. Thus, fraction W-4 was chosen as the focus for active compound isolation. Fraction W-4 was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC), eluting with the gradient solvent system of CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0â€“100% of MeOH, stepwise) to obtain eight fractions (W-4.1 through W-4.8). Fraction W-4.2 was separated by YMC RP-18 CC with acetone/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1.5/1.
