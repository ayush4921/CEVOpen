  <p>Inhibition of the activation of the RAW 264.7 cell line by the active compounds 
   <bold>1</bold> (Comp. 
   <bold>1</bold>) and 
   <bold>2</bold> (Comp. 
   <bold>2</bold>), in vitro. Cells were treated with different concentrations of compounds 
   <bold>1</bold>â€“
   <bold>2</bold>, oleanolic acid (
   <bold>O.A.</bold>) and dexamethasone (
   <bold>DEX</bold>), separately. Nitrite oxide concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined using a Griess reagent assay. Dexamethasone was used as the positive control.
