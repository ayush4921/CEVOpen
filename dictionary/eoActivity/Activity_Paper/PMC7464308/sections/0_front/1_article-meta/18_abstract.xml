  <italic>Stauntonia hexaphylla</italic> (Lardizabalaceae) has been used as a traditional herbal medicine in Korea and China for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. As part of a bioprospecting program aimed at the discovery of new bioactive compounds from Korean medicinal plants, a phytochemical study of 
  <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> leaves was carried out leading to isolation of two oleanane-type triterpene saponins, 3-
  <italic>O</italic>-[
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→2)-
  <italic>α</italic>-
  <sc>l</sc>-arabinopyranosyl] oleanolic acid-28-
  <italic>O</italic>-[
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl] ester (
  <bold>1</bold>) and 3-
  <italic>O</italic>-
  <italic>α</italic>-
  <sc>l</sc>-arabinopyranosyl oleanolic acid-28-
  <italic>O</italic>-[
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl] ester (
  <bold>2</bold>). Their structures were established unambiguously by spectroscopic methods such as one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopies, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and chemical reactions. Their anti-inflammatory activities were examined for the first time with an animal model for the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response as well as a cell-based assay using an established macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) in vitro. Together, it was concluded that the saponin constituents, when they were orally administered, exerted much more potent activities in vivo than their sapogenin core even though both the saponins and the sapogenin molecule inhibited the RAW 264.7 cell activation comparably well in vitro. These results imply that saponins from 
  <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> leaves have a definite advantage in the development of oral medications for the control of inflammatory responses.
