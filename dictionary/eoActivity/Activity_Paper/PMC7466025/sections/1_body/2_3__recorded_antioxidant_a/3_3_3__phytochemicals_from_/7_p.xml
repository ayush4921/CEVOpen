<p>In summary, a variety of pure compounds that may account for the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>Echium</italic> have been isolated. Apart from polyphenols, the presence of naphthoquinones might also play an important part in the antioxidant capacities of plant extracts. However, these classes of compounds have been rarely characterised in the 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species. No specific compounds elucidated from the classes of saponins and unsaturated terpenoids have been investigated thus far. The literature to date identifies that there is extensive future work to be carried out in the isolation and characterisation of biologically active phytochemicals from 
 <italic>Echium</italic> spp. This future work will undoubtedly link the past ethnomedicinal use to new phytochemical classes of biological significance.
