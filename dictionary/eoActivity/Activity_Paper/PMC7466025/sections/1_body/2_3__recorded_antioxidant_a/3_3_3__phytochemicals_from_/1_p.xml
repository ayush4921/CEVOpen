 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00722-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarises to date the bioactive phytochemicals that have antioxidant capacity identified from 
 <italic>Echium</italic> spp. (refer to 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-00722">Figure S1</xref> for chemical structures). Research on 
 <italic>Echium</italic> phytochemistry so far has revealed the existence of phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, lignans, and naphthoquinones isolated from the aerial plant, shoots, and roots of the plant. These types of compounds could certainly account for the promising antioxidant activity found in some of the traditional preparations, as documented in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-antioxidants-09-00722">Section 2</xref>. One of the most bioactive classes of compounds that are responsible for antioxidative properties is phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These secondary metabolites contain one or more hydroxylated aromatic rings commonly occurring in plants and include compound families, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, lignans, and quinones. Structurally, the number of hydroxyl moieties bonded to the ring systems, and where they are located, is related to the antioxidative effect [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This is due to the hydrogen donating properties of phenols subsequently quenching free radical-induced lipid peroxidation and enhancing the ability to scavenge free radicals [

 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Hence, there has been increased research interest in phenolic compounds, as they are effective in treating pathological conditions and diseases related to oxidative stress.
