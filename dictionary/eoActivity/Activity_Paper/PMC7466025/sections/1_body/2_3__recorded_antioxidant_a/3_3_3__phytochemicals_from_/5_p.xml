<p>Another identified class of compounds that have shown significant antioxidant capacity is naphthoquinones, represented by shikonin and its derivatives. Papageorgiou et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] has comprehensively reviewed shikonin and its enantiomer alkannin from the historical aspect as well as its chemical and pharmacological properties. Furthermore, Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] has reported on the cellular mechanistic activity of these compounds. Shikonin and its esterified derivatives were mainly found in the bright red root periderm of several 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B81-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,

 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], which correlates well with the reddish ointment used as folk medicine. It has also been shown that shikonin derivatives are present within the callus culture of 
 <italic>E. italicum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. plantagineum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B85-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-00722">Figure S1</xref>). Dur√°n et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>E. gaditanum</italic> contained the highest concentration of 3,3-dimethylacrylshikonin, interestingly independent of their collection locations. As for 
 <italic>E. plantagineum</italic>, the compounds with the highest concentrations within the extracts were found to be 3,3-dimethylacrylshikonin and acetylshikonin [
 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In another study, Weston et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed higher concentrations of naphthoquinones were present in the lower geo-elevations than those isolated from plants that are collected from cooler and higher elevations. The colour of the extracts may be indicative of their contents, with bright red colours attributed to higher levels of shikonin, deoxyshikonin, and acetylshikonin [
