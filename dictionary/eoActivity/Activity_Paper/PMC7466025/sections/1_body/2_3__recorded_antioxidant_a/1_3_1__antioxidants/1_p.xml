 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> is one of the most studied species in the genus for antioxidant activity. Asghari et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that a decoction and hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> showed more promising antioxidant activity than those extracted with methanol alone. This was evaluated by an OH radical assay, α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and the ferric reducing power assays, which are all common assays for determining total antioxidative potential, measuring parameters, such as free radical scavenging outcomes. Furthermore, the hydroalcoholic extracts showed the highest radical scavenging effects (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 110.8 μg/mL) in OH radical assays. The highest DPPH and ABST results were shown from the decoction extract with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 22.8 μg/mL and 17.1 μg/mL, respectively [
