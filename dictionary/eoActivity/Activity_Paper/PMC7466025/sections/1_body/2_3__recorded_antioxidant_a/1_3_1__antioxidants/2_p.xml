<p>Shirin Adel Pilerood and Jamuna Prakash [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported in their study that a water extract of 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> showed the highest antioxidant properties in a DPPH assay, whereas the acetone extracts showed the least activity. Petals of this species exhibited higher total phenolic content (TPC) (1540 mg/100 g), total flavonoid content (TFC) (4.54 ± 0.042 mg), and tannin content (2.47 ± 0.064 mg) when extracted by hot water. Overall, the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> could explain many of the biologically significant outcomes as recorded in the ethnomedicinal record. Moreover, this tradition of using tea (particularly in Iran) as a vehicle could be clinically significant, as water-based formulations are biologically applicable compared to organic solvents as formulations. However, it is always important to remember that water stable and soluble phytochemicals are not always bioavailable [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and therefore hot water extracted phytochemicals from 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> require further pharmacological investigation.
