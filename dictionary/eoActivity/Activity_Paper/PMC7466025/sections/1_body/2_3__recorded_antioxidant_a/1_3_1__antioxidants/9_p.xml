<p>In general, assays, such as DPPH, ABTS, and the ferric reducing power assay (FRAP), were conducted to evaluate the antioxidant capacity for extracts of numerous 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species. Plants were subjected to different solvent (hydroalcoholic, aqueous, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, hexane) to obtain extracts. Hydroalcoholic extracts commonly showed the highest antioxidant activity in all investigations, whilst ethyl acetate showed the least. It was also seen that in general the root extracts of the genus showed higher antioxidant activities than other parts of the plant. The results showed this antioxidant capacity might be due to the presence of phenolic compounds. This high level of phenolic compounds could be the result of using hydroalcoholic solutions as an extraction solvent and indicates that the roots of the plants contain the highest concentrations of phenols and other chemicals associated with antioxidant properties. Among all the 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species, 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> is the most studied, with the percolation extraction technique consistently obtaining the highest antioxidant activities.
