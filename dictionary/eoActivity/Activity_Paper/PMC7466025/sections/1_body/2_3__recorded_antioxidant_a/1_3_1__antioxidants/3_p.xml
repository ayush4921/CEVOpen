<p>Importantly, many reports exist regarding the evaluation of antioxidant activity for species in the genus, not recorded in the English ethnomedicinal literature. The antioxidant activity of hydromethanolic root extracts of 
 <italic>E. pycnanthum</italic> (a subspecies of 
 <italic>E. humile</italic> Desf.) collected in southern Algeria was reported on by Chaouche et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The results obtained using DPPH, iron-reducing power, ABST, iron chelation, and β-carotene assays showed a high flavonoid content of 16.26 ± 1.4 mg of CE/g DW. 
 <italic>E. sericeum (E. creticum),</italic> a species found in Egypt, also exhibited antioxidant effects in a DPPH assay [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This was speculated to, likewise, be due to the presence of the flavonoids in the extract. 
 <italic>E. rauwolfii</italic> was found to have the highest scavenging activity at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.3 μg when extracted with butanol, whilst the ethyl acetate extract presented the weakest activity at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 432.3 μg [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Sarra Kefi et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] indicated that the ethyl acetate extracts of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. arenarium</italic> grown in Tunisia were characterised by a high antioxidant activity with the highest TPC compared to those obtained from hydroethanolic, aqueous, and cyclohexane extracts. These extracts consequently showed the best DPPH inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.1 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.94 μg/mL).
