<p>Methodology: Regarding the methods used in obtaining the literature to be reviewed, time of publication was not an exclusion criterion. One exclusion criterion existed when choosing literature to review. That was, all reports had to be published in the English language. The authors accept that this may limit some literature from more “traditional sources”, particularly from uses around the native regions for 
 <italic>Echium</italic> spp. However, all reports searchable under the keywords, including MESH terms in common databases, such as Embase and Medline, were included without alteration. Therefore, this review is an accurate representation of the current therapeutic knowledge for the use of 
 <italic>Echium</italic> spp.
