 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> was higher than in other parts of the plant and the peels showed a strong ferrous ion-chelating capacity, although they did not have a high polyphenol content, DPPH, or ABTS radical scavenging activities [

In addition to being very rich in water, the pulp has a high concentration of mineral salts, including potassium salts, and is low in sodium salts. Moreover, two important compounds have been identified in Kiwano, rutin and lutein, with pharmacologically activities which are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, capillary protective, and blood platelet aggregation inhibitory [
