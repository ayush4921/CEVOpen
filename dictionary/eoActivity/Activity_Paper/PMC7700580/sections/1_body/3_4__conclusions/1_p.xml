<p>In this paper, we present the first comparative study of four juices from Romanian Cucurbitaceae varieties, performing HPLC quantification of major components together with evaluation of their different antioxidant and iron binding activities. The synergistic/antagonistic effect of the juice mixture was also studied. The most abundant compounds shown by HPLC analysis were the two triterpenes, oleanolic and ursolic acids, as well as catechin, epicatechin with the exception of 
 <italic>Benincasa hispida</italic> which is rich in gallic acid. One of the highest total antioxidant capacities was obtained for 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> juice but a synergistic effect was obtained for 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>cucumerina</italic> mixed juice. It is already known that the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids offers plants antioxidant potential and our results highlight this property. These results suggest that a synergistic antioxidant effect can be achieved by accumulating the combined effects of all antioxidant compounds. Our results will help avoid unwanted side effects due to higher amounts of juice consumed from a single variety of fruit, and therefore, play an important role for helping to treat various diseases. The studies on the properties of combined juices also suggest that for further analysis, it will be crucial to select the species that may be of further importance in the study of biological activity synergism.
