 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05468-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the total phenolics content (TPC) of the tested samples, determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method. The TPC of 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> was found at a good concentration, expressed as 18.97 ± 1.25 mg GAE/mL sample. In comparison, the content of TPC was found in smaller amounts of 10.32 ± 1.06 mg GAE/mL in 
 <italic>B. hispida</italic> and 10.253 ± 0.56 mg GAE/mL in 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> samples. Moreover, a higher level of TPC expressed as 27.64 ± 1.89 mg GAE/mL sample was found in the 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> juice variety. These results may be due to phenolic compounds such as gallic acid, 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ferulic acid.
