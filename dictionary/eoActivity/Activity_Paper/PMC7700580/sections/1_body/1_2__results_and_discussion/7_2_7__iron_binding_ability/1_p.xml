<p>Iron ions catalyze many processes that lead to the appearance of free radicals and their accumulation in the body can lead to various abnormalities. Therefore, the iron (II) chelating activity of fruit juices could be of great therapeutic significance in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s diseases, Thalassemia and other anemias [

This assay indicates that some bioactive compounds from our juices may have the ability to chelate transition metal ions which could be connected to the type of functional groups from their structure. In our study, the iron chelating abilities of four Cucurbitaceae juices were compared to that of a known strong iron chelator, Na
