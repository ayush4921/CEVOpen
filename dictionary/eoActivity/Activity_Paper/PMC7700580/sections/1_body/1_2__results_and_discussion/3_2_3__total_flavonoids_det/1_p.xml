<p>The found flavonoid contents ranged from 26.82 ± 1.49 µg/mL of quercetin equivalent in the 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> variety to as low as 8.20 ± 0.3 µg/mL in the 
 <italic>B. hispida</italic> variety (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05468-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the total flavonoid content of the 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> sample was comparable (23.13 ± 1.33) to that of the 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> sample (22.01 ± 1.29). These results may be due to the content of flavonoid compounds such as catechin hydrate, (−)-epicatechin, phloretin, phloridzin, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol derivatives, and procyanidines.
