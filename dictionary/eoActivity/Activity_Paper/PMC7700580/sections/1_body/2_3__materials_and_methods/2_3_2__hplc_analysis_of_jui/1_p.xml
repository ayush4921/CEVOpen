<p>High-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array (HPLC-DAD) studies were performed using a Hewlett-Packard HP-1090 Series II (Palo Alto, CA, USA), equipped with a vacuum degasser, a binary pump, an autosampler and a model 1046A HP photodiode array detector (DAD) and a mass spectrometer detector Trap SL (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Synergi Polar-RP C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 4 µm) analytical column from Phenomenex (Chesire, UK). The column was preceded by a security cartridge. The mobile phase for HPLC-DAD analyses was a mixture of water with 0.1% formic acid (

 <italic>v</italic>), flowing at 1 mL/min in gradient conditions: 0–15 min, 20% B; 15–45 min, 100% B; 45–60 min, 20% B. The column temperature was set at 30 °C and the injection volume was 10 µL [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Injection of 1–50 mg/L standard solutions at five different concentrations (i.e., 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/L) into the HPLC/DAD system was done to construct the calibration curves of the analyzed compounds. The correlation coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) of all the calibration curves was greater than 0.99, displaying the good linearity of the method. The quantification of the different analytes was carried out using the single calibration curve of the seventeen analytes [
