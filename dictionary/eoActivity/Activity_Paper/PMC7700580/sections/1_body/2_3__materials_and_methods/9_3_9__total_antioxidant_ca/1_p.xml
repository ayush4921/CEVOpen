<p>This assay is based on the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) and subsequent formation of a green Mo (V)-complex at acidic pH levels [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For total antioxidant capacity assay, 0.1 mL test sample was mixed in Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, and 4 mM ammonium molybdate). Then, they were incubated at 95 Â°C for 90 min. After the mixture had cooled to room temperature, the absorbance of each solution was measured at 695 nm. Total antioxidant capacity is reported as equivalents of ascorbic acid. All the experiments were done in triplicate.
