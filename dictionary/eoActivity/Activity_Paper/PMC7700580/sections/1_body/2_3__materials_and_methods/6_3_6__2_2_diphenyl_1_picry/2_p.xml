<p>The DPPH inhibition percentage, which relates to the antioxidant activity of quercetin and the juices, was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula>% inhibition of DPPH radical = (1 − A
  <sub>s</sub>/A
  <sub>c</sub>) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the sample.
