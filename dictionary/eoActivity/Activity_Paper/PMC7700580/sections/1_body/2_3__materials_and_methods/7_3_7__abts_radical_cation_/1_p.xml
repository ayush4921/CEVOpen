<p>2,2-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation scavenging was determined as previously described in the literature [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with slight modifications. The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution was prepared and then stored for 16 h in dark conditions at room temperature. The solution was diluted with absolute ethanol until the absorbance at 734 nm was 0.700 ± 0.02, and then it was used as the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> reagent. The absorbance of the final reacting solution was measured at 734 nm in a 96-well plate. An amount of 100 µL fresh juice of the four Cucurbitaceae species with 100 µl of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> reagent was mixed and stored for 30, 60 and 90 min. The final results were expressed by means of using a Trolox calibration curve (calibration curve from different concentrations: 50–0.25 µM). All the experiments were done in triplicate.
