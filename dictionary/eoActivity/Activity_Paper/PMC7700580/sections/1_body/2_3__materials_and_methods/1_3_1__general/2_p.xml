<p>Fruits of each selected species, i.e., 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> ”Brâncuși” variety
 <italic>, Cucumis metuliferus</italic> ”Tempus” variety
 <italic>, Benincasa hispida</italic> ”Zefir” variety, and 
 <italic>Trichosanthes cucumerina</italic> ”Felix” variety, acclimatized in Buzau, Muntenia region, Romania (Southeastern Europe), were obtained at eating ripeness from the Vegetable Research and Development Station (SCDL), Buzau, Romania. The fruits for our research were harvested between 2018 and 2020. The selected species were acclimatized using, as initial material, the seeds of endemic plants from Tibet, Nepal, the Kalahari Desert and China (Hubei University) between 1996 and 2019. The four species involved in the study were grown in a cold greenhouse (without technological heating). The greenhouse was divided into four plots, each species benefiting from a culture space with an area of 500 m
 <sup>2</sup>. All species benefited from the same crop establishment scheme, with 120 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants per row. For all species, the culture was established in a palisade system, the plants being supported with the help of the strings at the base and directed in the form of a snail to the supporting wires located at a height of 2 m. The care work was general, specific to cucurbits and consisted of water supply when needed, mechanical and manual weeding to control weeds and loosen the soil. After completing the acclimatization stage, the species were subjected to intensive breeding works, obtaining genotypes with distinct phenotypic expressiveness, of which the four varieties were registered in the Official Catalog of Cultivated Plants in Romania.
