<p>The total polyphenol content determination was completed using an adapted microspectrophotometric laboratory method [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] based on Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The absorbance was recorded at 760 nm by a 96-well plate analysis with a multiplate reader (Tecan Pro 200, Tecan Trading AG, Männedorf, Switzerland). Freshly prepared gallic acid solutions of known concentrations (0.97–500 µg/mL) were used to prepare the standard curve. Briefly, 10 µL of fresh juice from each test sample and 25 µL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were mixed and stored at room temperature for 5 min. The next step was the addition of 25 µL of a 20% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution and 140 µL of ultrapure water and stored for another 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was recorded at 760 nm and the results are expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent/100 mL fresh juice (mg GAE/mL fresh juice). For each sample, a blank was prepared by replacing the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with ultrapure water [
