 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Quercetin was used as a reference standard (40–0.078 µg/mL). An amount of 100 µL test sample was stored at room temperature for 15 min with 100 µL of a 2% aqueous solution of aluminum chloride and the absorbance was recorded at 415 nm. All the experiments were done in triplicate.
