<p>As reported earlier in the per-protocol set, between days 1 and 38, 238 patients (83.5%) in the BNO 1045 group and 272 patients (89.8%) in the FT group received no additional antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At a 15% noninferiority margin, BNO 1045 was noninferior to FT in treating uUTIs (nonantibiotic rate difference: −6.26%; 95% CI, −11.99 to −0.53%; 2-sided p=0.0014). Adverse event rates were similar between the groups. The rate of gastrointestinal disorders was higher in the FT group (22 cases in the FT group versus 13 in the BNO 1045 group) and there were 5 cases (4 of mild and 1 of moderate intensity) of pyelonephritis in the BNO 1045 group compared with 1 case (mild intensity) in the FT group. More than 95% of the patients in both treatment groups (full analysis set) did not take paracetamol within 24 hours of any the trial visits, with no significant difference between the groups (p&gt;0.05).
