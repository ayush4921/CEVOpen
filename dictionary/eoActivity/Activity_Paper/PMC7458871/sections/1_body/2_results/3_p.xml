<p>The current analysis was performed with data from patients of the full analysis set, who were treated with the investigational medicinal product at least once and were not potentially unblinded, consisting of 325 patients treated with BNO 1045 and 332 patients treated with FT (total, 657; Germany, 112; Poland, 129; Ukraine, 416) [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The mean sum-scores (SD) of the ACSS-typical domain in the full analysis set were comparable between groups on day 1 (BNO 1045: 10.2±2.17; FT: 10.1±2.19), and substantially decreased at day 4 (BNO 1045: 5.1±2.81; FT: 4.5±2.91), and by the end of treatment (BNO 1045: 2.1±2.06; FT: 2.1±2.33) and the end of follow-up (BNO 1045: 0.8±1.28; FT: 0.9±1.71) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the distributions of the sum-scores of the typical domain between the two treatment groups illustrated as boxplots. Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test comparison of mean ACSS-typical sum-scores between the groups indicated that the decrease was slightly higher in the FT group at day 4 (p=0.0166) but comparable at the end of treatment and at the end of the follow-up periods (p&gt;0.05). Therefore, it was considered justified to validate the ACSS as a patient-reported outcome measure to analyze the combined ACSS data of both groups (BNO 1045 and FT) together at the follow-up visits.
