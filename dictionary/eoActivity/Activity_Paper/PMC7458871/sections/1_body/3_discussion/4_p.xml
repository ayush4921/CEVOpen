<p>The overall results of the three systems (ACSS, FDA, EMA) were fairly comparable if “clinical cure” was defined such that none of the symptoms reported by the patient had to be present at a severity degree of more than mild (lowest severity category), which corresponds to the thresholds of C (ACSS), G (adapted FDA), and H (adapted EMA) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted; however, that the so-called typical symptoms mentioned in the FDA (4 symptoms) and EMA (3 symptoms) guidelines are unfortunately not obliged to be used by such a scoring system. In our opinion, this becomes necessary if a nonantibiotic approach is included in such a clinical study. Accordingly, therefore, clinical criteria such as patient-reported outcomes need to be considered as a primary endpoint. To achieve complete elimination of all symptoms does not seem realistic, because as discussed earlier, these symptoms may be typical for AC but are not found exclusively in female patients with AC. Besides symptom severity, the patient could also be asked about symptoms of discomfort (bothersomeness) and impact on daily and social activities (QoL domain), as is considered necessary for the patient-reported outcome measure by Holm et al [

Unfortunately, we could not test the overall clinical assessments proposed in the guidelines of the FDA and EMA [
