  <title>Purpose</title>
  <p>The Acute Cystitis Symptom Score (ACSS) used in a clinical trial comparing the phytodrug Canephron®N (BNO 1045) with an antibacterial agent (fosfomycin trometamol [FT]) in the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis (AC) in women was evaluated as a patient-reported outcome measure in a 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis.

  <title>Materials and Methods</title>
  <p>This double-blind, randomized, multicenter, phase III noninferiority trial was performed in 51 centers in Europe. The ACSS questionnaire was used to assess severity and course of symptoms.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis included 325 patients treated with BNO 1045 and 332 patients treated with FT (total of 657 patients). The mean sum-scores of the ACSS-typical domain were comparable between groups on day 1 (BNO 1045: 10.2; FT: 10.1), and then decreased on day 4 (BNO 1045: 5.1; FT: 4.5), at end of treatment on day 8 (BNO 1045: 2.1; FT: 2.1), and at late follow-up on day 38 (BNO 1045: 0.8; FT: 0.9). Predefined thresholds using the scoring system of the ACSS could be established and validated to define “clinical cure.”

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Evaluating not only antibacterial but also nonantibacterial agents indicated for the treatment of AC in women, clinical criteria for diagnostics, and measures of patient-reported outcomes are more important as main objectives than microbiological criteria. In this 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> evaluation, we showed that the ACSS questionnaire, validated in several languages, has the potential to be used as a suitable instrument for diagnostics and patient-reported outcomes in well-designed, international, clinical studies investigating different treatment modalities of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
