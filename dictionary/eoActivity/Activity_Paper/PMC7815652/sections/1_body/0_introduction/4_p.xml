<p id="p0040">Natural plant products have a narrow target range with specific mode of action, therefore are suitable for a specific target, mostly nontoxic for antagonistic microorganisms, show limited field persistence and have a shorter shelf life and no residual threats. They are generally safe to humans and environment in comparison to conventional synthetic chemical pesticides. They can easily be adopted by farmers in developing countries who traditionally use plant extracts for the treatment of human diseases [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Botanical derivatives are environmentally safe and may be used as an alternative to commercial fungicides for controlling pathogenic fungi [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, biocides of plant origin are nonphytotoxic, systemic and easily biodegradable [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is now known that various natural plant products can reduce populations of foliar pathogens and control the disease development, and then these plant extracts have a potential as environmentally safe alternatives and as components in integrated pest management. Hence present research study based on evaluation of antifungal efficacy of crude and partially purified faction of extract prepared from
