<p id="p0055">Effect of extract on a variety of morphological and cytological parameters of test pathogen was studied. Test fungi were treated with rising concentrations from 1.25 mg/ml to 10 mg/ml of the extract up till MIC. A small fungal biomass containing mycelium, vesicle and conidia/spores were separated from each tube and microscopic assessment was made after staining with cotton blue and mounting in lacto-phenol. Alteration in mycelium width, conidia size morphology were recorded with the help of Olympus trinocular research microscope BX- 51 and analyzed by Image analysis software Olysia Bioreport 3.2 of Olympus. Conidia counting were done by haemocytometer.</p>
