<p id="p0130">10 gm of dried and partially purified alcohol fraction of 
 <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic> leaf was dissolved in the mobile phase i.e. 5 ml n-Hexane and 5 ml Ethyl Acetate and this solution were subjected to column chromatography. Glass column (Merck: 100–200 mm) filled with 650 gm of silica gel was used for column chromatography. According to the colour band developed in column different fractions of extract containing various secondary metabolites were collected. All fractions obtained from column were dried in rotary vacuum evaporator under reduced pressure. These fractions were screened for their antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. solani</italic>. The fraction showing best antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. solani</italic> was subjected to further purification and characterization for active molecule via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis [
