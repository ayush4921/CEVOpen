<p id="p0095">Flavonoids are frequently found in plants as glycosides. Structurally, one or more of phenolic hydroxyl groups are combined with sugar residues. Alkaline reagent test is employed to identify flavonoids. Standard test for detection is, mixing of aqueous NaOH with a small quantity of extract.
