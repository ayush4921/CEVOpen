<p id="p0145">Among the partially purified fractions obtained, maximum mycelial growth inhibition of 74.38% was observed with partially purified alcohol fraction of 
 <italic>T. peruviana</italic> leaf extract. The inhibitory effect of leaf extract of 
 <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic> on morphology and reproduction of test fungi are depicted in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, B. There was normal growth pattern i.e. abundant mycelial growth and sporulation of 
 <italic>A. solani</italic> in control tube. Sequential decrease in conidial size and raise in mycelial width was observed with the increase in concentration of leaf extract. 
 <italic>A. solani</italic> also showed decreased sporulation with rising concentrations of the extract. Average mycelium width in control was 1.35 μm, which increased up to 5.40 μm at 1.25 mg/ml 74.57% reduction in conidial size was observed at 1.25 mg/ml concentration.
