<p id="p0190">Active fraction with best inhibitory activity was incorporated to TLC and subsequently into column fractionation and GC-MS analysis to determine active ingredients present in extract. TLC is an analytical procedure employed in this case first to identify precise secondary metabolites extracts, and second to separate the components of these metabolites. Calculating the front ratio (Rf) or retention factor of a compound; ratio of the migration distance of substance on the migration distance of solvent-front, showed significant diversity of compounds separated from the different researched secondary metabolites. Prepared chromatograms have revealed the existence of numerous types of tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, quinones, carotenoids, saponins, alkaloids and terpenes relative to phytochemicals colouring reactions in various organs of the plants tested.</p>
