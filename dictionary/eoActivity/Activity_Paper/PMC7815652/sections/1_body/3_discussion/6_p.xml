<p id="p0185">The medicinal plants are rich in secondary metabolites, a diverse group of chemicals, which include alkaloids, glycosides, amines, insecticides, steroids, flavonoids, and related metabolites, which have been extensively used in drug and pharmaceutical industry [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Flavonoids, tannins and phenolic acids belong to phenolic compound group of secondary metabolites. Phenolic compounds have been shown to exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In terms of antimicrobial properties, not the quantity of phenolic compounds and flavonoids is often important but the type of substances present in each extract [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Each fraction of plant extract prepared by successive extraction carries a specific set of secondary metabolites because solubility of secondary metabolites differs with different solvent. Qualitative phytochemical tests are used to detect phyto-constituents present in individual fraction. Several workers have studied phytochemical properties of plant extracts by qualitative phytochemical tests [
