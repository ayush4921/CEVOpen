<p id="p0175">Results suggested that in the presence of leaf extract of 
 <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic>, reduction in conidial dimension and raise in mycelia width of 
 <italic>A. solani</italic> was recorded. The manner of antifungal activity of leaf extract of 
 <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic> might be mainly due to cell wall attack and withdrawal of cytoplasm in the hyphae and eventually death of the mycelium [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Such modifications induced by the exposure to plant extract components may interfere with enzymatic reactions of wall synthesis and affect fungal morphogenesis and development.
