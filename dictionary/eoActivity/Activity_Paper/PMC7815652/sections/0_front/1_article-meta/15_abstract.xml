  <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, a plant pathogenic fungus causes significant economical losses of potato crop. The disease is controlled primarily through some traditional methods and most commonly via the application of chemical fungicides. Fungicides treatment is not protected as chemicals pollute environment, effect health vulnerability in humans and when these harmful chemicals enter into the food chain become hazardous to all living entities. Recent efforts have focused on developing environmentally safe, long-lasting, and effective biocontrol methods for the management of plant diseases. Present research focus on screening of crude and partially purified leaf extract of 
  <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic> for the presence of antifungal efficacy against 
  <italic>Alternarai solani</italic>. It was observed that 100% alcoholic crude and alcoholic fraction of partially purified extract showed maximum inhibitory activity which is due to the presence of different secondary metabolites, revealed by phytochemical screening. Active column fraction (possess best antifungal activity against 
  <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GS-MS) analysis. On the basis of peaks matching of GC-MS chromatogram with available data base showed the presence of benzoic acid and oxo-benzoate in active fraction of 
  <italic>Thevetia peruviana</italic> leaf extract which is already known chemical among the phytochemicals described for antimicrobial activity. Further research on development of herbal formulation from the same would be very helpful environment friendly approach to manage concern crop disease.
