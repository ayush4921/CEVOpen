<p>The majority of drugs that are currently in use are derivatives of secondary plant metabolites identified from crude extracts. Secondary metabolites have multiple non-essential, but regulatory roles for the plants. The presence of these secondary metabolites is responsible for the therapeutic effectiveness of most medicinal plants.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Secondary metabolites are classified into different phytochemical groups based on their physical and chemical characteristics.
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Among the range of these phytochemical groups’ alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins (steroidal sapogenins), polyphenolics, and glycosides (spirostanol and furostanol) with a range of pharmacological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities, were identified and characterized in the agave genus.
