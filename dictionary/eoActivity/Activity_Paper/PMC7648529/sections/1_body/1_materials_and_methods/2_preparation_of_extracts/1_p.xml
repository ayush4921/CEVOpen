<p>An 80% methanolic extract of 100 g leaf powder made by maceration for 48 h, which was performed five times with continuous stirring, filtration using filter paper, and a combination of the five portions. The final extract was then concentrated under reduced pressure in a rota vapor at 40 °C, and further dried for 48 h in an oven at 40 °C to produce dry powder, packed in a vial, and kept in a desiccator containing silica until the in vitro experiments were performed. Similarly, 100 g of 
 <italic>A. americana</italic> leaf powder was used to produce petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, and methanol fractions by sequential injection of the solvents into the extraction section of the Soxhlet apparatus. Concentration, oven drying (24 h), packaging, and storage were performed for the four extracts, similar to the crude extract described above.
