<p>A serialized swab was then used to streak a sample of each inoculum of the standard bacteria taken from the liquid broth into nonselective agar plates to assure formation of uniform growth throughout incubation. A sterile cork borer was then used to form bores of 10mm size on the nutrient agar plates and 100 μL of the test extracts or 0.1 mg mL gentamycin solution (positive control) was applied to fill bores using a micropipette. All the plates containing the test extract and the control drug were then kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 h. Finally, the measurement of the diameter of zones of inhibition was performed for each plate after 24 h incubation at 37°C.
