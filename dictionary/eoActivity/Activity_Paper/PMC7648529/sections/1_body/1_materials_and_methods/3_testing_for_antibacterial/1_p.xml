<p>Standard strains of one gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and three gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa)</italic> were used for antibacterial effect determination. The antibacterial activities of the crude and solvent fraction extracts of 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> were determined using the agar well diffusion method. The cultures of all the standard strains were grown in 5% sheep red blood agar plates at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Four to five colonies of all bacteria were then transferred to TSY liquid broth with a sterilized inoculating loop. The liquid medium containing the colonies of the standard bacteria was then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C until it achieved a turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard.
