<p>Subsequently, ARTP mutation has been successfully applied to improve the polysaccharide production of edible fungi. Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] mutated a 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> strain by ARTP and found that the mycelia yield increased by 25.03% and its polysaccharide content increased by 44.66%. Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that the structural characteristics of polysaccharide from the mutant 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> strain were significantly different from original strain and the in vitro immune activity was enhanced. In our previous studies, a new 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> strain A130 with high polysaccharide content was bred through ARTP mutagenesis after screening and a genetic stability test, which showed a productivity increase of polysaccharides and a total productivity of biomass compared with those of the original strain SH1. What are the differences between the polysaccharides produced by this new 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> strain A130 and the original one in the structure and activity and how does ARTP affect the production of polysaccharides need to be further investigated. The chemical composition, molecular mass and chain conformation of polysaccharides are essential for the study of their bioactivities. It is a rather comprehensive task to reveal the changes in physicochemical properties and biological effects of high-polysaccharide-yield strain A130 after mutation. Therefore, in this study, the physicochemical properties and immunological activities of 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> polysaccharides between A130 and SH1 are systematically compared and the change of conformation of polysaccharides is studied by high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) chromatography combined with laser light scattering and viscometry. The study attempts to unravel the interaction relationship between structure and activity, which enables further exploration of the mechanism of high polysaccharide productivities by ARTP.
