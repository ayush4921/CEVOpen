<p>The infrared spectra of six polysaccharide fractions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The characteristic IR absorption of polysaccharide at 3438 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (O-H), 2958cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H), 1644 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (H-O-H bending), 1156 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O), and 1076 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O-C) were exhibited in all samples. The IR absorptions of A130-20 and SH1-20 at 1540 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to the secondary -CONH- group in the protein, indicating that there were proteins bonded to the polysaccharides in 20% ethanol-precipitated polysaccharide fractions. SH1-20 showed characteristic absorption of an α-D-glucan IR at 850 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, while SH1-20 showed clear IR absorption at 930 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, revealing the existence of β-D-glucan. The IR spectra of A130-50 and SH1-50 are almost identical to each other, indicating that they have the similar chemical structure, and that they are mainly different in molecular weight. Furthermore, the samples SH1-50 and A130-50 showed peaks at 1720 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (COO-), indicating the presence of glucuronic acid, which was consistent with the result obtained by HPAEC determination. A130-70 and SH1-70 showed similar IR absorption and characteristic absorptions of polysaccharide, the weak bands at 2958 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were ascribed to C-H stretching, while the bands at 1416 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were attributed to the C-H bending vibrations. The results of IR spectra showed ARTP mutation did not change the spectral characteristics of the
