<p>An analysis of conformation plots according to molecular mass and root mean square (RMS) radius could give more structure information of polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The distributions of molar mass and rms radius are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b respectively. A130-20 showed larger molar mass but smaller rms radius than SH1-20 at the same elution time, which indicated A130-20 was more tightly structured compared with SH1-20. The RMS conformation plot provided relations between rms radius and molar mass [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To further elucidate the structure differences between A130-20 and SH1-20, conformation plots were detected and calculated by Astra 6.1 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f003">Figure 3</xref>c. The sever oscillation curve in RMS conformation plot of A130-20 indicates a relatively expanded branched chain such as Î±-D-glucan [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which was in accordance with its tight structure. It is generally accepted that the slopes of conformation plots for sphere-like polysaccharides in thermodynamically solvents are &lt;0.3. The conformation plot slopes of A130-20 and SH1-20 were 0 and 0.06, respectively, indicating both A130-20 and SH1-20 were solid sphere-like structure. However, the slopes of A130-20 was smaller than that of SH1-20, which provide additional evidence of branching after mutation.
