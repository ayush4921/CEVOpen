 <italic>Mn</italic>), root mean square radius (rms radius) and intrinsic viscosity [η] values by HPSEC–MALLS and viscometry measurements combined with laser light scattering photometry and a differential refractive index detector were listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03693-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A130-20 exhibited two polysaccharide peaks, while SH1-20 showed only one single peak. The molecular weight (Mw) of A130-20 (peak1) attained to 1.588 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> Da and Mw of peak2 was about 8.045 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Da which was very close to that of SH1-20 7.839 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Da. This indicated that Peak1 of A130-20 was the new polysaccharide fraction induced by ARTP mutagenesis and characterized by a large molecular weight. The HPSEC chromatogram of A130-50 was similar to that of SH1-50, and two peaks which appear closest to each other were identified. The weight-average molecular weights of A130-50 and SH1-50 ranged from 3.520 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 1.336 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Da, 1.875 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 1.326 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Da, respectively. There was no significant difference in HPSEC chromatograms of A130-70 and SH1-70, which showed a narrow peak with low molecular weight of 2.506 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 2.325 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> Da, respectively.
