<p>A130-50 and SH1-50 had similar monosaccharide composition, which were composed of galactose, glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid with similar composition ratios of nearly 0.2:2:1:0.1. In addition, monosaccharide compositions of mannose and glucose were 3.4:1 and 2.1:1 in SH1-70 and A130-70 respectively. The results showed that the monosaccharide composition in 20% ethanol-precipitated polysaccharide fractions were greatly changed after ATRP mutation, while there was little change in 50 and 70% ethanol-precipitated polysaccharide fractions. The results revealed that high-energy active particles from ARTP significantly affected the chemical components and the structural characteristics of polysaccharides in mycelia, especially for the polysaccharide fractions precipitated by 20% ethanol.</p>
