<p>Six polysaccharide fractions were isolated by grade EtOH precipitation and the monosaccharide components of their hydrolyzates were analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), and the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03693-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, together with polysaccharide content and yields of the polysaccharide fractions. The results indicated that glucose was the predominant monosaccharide in 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> polysaccharide. The polysaccharide fractions SH1-20 and A130-20 consisted mainly of glucose and mannose, with ratios 7.3:1.0 and 15.0:1.0, respectively. The ratio of glucose in A130-20 was double of that in SH1-20, which indicated that ARTP mutagenesis increased the proportion of glucose in polysaccharides, and the anabolic pathways of polysaccharides in the mutant strain were changed. Owing to ARTP mutagenesis, the yields of mutant polysaccharide fractions A130-20, A130-50 and A130-70 were significantly higher than the original one by 1.5-, 1.3- and 1.2-fold. The polysaccharide content of A130-20, A130-50 and A130-70 from the mutated strain improved by 23, 14, and 11% compared with original strain SH1, as shown in
