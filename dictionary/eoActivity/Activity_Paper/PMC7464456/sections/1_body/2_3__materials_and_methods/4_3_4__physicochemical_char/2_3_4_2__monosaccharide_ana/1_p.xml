<p>High-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to determine the monosaccharide composition of six different polysaccharide fractions according to the literature with little modification [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. 2 mg samples were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 4 h with 3 mL 2 moL/L trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in a vial container. The hydrolysate was heated and evaporated with methanol by N
 <sub>2</sub> blowing to completely remove TFA. Then the hydrolysates were dissolved by deionized water and filtered. 25 μL hydrolyzed sample was injected into HPAEC equipped with a CarboPac™PA20 column (Thermo, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The samples were eluted with mobile phase at 30 °C, and separate by monosaccharide standards [
