<p>High performance size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light scattering (HPSEC-MALLS) is often used to determine distributions of molecular weight, size and composition independent of column calibration by reference standards [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].The measurements were conducted on eight-angle laser photometer (Wyatt Technology Co., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped with TSK-GEL G6000 and G4000 PWXL column in 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution at 38 °C. A differential refractive index detector (RI-2414, Waters, Milford, MI, USA), and ultraviolet detector (UV-2487, Waters, Milford, MI, USA) were simultaneously connected. Meanwhile, an online differential viscometer (ViscoStar™II, Wyatt Technology Co., Goleta, CA, USA) was used to determine the intrinsic viscosity of polysaccharides [

Huggins and Kraemer plots were used to estimate the intrinsic viscosity [η]. ASTRA 6.1 software (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was utilized for the data acquisition and analysis [
