 <p id="Par1">DNA barcoding is currently an effective and widely used tool that enables rapid and accurate identification of plant species. The 
  <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> is the second largest family of flowering plants, with more than 700 genera and 20,000 species distributed nearly worldwide. The accurate identification of 
  <italic>Orchids</italic> not only contributes to the safe utilization of these plants, but also it is essential to the protection and utilization of germplasm resources. In this study, the DNA barcoding of 4 chloroplast genes (
  <italic>matK, rbcL, ndhF</italic> and 
  <italic>ycf1</italic>) were used to provide theoretical basis for species identification, germplasm conservation and innovative utilization of 
  <italic>orchids</italic>. By comparing the nucleotide replacement saturation of the single or combined sequences among the 4 genes, we found that these sequences reached a saturation state and were suitable for phylogenetic relationship analysis. The phylogenetic analyses based on genetic distance indicated that 
  <italic>ndhF</italic> and 
  <italic>ycf1</italic> sequences were competent to identification at genus and species level of 
  <italic>orchids</italic> in a single gene. In the combined sequences, 
  <italic>matK</italic> + 
  <italic>ycf1</italic> and 
  <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
  <italic>ycf1</italic> were qualified for identification at the genera and species levels, suggesting the potential roles of 
  <italic>ndhF, ycf1</italic>, 
  <italic>matK</italic> + 
  <italic>ycf1</italic> and 
  <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
  <italic>ycf1</italic> as candidate barcodes for 
  <italic>orchids</italic>. Based on the SNP sites, candidate genes were used to obtain the specific barcode of 
  <italic>orchid</italic> plant species and generated the corresponding DNA QR code ID card that could be immediately recognized by electronic devices. This study provides innovative research methods for efficient species identification of 
  <italic>orchids</italic>. The standardized and accurate barcode information of 
  <italic>Orchids</italic> is provided for researchers. It lays the foundation for the conservation, evaluation, innovative utilization and protection of 
  <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> germplasm resources.
