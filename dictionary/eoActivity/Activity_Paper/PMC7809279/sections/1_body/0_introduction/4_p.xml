 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>

 <italic>orchid</italic> family based on two plastid genes 
 <italic>matK</italic> or

 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>

 <italic>atpF</italic>-

 <italic>matK</italic> gene, 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> gene, 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene, 
 <italic>rpoC1</italic> gene,

 <italic>matK</italic> as a plant barcode based on the evaluation of recoverability, sequence quality and species identification level
 <sup>

 <italic>matK</italic> +

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
