<p id="Par19">On the basis of phylogenetic relationship, the Barcoding Gap and the Best Close Match with the genetic distance in evaluating candidate barcode identification capability in 
 <italic>Orchid</italic>, the phylogenetic analyses showed that the identification ability of 
 <italic>matK</italic> and 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> was low on the genus level. The possible reason was that there were more species in this study, which made the species in the related genus unable to form branches alone. The sequences of 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> were suitable for identification of genus and species of 
 <italic>Orchids</italic>, and the combined sequences 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> and 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> were qualified at the genera and species levels. The Barcoding Gap test indicated that these candidate genes all contained Barcoding Gap, and the variation between species and within species had clear boundaries. The test results of Best Close Match revealed that the all combined sequences exhibited high genus identification rate, which was suitable for the identification of orchids at the level of genus and species.
