<p id="Par20">Based on the SNP sites, the species level specific DNA barcodes of 
 <italic>Orchid</italic> were successfully developed. Combinatorial sequences were able to develop more species-specific barcodes than chloroplast genes, which might be the result of combination sequences could provide more mutation sites and SNP sites. There were some differences in the specificities of different combination genes in 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> plants. Compared with 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>, the combined sequences of 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> could be developed more specific barcodes, which might be related to the species identification accuracy of 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> in 
 <italic>Orchids.</italic>
