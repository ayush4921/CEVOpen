<p id="Par17">The results of sequences analyses on average GC content showed that the GC content of candidate sequences of 
 <italic>Orchids</italic> was far less than AT content, while significantly less than the GC content of about 50% in common angiosperms. Of sequence variation situation analysis, the candidate gene mutations exist base insert and missing phenomenon. We performed the analysis of the genetic diversity by the DnasP 5.0 software. The higher haploid type diversity and relatively low haploid type diversity of nucleotide diversity demonstrated that the candidate sequences had certain polymorphisms.
