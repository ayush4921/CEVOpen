<p id="Par12">Like the neutrality testes of the Tajima test statistic (D value) in the sequences, the genetic variation for 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> sequences was negatively little higher (− 2.37565) with respect to 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence, consisting value up to − 0.51015. And for combined sequences, the genetic variation for 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequences was negatively little higher (− 2.13392) with respect to 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence, consisting value up to − 1.75132. With respect to Fu’s 
 <italic>Fs</italic> value for sequences variation, the 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> sequences was higher sequences variation (− 2.96843), shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, in comparison with 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> sequence (− 0.51015). In order to observe nucleotide mismatch distribution among different sequences of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> species, DNA sequences were analyzed for population size changes which was enriched the results of genetic diversity among species. All results showed significant genetic variation in 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> species for candidate nucleotide sequences (Fig.
