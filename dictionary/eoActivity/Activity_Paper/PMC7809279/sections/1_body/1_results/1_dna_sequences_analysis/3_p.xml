<p id="Par9">The overall mean nucleotide base frequencies observed for candidate nucleotide sequences and the distribution of the four bases of candidate nucleotide sequences at different coding positions of codons were showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The average number of identical pairs (ii) for candidate nucleotide sequences was showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The account of transitional pairs (si) and transversional pairs (sv) of nucleotide sequences was showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The transitional and transversional of bases in the sequences may be related to the species difference.
