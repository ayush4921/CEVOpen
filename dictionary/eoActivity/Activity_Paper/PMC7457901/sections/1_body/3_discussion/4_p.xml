<p id="Par21">In conclusion, supercritical extracts of plants were used to inhibit dengue virus. The inhibition profile of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> plant extracts for dengue-2 showed significant anti-dengue activity. The GCâ€“MS identified natural compounds may be responsible for their inhibitory activity against dengue-2. At a result of molecular docking and in vitro study demonstrated that the 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> plant extract machanism of action is to cease the dengue replication (NS1). As anti-dengue activity is associated with 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> further research is required. Plant extracts and its derivatives have the potential to develop newer anti-dengue drugs with unique drug targets.
