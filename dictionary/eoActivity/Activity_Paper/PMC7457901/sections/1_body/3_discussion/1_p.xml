<p id="Par18">The viral outbreaks like Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg virus, SARS- CoV, MERS-CoV, Nipah, Zika virus, Rift Valley fever virus and now COVID-19 are some evidence of our disaster. Nipah virus, Zika virus, and COVID-19 outbreaks in India are a few episodes [

There are no commercial anti-viral drugs available in the market against it. Medicinal plants or their derivatives are of a crucial therapeutic aid for various diseases [

Drugs such as morphine, quinine, quinidine, aspirin, colchicines, digoxin, artemisinin, taxol, tubocurarine, ephedrine, vincristine, and vinblastine have been derived from several medicinal plants are used in the treatment of the different type of diseases. Therefore, research on medicinal plant extracts and their bioactive compounds which could be safer and cheaper than synthetic drugs is gaining importance. Many other studies have demonstrated the value of medicinal plants against dengue serotypes [
