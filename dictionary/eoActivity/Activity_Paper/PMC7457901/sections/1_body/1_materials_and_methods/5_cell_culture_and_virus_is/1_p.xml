<p id="Par7">The Aedes cell line C6/36 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-1660 TM) was maintained at 28 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator with the help of minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mML-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A total of 500 µl of an appropriate dilution of dengue-2 standard strain was inoculated onto confluent C6/36 cells in 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> tissue culture flask and then incubated at 28 °C incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 45 min, the virus growth media was added and the cells were further incubated. Even after proper incubation, no cytopathic effect or no plaque formation takes place. Then, flasks stored in the deep freeze and the lysates were harvested and viral RNA was extracted by using a commercial QIAmp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The viral titer of the dengue-2 virus was determined in cell culture lysate by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (ABI-7500 Real-time) along with known standards of dengue, which contains 10
 <sup>1</sup>–10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/ml (S1–S5) provided by Geno-Sen’s Dengue 1–4 commercial kit. A calibration curve was plotted with positive control. The 100 copies/ml of dengue-2 viruses were determined form the lysate, for further anti-viral experiments in the present study.
