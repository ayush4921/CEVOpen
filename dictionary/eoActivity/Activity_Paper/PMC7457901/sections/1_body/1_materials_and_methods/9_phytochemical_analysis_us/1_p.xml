<p id="Par11">Phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> SFE extract was carried out using GC–MS analyser (BRUKER SCION 436-GCSQ). Helium (99.9%) was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min in split mode. The RESTEK Rtx
 <sup>®</sup>-5(cross bond
 <sup>®</sup> 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane) column of suitable dimensions was used. The extract was dissolved in methanol solvent (HPLC grade) and filtered through Whatman filter paper 0.22 μm. 1μL of the plant sample was injected into the column with an inlet temperature of 280 °C. The conditions were initially programmed at temperature 72 °C hold for 2.5 min and then further amplified at a rate of 10 °C per minute until reached up to 320 °C; hold for 1 min. Total running time was 23.7 min including 3 min solvent delay. The mass spectrum of compounds present in the extract was obtained by electron ionization at 70 eV and the detector operates in scan mode 30 to 500 Da atomic units. The ionization spectra were matched with the NIST (National Institute of Standards Technology) library to identify the compounds along with their area and percentage of the total.
