 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extract was prepared by using Supercritical Fluid Extraction Machine (Applied Separation Inc. U.S.). Ten grams of the plant powder was loaded into the stainless steel extraction cell of the machine. The CO
 <sub>2</sub> used as a solvent in SFE. The flow rate was maintained at 1.6 ml/min with static-dynamic mode (1 h static and 30 min dynamic mode). The method of extraction of the plant was standardized and optimized at 40 °C temperature and 150 bar pressure. The obtained SFE extract was lyophilized, weighed and stored at 4 °C for further use.
