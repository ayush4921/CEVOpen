<p id="Par6">The maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> supercritical fluid extracts was determined on 90% confluent C6/36 cells. Approximate, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were seeded into 96-well flat bottom plate (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and the USA) and incubated at 28 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator overnight. After 90% confluency of C6/36 cells, the medium was removed and the cells were treated with a serial dilution of different concentrations (ranging from 1000 µg/ml to 15.62 µg/ml) of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> supercritical fluid extracts in triplicates. In the negative control, 100 µl of the growth medium was used. After incubation of 96 h, the medium of each well was replaced with 10 μl of MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromidesalt solution (5 mg/1 ml in PBS, as stock) and again incubated for 3 h at 28 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. MTT solution was discarded without disturbing the cells and 100 μl of DMSO was added into each well to stop the reaction. The 96 wells plate was continuously shaken until all formazan crystals dissolved. Cell viability was determined with the help of absorbance values obtained by using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at 595 nm.
