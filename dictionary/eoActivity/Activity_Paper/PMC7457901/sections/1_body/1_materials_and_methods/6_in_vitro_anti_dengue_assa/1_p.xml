<p id="Par8">The anti-viral assay was initiated by incubating 96 wells plate having a monolayer of C6/36 cells. The simultaneous mode of treatment was carried out to perform the anti-viral assay. The 100 µl of viral suspension of DENV-2 (100 copies/wells) was treated with an equal volume of the non-toxic dose (31.25 µg/ml) of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> plant extract was inoculated in 96 well plates. The plate setup included a cell control, a virus control (cells with back titration of 10, 100 and 1000 copies of dengue-2 virus) and cell viability control (cell with MNTD of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extracts) as well as experimental well (cell with 100 copies of the dengue-2 virus treated by MNTD of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extracts) in 96 replica plate. After that, the plate was sealed with parafilm and incubated on ice for 45 min and shaken gently after every 10 min. The mixture from each well of the replica plate was transferred into respective wells of the experimental plate without disturbing the C6/36 cells layer of experimental plate. After inoculation, the experimental plate was sealed with parafilm and incubates for 45 min at 28 °C in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The medium was aspirated from the experimental plate wells. Then, the virus growth medium (VGM) was added without disturbing the cells layer in all wells (including cell control wells). The experiments were carried out in triplicates. Further, the 96-well plate was incubated at 28 °C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 7 days. After proper incubation, the plate was frozen at − 70 °C and the lysates were harvested and RNA was extracted from each aliquot and quantifies the virus to study the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extracts.
