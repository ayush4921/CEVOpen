<p>In conclusion, dietary RN leaf powder supplementation indicated that RN powder at level 5 g RN/kg diet possesses moderate anti-coccidial effects through reduced the lesion scores, suppressed the output of oocysts per gram in chickensâ€™ feces, and hence could be used to treat avian coccidiosis in field conditions. Although RN was unable to minimize the weight gain loss caused by infection with emeriosis, RN leaf powder at level 1 g RN/kg diet improved feed conversion ratio and attempted to improved body weight gain, performance index, and production efficiency at 7-days post-infection compared to the infected control group. In addition, the wide distribution, economic nature, and simplicity of using the Ithrib shrub suggested that RN leaf powder could also act as a moderate alternative to anti-coccidial agents. This study would eventually support a novel strategy for controlling broiler chicken coccidiosis in field conditions.</p>
