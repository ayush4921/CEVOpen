<p>Coccidiosis is an intracellular protozoan disease that affects the hygiene and performance of the majority of animals and birds. Coccidian protozoa belonging to several genera and species cause coccidiosis. The genus 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> affects birds, cattle, rabbits, and other mammals, and the genus 
 <italic>Isospora</italic> is known to infect dogs and cats [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The protozoan Eimeria that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa causes avian coccidiosis. Avian coccidiosis is one of the most serious poultry diseases and affects the worldwide poultry industry. More than 50 billion poultry are raised as meat source each year, accounting for more than a third of protein foods for humans [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, coccidiosis causes large economic losses of up to USD 3 billion dollars worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Poor performance and high mortality and morbidity of chickens, associated with medication expenditure, subsequently contribute to the financial burden. The overall prevalence of coccidiosis in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in a year was reported at 75% among domestic rabbits [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and 80% among house-reared chicks [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ref. [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that younger chicks were more susceptible than older chicks to emeriosis. 
 <italic>Eimeria acervulina</italic>, 
 <italic>E. maxima</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. praecox</italic> are often found in broiler chickens.
