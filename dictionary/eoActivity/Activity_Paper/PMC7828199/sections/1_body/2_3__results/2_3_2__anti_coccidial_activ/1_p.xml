<p>Clinical signs of coccidia parasite infection such as huddling together, ruffled feathers, and depression were detected in the infected birds but not in the uninfected birds. 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00167-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the effects of RN leaf powder on the mean output of OPG, lesion score, oocyst value, bloody diarrhea, inhibition rate, and cecal length of each experimental group at d 7. There was no mortality in all the experimental groups, except for one bird in the PC group (group 5). Bloody diarrhea and fecal output of oocysts were absent during the first 4 d after the challenge. Bloody diarrhea was observed in groups 1 to 5 from the 4th to 7th d after 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> challenge. The dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg RN reduced the OPG, oocyst value, lesion score, bloody diarrhea, and cecal length atrophy of broilers at the 7th d after infection, whereas treatment with 1 g/kg RN produced the opposite results; however, the differences were not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, after feeding with RN leaf powder, the anti-coccidial activity among the birds appeared to be dose-dependent but not significant when compared with each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the anti-coccidial parameters of birds in groups fed with RN-medicated diets at the dose used in this study were not significant compared to those evaluated after Sacox treatment. Moreover, the birdsâ€™ OPG, oocyst value, lesion score, bloody diarrhea, and cecal length atrophy in RN- and Sacox-medicated groups were significantly reduced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with birds in the PC group. Consequently, severe pathological features such as higher OPG, oocyst value, lesion score, bloody diarrhea, and cecal length atrophy were noticed in the PC group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to those in the NC group. The inhibition rates of RN-medicated groups 1, 2, and 3 and Sacox-medicated group were 48.85%, 61.99%, and 76.07% and 75.06%, respectively (

 <italic>E. tenella</italic> in the infected experimental treatments is shown in
