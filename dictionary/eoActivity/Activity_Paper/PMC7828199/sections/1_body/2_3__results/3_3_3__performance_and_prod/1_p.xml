 <xref rid="animals-11-00167-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> shows the effects of RN leaf powder on the feed efficiency of broilers. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg RN increased the BW, FI, production efficiency factor (PEF) of broilers on the 7th d after infection, whereas treatment with 3 g/kg RN reduced the BWG, FI, and PEF, but with no significant differences (
