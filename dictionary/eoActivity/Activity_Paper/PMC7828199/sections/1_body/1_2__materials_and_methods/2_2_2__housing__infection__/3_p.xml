<p>The 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> oocysts used in this study were kindly provided by collaborators from the Department of Zoology, College of Science, KSU, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Unsporulated oocysts were collected from the feces of chickens that were naturally infected on the 7th d after infection. These oocysts were sporulated, purified, and preserved in 2.5% potassium dichromate at 25 °C for 72 h and then stored at 4 °C until use [

 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as the location of lesions. In addition, sporulated oocysts were passed twice over 2 weeks of age in healthy chickens before being used to activate the parasite and confirm the placement of the lesions. Oocysts were then collected, sporulated, washed, and adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/100 µL/bird. A total of 10,000 sporulated oocysts were administered orally (gavage) to each experimental chicken in 1 mL of distilled water [
