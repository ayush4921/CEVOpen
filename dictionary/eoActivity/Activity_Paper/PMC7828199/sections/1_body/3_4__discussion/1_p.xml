<p>Salinomycin (Sacox
 <sup>Â®</sup>) anti-coccidial drugs are developed from natural products and broadly used in the poultry sector for controlling coccidiosis. We attempted to mimic a synthetic anti-coccidial drug to evaluate a natural herb with anti-coccidial properties that could eventually be further developed into a new, safe, anti-coccidial drug without tissue residues or even drug resistance. After several herbal plant surveys, we focused on the RN leaf as there are no or only a few scientific articles addressing the impact of dietary supplementation of RN leaf powder in the broiler diet. This shrub is rich in several chemical ingredients such as carbohydrates, sterols, glycosides, triterpenes, saponins, tannins, and flavonoids in its flowers [

Various environmental factors may, of course, alter the quantitative and qualitative aspects of essential oils (EO) in a variety of ways, such as altering the metabolism of plants and their secondary metabolites. The chemical composition of EO depends on climatic, seasonal, and geographical conditions and harvesting age, distillation technique, storage conditions, the origin of the plant, part of the plant used, and the stage of development and growth of the habitat (soil, temperature, and fertilizers). Moreover, their anti-microbial activity depends on the type of composition and concentration of the EO, the type and concentration of the target microorganism, the composition of the substrate, and the processing and storage conditions [
