<p>The amount of oocysts in feces is a crucial indicator of the spread of coccidiosis through modern intensive poultry farming due to the transmission of 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> oocysts via the oral-fecal route [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the number of fecal oocysts in chickens challenged with coccidia were effectively reduced in response to the natural product. The RN leaf powder dramatically reduced the OPG output in the RN-treated groups, suggesting that RN leaf powder could contribute to the control of coccidiosis outbreaks in large-scale poultry farms.
