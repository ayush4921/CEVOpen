<p>The damaging effect of coccidiosis was obvious in the challenged group that was ameliorated treatment with the RN herb. The positive impact of RN leaf extract in terms of the anti-coccidial criterion can be attributed to the presence of abundant flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and saponins, which may exert a combined effect of anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diarrheal activity in birds [

In the present study, the chemical composition of RN leaves methanolic extracts was studied using HPLC and GC-MS analysis and resulted in the identification of Gallic acid and 13 compounds, respectively. Further studies are needed to investigate the anti-coccidial potential of active ingredients either alone or in mixtures with other anti-coccidial substances. Gallic acid is a phenolic acid widely distributed in plants and foods and has a wide range of activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-allergic, anti-carcinogenic, and ant-mutagenic properties. Therefore, natural or synthetic anti-oxidants are commonly used as feed supplements in the poultry industry to relieve or reduce oxidative stress caused by the high production of free radical oxidative species during the host cell immune response to

A total of 13 compounds were detected in the GC-MS analysis of the methanolic extract of RN leaf, whose activity and mode of action against coccidiosis must be investigated in further studies.
