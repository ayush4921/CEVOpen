<p>Besides the above mentioned important findings that strengthen and support the present study results represent in a reduction of Oocyst number and lesions in the cecum, there are some limitations. For instance, although the data on the performance index, weight gain, and production efficiency do not appear to support this shrub in promoting performance, it is likely that challenged birds by an overdose of coccidian oocysts or an ineffective dose of RN leaf powder supplementation (such as 1g RN/kg diet) have an undesirable effect on the chickens. Therefore, further studies must be conducted carefully using a lower dose of emeriosis oocysts or a higher medicinal dosage to relieve the undesirable effects on BW. Furthermore, in order to evaluate an in vitro anti-coccidial efficacy of RN leaf, it is necessary to, determine lethal dose 50 (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of RN leaf extract, isolate and identify pure components to understand the relationship between the major components and their corresponding anti-coccidial effects to allow new drug discovery. In the present study, our data confirmed that the RN leaf powder yields intermediate anti-coccidial effects. In this study, the nutritional proximate analysis revealed that RN had a moderate raw protein content (13.63 percent) and a high carbohydrate content (52.91 percent) resulted in a higher nutritional value (327.66 Kcal/100 g). There was no harmful effect of currently used anti-coccidial drugs to broilers or even to human based on pharmacognostical study of RN growing in Yemen reported by [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], who found that the ethanolic extract (70%) of RN considered as non-toxic up to a dose of 7.1 g/kg b.wt and have cytotoxic activity with varying degrees of potency against human cancer cell lines. We suggest that RN in the range of doses administered could be considered non-toxic.
