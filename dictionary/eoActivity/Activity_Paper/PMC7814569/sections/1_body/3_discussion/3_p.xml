<p>The natural products from plants like 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic> are known to be antidiabetic in nature as it belongs to the 
 <italic>Cucurbitaceae</italic> family. So, selection of this plant was based on its diverse pharmacological activities such as antiviral, antidiabetic, antioxidant, immune-stimulant, easy cultivation approaches and resemblance to structure of coronavirus. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies, ADME analyses and 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> interaction studies have suggested the important natural product-based hits for the comorbid and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. The molecular modeling and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> pharmacokinetic analysis had put a great contribution and light to further wet lab analysis for drug discovery and development from 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic> molecules and their kinetics as well as cell lines model studies are in progress. However, these natural molecules have significant in the drug discovery for multitargets of SARS-CoV-2 related infections.
