 <italic>In silico</italic> docking studies of the four natural ligands and three control drugs to the spike protein with ACE2 receptor (6M0J) for their binding affinity were noted. The obtained binding affinities are (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) Catechin (−7.5 kcal/mol), Quercetin (−7.8 kcal/mol), Hederagenin (−8.3 kcal/mol), Oleanolic acid (−8.5 kcal/mol), Favipiravir (−5.3 kcal/mol), Hydroxychloroquine (−6.2 kcal/mol) and Remdesivir (−7.9 kcal/mol). The triterpenoids, Oleanolic acid and Hederagenin showed the highest affinity to the protease. The hederagenin was properly positioned between Asn33, His34, Pro389 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">10</xref>). The His34 and Pro389 shared alkyl and pi-alkyl interaction with hederagenin. While the Oleanolic acid was positioned between Asn33, His34, Pro389, Lys417 (E). The residues His34, Pro389, Lys417 share alkyl and pi-alkyl interaction with oleanolic acid. The amino acid residues are Asn33, His34 and Pro389 are common in both the cases, except Lys417 of E chain of the protease which is included in interaction of oleanolic acid to the protease, since the compounds show structural similarity and both of them belong to same class of plant metabolites. These ligands showed high potentially high biological activity as compared to the control drugs in terms of binding affinities.
