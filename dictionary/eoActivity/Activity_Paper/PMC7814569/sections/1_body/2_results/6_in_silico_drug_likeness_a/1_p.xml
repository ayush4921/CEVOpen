 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) to predict their overall pharmacokinetic profile and drug-likeness ability based on the Lipinski’s Rule of Five. This rule majorly focuses the molecular weight, lipophilicity and the presence of number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the compound (
