<p>Since the compounds were also screened for Lipinski’s rule of five that predicts drug likeness properties of the natural compounds/metabolites from 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic>, Catechin, Quercetin and Hederagenin showed good bioavailability and drug-likeness by fulfilling Lipinski’s criteria. Other than these criteria, Catechin and Quercetin have good solubility which means good ADME properties execution. Hederagenin showed moderate solubility while Oleanolic acid showed poor solubility. Quercetin has the best solubility among all the compounds involved in this study. Molar refractivity of compounds should lie between 40 to 13. This rule is maintained in case of catechin and quercetin while not for Hederagenin and Oleanolic acid. The molar refractivity values for catechin and quercetin are 74.33 and 78.03, respectively.
