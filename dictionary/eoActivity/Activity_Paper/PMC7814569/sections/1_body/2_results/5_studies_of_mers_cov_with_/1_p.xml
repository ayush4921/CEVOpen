<p>The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> docking studies of the four natural ligands and three control drugs to the MERS-CoV with DPP4 receptor for their binding affinity were noted. The obtained binding affinities are (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) Catechin (−7.2 kcal/mol), Quercetin (−7.8 kcal/mol), Hederagenin (−7.9 kcal/mol), Oleanolic acid (−8.2 kcal/mol), Favipiravir (−5.6 kcal/mol), Hydroxychloroquine (−5.4 kcal/mol) and Remdesivir (−7.4 kcal/mol). The triterpenoids Oleanolic acid and Hederagenin showed the highest affinity to the protease. The hederagenin was properly positioned between Leu366, Ala409, Leu410, Phe461 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">12</xref>). The Leu366, Ala409, Leu410 shared alkyl interaction with Hederagenin whereas Phe461 showed unfavorable donor-donor interaction with hederagenin. While the Oleanolic acid was positioned between Phe364, Leu366, Ala409, Leu410, Phe461. The residues Leu366, Ala409, Leu410 shared alkyl interaction with oleanolic acid while Phe364 and Phe461 shared hydrogen bonding with the Oleanolic acid moiety. The amino acid residues are Leu366, Ala409, Leu410, Phe461 are common in both the cases, since the compounds show structural similarity and both of them belong to same class of plant metabolites. These ligands showed high potentially high biological activity as compared to the control drugs in terms of binding affinities.
