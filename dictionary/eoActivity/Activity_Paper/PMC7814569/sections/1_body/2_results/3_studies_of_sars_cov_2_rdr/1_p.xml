<p>With the help of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> docking studies, the four natural ligands and three control drugs were analyzed for their binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (6M71). The obtained binding affinities are (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) Catechin (−6.8 kcal/mol), Quercetin (−7.6 kcal/mol), Hederagenin (−8.2 kcal/mol), Oleanolic acid (−8.3 kcal/mol), Favipiravir (−5.1 kcal/mol), Hydroxychloroquine (−5.5 kcal/mol) and Remdesivir (−6.9 kcal/mol). The triterpenoids Oleanolic acid and Hederagenin showed the highest affinity to the protease. The hederagenin was properly positioned between Lys621 and Trp800 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">8</xref>). The Trp800 shared Pi-Alkyl interaction with Hederagenin while Lys621 showed unfavorable donor-donor bond to hederagenin moiety. While the Oleanolic acid was positioned between Cys622 and Trp800. The Trp800 shared Pi-Alkyl interaction with Oleanolic acid as similar to Hederagenin while Cys622 showed Alkyl bond to hederagenin moiety. The amino acid residue Trp800 is common in both the cases, since the compounds show structural similarity and both of them belong to same class of plant metabolites. These ligands showed potentially high biological activity as compared to the control drugs in terms of binding affinities.
