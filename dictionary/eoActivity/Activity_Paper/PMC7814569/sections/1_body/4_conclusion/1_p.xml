<p>The present study reports the predicted efficacy of flavonoids and triterpenoids from 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic> plant against the viral proteases and proteases having comorbidities of the coronavirus. These metabolites in 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic> have been previously reported to have antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory properties that are primarily necessary to be effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Currently, as in the COVID-19 pandemic, there is rapid replicability of viral particles and lack of specific drugs and vaccines. So, it is need to apply concepts of Phyto pharmaceuticals to fight against the coronavirus and keep oneself away from the physical and mental stress. The phytoconstituents catechin, quercetin, hederagenin and oleanolic acid could serve as potential medicinal agents in COVID-19. In this present study, we screened the potential biological activities of phytoconstituents from spine gourd against the viral and comorbid proteases of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modeling and to compared its efficacy in terms of binding energy with the drugs currently used in treatment of COVID-19.
