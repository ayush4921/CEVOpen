<p>The 3CLpro protease or main protease of SARS-CoV-2 does cleavage at the C-terminal of polyproteins at eleven sites to give rise to other non-structural proteins that are required in viral replication. The main protease has three domains I, II and III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The active site having the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) present between the domain I and II shows the protease activity. The third domain is connected to rest of the protein structure by a long loop and this gap contains a larger pocket relative to the active site. Thus, drugs that target this protease play a critical role in inhibiting the replication of the virus (Liu et al.,
