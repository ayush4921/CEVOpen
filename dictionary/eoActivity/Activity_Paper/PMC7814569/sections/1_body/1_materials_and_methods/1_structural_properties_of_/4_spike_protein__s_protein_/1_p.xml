<p>The spike protein consists of three regions: Ectodomain (ED) region, Intracellular domain region and Transmembrane region. The S protein is type I-transmembrane (TM) protein which appear as clove shaped. The ED region consists of two receptor binding domains (RBD), S1 and trimeric stalk containing S2 subunit associated on C-terminal (

This protein is considered as a potential target for drug discovery because S1 domain and host ACE2 for SARS-CoV and Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV associated with host and viral membrane fusion mediated by S2 segment potentiate the coronavirus to release its RNA in host cell (Vijayakumar et al.,
