<p>In this study, the amino acid residues present at the active site of the proteases were predicted and determined from the related literature, using the metaPocket server (Huang, 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and through the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020 (Design, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The determination of the amino acids in the active site was used to analyze the Grid box and to carry out site-specific docking. Discovery Studio is an offline life sciences software that provides tools for protein, ligand and pharmacophore modeling (Hastantram et al.,
