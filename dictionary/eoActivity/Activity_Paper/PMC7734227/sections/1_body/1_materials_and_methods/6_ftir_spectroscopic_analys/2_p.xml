<p id="p0045">Structural analysis of EPS was determined using Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (8400S, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc.). EPS (1.0 Î¼l) was placed on fused KBr disc for detecting the functional groups. This was carefully placed on cell holder, clamped loosely and fixed on the infrared (IR) beam. The running was done at 400 to 4000 per cm wave number.</p>
