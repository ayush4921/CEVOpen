<p id="p0070">Nitric oxide scavenging activity of EPS was carried out using the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jagetia and Baliga (2004)</xref>. A volume of 1.0 ml of sodium nitroprusside (10 mM) prepared in 0.5 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) was mixed with EPS (100 μl) and vortexed. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 150 min. Thereafter, 1.0 mL of previous solution was mixed with 1.0 ml of Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide, 2% o-phosphoric acid and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine hydrochloride) and incubated at 26 ± 2 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was recorded at 546 nm. Scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula id="ufd4">NO Scavenging activity (%) = {(A control –A sample) / A control}x 100%</disp-formula>
