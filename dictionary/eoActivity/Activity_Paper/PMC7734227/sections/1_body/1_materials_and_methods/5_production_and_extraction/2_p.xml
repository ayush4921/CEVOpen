 <sub>4</sub>, 0.1 g/L K
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.1 g/L CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> and agro-waste of 4.0 g/L, 12.0 g/L and 20.0 g/L in different Erlenmeyer flask. The flasks containing the mixture were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, the flasks were allowed to cool before inoculation of 7 days-old mycelium of 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic>. The flasks were incubated at 26 °C and maintained at 120 rpm for 18 days in thermostat incubator with shaker (IN-SK100, Tianjin, China). After submerged fermentation, EPS was assayed using the methods of

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Diamantopoulou et al. (2014)</xref>. Briefly, the concentrated culture filtrates were mixed with four volume of ethanol 95% v/v, stirred thoroughly and allow to stand for 24 h at 4 °C. The precipitated EPS was treated with 1:4 of 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol: chloroform (1:5 v/v) to remove protein. The EPS content was determined by phenol-sulphuric acid methods and glucose was used as standard (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 1956</xref>). The solvent extract was purified by ion exchange chromatography at flow rate of 24 ml/h and elution was performed with distilled water. The samples were dialyzed exhaustively against distilled water to remove unwanted impurities for 24 h. The EPS obtained was freeze-dried (FD-10-MR, Xiangtan Xiangyi instrument Ltd, China) at -65 °C. EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture without agrowaste, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture with pineapple peel, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture with groundnut shell and EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture with coconut husk were selected for further studies.
