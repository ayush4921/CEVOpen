 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> was collected from Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi (FIIRO) Lagos, Nigeria. The fungus was sub-cultured on Potato Dextrose Agar to maintain a pure strain of the fungus. Indicator bacteria and fungi were obtained from Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Lagos, Nigeria. The indicator microorganisms include: 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli</italic> O 157:H7, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae,</italic> Methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans,</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> (ATCC 66029)
 <italic>.</italic> All the tested microorganisms were aseptically sub-cultured into appropriate media and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and 26 °C for 48 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Two probiotic strains; 
 <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic> used in this study were isolated from yoghurt starter culture.
