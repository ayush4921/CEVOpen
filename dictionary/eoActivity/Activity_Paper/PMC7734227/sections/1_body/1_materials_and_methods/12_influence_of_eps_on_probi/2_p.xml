<p id="p0075">Probiotic growth stimulation of EPS was determined using the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sawangwan et al. (2018)</xref> with modifications. Briefly, de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth (10.0 ml) was prepared in different test tubes, sterilized at 121 °C for 15 min and was allowed to cool. The MRS broth was supplemented with sterile (0.22 μm milipore) 1% v/v of EPS, a negative control contained MRS broth, positive control contained MRS broth with 1% w/v of glucose or commercial prebiotic; fructose oligosaccharides (FOS). Each tube was inoculated with 100 μl of 10
 <sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU) 
 <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles.</italic> The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under anaerobic conditions. After incubation, growth rate of probiotics was quantified by measuring their optical cell density using spectrophotometer at 620 nm. To determine load of 
 <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic>, 100 μl was serially diluted in sterile distilled water up to 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, where 100 μl was transferred to MRS agar plates. Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Thereafter, colonies of 
 <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic> were counted using colony counter (TT-20, Techmel and Techmel, USA) and reported as colony forming unit per milliliter (CFU/ml).
