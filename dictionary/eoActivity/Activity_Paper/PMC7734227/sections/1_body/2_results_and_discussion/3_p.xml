<p id="p0090">Supplementation of agrowastes into cultivating media of fungi during fermentation processes is a mechanism to produce useful bioavailable metabolites for medicinal purposes. Bioproduction of multiple secondary metabolites by higher fungi have increased for industrial applications through optima fermentation conditions, application of metabolic engineering techniques, and fungal genetic manipulation (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>). Solid state fermentation and submerged cultivation of Basidiomycota are much faster biotechnological processing as a promising tool for industrial production of exopolysaccharides. Submerged cultivation of fungal mycelium is still attractive alternative to produce high-value metabolites; exopolysaccharides (EPS), which are often synthesize in the cell membrane through the action of enzymes (

 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> grown on twelve formulations of different inexpensive lignocellulosic biomass such as oak sawdust, coconut fiber (hairs), coffee husks, and corn bran plus soybean oil produced better yield of polysaccharides (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sadh et al., 2018a</xref>). Hence, the utilization of agro-wastes to produce biologically active compounds by submerged fermentation with microbial technology is a major way to proffer solution to poor management and disposal of agro wastes. Shells of groundnut, coconut, walnut and dried fruit peels contain cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which enable fungi to grow and produce better metabolic products. Groundnut shell was utilized for the production of various bio-products like biodiesel, bioethanol, and enzyme (
