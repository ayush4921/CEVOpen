<p id="p0095">The varying amount of EPS could base on quantity of agrowastes, different type of agro-wastes used, their chemical composition and choice of fungi. It has been reported that optimal submerged culture conditions for maximum mycelial growth and EPS production depend strongly on type of substrates and fungal species (

Other environmental parameters or physical conditions on the fungal mycelia formation during fermentation with culture medium composition could be associated with yield of EPS. The morphological nature, physicochemical parameters and various physiological activities on fungal mycelia in submerged cultures were strongly depended on the quantity of metabolites (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2006)</xref> revealed that, characteristics of mycelia in submerged fermentation were influenced by culture conditions such as composition and initial pH of fermentation medium, age and size of inoculum, aeration rate, agitation speed and thus, affect yield of EPS. The basic composition of agro-wastes residues like nitrogen, carbon and minerals could also affect the production of EPS. Findings of

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mahapatra and Banerjee (2013)</xref> suggested that, most of the EPS producing fungi are aerobic or facultative anaerobic, and oxygen limitation did not support EPS production and thus, revealed that fungi needed long incubation time for maximum EPS production.
