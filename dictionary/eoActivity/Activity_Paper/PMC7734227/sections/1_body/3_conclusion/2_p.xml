<p id="p0125">Fruit peels, coconut husk, groundnut shell and walnut shell supplemented into submerged culture of 
 <italic>P.Â pulmonarius</italic> mycelia supported the production of EPS. EPS inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, displayed antioxidant activities against free radicals and sustained the growth of probiotics. Therefore, bioactivities of EPS make it a better candidate of natural products that is often used as a preservative agent in foods industries. Production of natural bioactive compounds in submerged culture of fungi with agro-wastes will therefore, reduce indiscriminate disposal of agro-wastes into the environment. Chemical constituents of agro-industrial residues can be utilized by fungal enzymes to produce biologically active compounds (secondary metabolites) in larger scale production.
