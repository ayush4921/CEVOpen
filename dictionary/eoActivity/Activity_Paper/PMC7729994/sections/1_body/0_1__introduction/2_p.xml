<p>Type 2 DM patients are vulnerable to complications that disrupt normal functions of the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves and blood vessels [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These complications are thus responsible for the high mortality rates observed in the diabetic patients especially poorly treated cases [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is undeniable that the use of orthodox drugs improved the management of T2DM but are associated with adverse side-effects [

As a result of a wide array of metabolic abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications, excellent treatment modalities should not only correct deranged glucose metabolism but also reverse or prevent the development of diabetic complications [

Promising findings have been reported as a result of various compounds that are present in medicinal plants, which work individually or in synergy to produce the desired antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects [
