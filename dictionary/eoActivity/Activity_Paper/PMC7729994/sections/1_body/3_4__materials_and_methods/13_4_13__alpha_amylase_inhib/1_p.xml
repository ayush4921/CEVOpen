<p>The inhibitory effects of vindoline and the extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> on the activity of α- amylase were assessed using the modified method described by [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This assay determines the decrease in the units of maltose produced after the breakdown of starch by the enzyme alpha amylase. If an extract or compound possesses alpha amylase inhibitory activities, there will be a decrease in the amount of maltose formed, which is signified by a yellowish color instead of brick red. In this study, 200 μL of the test compounds was preincubated with 200 μL of the enzyme (1 U/mL) for 10 min. Soluble starch solution (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was then added to the plant-enzyme solution and incubated for 30 min, the reaction was then stopped by adding 200 μL of 96 Mm of 3, 5 dintrosalicyclic acid (prepared 12 g of sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate in 8 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide and 96 mM salicyclic acid. This was followed by a heating step (85 °C for 15 min). Two blank samples were used in this experiment: one made without the enzyme and the other without the plant extract, 200 μL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer was added instead. The amount of maltose formed was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer.
