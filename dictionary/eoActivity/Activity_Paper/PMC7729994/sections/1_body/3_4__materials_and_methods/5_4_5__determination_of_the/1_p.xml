<p>The ORAC is an assay that determines the rate at which biological or plant samples reduce the peroxyl radical. If a sample has high concentrations of antioxidants, there will be a delay in the decrease in fluorescence of the fluorescein reagent. In this study, the method of Ou et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] was adapted to determine the antioxidant capacity of vindoline and different extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>. In brief, 12 µL of the trolox standard or samples was mixed with 138 µL of a 14 µM fluoresce reagent and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation step, 50 µL of 4.8 mM 2,2′-azobis (2-methyl-propanamide) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was added introducing the free radical. The rate of fluorescence decrease was measured at 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission readings recorded every 1 min for 2 hr using a Fluoroskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results were expressed as µM Trolox equivalents (TE)/L or µM Trolox equivalents (TE)/g.
