<p>The RIN-5F is an insulinoma cell line derived from the pancreatic β cells of rats. These cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 media (RPMI 1640) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were cultured in sterile cell culture flasks and were incubated at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The media was changed after every 4 days to prevent starvation of cells. Upon reaching 80% confluence, cells were either subcultured or seeded at a cell count of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> for further experiments.
