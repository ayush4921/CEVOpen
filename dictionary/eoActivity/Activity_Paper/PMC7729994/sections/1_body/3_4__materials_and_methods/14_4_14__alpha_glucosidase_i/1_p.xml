<p>The alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> extracts and vindoline were tested by the method of Monteiro de Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Of the plant samples 200 μL were incubated with 1 U/mL alpha glucosidase enzyme for 5 min. To initiate the reaction, 200 μL of the substrate reagent pNpG (3 mM prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.9) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Of sodium carbonate 100 mM was added to stop the reaction and the reaction was measured at an absorbance of 405 nm. Blanks were made by replacing the enzyme/plant with distilled water.
