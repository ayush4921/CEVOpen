<p>To evaluate the effect of exposing RIN-5F cells to different concentrations extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>, cell viability was assessed using the WST-1 method and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of extracts ranging from 1 to 0.03125 mg/mL. The CR-Aq extract at 1 and 0.5 mg/mL significantly increased the number of viable cells to approximately 150% when compared to the control at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. A significant decrease in cell viability was observed in cells that were treated with 0.5 mg/mL of CR-DCM and those treated with 1 mg/mL CR-METH and CR-DCM. Concentrations that resulted in about 85% viability were used for further experiments and these included the 0.03125 mg/mL for CR-Aq and 0.0625 mg/mL for both the CR-Meth and CR-DCM.
