<p>The results represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f009">Figure 9</xref> indicate the effect of different extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> on inhibition of alpha amylase activity. The methanolic extract exhibited high alpha amylase inhibitory activity when compared to the control at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. At 50 mg/mL, CR-Meth displayed alpha amylase inhibitory activity of about 40% while CR-Aq and CR-DCM showed 20% and âˆ’2% enzyme inhibitions, respectively. The inhibitory effect of the methanolic extract at 25 and 12.5 mg/mL resulted in roughly 30% reduction of the enzyme activity whereas the aqueous extract showed relatively weaker activities of 11 and 9% respectively. In this study, the dichloromethane extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> showed negative alpha amylase inhibitory effects demonstrated by an inverted graph.
