<p>Although the dichloromethane and the ethyl acetate extracts contained lower concentrations of the selected polyphenols, the HPLC quantification showed elevated concentrations of an alkaloid vindoline in these extracts while the aqueous extract recorded the lowest. In a previous study, the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> reduced the fasting blood glucose levels by approximately 40% in DM rats. The observed reduction was attributed to the presence of hypoglycemic alkaloids such as vindoline. Increased glycogenesis, decreased glucose absorption and gluconeogenesis were assumed to be the underlying mechanisms behind the in vivo antidiabetic effect of the ethyl acetate extract [
