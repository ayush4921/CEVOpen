<p>The alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities of vindoline, aqueous, methanolic and dichloromethane extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> were investigated. Our results showed appreciable alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities at 50 mg/mL of the plant extracts. However, at lower concentrations, dichloromethane extract demonstrated weaker inhibitory activities. On the other hand, methanolic extract exerted significantly higher alpha amylase inhibitory activities. These findings are in agreement with results of Jyothi et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite the reported in vivo antidiabetic effects of dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> by previous researchers [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we did not observe any alpha amylase inhibitory effects of this extract, indicated by the negative inhibitory values. Our result proposed that the dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> may stimulate the activity of alpha amylase hence does not delay the breakdown of carbohydrates after a meal. The carbohydrate inhibitory activities observed in this study may be associated with the presence of compounds such as phenolics and terpernoids, which were previously reported to possess alpha glucosidase and alpha amylase inhibitory activities [
