<p>In order to assess the potential effect of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> leaf extracts and vindoline on the RIN 5-F cell survival, cell viability was measured. In our findings, the CR-Aq extract at high concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL increased the number of viable cells signified by a cell viability of 150%. The enhanced viability observed may imply that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> has the ability to increase the number of viable β cells in the pancreatic tissue [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, the improved cell viability attests to the traditional consumption of the water decoction of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> leaves in the treatment of DM [

The enhanced cytotoxicity may have been instigated by the presence of extreme amounts of indole alkaloids with proapoptotic effects thus restricting cell proliferation [
