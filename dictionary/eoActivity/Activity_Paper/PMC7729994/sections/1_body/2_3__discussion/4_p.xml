<p>The antioxidant potential of vindoline was measured using the FRAP, DPPH and ORAC methods, with ascorbic acid as a positive control antioxidant in these assays. The DPPH scavenging capacity and the FRAP assay showed no significant change when compared to standard ascorbic acid. Interestingly, vindoline showed a high oxygen radical absorbance capacity with values that are significantly higher than a known antioxidant ascorbic acid. Our findings indicate that vindoline inhibited the fluorescence decay of fluorescein-peroxyl radical complex through donating its hydrogen atom suggesting vindolineâ€™s antioxidant effectiveness. Augmentation of cellular antioxidant defense structures remains an approach in averting the progression of disease states in which oxidative stress has been implicated [
