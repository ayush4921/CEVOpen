<p>In our present study, we measured the concentrations of vindoline and selected phenolic compounds in the aqueous (CR-Aq), methanolic (CR-Meth), dichloromethane (CR-DCM) and ethyl-acetate (CR.Ethyl) extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>. The HPLC chromatogram of the methanolic extract followed by the aqueous extract showed higher concentrations of the selected phenolic compounds. Polyphenolic compounds are present in plants and their inclusion in the diet has been reported to have remarkable human health benefits. Polyphenolic compounds have the ability to scavenge ROS/RNS in biological systems. Their free radical scavenging ability has been linked to the prevention or reduction of the risk of diseases like T2DM and cancer [

In addition, modulatory effects of phenolic compounds like flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) in DM is linked to alterations of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, attenuation of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation and insulin resistance [

Previous studies reported the stimulated insulin secretory effect of chlorogenic acid from INS-1E cells; moreover it has been shown to enhance GLUT4 expression [

Results from total polyphenolic (TP) determination showed high concentrations of TP (in decreasing order) in methanolic, dichloromethane, aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts. The quantitative polyphenolic assessment of the various extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> revealed methanolic extract as the best solvent to extract the phenolic compounds. These findings are in agreement with previous studies [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that reported high polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic>.
