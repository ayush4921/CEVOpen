<p id="p0035">Cellular infection and replication cycles start after the penetration of the virus in the host cells. The ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase that modulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) frequently expressed in the alveolar epithelial cells and many other tissues (
 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2002</xref>). This enzyme constitutes the key functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 that allows the attachment to human and bat cells (

 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Sigrist et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, this receptor combines with spike protein-receptor binding domain (RBD) (S1 subunit), and the interaction trigger conformational changes of the C-terminal of the S protein inducing the exposition of S2 subunit responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion. The fusion process requires activation by proteolysis in S1/S2 junction processed by host cell-type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) leading to the ACE2 cleavage and therefore to viral endocytosis (

 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Rabby, 2020</xref>). The binding affinity between ACE2 and the ectodomain structure of the S protein determines the human transmission capability and inflammatory response. It is supposed that the decrease of ACE2 activity and expression in host-cell membranes reduce the entrance ability and the inflammatory activity (

After the endocytosis and uncoating process, the genomic RNA released in the cytoplasm is translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) by host ribosomes. These polyproteins undergo a proteolytic cleavage generating 15â€“16 nonstructural proteins including two cysteine proteases PL
 <sup>pro</sup> and 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These proteases are key tools for the auto cleavage process which is essential for viral propagation and infection cycle (

The set of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced assemble to facilitate viral replication and transcription and constitute a multi-subunit replication/transcription machinery. The nsp12 also known as RdRp is a crucial replicate that catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary RNA strand using the virus RNA template with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as co-factors (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The genomic RNA is also transcribed into subgenomic RNA which in turn leads to the synthesis of structural (S, E, M and N) and accessory proteins. That subsequently insulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and then moved to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Finally, the assembled virions are released via the secretory pathway (
