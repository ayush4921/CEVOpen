<p id="p0090">PL
 <sup>pro</sup> is another important druggable target due to its important functions in the viral replication cycle. This enzyme is involved in N-terminal viral polyproteins cleavage in order to generate many Nsps (Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3) (
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Mhatre et al., 2020</xref>). It is also crucial in alienating the innate immunity of the host cells. Indeed, SARS-CoV viruses use PL
 <sup>pro</sup> as an antagonist to inhibit the activation of the interferon regulatory factor-3 pathway (IRF3-pathway) in order to reduce the production of interferon widely known for its antiviral activities (

 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme would normally elicit a robust interferon-mediated response, activate the immune system and the antiviral response of the host cells, and also disturb the replication cycle.
