 <sup>pro</sup>, also known as the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) is a non-structural protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This enzyme is required for proteolytic maturation of the viral polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) in order to form the RNA replicase-transcriptase complex, which is essential for both viral transcription and replication processes (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Elmezayen et al., 2020</xref>). This protease has a highly conserved three-dimensional structure among various CoVs and active only in a dimeric form (the individual monomers of SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> are enzymatically inactive). Structural and catalytic characteristics of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> make it a selective target for drug development. Indeed, many strategies could be employed in order to develop inhibitors against this enzyme. Firstly, since M
 <sup>pro</sup> is highly conserved, a mutation in M
 <sup>pro</sup> genome is often lethal to the virus, the catalytic activity of this enzyme could be altered by the fixation of a molecule in the substrate-binding pocket or by the use of dimerization inhibitors (

 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme may constitute promising drugs with a broad-spectrum of antiviral activities able to stop the post-translational processing of SARS-CoV-2 polypeptides and to reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance.
