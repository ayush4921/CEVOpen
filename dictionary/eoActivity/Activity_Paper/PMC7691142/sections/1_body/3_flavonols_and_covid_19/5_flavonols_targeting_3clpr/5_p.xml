<p id="p0100">Previous studies reported that rutin exhibited a high stability compared to many other flavonols namely narcissin, calendoflaside (isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnosyl-rhamnose), calendoflavoside (isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-neohesperidoside), quercitrin, isoquercitrin and isorhamnetin (

 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Owis et al., 2020</xref>). The reactivity of rutin is due to the presence of rutinoside moiety and four free hydroxyl groups on the aglycone skeleton. While the substitution of rutin with a methoxy group in C-3′ of B ring to obtain narcissin reduces the reactivity of this molecule which is previously reported by 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Owis et al. (2020)</xref>. In contrast, the presence of a glucose unit in the flavonol skeleton gives a strong binding affinity compared to the rhamnose unit as in the case of isoquercitrin and quercitrin (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the position and the type of branched osidic units may affect the binding energy. The comparison between the structures of isorhamnetin derivatives (narcissin and calendoflavoside) could explain this suggestion. In fact, these molecules bear the same branched osidic units (glucose-rhamnose) on the C-3 position of the isorhamnetin skeleton. However, the linkage between the osidic units differ for narcissin (-β-D-Glc-(1 → 6)-α-L-Rha) and for calendoflavoside (-β-D-Glc-(1 → 2)-α-L-Rha). This could increase the steric hindrance in the structure of calendoflavoside and decreases the capacity of hydrogen bonds as well as the formation of electrostatic interactions (
