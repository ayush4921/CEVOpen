<p id="p0095">Flavonols could be considered as promoter compounds able to induce the inhibition of many enzymes involved in the infection with coronavirus and constitute a source of possible drugs and vaccines candidate against this pandemic. According to the study of 
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2012)</xref>, the lack of 2,3-double bond and carbonyl group at the C-4 position in the C ring, and galloyl moiety and the presence of hydroxyl group in C-5′ position of B ring in flavonoid skeletons reduce the chemical interactions, the formation of hydrogen bonds and the electrostatic interactions with the active site of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These data support the bioactivity of flavanols which contain a carbonyl function (C-4) and a double bond in position C

 <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> L. aerial parts. The data showed that all the tested flavonols had significant binding stability compared to the darunavir as standard drug, which confirms that the basic flavonol skeleton itself possesses an activity. The comparison between these results revealed that the presence of rutinose moiety (α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1

  <math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg">

  </math>
 </inline-formula>6)-β-D-glucopyranose) at the C-3 position of C ring and the absence of an additional methoxyl group at C-3′ position of B ring in flavonol structure could increase the binding stability. Furthermore, the addition of a rhamnose unit to the rutinoside group decreases the binding stability of the tested molecules (
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Owis et al., 2020</xref>). This could be explained by the covering of specific hydroxyl groups in the tested molecule with adjacent groups, preventing the ability of hydrogen bond formation and electrostatic interactions by steric blocking. Also, from the study of 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cherrak et al. (2020)</xref>, seventeen flavonol glycosides were modeling for their ability to interact with the active site of the M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Among these compounds, five molecules namely quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnose, myricetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, rutin, myricitrin and quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-neohesperidoside had strong docking scores. Glycoside flavonols had a high binding affinity than aglycone flavonols. In fact, for aglycone skeletons, the C-3 substituted flavonols were more active than those substituted in C-7 position. In the case of glycosylated flavonols, the nature of the linked sugar with the skeletons and its position affect the docking scores, the presence of rhamnose or a rutinoside moiety in C-3 position enhances the bioactivity of the selected compounds which is in agreement with the results of 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Owis et al. (2020)</xref>. Moreover, the presence of a glucoside group in flavonol structures increases the possibility of hydrogen bonds creation compared to the rhamnoside unit. According to the docking study of Jo and his collaborators (2019), quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <italic>D</italic>-glucoside, which is a homolog of quercitrin where rhamnoside is substituted by glucoside, showed that the hydroxymethylene group (CH
 <sub>2</sub>–OH) of the glucoside moiety creates a supplementary hydrogen bond with Glu169 that contributes to its closer binding to the S
 <sub>1</sub> subunit than the rhamnoside moiety of quercitrin. Moreover, the substitution of the flavonol with additional hydroxyl groups especially in A ring creates more interactions between the docked sites and the tested molecules. This was clearly observed in the study of 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al. (2020)</xref> which tested the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of 64 molecules belonging to ten different classes of flavonoids. According to this finding, flavonols were the most active compounds compared to the other classes of flavonoids. Indeed, morin, kaempferol and herbacetin bind with the MERS-CoV 3C-like protease. However, herbacetin which is a kaempferol derivative with an additional hydroxyl group at C-8 position had the strongest binding affinity compared to the other tested molecules. This molecule occupies the S
 <sub>1</sub> and S
 <sub>2</sub> sites of MERS-CoV 3CLpro and forms four hydrogen bonds. However, the main bond strengths were occurred between the C-8 position with Glu166, Gln189 and His41 (
