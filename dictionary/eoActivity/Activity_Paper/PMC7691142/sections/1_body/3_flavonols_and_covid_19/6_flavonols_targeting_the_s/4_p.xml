<p id="p0125">Both flavonols myricetin and linebacker indicated potential binding efficacy to the S protein, helicase and to many protease sites and had the ability to interact with the ACE2 receptor causing conformational changes and viral entry inhibition (

 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al. (2021)</xref> galangin, morin and myricetin exhibited good docking scores against spike glycoprotein in comparison with abacavir and hydroxychloroquine as standard drugs. In addition, according to the study of Tallei and his collaborators (2020) herbacetin, kaempferol and morin revealed a good ability to bind with S protein. Quercetin had a very strong ability to interact with to ACE2 receptor better than hydroxychloroquine and many other antiviral drugs, and possessed good binding interactions with S protein (

 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside, kaempferol-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside and kaempferol showed strong binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor. In fact, quercetin-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside presents a high binding affinity compared to kaempferol-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside, which indicates the important role of hydroxyl groups in the occurrence of hydrogen bonds (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Balmeh et al. (2020)</xref>, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinose (Rutin) had a strong binding affinity to the TMPRSS2. This enzyme is involved in proteolytic cleavage of the S1/S2 junction of the ACE2 receptor leading to viral endocytosis.
