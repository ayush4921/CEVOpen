<p id="p0115">The S protein is a homotrimeric glycoprotein located on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion which plays multifunctional roles in the COVID-19 viral infection transmission including host receptor binding, cell tropism, and pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Sigrist et al., 2020</xref>). The S protein is also the major target for the host immune system. According to 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Cheng (2020)</xref>, these proteins are considered as virulence determinants and powerful immunogenic molecules able to solicit the humoral immune response and considered as interesting epitopes for vaccine development and antibody-based therapeutic interventions (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2020</xref>). The S protein is a crucial recognition factor for virus attachment and entry to the host cells. In fact, the interaction with a high affinity and mutability between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located on the S1 subunit of the S protein and the ACE2 receptor undergoes several structural rearrangements and conformational changes in the S protein inducing the exposure of a proteolytic site. This latter is cleaved by the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS27 leading to the dissociation of the S1 subunit and the transition from the S2 subunit to a postfusion state which allows the endocytosis of the virus (

For this, molecules able to disturb and destabilize the binding between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor leading to the inhibition of membrane fusion and the viral nucleocapsid transfer could constitute effective drugs able to block the viral host cell attachment and endocytosis (
