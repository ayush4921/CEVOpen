<p id="p0080">Quercetin decreases the clinical signs of chronic arthritis induced by adjuvant in rats (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Mamani-Matsuda et al., 2006</xref>) and improves the inflammatory response (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Morikawa et al., 2003</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Makino et al. (2013)</xref>, glycosyl conjugation with specific sugar units enhances 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activities of quercetin. Indeed, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide had potent immunomodulatory and anti-atherogenic activities (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Derlindati et al., 2012</xref>) and exerted an interesting anti-inflammatory effect by the suppression of JNK and ERK signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Isorhamnetin contributes to the inhibition of acute inflammatory response by the inhibition of JNK and AKT/IKKα/β pathways activation which leads to NF-κB inactivation (
 <xref rid="bib163" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). This metabolite inhibits the reactive oxygen species production induced by LPS and acts as a natural COX-2 inhibitor (
 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2014</xref>). Isorhamnetin and its sulfate derivative persicarin possess antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Ku et al., 2013</xref>). Isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosyl-rhamnosyl-rhamnoside and isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosyl-rhamnoside exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effects by several mechanisms of action including the regulation of cytokines secretion, the suppression of cellular infiltration, and the inhibition of nitric oxide production and COX-2 activity. However, isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosyl-rhamnosyl-rhamnoside is less active than isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosyl-rhamnoside, suggesting that the glycosylation profile affects the bioactivity (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Antunes-Ricardo et al., 2015</xref>). Kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucorhamnoside has a potent anti-inflammatory effect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2019a</xref>). The anti-inflammatory activity of myricetin was reported in several studies on animal models 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">Semwal et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, this molecule showed a high anti-inflammatory activity against the 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>-induced inflammatory response in host cells and prevented NF-κB activation in a monocyte model. In addition, this molecule inhibited the secretion of many cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8 (
