<p id="p0140">Fisetin, quercetin and hyperoside displayed high affinities with the RNA-polymerase active site, and the nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase-fingers site (NiRAN) compared to remdesivir as the control drug. Indeed, hyperoside forms the maximum possible number of non-covalent interactions with RNA-polymerase site due to the presence of galactose moiety. Moreover, fisetin with the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-5 position of B ring showed a strong binding affinity than that of quercetin for the RNA polymerase NiRAN-fingers site. This could be explained by the absence of chelating bonds between the ketone function in C-4 position and OH group in C-5, which liberate the free doublets of the ketone function leading to the formation of more hydrogen and electrostatic bonds (
