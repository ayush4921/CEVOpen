<p id="p0055">One of the promising therapeutic strategies against Covid-19 virus infection is the search for enzyme inhibitors in natural compounds using molecular docking in order to obtain products with minimal side effects. Among natural compounds, the flavonoids class constitutes a possible target for antiviral drugs due to its large spectrum of biological properties (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities) (

Also, these molecules had a broad spectrum of biological activities (anti-HIV, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective effects), that could reduce the severity of infection symptoms and enhance the immune response of the patient (
