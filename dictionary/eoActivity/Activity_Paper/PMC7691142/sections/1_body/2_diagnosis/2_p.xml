Virus demonstration in respiratory or blood specimens by special molecular and serological assays including the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR), gene sequencing and the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies (

The high cost of ELISA test and the low sensitivity of RT-PCR due to problems with sample collection and transportation, RNA extraction, implies that many COVID-19 patients are not identified (false-negative cases) and do not receive the appropriate treatment in time and constitute a high risk of contagiously to the population. For this, as an important complement to RT-PCR, Chest CT scan is used. This routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis is a performing manner to produce a fast diagnosis for COVID-19 (
