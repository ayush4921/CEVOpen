<p id="p0050">No special available antiviral drugs or vaccines against coronavirus disease were clinically approved. Actually, The treatment is symptomatic and based on the use of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and immunomodulating therapies (Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, etc., â€¦) (

Vitamins D and C play a crucial role in the reduction of respiratory tract infections risks by minimizing viral replication rates and the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These vitamins enhance the antioxidant response by the neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate the innate immune response and assist immunoregulation (

Monoclonal antibodies able to bind with the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 constitute a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection (
