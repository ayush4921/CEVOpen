<p id="p0155">The use of flavonol glycosides as future drugs had some inconvenience. The presence of sugar moieties usually increases the bioavailability of flavonoid aglycone. But in some cases, the nature of the substituted sugar affects the digestibility and the absorbability of these natural compounds. Indeed, flavonols with glucose moieties are absorbed more rapidly than flavonoids with rhamnosides, rhamnoglucosides, rutinosides and neohesperidosides substitutions (

However, the lack of α- L -rhamnosidase or rutinosidase in human cells makes the bioavailability of relative flavonoids largely dependent on their hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria (

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Amaretti et al., 2015</xref>), but the tested molecules could be active even after the cleavage of the glycosidic part by hydrolyzing enzymes in the human gastrointestinal tract because the bioavailability of the molecules is due to the aglycone part (

However, the use of smart drug delivery technologies such as polymeric nanoparticles/microspheres, inorganic nanoparticles, phospholipid vesicles, inclusion complex, micelles and other nanomaterials may increase the absorbability, reduce the bioavailability limitations and improve the therapeutic effects (
