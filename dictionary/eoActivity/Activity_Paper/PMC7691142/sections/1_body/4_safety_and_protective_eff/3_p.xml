<p id="p0150">Isorhamnetin derivatives were revealed to be non-toxic towards several cell lines (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Ressaissi et al., 2017</xref>). Isorhamnetin possesses many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects and hepatoprotective activities (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). The pretreatment with isorhamnetin reduces significantly the Doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity (
 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Also, this molecule had neuroprotective (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and renoprotective properties (
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Morin subchronic toxicity was studied 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> on both sexes of F344 rats and the no-observed-adverse-effect level was estimated. During 13 weeks of the treatment, no mortalities or abnormal clinical signs were observed. However, the treatment induces a significant increase in several biochemical parameters (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Morin had 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects on doxorubicin-induced hepatorenal toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Kuzu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, this molecule displays cardioprotective and neuroprotective activities (
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Long-term feeding of fisetin to mice was safe, no toxic signs were observed at doses up to 2Â g/kg. Also, no histological modifications were observed in multiple tissues (lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, heart, stomach, intestine, testes, and ovary) (
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2016</xref>). Fisetin possesses interesting protective effects on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib170" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) and protects the liver from binge alcohol-induced toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Koneru et al., 2016</xref>). This molecule has neuroprotective effects and protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Fazel Nabavi and Braidy, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2020</xref>). Also, fisetin supplementation improves insulin resistance and inflammatory response against metabolic stress-inducing renal injury (
