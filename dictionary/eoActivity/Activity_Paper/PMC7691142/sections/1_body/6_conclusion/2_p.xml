<p id="p0160">The evidence reviewed in the present study based on recent computational and experimental investigations indicated that flavonoids and especially flavonols class may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. Indeed, flavonols have the ability to disturb and destabilize the binding between S protein and ACE2 receptor leading to the inhibition of virus entry and able to halt the activity of several enzymes involved in the replication cycle of the virus including 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, PL
 <sup>pro</sup> and RdRp. Due to their large spectrum of biological activities, these molecules may alleviate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and modulate the immune response.
