<p>There is evidence to suggest that ATF3 inhibits the inflammatory response (
 <xref rid="b25-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thus, the effect of ATF3 on the inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators by HBL and HBB was investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, HBL and HBB rapidly increased the expression of ATF3. In addition, HBL and HBB dose-dependently increased the ATF3 protein expression level (
 <xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The knockdown of ATF3 by transfection with ATF3 siRNA was observed to attenuate the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of iNOS and IL-1Î² (
 <xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). These results indicate that the upregulation of ATF3 by HBL and HBB may be associated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.
