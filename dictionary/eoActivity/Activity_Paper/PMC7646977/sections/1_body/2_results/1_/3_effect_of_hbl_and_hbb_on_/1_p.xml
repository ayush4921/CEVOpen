<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="f5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, HBL significantly increased the expression of HO-1 protein from 1 h after treatment. The expression level of HO-1 was observed to be highest at 6 h of HBL treatment, and gradually decreased when the treatment duration was &gt;6 h. HBB started to significantly increase the expression level of HO-1 protein from 6 h of treatment, and the level continued to increase until 24 h after treatment. The effect of different HBL and HBB concentrations on HO-1 protein expression levels were also examined. As the previous results confirmed that the HO-1 expression induced by HBL and HBB was highest at 6 and 10 h after the start of treatment, respectively, RAW264.7 cells were treated with HBL and HBB for 6 and 10 h. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, HBL and HBB concentration-dependently increased the HO-1 protein level. Furthermore, whether the increase in HO-1 protein level induced by HBL and HBB was associated with the LPS-mediated overexpression of iNOS and IL-1β was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the knockdown of HO-1 by transfection with HO-1 siRNA blocked the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of iNOS and IL-1β in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (
