<p>It has been reported that ROS increase the expression of HO-1 and are upstream of p38 (
 <xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Isoegomaketone has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators through the activation of a ROS/p38/HO-1 pathway (
 <xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, the effect of ROS/p38 signaling on the HBL- and HBB-mediated expression of HO-1 was investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, the inhibition of p38 by SB203580 and of ROS by NAC suppressed the HBL- and HBB-induced expression of HO-1. Thus, whether HBL and HBB induce the production of ROS was investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, ROS production was observed in HBL- and HBB-treated RAW264.7 cells. In addition, HBL and HBB increased the phosphorylation level of p38 (
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), and the inhibition of ROS by NAC attenuated the HBL and HBB-induced p38 phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB induced HO-1 expression through the ROS-dependent activation of p38.
