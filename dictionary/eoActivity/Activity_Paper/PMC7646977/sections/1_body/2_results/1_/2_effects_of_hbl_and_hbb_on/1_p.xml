<p>The ability of HBL and HBB to inhibit the LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB was investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, HBL and HBB did not suppress the LPS-induced degradation of IκB-α; however, HBL and HBB significantly attenuated the LPS-induced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65 (
 <xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB may inhibit the activation of NF-κB signaling independently of IκB-α degradation. Whether HBL and HBB inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway was also investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, LPS increased the phosphorylation levels of p38 and ERK1/2, which was not inhibited by HBL. However, HBB significantly attenuated the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 but not that of ERK1/2. These results indicate that HBL did not inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, whereas HBB inhibited the activation of p38.
