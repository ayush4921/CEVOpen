<p>Total flavonoid content was measured according to a previously described method with some modifications (
 <xref rid="b23-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, 20 µl HBL, HBB or HBF (50 mg/ml), 80 µl distilled water and 6 µl 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 12 µl 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. After 6 min, 40 µl 1 M NaOH was added and the mixture was incubated for 11 min at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC).
