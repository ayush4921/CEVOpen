<p>An analysis of the anti-inflammatory compounds in HBL, HBB and HBF was performed using a Waters 1525 HPLC system with Waters 2487-dual λ absorbance detector (Waters Corporation). The column was equipped with a SunFire™ C18 column (250×4.6 mm; Waters Corporation), and the binary mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid (solvent B). The flow rate was kept constant at 1.0 ml/min at 37°C for a total run time of 40 min. The mobile phase was programmed consecutively in a linear gradient as follows: 0–5 min (10% A); 5–10 min (10→15% A); 10–15 min (15% A), and 15–40 min (15→40% A). The injection volume of the extract was 10 µl and the elution was monitored at 254 nm. The anti-inflammatory compounds of HBL, HBB and HBF were identified by comparison with the chromatograms of analytical standards, including protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid.</p>
