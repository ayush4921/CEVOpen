<p>RT-PCR was performed according to a previously described method (
 <xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). After treatment, total RNA was extracted from the cells using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, Inc.), and cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 µg) using a Verso cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using a PCR Master Mix (Promega Corporation) and mouse primers for iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and GAPDH as follows: iNOS: Forward, 5′-ttgtgcatcgacctaggctggaa-3′ and reverse, 5′-gacctttcgcattagcatggaagc-3′; COX-2: Forward, 5′-gtactggctcatgctggacga-3′ and reverse, 5′-caccatacactgccaggtcagcaa-3′; IL-1β: Forward, 5′-ggcaggcagtatcactcatt-3′ and reverse, 5′-cccaaggccacaggtattt-3′; IL-6: Forward, 5-gaggataccactcccaacagacc-3 and reverse, 5-aagtgcatcatcgttgttcataca-3; TNF-α: Forward, 5′-tggaactggcagaagaggca-3′ and reverse, 5′-tgctcctccacttggtggtt-3′; GAPDH: Forward, 5′-ggactgtggtcatgagcccttcca-3′ and reverse, 5′-actcacggcaaattcaacggcac-3′. PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94°C for denaturation, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C for denaturation, 1 min at 55°C for annealing and 1 min at 72°C for elongation and final extension for 10 min at 72°C. The PCR results were visualized using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and Safe Shine Green (10,000 X; Biosesang). The density of the mRNA bands was calculated using the software UN-SCAN-IT gel version 5.1.
