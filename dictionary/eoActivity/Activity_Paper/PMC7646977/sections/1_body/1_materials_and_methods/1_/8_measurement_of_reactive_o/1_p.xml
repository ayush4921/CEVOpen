<p>The levels of ROS produced by HBL- and HBB-treated RAW264.7 cells were measured with DCFH-DA staining. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells plated on a 96-well plate (3×10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) for 24 h were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB at 37°C for 24 h. The culture medium was then removed, and the cells were treated with DCFH-DA (10 µM) for 20 min at 37°C in the dark. After washing the cells three times with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC).
