<p>MTT assay for measuring cell viability was performed according to the method described in a previous study (
 <xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, the cells were plated on a 96-well plate at a density of 3×10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well, followed by treatment with HBL and HBB (0, 100 or 200 µg/ml) at 37°C for 24 h. Next, the cells were treated with 50 µl MTT solution (1 mg/ml) at 37°C for 4 h. After 4 h, the cell culture supernatant was removed and DMSO was added to dissolve the resulting crystals. The formation of formazan was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC).
