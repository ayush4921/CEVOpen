<p>The present study also indicated that HBL and HBB upregulated the HO-1 protein expression level through the ROS/p38-dependent activation of Nrf2, and that HO-1 knockdown inhibited the downregulation of inflammatory mediators by HBL and HBB. It has previously been shown that ROS induce the expression of HO-1 through the p38-dependent activation of Nrf2 (

 <xref rid="b43-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which can inhibit the inflammatory process. Therefore, Nrf2 activators are considered potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various human diseases, including inflammatory diseases (

 <xref rid="b46-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is known to regulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 (

However, ROS induces the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus through the degradation of Keap1. Nuclear Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element and induces the transcription of HO-1 (

 <xref rid="b47-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="b48-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), we hypothesize that ROS produced by HBL and HBB may induce Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus through the degradation of Keap1, contributing the expression of HO-1. Thus, the present data may provide evidence of a link between ROS/p38/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and the anti-inflammatory activity of HBL and HBB.
