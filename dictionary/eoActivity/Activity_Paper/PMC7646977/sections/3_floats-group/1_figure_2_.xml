  <p>Effects of HBL and HBB on the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. Total RNA was extracted after the treatment. GAPDH was used as the internal control for analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. *P&lt;0.05 vs. untreated cells and 
   <sup>#</sup>P&lt;0.05 vs. cells treated with LPS alone. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX, cyclooxygenase; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; IL-6, interleukin 6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α.
