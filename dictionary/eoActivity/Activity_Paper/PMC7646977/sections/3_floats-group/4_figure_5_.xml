  <p>Effects of HBL and HBB on HO-1 expression in RAW264.7 cells. (A) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for the indicated times. (B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with HBL (100 and 200 µg/ml) for 6 h or HBB (100 and 200 µg/ml) for 10 h. The cell lysates were subjected to and western blotting was performed using an antibody against HO-1. Actin was used as an internal control for western blot analysis. (C) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with control or HO-1 siRNA for 48 h. After the transfection, the cells were pretreated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. After the treatment, total RNA was prepared. *P&lt;0.05 vs. cells without HBL or HBB treatment. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA.</p>
