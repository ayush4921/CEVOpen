  <p>Effects of HBL and HBB on ATF3 expression. (A) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for the indicated times. (B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 1 h. For western blot analysis, the cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting was performed using an antibody against ATF3. Actin was used as an internal control for western blot analysis. (C) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with control or ATF3 siRNA for 48 h. After transfection, the cells were pretreated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. After the treatment, total RNA was extracted. *P&lt;0.05 vs. cells without HBL and HBB treatment. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; ATF3, activating transcription factor-3; siRNA, small interfering RNA; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; IL-1β, interleukin 1β.</p>
