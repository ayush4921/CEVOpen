  <p>Comparison of the inhibitory effects of HBL, HBB and HBF on the LPS-induced production of NO, iNOS and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells. (A) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 µg/ml HBL, HBB or HBF for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. The concentration of NO in the cell culture medium was measured by Griess assay. (B) Total RNA was extracted after the treatment. GAPDH was used as internal control for analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. *P&lt;0.05 vs. cells treated with LPS alone. (C) Contents of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds in HBL, HBB and HBF were analyzed. (D) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 µg/ml ibuprofen, HBL or HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. The concentration of NO in the cell culture medium was measured by Griess assay. *P&lt;0.05 vs. untreated cells and 
   <sup>#</sup>P&lt;0.05 vs. cells treated with LPS alone. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; HBF, honeyberry flower extract; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide.
