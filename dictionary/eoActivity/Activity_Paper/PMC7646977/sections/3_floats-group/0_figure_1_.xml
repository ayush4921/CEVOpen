  <p>Effects of HBL and HBB on NO production and cell viability in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. (A) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 20 h. The concentration of NO in the cell culture medium was measured by Griess assay. (B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 24 h. The cell viability was then measured using MTT assay. (C) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB in the absence or presence of LPS (1 µg/ml) for 24 h. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay. *P&lt;0.05 vs. the untreated cells and 
   <sup>#</sup>P&lt;0.05 vs. the cells treated with LPS alone. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; NO, nitric oxide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide.
