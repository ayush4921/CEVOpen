 <sup>TM</sup> software (version 12) was used to determine the optimized extraction process parameter. The desirability function was applied to the optimizing stage in order to maximize the yield of KA. The optimal conditions for the three parameters of the extraction process were estimated: The methanol concentration was 79.99%, the extraction temperature was 60.02 °C, the extraction time was 5.0 min, and the KA yield was 94.7 ng/spot. The extraction process was repeated, the optimum extraction conditions, i.e., an 80% methanol concentration at 60 °C for 5 min, and the KA yield was 94.65 ± 0.5. There was no significant difference (
