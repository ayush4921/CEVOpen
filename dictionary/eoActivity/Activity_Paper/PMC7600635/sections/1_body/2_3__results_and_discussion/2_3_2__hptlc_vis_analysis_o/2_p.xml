 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99). Validation parameters such as the LOD and the LOQ were used to confirm the accuracy and precision of the proposed method with reproducible results. The validation parameters in the current study were large (LOD = 8.16 ng; LOQ = 18.142 ng), indicating that the method used here was more sensitive than the HPTLC methods used for previous KA analyses [
