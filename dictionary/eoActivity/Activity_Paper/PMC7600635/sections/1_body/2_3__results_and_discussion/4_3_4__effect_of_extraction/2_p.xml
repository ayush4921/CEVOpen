<p>The parameter variables in this study were methanol concentration (A), extraction temperature (B), and extraction time (C). The effects of the parameter variables and their interactions on the KA contents in the ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> were examined. The third variable was assigned to be constant at the intermediate setting, while the two independent variables were displayed on three-dimensional surface plots.
