 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01379-f005">Figure 5</xref>A shows that the yield of the KA content rapidly increased and reached the maximum value at 0 level of extraction time when the methanol concentration increased from 40% to 79.99%. The extraction temperature was fixed at 60.02 °C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01379-f005">Figure 5</xref>B shows how the KA content was affected by the interaction between the methanol concentration and the extraction time at a fixed extraction temperature level of 0. The maximum KA content was obtained when the methanol concentration was at 80%. The KA yield content decreased slightly when the methanol concentration was increased to 80%. The extraction time was fixed at 5.0 min. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01379-f005">Figure 5</xref>C shows that the KA yield rapidly increased and reached the maximum value at 0 level of methanol concentration when the extraction temperature increased from 40 to 60 °C. The extraction time was fixed at 5.0 min. Interestingly, when the extraction temperature exceeded 60 °C, the yield of the extracted KA rapidly decreased. This result confirmed the fact that the solubility of the solute was enhanced when the temperature increased, resulting in a higher yield. However, the solvent density could be simultaneously reduced when the temperature increased, consequently decreasing the total flavonoid yield. This would mean that either a positive or negative effect could occur when the temperature increased [
