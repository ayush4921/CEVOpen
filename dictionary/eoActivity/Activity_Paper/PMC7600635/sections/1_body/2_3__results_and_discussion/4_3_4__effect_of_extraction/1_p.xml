<p>The ANOVA and the contributions of each independent variable for the extraction of KA from ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Oci</italic>
 <italic>mum basilicum</italic> were determined. The linear, interaction, and quadratic variables were significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), thus indicating that the KA yield was affected by all of the variables, the interactions between variables, and the square of each variable. The model in the study showed a high degree of precision (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9735), and the experiment values were reliable (% Coefficient of Variation (CV) = 0.55) [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Aiming to visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the KA yield, three-dimensional (3D) plots were constructed based on the generated quadratic polynomial model equation of coded factors:
 <disp-formula>KA yield = 90.15 + 0.4375 × A + 1.2875 × B + 1.73543 × 10
  <sup>−15</sup> × C + 1.75 × AB + 0.025 × AC + −0.725 × BC + 1.2 × A
  <sup>2</sup> + 1.89196 × 10
  <sup>−14</sup> × B
  <sup>2</sup> + −0.825 × C
