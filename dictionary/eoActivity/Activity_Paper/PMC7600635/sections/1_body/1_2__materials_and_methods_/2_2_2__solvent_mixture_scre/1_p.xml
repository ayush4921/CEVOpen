<p>Different solvent mixtures (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01379-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were tested in order to maximize the extraction of total flavonoids. The higher flavonoid content positively reflected the amount of the desired KA compound. For each of the five solvent mixtures, 2 g of lyophilized basil were ground with a mortar and pestle with 20 mL of the appropriate solvent mixture. The mixture was transferred to a flask, and 100 mL of a different solvent mixture was added. The resulting solution was then transferred to a 200 mL cylindrical polypropylene container with a screw-on lid before insertion into an ultrasonic bath cleaner (UBC; Elmasonic P30, Elma Hans Schmidbauer GMBH, Singen, Germany) at a 37 kHz frequency, 35 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup> power, and 60 Â°C for 15 min.
