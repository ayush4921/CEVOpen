<p>The total flavonoid content of each sample was quantified with the aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Quercetin was used to make the standard calibration curve for total flavonoid content. Quercetin (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol, after which serial dilutions were prepared with methanol (5–200 mg/mL). Each of the serial dilutions was mixed with 0.6 mL of 2% aluminum chloride and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. A UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Sunny UV.7804C, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the absorbance of the reaction mixtures at the 420 nm wavelength and compared to a blank slide.
