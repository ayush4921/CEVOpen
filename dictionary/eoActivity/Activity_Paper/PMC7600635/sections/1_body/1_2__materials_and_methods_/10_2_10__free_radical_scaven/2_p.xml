<p>Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and L-ascorbic acid were used as reference standards with the unit of probits for the inhibition ratio. Probit values were plotted against the logarithmic values of test samples concentrations using a linear regression curve to establish the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values (μg/mL). All analyses were repeated in triplicate, with results expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using the Waller–Duncan test with alpha = 0.05.
