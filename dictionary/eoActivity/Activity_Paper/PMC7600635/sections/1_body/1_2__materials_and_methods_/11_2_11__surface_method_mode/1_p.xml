<p>Experiment results were analyzed with the Design-Expert™ (version 12) software (alpha = 0.05). The three factors of methanol concentration, extraction temperature, and extraction time were simultaneously optimized using the response surface method (RSM). A subsequent ultrasonic-assisted extraction experiment was completed in triplicate using the optimized conditions, and the KA yield was compared with the predicted values for the validation of the model. A mean comparison using Tukey’s test was performed with STATISTICA 13 (alpha = 0.05).</p>
