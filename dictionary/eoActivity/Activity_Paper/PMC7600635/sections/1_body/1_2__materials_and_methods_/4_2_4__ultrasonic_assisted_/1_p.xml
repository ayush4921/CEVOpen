 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> (10 g) was weighed and placed in each one of the 200 mL glass flasks used. Different percentages of methanol (40%, 60%, and 80%) with 100 mL of solvent each were added to corresponding flasks and moved to a 120 mL cylindrical polypropylene container with a screw-on lid before insertion into the UBC. The UBC was operated at a 37 kHz frequency and 50% constant power for all treatments, and an adjustable water bath was used to reach the desired temperature before initiating ultrasonic treatment. According to the manufacturer’s effective power rating, an ultrasonic power at a 50% power setting was used at 35 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The selected mixture was investigated at three different temperatures (40, 50, and 60 °C) over three ultrasonic treatment periods of 5, 10, and 15 min. Each UBC setting was repeated in triplicate with samples before changing to the next setting. After UBC treatment, the upper layer of samples was filtered (Whatman no. 1 paper) and subjected to rotary evaporation at 40 °C with a vacuum in order to remove the solvent [
