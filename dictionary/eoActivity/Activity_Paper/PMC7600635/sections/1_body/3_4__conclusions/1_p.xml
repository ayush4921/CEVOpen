<p>The data obtained from the current study showed that the HPTLC-VIS densitometric method and the BBD were efficient for the identification and quantitative analysis of KA from basil leaves. The interaction and the quadratic terms of each factor from all three variables had significant effects on the KA yield. A quadratic model for the KA yield was derived with R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99. The current study revealed that the use of methanol (79.99%) at 60 Â°C for 5 min comprised the optimal conditions for extracting a high yield of KA from ultrasonicated basil leaf extracts. Under these conditions, the KA yield was 94.7 (ng/spot), which was consistent with the predicted yield value. The isolated KA exhibited and offered a higher antioxidant activity compared to the reference of ascorbic acid and BHT. This study thus demonstrated, for the first time, the utilization of a solvent system that can be used with higher efficiency during the HPTLC-VIS analysis of KA. The used solvent system provided a high quality resolution of KA peaks. The LOD and LOQ values were found to be comparatively low, thus supporting the high sensitivity of the developed method. In addition, this method was supported by statistical analysis that highlighted how the proposed method is reproducible and specific for this type of extraction.
