I) Normal cells (Negative control); II) Normal cells + DMSO 1%; III) APAP-induced cells (Positive control); IV) Positive control + RBLE 25 μg/mL; V) Positive control + RBLE 100 μg/mL. Based on Kruskal-Wallis Test (P &lt; 0.05) and Mann-Whitney Test (P &lt; 0.05), there are significant different between group.
