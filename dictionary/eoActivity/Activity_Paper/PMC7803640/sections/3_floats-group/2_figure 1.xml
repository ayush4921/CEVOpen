  <p>RBLE treatment effect toward TNF-α concentration in APAP-induced HepG2 cells as hepatotoxicity model. (A) TNF-α concentration (pg/mL) on hepatotoxicity model. (B) TNF-α concentration (pg/mg protein) on hepatotoxicity model. ∗Data was included as mean ± standard deviation. I) Normal cells as negative control; II) Normal cells + DMSO 1% as vehicle control; III) APAP-induced cells (Positive control); IV) Positive control + RBLE 25 μg/mL; V) Positive control + RBLE 100 μg/mL. Significance among treatments toward TNF-α concentration was presented as different letters (a,b) based on Tukey HSD post hoc test (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
