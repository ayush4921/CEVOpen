  <p>Proposed RLBE hepatoprotective mechanism in liver injury model. ∗CYP2E1 act to transform APAP to NAPQI. It induce GSH depletion then induce production of ROS. The excessive of ROS decrease the GPX gene expression leads to increase cell death. NAPQI activate the kupper cell and leads to TNF-α production that induce the JNK signaling pathways that also increase ROS level and leads to upregulate cell necrosis; increase inflammation; and induce cell death. While JNK induced the Bcl-2 down-regulation and Bax up-regulation, resulting in activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 that leads to apoptosis cells. The RLBE treatments could inhibit the excessive ROS and TNF-α. It also could lowering the necrosis and apoptosis that leads to lowering inflammation. RBLE treatments decrease the cell death and increase the survival hepatic cells.</p>
