  <p>RBLE effect toward apoptotic, necrotic, dead cells in hepatotoxicity model. (A) Live cells on hepatotoxicity model. (B) Early apoptotic on hepatotoxicity model. (C) Late apoptotic on hepatotoxicity model. (D) Necrotic on hepatotoxicity model. ∗Data was included as mean ± standard deviation. I) Normal cells as negative control; II) Normal cells + DMSO 1% as vehicle control; III) APAP-induced cells (Positive control); IV) Positive control + RBLE 25 μg/mL; V) Positive control + RBLE 100 μg/mL. There are significant different between all groups based on Kruskal-Wallis Test (P &lt; 0.05) and Mann-Whitney Test (P &lt; 0.05). It was marked as single star (∗) marks for the statistical difference between positive control and negative control while the hashtag (#) mark for statistical difference between treatment and positive control.</p>
