<p id="p0030">The cells that used in this study is human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line (ATCC, HB-8065™) from Aretha Medika Utama Biomolecular and Biomedical Research Center, Bandung, Indonesia. It was grown in complete medium with composition: Modified Eagle Medium (MEM) (Biowest, L0416-500), fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest, S1810) as much as 10% (v/v), antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062) as much as 1% (v/v), also nanomycopulitine (Biowest, LX16) addition) as much as 1% of (v/v). Acetaminophen (Sigma Aldrich, A7085) with concentration at 40 mM was used to induce the hepatotoxicity. When the cells were confluent, it was rinsed using PBS and detached using trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25200072) with incubation at 37 °C. In 6 well plates, the cells was seeded (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and then incubated at the same temperature with 5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. The cells was induced by RBLE and incubated again for 24 h. According to the treatment, it was divided into 5 groups: I) Normal Cells; II) DMSO1%; III) APAP 40 mM; IV) APAP 40 mM + RBLE 25 μg/mL; V) APAP 40 Mm + RBLE 100 μg/mL. Then it was centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as sample for the Elisa assay (
