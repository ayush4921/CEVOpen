<p id="p0035">Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma Aldrich, A9576) was used as standard in this method. Briefly standard solutions as much as 20 μL also same volume for the samples was mixed with Quick Start Dye Reagen 1X (Biorad, 5000205) as much as 200 μL into each well in 96 well plate. The mixture then incubated at room temperature for around 5 min. The wavelength at 595 nm was used to determine the mixture absorbance by using microplate reader (Multiskan™ GO Micro plate Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, 51119300) at 595 nm. The result from this assay was used for normalization of TNF-α data calculation (
