In small percentage, the cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzymes was oxidizing the APAP and form N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a highly reactive intermediate, which is detoxified by covalent binding with glutathione (GSH). However, in APAP poisoning, it will generates excess NAPQI which evokes the GSH depletion that binds to macromolecules triggering oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately resulting in hepatocellular death (

Although the mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity that induced by APAP still unclear, some evidences was indicate that inflammation mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) also oxidative stress was contribute to the APAP-induced acute liver damage pathology process (
