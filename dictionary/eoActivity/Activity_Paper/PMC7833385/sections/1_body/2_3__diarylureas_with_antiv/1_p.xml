<p>Today, viruses represent the most common cause of infections in the world; therefore, research is being conducted to identify new safe and effective antivirals [
 <xref rid="B72-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Among the several virus families, the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> one has attracted the attention of some research groups working on the diarylureas field. It includes Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), many of which cause serious human and animal infections. Micewicz et al. (2018) described the identification of potent inhibitors of Zika virus infection, which is a mosquito-borne RNA virus, with picomolar activity in vitro. Compounds ASN 07115854, ASN 07115873, ASN 07115881, and ASN 07115927 (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00092-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were active in the low nanomolar or picomolar range (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 160.3 nM, 189.2 pM, 317.7 pM and 26.9 nM, respectively) as assessed by using a viral plaque-forming assay and the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line, described as highly permissive to Zika infection [
 <xref rid="B73-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In a successive paper by the same research group, a new library of diarylureas was screened using the same assay. Several compounds in the library showed high inhibitory activity against Zika virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the picomolar range. The most interesting compound was 
 <bold>25</bold> which exhibited an excellent IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 85.1 pM [
 <xref rid="B74-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Recently, several diarylureas have been studied for the treatment of DENV. New compounds binding the flavivirus NS5 AdoMet-dependent mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) domain, a main component of DENV replication complex, were proposed using a fragment-based drug design. Compounds 
 <bold>26</bold> and 
 <bold>27</bold> were the most interesting compounds, as they showed high inhibitory effect in both DENV N7-MTase assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 91 µM and 110 µM, respectively) and in WNV 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-MTase assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 51 µM and 71 µM, respectively) [
