<p>Neuroinflammation has been connected to neurodegenerative disorders of the brain, such as AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) plays an essential part in neuroinflammation and has been recently reviewed [

 <bold>56</bold> was predicted to target the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), which is also a potential target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the bioassay validation of CXCR2 with this compound was not performed [
