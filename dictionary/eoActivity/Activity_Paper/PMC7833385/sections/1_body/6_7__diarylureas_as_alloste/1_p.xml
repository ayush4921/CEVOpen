<p>The activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB
 <sub>1</sub>) is essential for the development of an effective innate immune response during bacterial infection [
 <xref rid="B87-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Diarylurea PSNCBAM-1 is an allosteric modulator of CB
 <sub>1</sub> and antagonized G protein coupling [
 <xref rid="B88-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Starting from this lead compound, several analogues have been studied. Compounds

 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00092-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), bearing a pyrimidine ring, were shown act as allosteric modulators of CB
 <sub>1</sub> while showing an antagonism of G-protein coupling activity. They ascertained extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated via β-arrestin [
 <xref rid="B89-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In a recent work, several restricted derivatives of PSNCBAM-1 were studied. Compounds LDK1317 and LDK1321 exhibited binding affinity (
