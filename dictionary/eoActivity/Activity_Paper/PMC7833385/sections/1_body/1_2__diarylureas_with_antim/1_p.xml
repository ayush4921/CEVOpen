<p>Antimicrobials are small molecules that can inhibit or kill bacteria. However, some bacteria can grow and survive despite antimicrobial pressures, a characteristic known as antimicrobial resistance. In clinical settings, resistant bacterial infections decrease the achievable treatment options and increase morbidity and mortality, compared with those caused by susceptible microbes [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, traditional bactericidal antibiotics kill only actively growing bacterial cells, whereas non-growing metabolically inactive cells are tolerant to and therefore “persist” in the presence of legacy antibiotics. Thus, the discovery of new antibiotics may be envisaged. Triclocarban (TCC,

 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00092-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) is a diarylurea used as an antimicrobial agent in feminine care products, such as bar soaps, deodorants, detergents, and other disinfectants [
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Besides its antimicrobial activity, TCC has been acknowledged as an endocrine disruptor, i.e., “an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function(s) of the endocrine system and consequently causes side effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub)populations” (World Health Organization 2013) resulting in hormonal effects [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, TCC demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged murine model [

 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and is associated to potential adverse birth outcomes in neonates, in particular decreased gestational age at birth [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The biodegradation of TCC is very slow as a result of its three chlorine atoms; thus, it can persist in the environment for years and it accumulates in aquatic habitats [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For these reasons, since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned its use in consumer products [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The mechanism of action against bacteria is still unknown. Unlike other antibacterial compounds, triclocarban does not interfere with the membrane. Therefore, it may act as an inhibitor of lipoprotein synthesis, by mimicking the natural substrate of enoyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme. ENR is a highly conserved enzyme of lipid biosynthetic pathways in bacteria, notably gram-negative, gram-positive, and mycobacterial species [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Macsics et al. (2020) recently studied the TCC mechanism of action. Protein demethylmenaquinone methyltranferase (MenG) was proposed as the molecular target of TCC, which inhibits its biosynthesis finally leading to inhibition of the
