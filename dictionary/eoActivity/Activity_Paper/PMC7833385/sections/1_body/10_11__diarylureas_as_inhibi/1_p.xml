<p>The genetic predisposition has been suggested to be involved in COVID-19 disease transmission. Genetic polymorphisms in other multiple genes, such as that codifying for the AChE, is relevant to SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. Several diarylureas were studied for their action on AChE for the treatment of AD. Compound
