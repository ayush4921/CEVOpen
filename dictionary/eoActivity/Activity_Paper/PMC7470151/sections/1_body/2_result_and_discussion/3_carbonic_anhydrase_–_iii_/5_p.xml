<p>The absorptivity (
 <italic>a</italic>) of the standard was then deduced from the known concentration and absorbance of the standard using Beerâ€“Lambert law. The concentration of ligand bound to CA-III (which represents the amount of ligand removed from the stationary phase as a result of binding to the enzyme) was measured again using the same equation.
