<p>Different concentrations of CA-III were injected in the chromatographic system containing a constant concentration (0.24 mM) of analytes 
 <bold>(12a–16a)</bold> in the mobile phase. HPLC quantification was generated with Shimadzu’s LC-solution software coupled with Shimadzu instrument. Absorbance (A) as a response in terms of detector signal is obtained from the negative-peak area determination. This response was utilised to measure the concentration or amount of the ligand bound with the CA-III enzyme [
 <italic>I
  <sub>B</sub>
 </italic>], by dividing the area obtained for absorbance of negative peak by absorptivity (a) of the standard ligand with known concentration according to Beer–Lambert law:
