<p>Compounds 
 <bold>12–16</bold> (2 mM) were suspended in distilled water, and 1 M NaOH solution (2 mM) was added to the reaction. The reaction mixture was warmed to 50 °C until the solution became clear and then the reaction mixture was kept in stirring at room temperature for 5 h. The reaction mixture was acidified by 1M HCl solution to pH 4 and the precipitate thus formed was collected by filtration, dried, and recrystallized with methanol and dichloromethane to get the hydrolysed compounds 
 <bold>12a–16a</bold> in quantitative yield (45–80%). Compounds 
 <bold>12a</bold> and 
 <bold>16a</bold> were prepared according to the reported procedure and their physical and spectral properties were found to be on par with the literature report
