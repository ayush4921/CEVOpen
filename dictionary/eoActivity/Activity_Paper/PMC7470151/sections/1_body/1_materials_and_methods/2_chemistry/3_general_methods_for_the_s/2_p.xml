<p>A mixture of appropriate aldehyde 
 <bold>1–5</bold> (9 mM) solution in dry diethyl ether (25 mL), and methyl dichloroacetate 
 <bold>6</bold> (10 mM) was kept in stirring at 0 
 <bold>°</bold>C. A pre-cooled solution of sodium methoxide (10 mM) in dry methanol was added drop wise to the aldehyde solution. After the completion of the sodium methoxide addition, the reaction mixture was kept in stirring at room temperature for 4 h. Then the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness, and the resulted creamy residue was suspended in distilled water followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated to yield the intermediate compounds 
 <bold>7–11</bold> as creamy oily residue that was used for the next step without any farther purification.
