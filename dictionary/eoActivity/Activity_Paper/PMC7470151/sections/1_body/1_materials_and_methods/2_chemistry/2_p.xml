<p>The progress of reactions was routinely monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (pre-coated Merck
 <sup>®</sup>), and spots were examined under the UV light (254 nm). Melting points were measured by open capillaries using a Stuart Scientific electro-thermal melting point apparatus (UK). FT-IR spectra were recorded on Thermo-Nicolet Avatar FT-IR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockville, MD).
