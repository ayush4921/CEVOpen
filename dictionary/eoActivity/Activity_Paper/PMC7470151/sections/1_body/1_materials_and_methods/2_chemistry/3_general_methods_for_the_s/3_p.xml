<p>Thiourea (9 mM) and the creamy residue (
 <bold>7–11</bold>) were dissolved in dry methanol and heated under reflux for 5 h and left under stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness to get the yellow precipitate and suspended in water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate, and evaporated to get the solid residue. The solid residue thus obtained was recrystallized with ethyl acetate, and hexane to get the crystals of compounds 
 <bold>12–16</bold> in quantitative yield (40–70%). Compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold> were prepared according to the reported procedure and their physical and spectral properties were found to be on par with the literature report
