<p>Compound 
 <bold>13/14/16</bold> (1.5 mM) was dissolved in dry dimethyl formamide, and phenyl isocyanate (2.0 mM) was added to the reaction. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Solvent was evaporated to dryness, and the solid residue thus obtained was recrystallized with ethyl acetate and hexane to get the compounds 
 <bold>13b, 4d,</bold> and 
 <bold>16b</bold>, respectively, in quantitative yields. Compound 
 <bold>13b</bold> on further hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide resulted in the formation of compound 
 <bold>13c</bold>.
