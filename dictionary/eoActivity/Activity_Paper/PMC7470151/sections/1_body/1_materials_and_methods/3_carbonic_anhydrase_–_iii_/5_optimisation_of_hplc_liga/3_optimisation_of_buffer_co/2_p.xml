<p>The effect of buffer concentration was investigated by systematically increasing the concentration from 0.2 to 35 mM. The column was thermostatted at 37 °C throughout the chromatographic run. The mobile phase composition was 10% acetonitrile in phosphate buffer with pH = 6. Optimum buffer concentration was considered to be 10 mM.</p>
