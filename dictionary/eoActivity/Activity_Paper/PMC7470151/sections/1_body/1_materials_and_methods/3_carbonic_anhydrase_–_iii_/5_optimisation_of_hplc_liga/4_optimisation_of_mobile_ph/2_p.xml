<p>The effect of pH was investigated by increasing pH in 0.5 increment rate starting from 5.5 to 7.5. Column pH toleration was taken into consideration and the maximum area of negative peak was chosen accordingly. The column was thermostatted at 37 °C. Optimum interaction was found at pH = 6.5.</p>
