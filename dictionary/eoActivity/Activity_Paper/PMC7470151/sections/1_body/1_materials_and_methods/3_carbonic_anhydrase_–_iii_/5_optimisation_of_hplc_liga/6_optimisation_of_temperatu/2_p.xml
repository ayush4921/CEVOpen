<p>The column temperature was gradually increased from 25  to 50 °C (which is the maximum tolerated temperature by the column). Selected temperatures were: 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45, and 50 °C. There was a sharp increase in the interaction by increasing temperature, however, increasing temperature could affect the column longevity, thereby 37 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature.</p>
