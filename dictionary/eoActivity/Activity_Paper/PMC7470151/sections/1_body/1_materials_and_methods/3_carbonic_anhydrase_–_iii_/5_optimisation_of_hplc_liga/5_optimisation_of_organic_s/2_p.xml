<p>The effect of organic modifier proportion was investigated by increasing the volume fraction of acetonitrile in the mobile phase by an increment of 5. Starting from 5 to 40%, the maximum area of negative peak was chosen accordingly, indicating higher interaction between enzyme and ligand. The column was thermostatted at 37 °C. Optimum interaction was observed by using 10% acetonitrile at a buffer concentration of 10 mM, and pH 6.5.</p>
