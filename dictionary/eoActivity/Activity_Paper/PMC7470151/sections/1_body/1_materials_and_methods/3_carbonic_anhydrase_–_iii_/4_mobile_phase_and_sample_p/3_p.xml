<p>The mobile phase used for analysis was chosen according to the optimised conditions obtained, where 10% of organic modifier, 30 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5) and 37 °C temperature was used. Column was pre-equilibrated with the mobile phase for 50 min. The flow rate of mobile phase was maintained at 1 mL/min during the run time. A wavelength of 230 nm (
