<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are a well-known superfamily of metalloenzymes, ubiquitously present in both prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes

 </xref>. CAs catalyse the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) into bicarbonate (HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) and proton (H
 <sup>+</sup>), thereby involved in various important physiological and pathophysiological processes including acid–base regulation, ion transport, electrolyte secretions, biosynthetic reactions, and calcifications

 <italic>δ</italic>, 
 <italic>ζ</italic>,

 <italic>ι</italic>-CAs. In human, 15 isoforms of α-CAs containing Zn(II) have been reported to date, where hCAs I-III, VII, and XIII are cytosolic isoforms, hCAs IV, IX, XII, and XIV are membrane-bound isoforms and hCAs VA and VB are mitochondrial isoforms, hCA VI is mainly secreted in saliva

A large number of potential small-molecule inhibitors have been developed and some are under current clinical trial investigations targeting hCAs as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various diseases including diuretics, glaucoma, edema, obesity, osteoporosis, epilepsy, pain, malaria, and cancer

 </xref>. It is worth mentioning that carboxylic acid group-containing environmental organic pollutants like perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) do exhibit toxicity by inhibiting hCAs, which in turn lead to the disturbance of normal physiological functions

 </xref>. However, hCA inhibitors (hCAIs) are found to be associated with various side effects mainly due to their lack of isoform specificity and off-target activity. Thus, current research efforts are focussed on the design and development of CA-specific inhibitors by using both traditional non-spectral and spectroscopic experimental approaches including recently reported innovative strategy of using narrow-bore nano-electronspray ionisation emitters in tandem with native mass spectrometry to enhance the accuracy of ligand-protein binding measurement
