<p id="Par79">A more systematic approach in cataloguing the potential effects of natural remedies/compounds will speed up the drug discovery process, in order to have more investigations done on unexplored compounds. Detailed mode of actions for each compound can be delineated using high throughput methods such as NGS coupled with various other confirmative studies such as transcriptomic validation, protein translation and function as well as epigenetic studies. Integrative analysis of such ‘omics’ data will allow researchers with an unprecedented speed in understanding the underlying pathophysiology this rare disease, developing effective biomarkers and pursuing meaningful clinical testing [

NGS can be implemented on HA research in identifying and validating potential targets through epigenetic studies, differential gene expression, genome sequencing and protein translation rates. Moreover, NGS sequencing can be used to discover biomarkers that can reflect the mechanism of action regulated by the natural remedy or compound [
