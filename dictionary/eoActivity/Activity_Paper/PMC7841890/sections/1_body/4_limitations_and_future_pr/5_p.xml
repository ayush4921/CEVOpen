<p id="Par78">In spite of the fact that natural remedies are shown to produce significant improvement in HA patients, the results of such studies are limited by the sample size and possible bias to ethnicity and gender. Clinical studies by Okabe et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and Okabe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] were each conducted with only one test subject. Furthermore, both test subjects were elderly Japanese female aged 60 and 71. The limited number of test subject and lack of diversity in terms of age and ethnicity may affect the reliability of the findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Another major limitation is the lack of safety and efficacy profile for the natural remedies and compounds studied in this review. It is not known whether the dosage of decoctions with complex formulations and compounds administered may lead to potential toxicity, adverse effects or will be present at the intended site of action in sufficient concentration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. This is also further complicated with the lack of understanding of the molecular targets and mechanism involving the natural remedies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Greater understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles of these compounds will support more effective clinical trials in the future.
