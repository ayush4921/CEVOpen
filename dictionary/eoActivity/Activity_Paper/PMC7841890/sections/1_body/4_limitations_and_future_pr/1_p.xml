<p id="Par74">There are valid concerns on the use of natural remedies in HA drug discovery and development. Natural remedies are often initially experimented as crude extracts and due to the high abundance of non-desirable components, bioassay-guided isolation of target compounds must be performed with subsequent identification [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Furthermore, metal impurities, fluorescence-interfering, the presence of non-polar or polar compounds in the extracts may provide inaccurate results for some bioassays. Therefore, such compounds must first be removed depending on the assay system to avoid interference [
