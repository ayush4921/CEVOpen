<p id="Par80">As pre-clinical and clinical studies are currently lacking, effort should be directed towards testing using polyQ animal models and randomised controlled trials, respectively, including for forms of HA not yet studied. Improved studies should be done where study conclusions are uncertain due to methodological insufficiencies or discrepancies. Comparative studies should be done with current treatments versus natural remedies (single compound or the mixture) to ascertain the potential of the latter as supplements or alternative treatments for HA. Additionally, further studies can be conducted towards investigating whether the natural remedies could modulate HA through other pathways not discussed in this review.</p>
