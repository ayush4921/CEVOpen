<p id="Par75">Another impediment in its acceptance is the lack of standard profile for quality control, cost per sample, complexity of resupply and variation of chemical composition. Natural remedies harvested from the wild are susceptible to environmental factors such as deforestation, pollution, global warming and anthropic pressure which hinders their habitat and limits availability. In addition, discrepancy in growth requirements such as soil composition, weather, altitude and storage conditions contribute to variation of chemical composition. The composition may also be affected during processing and isolation as some compounds may undergo transformation and degradation [
