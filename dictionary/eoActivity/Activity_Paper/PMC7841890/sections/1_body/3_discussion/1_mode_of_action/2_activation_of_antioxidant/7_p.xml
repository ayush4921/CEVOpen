<p id="Par67">The activation of the antioxidant pathway by natural remedies is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The antioxidant activities of natural remedies were shown to have therapeutic effects against cell damage in SCA through the activation of NRF2/ARE (antioxidant response element). This antioxidant pathway involved the upregulation of various phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes that attenuated the oxidative damage and prevented ROS-induced cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In a study by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], Shaoyao Gancao Tang upregulated the expression of NRF2 and PGC-1α, a coactivator of NRF2, which suppressed ROS levels in vitro and restored motor function in transgenic SCA17 mice. Studies by Chang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>G. jasminoides</italic> and 
 <italic>G. inflata</italic> could activate downstream targets of NRF2 and PGC-1α (e.g., SOD2, CYCS, NAD(P)H, NQO1, GCLC and GSTP1), which effectively suppressed ROS levels and polyQ aggregation. In contrast, knockdown of PGC-1α and/or NRF2 promoted aggregation and attenuated the anti-aggregation activity of Shaoyao Gancao Tang, 
 <italic>G. jasminoides</italic> and 
 <italic>G. inflata</italic>, which suggest PGC-1α and NRF2 are involved in the positive effects on SCA [
