Pre-treatment with the formulation (0.001–100 µg/mL) in cells for 8 h demonstrated no cytotoxicity, as indicated by MTT assay. The formulation was able to restore the expression of PGC-1α and NRF2, and their downstream targets, CYCS, GCLC and NQO1, as detected by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, suppression of polyQ aggregation was observed in cells, as shown by low GFP intensity. Administration of 0.4% Shaoyao Gancao Tang in the drinking water of the mouse model improved gait coordination and suppressed hyperactivity, as indicated by footprint and locomotor test, respectively [
