<p id="Par64">Pohl et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] investigated the antioxidant activities of ethanol extract from rapeseed pomace, a by-product of 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> using Soxhlet extraction. Administration of ethanol extract (1-5Â mg/mL) in an in vivo model of SCA3 using transgenic 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> expressing mutant ataxin-3 protein showed no toxicity, as detected by food clearance assay. Ethanol extract treatment promoted the expression of glutathione S-transferase 4 (GST4) and SOD3, which are involved in GSH metabolism and mitochondrial manganese SOD synthesis, respectively. Furthermore, ethanol extract improved motor function in transgenic 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> comparable with the wild type, as observed by a motility assay. Knockdown of GST4 gene in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> abolished the improvement in motor function by ethanol extract. Pohl et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] suggested that the positive effects of rapeseed pomace extract were dependent on GST4 expression. Moreover, sinapine, a major compound derived from the ethanol extract, also demonstrated improvement in motor function of transgenic 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but it was less effective than the whole extract. This indicates additional compounds in conjunction with sinapine contributed to the positive effects of ethanol extract [
