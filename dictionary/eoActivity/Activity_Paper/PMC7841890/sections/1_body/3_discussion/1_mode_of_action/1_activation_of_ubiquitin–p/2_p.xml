<p id="Par58">In a study by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], the anti-aggregation effects of catalpol derived from 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic>, and daidzein and puerarin derived from 
 <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> were investigated in in vitro models of SCA3. Carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal (MG132), a proteasome inhibitor, was used to treat human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 proteins. Pre-treatment with 0.1 μM catalpol, puerarin or daidzein for 24 h showed no cytotoxicity against the cells, as indicated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The compounds were able to restore UPS function and effectively enhance proteasome activity in the cells, as evidenced by low green fluorescent protein (GFP) intensity. Additionally, the compounds suppressed polyQ aggregation induced by mutant ataxin-3 protein, as detected by Western blot analysis. Following pre-treatment with the test compounds, no autophagy activity was observed in the cells, as evidenced by an insignificant increase in red fluorescent protein (DsRed-LC3) intensity, suggesting the anti-aggregation ability of the compounds were due to UPS activation. Furthermore, the compounds also suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic marker BCL-2-associated X (BAX) protein and promoted the expression of anti-apoptotic marker B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein. Caspase-3 activity was also reduced, which prevented polyQ-induced cell death [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] using an in vitro model of SCA3 with MG132-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Pre-treatment with 50 μM daidzein for 24 h restored proteasome activity in the cells. Additionally, daidzein was able to suppress MG132-induced cell death, as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay [
