<p id="Par73">Chang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] investigated the effects of 
 <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> and its major compound paeoniflorin on HSPs in in vitro models of SCA3 using HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 proteins. Pre-treatment with 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> (2-50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h showed no cytotoxicity, as assessed by MTT assay. The extract and compound upregulated the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone in cells. Additionally, suppression of polyQ aggregation was observed in the cells, as shown by low GFP intensity. Overexpression of HSP1 also resulted in suppressed polyQ aggregation, suggesting that the positive effects of the extract and compound were modulated by HSPs. The role of HSPs in suppressing polyQ aggregation was further supported by Chen et al. [
