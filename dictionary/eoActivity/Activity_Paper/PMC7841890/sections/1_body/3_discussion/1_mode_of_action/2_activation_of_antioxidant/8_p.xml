<p id="Par68">Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of GAA repeats contributing to suppressed expression of frataxin (FXN) protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Evidence shows that frataxin deficiency in FRDA impairs the intracellular antioxidant defence system, resulting in decreased GSH levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] and expressions of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT, glutaredoxin, and thioredoxin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Additionally, excessive ROS is generated by an iron-dependent Fenton reaction and mitochondrial dysfunction. The compromised antioxidant defence system and ROS accumulation contribute to the unregulated increase in oxidative damage, leading to DNA damage and cell death [
