<p id="Par69">Lew et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] investigated the antioxidant activities of a standardised aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> in an in vitro model of FRDA involving L-Buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO)-induced human dermal fibroblast expressing abnormal expansion of GAA triplet repeat. L-Buthionine sulfoximine is an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which plays a role in GSH biogenesis. Cells treated with L-BSO had reduced levels of GSH, which increased the susceptibility of cells to oxidative damage [

The extract also reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and apoptotic body formation, as detected by LDH assay and Hoechst 33258 staining, respectively. The findings suggest the extract was able to prevent oxidative damage-induced cell death by preventing GSH depletion [
