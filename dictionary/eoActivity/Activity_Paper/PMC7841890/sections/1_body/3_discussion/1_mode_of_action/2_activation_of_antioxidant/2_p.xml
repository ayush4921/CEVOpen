<p id="Par62">Three derived compounds genipin, geniposide and crocin and the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Gardenia jasminoides</italic> were investigated for their antioxidant activities in in vitro models of SCA3 using HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The presence of polyQ aggregates in the cells were observed to suppress the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), an antioxidant marker. Pre-treatment with aqueous extract (1-10 g/mL), genipin (50–500 nM), geniposide (500 nM) or crocin (100 nM) for 8 h showed no cytotoxicity in the cells, as indicated by MTT assay. Pre-treatment with the extract or compounds restored the depleted expression of NRF2 and downstream antioxidant enzymes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), and glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), while suppressing ROS levels and polyQ aggregation, as detected by low ROS fluorescence and GFP intensities. Overexpression of NRF2 in cells suppressed polyQ aggregation, whereas knockdown of its gene promoted polyQ aggregation. These findings suggest the involvement of antioxidant genes in the anti-aggregation effects in cells. Pre-treatment with extract or compounds did not significantly change DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity, suggesting DPPH radical scavenging is not a major factor in the anti-aggregation effects [
