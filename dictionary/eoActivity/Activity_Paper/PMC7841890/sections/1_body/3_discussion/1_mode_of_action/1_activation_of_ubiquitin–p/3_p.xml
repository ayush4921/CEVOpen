<p id="Par59">A study by Chou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] investigated the proteasome enhancing ability of T1-11 (N
 <sup>6</sup>-(4-Hydroxybenzyl) adenosine), a compound derived from 
 <italic>Gastrodia elata</italic>, and JMF-1907 (N
 <sup>6</sup>-(3-Indolylethyl) adenosine), a synthetic analogue of the former. They used an in vivo model of SCA3 in transgenic mice expressing mutant ataxin-3 protein. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg T1-11 or JMF-1907 for 3 months prevented neuronal cell death in the pontine nuclei by reversing the induced expression of BAX protein and decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xL) protein. Additionally, proteasome activity was significantly enhanced in the cerebellum and pontine nuclei in the treatment group, as indicated by increased levels of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). An improvement in motor functions was also observed in the treatment group compared to untreated animals, as indicated by the rotarod test [
