<p id="Par70">Calcium ions are important signalling molecules that control a wide variety of cellular processes including muscle control, cell signalling and cell growth [

Accumulating evidence shows that polyQ aggregates impair calcium homeostasis and induce abnormal calcium ion influx in Purkinje cells through ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) [
