<p id="Par72">Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionarily conserved chaperones ubiquitous in organisms and are responsible for cell survival by facilitating protein assembly, folding, translocation, stabilisation and degradation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] demonstrated the presence of TBP induced the sequestration of nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY) complexes and suppressed its downstream targets including the heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSPA) 5 and 8. Studies also showed that upregulation of HSPs could suppress polyQ aggregation and protect against polyQ-induced toxicity [
