<p id="Par63">Similar findings were reported by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] using the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic> and its compounds licochalcone A and ammonium glycyrrhizinate (AMGZ) in in vitro models of SCA3 using HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 proteins. Pre-treatment with aqueous extract (50 µg/mL), licochalcone A (10 nM) or AMGZ (1 µM) for 8 h showed low cytotoxicity in cells, as indicated by MTT assay. However, the extract or compounds upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a regulator of the mitochondrial antioxidant defence system, and its downstream targets, NRF2, NQO1, SOD2, cytochrome c (CYCS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), as detected by Western blot analysis. Oxidative damage was reduced through promotion of the glutathione/oxidised glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, suppression of ROS levels and polyQ aggregation [
