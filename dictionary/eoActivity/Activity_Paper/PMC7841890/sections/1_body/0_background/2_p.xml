<p id="Par44">Among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 3 is the most common subtype, followed by SCA1, 2, 6, 7 and 17, which are all caused by the expansion of polyglutamine-coding Cytosine-Adenine-Guanine (CAG) repeats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another ACDA subtype is episodic ataxia (EA), which include the common EA1 and 2 subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA), Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is the most common subtype, followed by ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) and type 2 (AOA2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most common X-linked ataxia is fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The age of onset varies according to types of HA, but onset actually helps in the diagnosis of HA: infancy onset suggests AT; childhood or teenage onsets suggest EA, FRDA, AOA1 and AOA2; and adult onset suggests SCA, FXTAS, or other autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias [
