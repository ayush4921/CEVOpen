<p id="Par46">To date, there are no effective treatments for HA and current therapeutic strategies only focus on symptomatic and supportive management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The complexity in the neurochemistry of HA suggests that there may be multiple therapeutic targets. For example, some pharmacological molecules have been used to target motor and non-motor symptoms associated with HA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]: riluzole, amantadine and varenicline were demonstrated to reduce the deteriorating symptoms in various ADCA and ARCA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; acetazolamide and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) were reported to be effective in reducing symptoms in EA; and acetyl-DL-leucine was found to improve gait variability in patients with various subtypes of cerebellar ataxia including SCA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, many pharmacological molecules have yet to reach clinical trials or be translated into breakthrough treatments, mainly due to the limited pre-clinical studies [
