<p id="Par51">Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop evidence-based Chinese medicine and new lead compounds and scaffolds from TCM. Combined chemical and biological studies on the effective TCM have provided unprecedented opportunities for the development of new drugs and the modernisation of TCM. In such circumstances, many in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to explore the therapeutic effect of the natural remedies in HA. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these natural remedies has yet to be demonstrated or translated into clinical practice. Hence, this review aims to synthesise the evidence in pre-clinical and clinical research on natural remedies published from June 2007 to July 2020 to examine if these experimental studies may provide a mechanistic framework for developing treatments for HA towards clinical trials.</p>
