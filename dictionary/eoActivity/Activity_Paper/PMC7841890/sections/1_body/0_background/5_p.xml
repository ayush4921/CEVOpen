<p id="Par47">Natural remedies have been used as complementary therapeutic agents for various neurodegenerative diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Natural remedies are a good source for the discovery of drugs or agents that have therapeutic potential. In addition, holistic practitioners commonly use natural remedies, as they are well accepted and relatively safe compared to synthetic drugs. One of the key distinguishing attributes of natural remedies is their affinity for the target protein or specific biomolecule in living organisms [

 <sup>3</sup>-hybrid carbon atoms allowing the tetrahedron carbons to form flexible chains or cyclic structures, whereas the multi-functional groups make them bind to the biological targets strongly and increase the additional interactions with biological molecules [
