<p id="p0035">Presently, traditional medicines from different parts of the world have been studied for their therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV-2. Traditional medicines-based defense methodology has been used against different human viruses, including SARS-CoV, Ebola, and Zika viruses [

 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] had compared the mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria plasmodium and found that both the pathogens infect the lungs to cause the crystallization of carbon dioxide. Based on this information, artemisinin molecule (sesquiterpene lactone), isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua,</italic> has been proposed to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Artemisinin is popularly used in treating malaria; however, it has also been tested for its activity against different viral diseases, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Currently, WHO has backed the clinical trials on 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> for its use in treating COVID-19, and collaborative research in this direction is being performed at Max-Planck research center, Germany and Mateon Therapeutics, California. The use of medicinal plants for treating infectious diseases is found to be associated with the tradition and custom of several populations around the globe. For example, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the well-studied and documented practices followed in China that has been reported to cure many diseases or infections, including SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Approximately 85% of COVID-19 patients were treated with TCM that might act due to a close homology between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. These plants could possess active biomolecules that regulate virus accumulation by restricting their multiplication. For example, flavonoids (herbacetin, isobavaschalcone, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, quercetin 3-Î²-D-glucoside, and epigallocatechin gallate) were found inhibit the enzymatic activity of one of the viral proteases; MERS-CoV 3CL protease and myricetin and scutellarein have the potential to regulate the helices activity of nsP13 (SARS-CoV helicase protein). Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] had reported that at least fifteen clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
