<p id="p0055">Plant biotechnology offers a broad spectrum of production strategies at different levels, including whole plant, tissue, and cell. Hairy roots and cell suspension cultures facilitate the synthesis of biomolecules at large-scale [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, advances in genetics and genomics had also facilitated the manipulation of genes and pathways underlying the biosynthesis of therapeutic molecules. Numerous approaches for genetic manipulation of genes and genomes are available in plants, including stable transformation (transgenics and transplastomics), transient and inducible expression systems, gene silencing approaches (knockdown and knockout), and genome editing methods. A transient expression for vaccine production is beneficial over stable transgenics as it saves time and expedites the large-scale manufacturing in pandemic situations. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> illustrates how genomics and biotechnology could intervene in producing plant-based drugs. Next-generation sequencing provides comprehensive information about the genes, non-coding regions, and regulatory elements present in the genome, which enables rapid identification of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of therapeutic molecules. Forward genetics approach of estimating the biomolecule content (or large-scale metabolite profiling) in a given population followed by genotyping (genotyping-by-sequencing, double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, whole-genome resequencing, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>) will identify the genomic regions regulating the biosynthesis of individual molecules. These genomic regions (genes/alleles/QTLs) can be effectually used in genomics-assisted breeding for developing elite lines producing higher levels of target molecules. On the other hand, gene cloning enables the isolation and molecular characterization of target genes encoding for active biomolecules that can be transformed into a different plant system (
 <italic>Nicotiana,</italic> for example, is a widely used system for plant-based drugs) for the ease of expression, optimization of production and purification. For instance, 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> is now being used as an efficient system for expressing VLP of SARS-CoV-2 to produce a plant-based vaccine. Similarly, these heterologous systems can be used to produce the desired biomolecules that could be isolated and purified for further downstream approaches. A few metabolites could be tissue- or development-specific, and therefore, finetuning their expression throughout the life cycle of the respective plant is imperative to ensure a maximum harvest. For example, β–Eudesmol has been found to have antibacterial and antiviral properties; however, its usage as an antiviral drug is limited due to its low level (2.39%) of production in 
 <italic>Lauris nobilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Promoter cloning or manipulation of 
 <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements in the promoter regions could provide an amenable solution to this issue. CRISPR/Cas9 approach can be deployed to edit the 
 <italic>cis-</italic>elements present upstream to the gene(s) for ensuring its expression throughout the life cycle of the target plant. Genetic elements regulating post-translational events acting on the therapeutic biomolecule of interest should also be studied.
