<p>In this study, the dichloromethane: methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> demonstrated antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. sonnei.</italic> Tetracycline (30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g) was used as a positive control, and 0.2% DMSO was used as a negative control. The antibacterial effects of the reference drug (tetracycline) were significantly higher against the five bacterial species compared with the 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract at all concentrations tested (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The inhibitory activities of the 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract concentration of 500 mg/ml were significantly higher against the five bacterial species tested compared to the other extract concentrations tested (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The same trend was observed when 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extracts were tested at 250 mg/ml and 125 mg/ml. At the lower 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract concentrations, there were no significant inhibitory activities that were recorded against the test bacterial species; thus, the activity was dose-dependent (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
