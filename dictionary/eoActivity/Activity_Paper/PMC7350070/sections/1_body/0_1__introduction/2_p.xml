<p>In addition, many bacterial pathogens form biofilms when they come in contact with a hydrated surface [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and are a major problem in clinical therapeutics since microbial communities adhered to surfaces are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same bacteria [

In bacterial culture, a growth medium is required which is a culture media either in a solid, liquid, or semisolid form designed to support the growth of bacteria. A culture media used for general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria contains a carbon source, water, salts, amino acids, and nitrogen [
