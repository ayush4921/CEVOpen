<p>Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The use of antibiotics to control these diseases has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and, therefore, the need for alternative medicines [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], such as medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which are easily available, affordable, and efficacious with minimal side effects [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The problem of antibiotic resistance is confounded by the emergence of “superbugs” such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> that are resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics [
