<p>Samples of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l from each well with a concentration at and above the MIC of the antimicrobial agent being tested [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were taken, and the inoculum was spread over the MHA plate with a sterile cotton swab [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, visible colonies were counted on each subculture plate, as well as the initial inoculum plates. The MBC was recorded as the lowest concentration of the plant extract in which there was a reduction of the initial inoculum by 99.9% [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
