<p>The assays for antimicrobial activity of the DCM: methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> were performed by the disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Bacteria from the stock cultures were cultured overnight at 37°C in MHA and used as the inoculum. Bacterial cultures were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland's standard to achieve a concentration of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml in physiological saline and then used to lawn Mueller–Hinton agar plates evenly using sterile cotton swabs. The inoculated plates were air-dried in the laminar airflow hood for 15 min and, then, used for the sensitivity test. The discs, impregnated with a series of plant extract dilutions, were placed on the Mueller–Hinton agar surface with each test plate comprising eight discs equidistant from each other. A standard commercial antibiotic disc (Tetracycline 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g) was used as a positive control, while a disc impregnated with 0.2% DMSO was used as the negative control. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h after which zones of inhibition around the discs were observed and measured. The tests were performed in triplicates.
