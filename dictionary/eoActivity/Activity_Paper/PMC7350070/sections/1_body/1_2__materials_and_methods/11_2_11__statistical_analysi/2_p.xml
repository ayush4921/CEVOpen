<p>In order to test for parametric assumptions, results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test were used for separation and comparison of means to obtain the specific significance difference. The values of 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. The time-kill kinetics plot of log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU against time was drawn to determine the time required to kill all the bacteria.
