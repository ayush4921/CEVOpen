<p>Ten microlitre (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) samples from the growth control well were removed immediately after inoculation and mixed with 990 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of sterile MHB in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. This suspension was further diluted by taking 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l and adding to 900 
 <italic>µ</italic>l sterile MHB. A hundred microlitres (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l) from each of the dilutions was plated on nutrient agar and incubated at 37°C for 24 h together with the microtiter plate. Colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation to confirm the CFU/ml present in the innocula.
