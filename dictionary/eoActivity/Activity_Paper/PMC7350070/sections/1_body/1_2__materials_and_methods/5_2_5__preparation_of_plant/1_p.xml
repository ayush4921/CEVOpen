<p>The plant extract stock solution was reconstituted using 0.2% DMSO by weighing 1 g of the extract in a sterile sample bottle and dissolved in 1 ml 0.2% DMSO to make a concentration of 1 g/ml. The stock solution was then diluted serially in a two-fold dilution starting from 500 mg/ml. Paper discs of 6 mm in diameter were prepared from Whatman No. 1 filter paper using a paper punch and sterilized at 121°C for 15 min. Twenty microlitres from each of the different concentrations was used to impregnate the paper discs. The impregnated discs were air dried in a laminar flow hood for 3 h and immediately used for the sensitivity tests.</p>
