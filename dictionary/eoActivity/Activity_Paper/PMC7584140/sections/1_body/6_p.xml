<p>The managing committee of this journal will ensure that all steps of submission, peer-review and final preparation of proofs respect the journal publication goals and deadlines. The journal also has an in-house English copyeditor to assist authors whose native language is not English. All this makes the JoX a convivial, simple and rapid platform for the publication of high-quality papers. The JoX welcomes short communications, Special Issue articles and communication from relevant sessions from international meetings dealing with the presence and the biological effects of xenobiotics. The JoX is a young and dynamic international journal that aims to reach the global scientific community as much as possible, for the benefit of us all. We are confident that this journal will contribute to the dissemination of peer-reviewed research data on either the beneficial or the harmful properties of chemicals from human activities in these times of global warming.</p>
