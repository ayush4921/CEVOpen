<p>The JoX promotes the rapid publication of peer-reviewed research articles dealing with either the pharmacological (beneficial) or toxicological (detrimental) properties of foreign compounds in all living beings. This dual approach should provide a more dynamic view on the health effects of xenobiotics of emerging interest in various ecosystems. Studies aimed at synthetizing products (e.g., products from green chemistry) or focusing on their release into the environment and understanding the basic/fundamental properties of xenobiotics that enable the development of biomarkers are welcome. Moreover, because organisms are rarely exposed to a single substance in the environment, studies dealing with the resulting toxic properties of complex mixtures, such as industrial or municipal wastewaters, or cocktails of pharmaceuticals threatening various health conditions, are also of value. For example, the interaction of pharmaceutical agents with nutrition status or diets, including herbal therapies, are of interest for the JoX.</p>
