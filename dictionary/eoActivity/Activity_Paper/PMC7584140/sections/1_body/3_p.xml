<p>The understanding of the combined effects of xenobiotics and their interaction with other chemicals is particularly of interest in the context of the 21st century. For example, the application of specialized materials derived from nanotechnology, which pervade many sectors of our economy, could also produce inadvertent health effects when released into the environment. A special case of nanomaterials concerns the release of plastic nanoparticles into the environment from the degradation of plastics. Nanoparticles could be readily absorbed in cells and produce unexpected biophysical changes at a cellular level. Indeed, plastic materials are found in very high levels (billions of tons) in the environment and degrade into smaller and smaller particles reaching the micro and nanoscale, which could pose a toxic risk in the long-term. Moreover, the use of drug vectors and environmental nanoparticles could bind existing contaminants (pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, etc.), influence their bioavailability and mitigate their effects.</p>
