<p>In the context of global warming, more extreme episodes of drought and heavy rainfall could change their levels in the environment and modify organisms’ sensitivity to xenobiotics. Increased episodes of heavy rainfall could increase the release of untreated urban wastewaters (a complex cocktail of industrial and pharmaceutical products, among others) because of the volume limit of treatment plants to handle important volume changes. This further reinforces the need to better understand complex mixtures of xenobiotics. High throughput approaches from “omics” technologies should also contribute to an increase in our understanding on the beneficial/detrimental effects of newly produced xenobiotics or those of emerging interest. These approaches should provide critical information about the mechanisms of action and methods of identification of adverse outcome pathways.</p>
