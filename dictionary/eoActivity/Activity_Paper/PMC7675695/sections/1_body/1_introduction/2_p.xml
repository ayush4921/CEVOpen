<p>Coronaviruses are the infectious agents of respiratory tract infections but can also affect the digestive tract and systemically infect both humans and animals (Malik et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Coronaviruses are single‐stranded RNA viruses, which are highly diverse and first reported in 1960. Primarily, Coronavirus strains reside in bats and wild birds and can spread to other living beings. The first case of COVID‐19 was reported in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019, sometime later, Thailand reported the first case of the disease outside of Mainland China on January 13, 2020 (Hui et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The virus that causes COVID‐19 is believed to have originated in bats and then spread to humans, possibly through snakes and pangolins, perhaps by contamination of meat from wild animals and seafood, in meat and seafood markets in China. At present, about 210 countries and territories around the world are affected by COVID‐19. Notably, China, the USA, the UK, Spain, France, and Italy are the most severed because of COVID‐19. As of July 15, 2020, this pandemic has claimed the lives of 586,194 along with 13,683,743 confirmed cases (John Hopkins University, Coronavirus Resource Center). Common symptoms of COVID‐19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea, but in severe cases, it may cause pneumonia and/or even death (WHO,
