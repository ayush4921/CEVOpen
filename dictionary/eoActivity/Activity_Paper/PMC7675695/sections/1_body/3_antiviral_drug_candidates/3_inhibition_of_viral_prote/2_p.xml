<p>Protease inhibitors alter or deactivate the configuration of protease involved in the proteolytic activity (events) associated with diseases like AIDS, cancer, thrombosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis (Mishra, Reddy &amp; Prasad, 2020). Fisetin (

Some drugs from the primary investigations that are used for COVID‐19 are protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (arbidol), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), lamivudine (3TC) and hydroxychloroquine, which blocks virus entry and endocytosis (Lu,
