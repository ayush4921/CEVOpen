<p>Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) (

 <xref rid="ptr6893-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) inhibited Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) replication with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.004 mM by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase GL showed antiviral activity against SARS‐CoVs in Vero cells with a SI of 67 by reducing replication and inhibiting penetration and adsorption of the virus (Cinatl et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). 2‐Acetamido‐β‐D‐glucopyansylamine (
 <bold>47</bold>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) suppressed the expression of viral antigen (&gt;99%) with an inhibition of 40 μM toward SARS‐CoV replication (Hoever et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Pyridine‐N‐oxide derivatives were found active against HIV‐1, HIV‐2, HCMV, and also inhibited SARS‐CoVs by targeting the transcription level of the virus cycle (Balzarini et al.,
