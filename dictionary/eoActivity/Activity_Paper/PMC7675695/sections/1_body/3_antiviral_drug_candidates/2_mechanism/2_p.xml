<p>Polyphenols, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, saponins, monoterpenoids, triterpenoids, glucosides, sesquiterpenes, and alkaloids isolated from various medicinal plants have diverse antiviral activities of which some are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Antiviral drugs interact with haemagglutinin, which interferes with the entry of the virus. Neuraminidase, an essential glycoprotein required for viral amplification (proliferation and infections), catalyzes the cleavage of α‐(2,3) or α‐(2,6) ketosidic linkage between sialic acid and oligosaccharide of glycoproteins such that viruses release from infectious cells (Muchtaridi, Sugijanto, Mohd Gazzali, &amp; Wahab, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) can block the viral enzyme neuraminidase, which prevents the release of viruses from host cells (Liao, Kowal, Cardenas, &amp; Beauchemin,
