<p>Lipolytic enzymes are composed of esterases (EC 3.1.1.1) and lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3), and the latter represent the most important enzymes that act on ester bonds between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group at the lipid-water interface

Furthermore, microbial lipases are a kind of crucial enzymes in biotransformation due to its multifunction in applications and convenience for mass production, and are superior to the lipases from plants and animals in terms of activity, stability, ease of purification, molecular modifications, and continuous production independent of season
