<p>Lipolytic bacteria are classified into different families based on their gene sequences and biochemical properties, and a high level of lipase is also a general feature of staphylococcus. The lipolytic enzymes in staphylococcus that have been studied for their applications in biotechnology

 <italic>Staphylococcus caprae</italic> lipases have been reported, and thus purification and characterisation of these enzymes are necessary.
