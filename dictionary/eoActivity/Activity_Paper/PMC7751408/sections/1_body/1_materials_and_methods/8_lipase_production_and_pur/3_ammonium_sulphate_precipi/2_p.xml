<p>Gradient concentration of ammonium sulphate (10 − 80%) was added to cell-free crude extract under magnetic stirrer at 4 °C for overnight stratification. The precipitate at 80% saturation ammonium sulphate solution was obtained by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in Buffer A. The crude lipase solution was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min to remove the insoluble materials and then concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon-Ultra-15 (MWCO10kD, Millipore, Bedford, MO, USA). The concentrated lipase was lyophilised by a freeze drier after dialysing for follow-up experiments.</p>
