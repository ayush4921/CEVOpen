<p>The enzymatically active fractions (40 ml) eluted from the Sephadex G-50 column were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (16 × 300 mm) preequilibrated with Buffer A. The lipase was absorbed by the column, and the impurities were washed away by Buffer A at a flow rate of 50 ml/h until no lipase activity was detected in the washed fractions. Absorbed proteins were subjected to gradient elution, followed by a series of NaCl solutions (100 ml of 0.02–1.0 M in sterile water) at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The fractions with the highest lipase activities were concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon-Ultra-15 (MWCO10kD, Millipore, Bedford, MO, USA), and then freeze-dried for subsequent analyses.</p>
