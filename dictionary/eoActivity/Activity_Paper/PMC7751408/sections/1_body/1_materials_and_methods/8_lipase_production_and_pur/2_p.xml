<p>The 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> NCU S6 was cultivated under optimal reaction conditions for 51 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. The submerged culture medium was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to discard the cells. The clear supernatant containing extracellular lipase was used as crude lipase for subsequent purification. The lipase produced by 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> was purified by three steps and the purified lipase named as SCNL. The lipase activity and protein concentration were measured after each step.
