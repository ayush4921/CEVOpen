<p>The optimal pH value for the lipase activity was also investigated by assaying the activity in various buffers at different pH values (3.0–12.0) for 30 min at 40 °C. Sodium acetate (50 mM, pH 3.0–5.0), sodium phosphate monobasic (50 mM, pH 6.0–7.0), Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, 8.0–9.0) and glycine/NaOH buffer (50 mM, 10.0–12.0) were used as buffers. For pH stability test, the purified lipase was pre-incubated in different buffers with pH 3.0 to 12.0 for 7.0 h. Then, the remaining activity was determined every hour as described previously.</p>
