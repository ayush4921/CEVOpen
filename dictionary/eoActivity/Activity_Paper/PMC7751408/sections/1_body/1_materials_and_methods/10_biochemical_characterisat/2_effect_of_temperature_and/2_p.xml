<p>To determine the optimal reaction temperature of SCNL, SCNL was incubated in Buffer A at the temperatures from 10 to 60 °C, with a constant pH value at 7.0. The relative lipase activity and specific activity were determined under standard assay conditions. The highest lipase activity was taken as 100%. For thermostability determination, the purified lipase was pre-incubated in Buffer A at the same temperature range for 240 min. The mixture was sampled every 20 min and remaining lipase activity was determined as described previously. The initial lipase activity was taken as 100%.</p>
