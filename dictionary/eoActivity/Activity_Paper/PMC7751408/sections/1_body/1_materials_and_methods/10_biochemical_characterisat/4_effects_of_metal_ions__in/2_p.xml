<p>The effects of metal ions, inhibitors and detergents on the stability of the purified lipase activity were investigated. The relative activity was measured by pre-incubating the lipase solution with each additive. All reagents were prepared in Buffer A, with each metal ion at a final concentration of 1 or 10 mM (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Reaction mixtures containing 0.1 or 1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic> or 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) of popular commercial detergents and inhibitors (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were also incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The lipase activity without addition of metal ions, inhibitors or detergents was defined as 100%, and the relative activity was determined as compared to the control. Experiments were performed as described above, using 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPP as a substrate. Each assay was carried out in triplicates.
