<p>NCU S6 strain was cultivated in growth medium A, and the cell metabolism was strongly linked to lipase activity. With the increase of incubation period, enzyme production was firstly increased and then decreased. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, dynamic growth condition and lipase activity of the cells in the fermentation medium was reflected by absorbance value. The logarithmic growth phase of NCU S6 started quickly after culturing in fermentation medium for 3 h and lasted for approximately 21 h. A slow growth from 24 to 39 h was observed, and the strain subsequently entered a stationary phase from 42 to 111 h. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> also showed the dynamic changes of lipase activity, with an increase from the beginning of inoculation to 51 h. The growth rate declined from 51 to 111 h, which may result from the depletion of nutrients in the fermentation medium and a low metabolism level under aging phase of growth

 </xref>. Obviously, the peak (51 h) of lipase activity (101 U/mL) in the culture period was the optimal enzyme production time.
