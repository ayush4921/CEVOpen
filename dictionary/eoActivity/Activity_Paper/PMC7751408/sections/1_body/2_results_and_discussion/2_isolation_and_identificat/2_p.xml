 </xref>. A total of 36 bacterial isolates were identified from the sewerage samples collected at Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, China. In the preliminary screening, only 22 isolates showed clear halo on the bromocresol purple plates after 24-h cultivation at 37 °C, among them 13 isolates also produced a zone of clearance surrounding each colony after 2-day incubation on tributyrin agar plates. However, the tributyrin was not only sensitive to hydrolysis by lipases, but also by esterases. Rescreening of the 13 isolates found that only 6 of them showed obvious effect of lipase production on Rhodamine B agar plate. NCU S6 was found to be the best lipolytic strain that showed the broadest orange fluorescence halos around each colony through UV irradiation.
