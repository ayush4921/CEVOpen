<p>The extracellular lipase from 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> NCU S6 (SCNL) was purified by three purification steps, ASP, GFC and IEC. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the activity (502.76â€‰U/mg) of the purified SCNL was increased by 332.95-fold, with approximately 6.13% recovery of overall yield. Among the three purification steps, GFC and IEC were found to be critical for obtaining highly purified lipase
