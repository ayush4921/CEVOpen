<p>Lipases with tolerance to organic solvents have received a great attention in recent years, as the enzymes could be used as desirable catalysts in various biotechnological fields, such as biofuels production, synthesis of catalysts and the optical resolution of chiral compounds

 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 1 day, and its activity slightly decreased in acetone, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol and acetonitrile after 28-day incubation. These results were consistent with a previous study showing that DMSO at 10% (
