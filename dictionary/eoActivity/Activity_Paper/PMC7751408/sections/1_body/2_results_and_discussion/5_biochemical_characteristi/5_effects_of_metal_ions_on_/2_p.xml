<p>The tolerance of an enzyme to various metal ions is crucial not only for investigating its action mechanism, but also for its certain industrial applications. Several metal ions were reported to be involved in the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of oil by inducing the fatty acids to form their respective metal salts in the oil–water interface and allowing lipase to act freely on oil molecules

 <sup>2+</sup>. Especially, its relative activity in the presence of 10 mM Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> was 1.66 folds higher than the control. Ca
