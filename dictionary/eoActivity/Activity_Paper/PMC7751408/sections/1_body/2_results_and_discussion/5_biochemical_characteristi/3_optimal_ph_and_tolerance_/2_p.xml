<p>The effect of pH on lipase activity and stability was determined by pre-incubating the enzyme in the pH values from 3.0 to 12.0 for 30 min at 40 °C. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>, the lipase was active (≥50%) from pH 5.5 to 12.0, with the highest relative activity and residual activity at pH 9.0 and 8.0, respectively. The enzyme was similar to the lipase from 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> N3, which showed maximum activity at pH 8.0

 </xref>. Investigation of pH tolerance of the enzyme (3.0–12.0, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(D)</xref>) showed that the enzyme reached the highest remaining activity at pH 9.0 after 5 h. The lipase possessed a strong tolerance to alkaline environment, and the remaining activity was greater than 100% from pH 8.0 to 11.0. The stability of SCNL under alkaline conditions was also observed in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermis</italic>

 </xref>. The enzyme activities at pH 3.0–6.0 were lower than those at the neutral pH, with 60% of its initial activity being lost at pH 3.0. The results suggested that the lipase was suitable for applications under alkaline conditions.
