<p>Commercial inhibitors and detergents were important surfactants for the preparation of emulsions in their practical applications. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1 and 10 mM) exhibited significant effects on its relative activity (66.5 and 32.9%), indicating that SCNL was not only a metalloenzyme, but also a metal-activated enzyme. The inhibitors, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and dithiothreitol (DTT) were reported to reduce the disulphide bonds of an enzyme, and prevent the formation of inter- or intramolecular disulphide bonds between cysteine residues of a lipase

 </xref>, but the relative activities of the lipase in the presence of these two inhibitors at 1 and 10 mM still maintained more than 70%.
