<p>The SCNL can hydrolyse

 <italic>p</italic>NPS (18 carbons). The

 <sub>16</sub> were hydrolysed moderately (45.46–54.54%) by SCNL apart from 
 <italic>p</italic>NPB (4 carbons), indicating its preference for C

 </xref>, possessed a strong hydrolysis efficiency for medium and long carbon chain length substrates, and had mild specificity towards short-chain 
 <italic>p</italic>-NP esters. Among the triglycerides, SCNL showed a preference for short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids from C
 <sub>2</sub> to C
 <sub>12</sub>, with the maximum activity (196.00 U/mg) in tributyrin (C
 <sub>4</sub>). The results indicated a lower hydrolytic activity of the enzyme for triglycerides with more than twelve carbons atoms (C
 <sub>14</sub>–C
 <sub>18</sub>), and that SCNL was a novel lipase different from esterases that only hydrolyse short-chain fatty acids.
