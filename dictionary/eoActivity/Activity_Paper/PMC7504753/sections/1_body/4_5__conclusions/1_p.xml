<p>COVID-19 created a devastating global crisis impacting thousands of people every day, taking thousands of lives and hampering the global economy. Virtual molecular docking was conducted to identify new compounds that could bind the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The isolated compounds obtained from the methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> were investigated in silico, which concluded that some selective compounds are potentially enough to alter the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme. Our analysis indicates phytochemicals from the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> such as imidazolidin-4-ne, 2-imino-1-(4-methoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl), spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl, 3.beta-hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid, androstan-17-one, 3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-(5.alpha), camphenol, (âˆ’)-Globulol, yangambin, nordazepam, TMS derivative, benzeneethanamine have a better binding affinity to M
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 compared to nelfinavir and lopinavir. Further research and development will pave the way for identifying possible SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. We anticipate that the insights obtained in this study can be useful for the potential discovery and development of new natural anti-COVID-19 therapeutic agents.
