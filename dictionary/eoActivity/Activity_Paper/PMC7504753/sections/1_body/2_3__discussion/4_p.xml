<p>Recently, researchers from different parts of the world have been working extensively to find certain potential lead compounds from medicinal plants that are active against several enzymes and other proteins responsible for viral replication and growth [

 <italic>T. crispa</italic> extracts against malaria and the recent successful usage of anti-malarial drugs in combatting COVID-19, which leads the foundation for our hypothesis.
