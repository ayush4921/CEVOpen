<p>Nowadays, drug design using various bioinformatics tools has been proven as groundbreaking methods in drug discovery not only due to promptness and accuracy but also its low cost [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A recent study from Yamamoto et al. has already shown that nelfinavir can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Previously, another study from Yamamoto et al. reported the inhibitory effect of nelfinavir on the replication of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, another in vitro analysis showed that lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited potential inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Hence, we selected nelfinavir and lopinavir as positive controls in the present study. In this study, our selected phytocompounds, along with two antiviral drugs, nelfinavir and lopinavir, were able to dock with the active pockets of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme, which was confirmed by our analysis through CASTp web server. Despite showing lower binding affinities than nelfinavir and lopinavir, our selected compounds interacted with the active pockets of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme like the standard compounds. Additionally, imidazolidin-4-one, 2-imino-1-(4-methoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) not only has a docking score almost the same as nelfinavir, but also, like nelfinavir, interacts with Glu166 residue through H-bonding. On the other hand, the interactions between spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl and 3.beta-hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme were found to be more than both the standard drugs. Additionally, other compounds, including androstan-17-one, 3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5.alpha), camphenol, (âˆ’)-Globulol, yangambin, nordazepam, TMS derivative, and benzeneethanamine, also represented greater interaction with the abovementioned enzyme. Previously, it was found that the His41 and Cys145 residues belong to the catalytic dyads of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the current study, the results of the docking analysis revealed that retinal, retinol, spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl, phosphonoacetic Acid, 3TMS derivative, aR-turmerone, androstan-17-one, 3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5.alpha) interacted with Cys145 residue through hydrophobic interaction. Furthermore, the two standard drugs, along with most of the selected compounds, interacted with His41 residue. Like nelfinavir, benzeneethanamine also yielded interaction with His41 residue by forming hydrogen bonds. Although neither nelfinavir nor lopinavir interacted with Met49 residues, most of the targeted compounds interacted with Met49 residues, and this residue, along with His41, is crucial for substrate-binding [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, Gly143, Ser144, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Thr190, Ala191, and Gln192 residues are also crucial for substrate binding in SARS-CoV-2 M

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Our analysis showed that 3,4-dihydroxymandelic interacted with His163, Ser144 from the substrate-binding domain through hydrogen bonding. In addition, camphenol, possessing a greater docking score, formed a hydrogen bond with substrate-binding His164 residue. Moreover, most of the selected compounds as well as nelfinavir interacted with Met165 residue by forming a hydrophobic interaction.
