<p>The whole plant of 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> was collected at the mature stage from the Lawachara National Park, Moulavi Bazar, Bangladesh, in January 2018. The plant parts were cut into small pieces that were washed under tap water and then dried in the dark at 21–30 °C for 15 days. The whole plant material was ground by a mechanical grinder and passed through a size of 60 mesh sieve to obtain a fine powder that was stored in an air-tight container.
