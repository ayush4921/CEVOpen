<p>3D crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 6W63) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank and prepared using the protein preparation wizard of the Schrödinger Suite—Maestro version 10.1. Charges and bond orders were assigned, hydrogens added to heavy atoms and selenomethionines and selenocysteines converted into methionines and cysteines, respectively, followed by removing all water molecules. Using force field OPLS_2005, minimization was performed to set a maximum heavy atom RMSD to 0.30 Å.
