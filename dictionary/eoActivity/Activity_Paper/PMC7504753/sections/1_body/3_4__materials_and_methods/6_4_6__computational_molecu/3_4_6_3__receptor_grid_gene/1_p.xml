<p>Receptor grid generation and molecular docking experiments were performed using Glide (Schrödinger Suite—Maestro version 10.1) [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A grid was produced for each protein using the following default parameters: van der Waals scaling factor 1.00 and charge cut-off value 0.25, subjected to the OPLS_2005 force field. A cubic box of definite dimensions centered on the centroid of the active site residues was generated for the receptor, and the box size was set to 14 Å × 14 Å × 14 Å for docking. Docking experiments were carried out using the standard precision (SP) scoring function of glide, and only the best scoring fit with docking score was noted for each ligand.
