<p>The pharmacokinetic properties of all major identified compounds were evaluated using Lipinski’s rule of five [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Lipinski stated that a compound could show drug-like behavior if it does not fail more than one of the following criteria: (i) Molecular weight is not more than 500; (ii) H-bond donors ≤ 5; (iii) H-bond acceptors ≤ 10; (iv) Lipophilicity &lt; 5; and (v) Molar refractivity between 40 and 130. The web tool Swiss ADME was used to assess the ADME parameters of all compounds. Compounds obeying the Lipinski rule are considered as ideal drug candidates [
