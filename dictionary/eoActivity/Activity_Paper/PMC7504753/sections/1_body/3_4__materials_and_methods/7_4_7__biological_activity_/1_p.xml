<p>The targeted compounds were assessed for potential bioactivity by calculating their activity scores as GPCR ligands, ion channel modulators, kinase inhibitors, nuclear receptor inhibitors, and enzyme inhibitors. All the parameters were checked with the aid of the software Molinspiration (

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03936" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Calculated drug-likeness scores of each compound were compared with each compoundâ€™s specific activity and were compared with the standard drugs (nelfinavir and lopinavir).
