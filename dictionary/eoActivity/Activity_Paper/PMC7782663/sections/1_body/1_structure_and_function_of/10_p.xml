<p>In many pathological conditions such as arterial hypertension, insulin resistance or abdominal obesity – which are part of the metabolic syndrome – and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, as well as in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and in some cancers, increased expression of Trx and TrxR significantly disturbs redox homeostasis

 </xref>. It has been suggested that oxidative stress leading to increased TrxR biosynthesis may inhibit apoptosis, resulting in initiation of the neoplastic process
