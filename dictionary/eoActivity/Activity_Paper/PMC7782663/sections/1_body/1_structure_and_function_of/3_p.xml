<p>Trx1 is a 12 kDa protein
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>5</sup>
 </xref> that is biosynthesized as a 105-amino acid propeptide, which through an activation process, undergoes removal of an N-terminal methionine, leading to the generation of the 104-amino acid active protein that has valine at its N-terminus
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>6</sup>
 </xref>. The mitochondrial Trx isoform is biosynthesized as an 18 kDa protein containing 166 amino acids with a 60-amino acid sequence at its N-terminal that is responsible for directing the newly synthesised Trx molecule into the mitochondrion. After reaching the mitochondrion, the protein is hydrolysed with a 60-amino acid peptide cleavage, resulting in the 12.2 kDa active Trx2 protein
