<p>On the other hand, 
 <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> studies have shown that Trx-dependent neurotoxin-reducing effects are necessary to affect botulinum nerve cells (BoNT) and tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). It has been observed that blocking of impulse conduction by BoNT and TeNT occurs only when the interchain disulphide bond in the toxin structure is reduced, which is possible in the presence of a reduced form of Trx

 </xref>. As BoNT- and TeNT-producing Clostridia bacteria are widespread, humans are often exposed to these toxins when wounds are infected or when contaminated food is eaten, which in serious cases, can lead to death. Consequently, the search for inhibitors of the Trx-TrxR system is also necessary in the context of treatment for neurotoxin poisoning, which is a serious toxicological and pharmacological problem

 </xref>. That is why for many years, research to find effective but selective methods of modifying the function of the Trx-TrxR system has been important. As a consequence, many natural chemical/physical factors and a whole range of synthetic compounds, mainly transition metal ions complexes, have been explored to target this system.
