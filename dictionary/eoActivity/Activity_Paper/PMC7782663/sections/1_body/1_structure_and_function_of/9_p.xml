<p>Although antioxidant activity is the main function of the thioredoxin-dependent system, the system also participates in cofactor activities and regulates the expression of many genes

 </xref>. Trx supports the transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor NFκB – which can stimulate the growth of cancer cells – by promoting its interaction with DNA through reduction of the disulphide bond in one of the NFκB subunits

 </xref>. Trx also binds to Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) – which regulates apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions – to cause its degradation

 </xref>. However, in the presence of ROS or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), Trx and ASK1 are released. ASK1 stimulates cellular growth through the activation of kinases such as p38 and JNK, which stimulate the activity of the proapoptotic protein Bax and simultaneously inhibit the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. This promotes the activation of caspase 3, which triggers apoptosis

 </xref>. Moreover, Trx, through the Reduction-oxidation factor 1 (Ref-1), modulates the activity of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth in response to exogenous stimuli such as ionising radiation

 </xref>. It has also been observed that TNFα stimulates the biosynthesis of TrxR, which by reducing Trx, leads to an increase in NFκB activity
