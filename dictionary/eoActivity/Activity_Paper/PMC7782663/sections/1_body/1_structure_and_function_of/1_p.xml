<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a byproduct of metabolism in living organisms. Redox homeostasis is achieved by cellular systems involving macromolecular compounds including proteins that either prevent the production of these reactive species, or regulate their effects. One such system involves three cooperating redox proteins: thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), and NADPH (the latter is a source of protons) (
