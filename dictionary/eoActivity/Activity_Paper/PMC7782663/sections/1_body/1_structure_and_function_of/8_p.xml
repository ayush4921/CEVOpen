<p>The effective action of the Trx-dependent system is also linked to the presence of thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), which in cooperation with Trx, can reduce lipid peroxides and hydrogen peroxide

 </xref>. TPx belongs to a family of proteins called peroxiredoxins (Prx), which contain in their active centre, a cysteine (Prx-SH) that is prone to oxidation. The peroxiredoxin molecule is converted to its oxidised form (Prx-SOH) as a result of peroxide reduction, which in reaction with another reduced peroxiredoxin molecule, forms a disulphide bond (Prx-S-S-Prx) with simultaneous release of a water molecule. TPx contains the Cys47 and Cys170 residues, which participate in peroxide reduction. The large distance between the cysteines makes it impossible for the formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond and as a result, the oxidised form of TPx, similar to TrxR, occurs in the form of dimers in which two intermolecular bonds in the Cys47-Cys170 system are formed

 </xref>. The effective action of TPx requires the presence of reduced Trx. The reduced form of Trx reduces TPx, which can then reduce peroxide molecules in the cell, protecting other molecules from the oxidative effects of ROS
