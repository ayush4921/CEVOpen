<p>The formation of the enzyme as a homodimer is important for TrxR biological activity. TrxR molecules are arranged in space such that the C-terminal active site of one molecule is adjacent to cysteines present in the redox-active sequence at the N-terminal element of another molecule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) â€“ this is crucial for the function of the enzyme because such a spatial organisation allows for the free flow of electrons during the redox reaction

 </xref>. After recruitment of NADPH via the NAPDH binding domain of the enzyme, electrons are transferred to the FAD domain at the N-terminal end of the protein. The active redox sequence of one subunit of the enzyme transfers electrons to the active site located at the interface domain of the other subunit
