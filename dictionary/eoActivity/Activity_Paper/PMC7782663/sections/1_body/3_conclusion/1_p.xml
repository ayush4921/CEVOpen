<p>The Trx-TrxR system is essential to maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Cellular metabolism in normal physiological, as well as pathophysiological, conditions including carcinogenesis, depends on the efficiency of this system. Since the Trx-dependent system can both contribute to the intensification of angiogenesis, tumour growth, resistance to therapy, as well as drive changes that result in the death of cancer cells by apoptosis, the search for compounds that are inhibitors of Trx and/or TrxRs could modulate the tumoral activity of the Trx-dependent system. The functions of the Trx- and GSH-dependent systems complement each other, so a decrease in the performance of a Trx-dependent system usually increases the performance of a GSH-dependent system. Therefore, ideal inhibitors would simultaneously limit the function of both antioxidant systems.</p>
