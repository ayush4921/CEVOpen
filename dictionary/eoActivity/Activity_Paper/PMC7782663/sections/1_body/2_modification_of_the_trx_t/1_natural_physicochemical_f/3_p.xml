<p>It has been found that the enzymatic activity of TrxR can be inhibited by some natural polyphenolic compounds including curcumin (

 </xref>. Curcumin causes covalent modification of the C-terminal TrxR fragment, namely alkylation of both cysteine and selenocysteine. This irreversibly inhibits the activity of the enzyme, causing TrxR to lose its ability to reduce proteins through Trx, which promotes an increase in oxidative stress in cells

 </xref>. Similar effects have been observed with quercetin and myricetin, which like curcumin, can cause irreversible inhibition of TrxR activity

 </xref>. For myricetin, it has been observed that a TrxR mutant containing cysteine in position 498 does not prevent the oxidation of this flavanol. This suggests that the selenocysteine in the active centre of TrxR is crucial for the interaction between TrxR and flavanols

 </xref>. Curcumin-induced alkylation of TrxR can have effects analogous to NADPH oxidase that involve significant increases in ROS production and increased oxidative stress
