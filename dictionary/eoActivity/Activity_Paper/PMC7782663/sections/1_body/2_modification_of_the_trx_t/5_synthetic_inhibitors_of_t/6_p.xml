<p>In addition to the abovementioned organometallic compounds, TrxR activity is also inhibited by compounds containing rhodium (Rh) and copper (Cu) ions. It has been shown that compound complexes containing Rh(I) in their structure that inhibit the activity of TrxR also have an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells such as breast adenoma and colorectal cancer cells

 </xref>. However, copper (I) alkyl phosphine complexes have greater cytotoxicity towards cancer cells than analogous compounds containing Au + and Ag + as a central ion, and higher cytotoxicity than the reference compound cisplatin

 </xref>. The fact that Cu(I) complexes inhibit TrxR activity to a much lesser extent than the reference compound suggests that the toxic action of Cu-containing complexes against cancer cells does not result from apoptosis, but is caused by impairments to systems that regulate redox homeostasis.
