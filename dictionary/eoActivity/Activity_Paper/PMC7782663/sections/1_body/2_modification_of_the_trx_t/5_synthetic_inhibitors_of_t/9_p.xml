<p>Another pharmacologically important group of TrxR inhibitors are compounds that are classified as Michael acceptors. These include compounds containing electron-withdrawing groups (for instance ester or carbonyl group) connected with alkenes which interact directly with the active centre of the TrxR

 </xref>. In addition, some DVD-445 analogues also show inhibitory activity against TrxR activity, but not in cancer cells

 </xref>. Therefore, the search for other TrxR inhibitors that will simultaneously inhibit the action of other pro-survival enzymes in relation to cancer cells is ongoing. Such a group of compounds includes the sulfocoumarins

 </xref> and other Michael acceptors which inhibit both thioredoxin reductase and carbonic anhydrase
 <xref rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>. The presence of electron withdrawing groups in their structures makes them act as Michael acceptors and thus have the ability to inhibit the activity of TrxR
 <xref rid="CIT0093" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>93</sup>
 </xref>. A similar effect was observed for a synthetic compound that contains both the Michael acceptor group (responsible for the inhibition of TrxR) and the motif responsible for inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, which is very important in the process of carcinogenesis, because carbonic anhydrase protects cancer cells against acidification and hypoxia, preventing them death. This "hybrid" exhibits significant cytotoxicity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-1) compared to co-administered combinations of TrxR inhibitors and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

 </xref>. Consequently, due to the efficacy and preference for cancer cells, the synthesis and further research on Michael acceptors indicate the possible emergence of a compound effective in the treatment of highly multi-drug resistant cancers (
