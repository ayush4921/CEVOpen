<p>Other compounds that inhibit TrxR activity include organic complexes containing tin (Sn) or ruthenium (Ru) ions at +4 and +3, and +2 oxidation levels, respectively

 </xref>. Like other metal ions, ruthenium compounds inhibit the activity of only the cytosolic isoform of the TrxR, while the mitochondrial isoform does not show significant changes in activity even after administration of high concentrations of ruthenium

 </xref>. However, some Ru (II) compounds show an antiproliferative effect on melanoma cells similar to the effects of cisplatin, whereas other ruthenium compounds have more significant anti-proliferative effects than cis-platin. In the case of multi-drug resistant lung cancer cells insensitive to cisplatin, ruthenium complexes have been shown to significantly inhibit TrxR activity. Also, these compounds were shown to inhibit the activity of TrxR more effectively than auranofin
