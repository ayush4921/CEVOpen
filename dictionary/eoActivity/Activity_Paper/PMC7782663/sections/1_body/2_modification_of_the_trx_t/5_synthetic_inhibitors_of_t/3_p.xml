<p>Lanthanum (III) chloride (LaCl
 <sub>3</sub>) also shows an inhibitory effect on TrxR activity, similar to that of calcium ions, which can be explained by the similarities between Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and La
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. Like calcium ions, lanthanum ions have a stronger affinity for the cytosolic TrxR isoform than the mitochondrial reductase, which manifests itself in lower required concentrations to reduce TrxR activity, and increasing ROS levels only affect relatively low concentrations of lanthanum ions

 </xref>. Higher concentrations of La
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (similar to calcium ions) inhibit TrxR, whereas no increase in ROS levels are observed, which suggests that lanthanum compounds may also act as scavengers of ROS. It is important to note that LaCl
 <sub>3</sub> does not react directly with cysteine or selenocysteine in TrxR but forms a link with the enzyme outside its active centre, which changes the spatial arrangement of the polypeptide TrxR chain. This is explained by the fact that according to the theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), the La
 <sup>3+</sup> ion is a hard acid that reacts with groups classified as hard bases (e.g. carboxylate ions or hydroxyl groups)

 <sub>3</sub> does not show an inhibitory effect on GR activity, even when significant concentrations of the salt are used
