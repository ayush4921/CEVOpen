<p>A significant group of compounds that can inhibit the activity of TrxR include complexes containing metal ions, mainly transient ones. Among chemicals that inhibit TrxR activity, some of the most effective are platinum and gold complexes

 </xref>. Platinum complexes (cis-platinum, carboplatin) – which are used in the treatment of many cancers – irreversibly inhibit the activity of TrxR while maintaining the activity of other reductases (e.g. glutaredoxin or GSH reductase). This is because platinum complexes show a greater affinity for the selenol group (present in the TrxR active centre) compared to the thiol group (located in the GSH reductase active centre)

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that auranofin – a complex containing gold at +1 oxidation level – is capable of inhibiting TrxR at a low, nanomolar level concentration whereas such an effect on glutathione reductase (GR) was only observed at higher micromolar concentrations

 </xref>. Differences in auranofin concentrations needed to inhibit these enzymes were attributed to the presence of selenocysteine in the C-terminal motif of TrxR and its absence in GR. Additionally, it has been observed that during auranofin application, hydrogen peroxide production and cytochrome C secretion increases, which results in a change in the redox environment and consequently, apoptosis

 </xref>. It has been suggested that gold ions that bind to cysteine and selenocysteine in the C-terminal motif of TrxR create a -Se-Au-S- motif, blocking the possibility of the enzyme to form disulphide bonds
