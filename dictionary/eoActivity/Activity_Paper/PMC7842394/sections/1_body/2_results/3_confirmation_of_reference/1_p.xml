<p id="Par20">To confirm the dependability of the selected reference genes for standardization, we investigated the expression patterns of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> in different tissues. When standardized with the top two most appropriate reference genes (
 <italic>Î²-TUB</italic> and 
 <italic>UBC</italic>) and their combination, the expression levels of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> were highest in the root (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These findings are coincident with the expression profiles of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> previously reported in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, when normalized with the unstable gene 
 <italic>ACT11</italic>, the expression patterns of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> were quite different from previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and these two genes showed the highest expression level in the stem and leaf, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, the selection of an inappropriate reference gene may cause biased results. Here, analysis of the expression profiles of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> indicted that the chosen reference genes were reliable for qRT-PCR standardization.
