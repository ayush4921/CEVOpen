<p id="Par14">Based on the transcriptome sequences of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, the expression patterns of candidate reference genes were analyzed in diverse experimental conditions, comprising six housekeeping genes (
 <italic>ACT11</italic>, 
 <italic>ACT7</italic>, 
 <italic>α-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic>, and 
 <italic>UBC</italic>) and four novel candidate reference genes (
 <italic>RPL</italic>, 
 <italic>SAM</italic>, 
 <italic>HSP70</italic>, and 
 <italic>PP2A</italic>). The results of agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that all the 10 candidates were specifically amplifed because only one single product of the expected size appeared (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, the specificity of primers was also verified by the single peak of melting curve (Supplementary Fig. 2). The melting temperatures of the amplicons ranged from 81.6 °C for 
 <italic>UBC</italic> to 89.2 °C for 
 <italic>HSP70</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 2). The 
 <italic>E</italic> of the primers varied from 92.52% for 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> to 118.18% for 
 <italic>ACT7</italic>, while the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> ranged from 0.9889 for 
 <italic>PP2A</italic> to 0.9992 for 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> and 
 <italic>HSP70</italic>. The expression levels of the 10 candidate reference genes were determined by the values of the cycle threshold (Ct). A smaller Ct value indicated a higher expression level. The Ct value of all candidate reference genes under different experimental conditions varied from 21.13 to 32.17 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Among them, 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> represented the lowermost transcript abundance with the uppermost average Ct value, while 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> had the uppermost transcript abundance with the lowermost average Ct value. In addition, among all samples, the SD of 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> was the smallest (SD = 0.79), whereas 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> showed the maximum variability (SD = 1.44) (Supplementary Table 2).
