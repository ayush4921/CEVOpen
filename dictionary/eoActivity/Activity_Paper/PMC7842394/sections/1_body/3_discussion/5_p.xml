<p id="Par25">To confirm the dependability of the selected reference genes, we used the top two most stable reference genes (
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> and 
 <italic>UBC</italic>), a combination of these, and the most unstable reference gene (
 <italic>ACT11</italic>) to standardize the relative expression levels of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> in different tissues. The results indicated that the expression profiles of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> in different tissues were consistent with those reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] when 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>UBC</italic>, or their combination were used for normalization. In contrast, their expression profiles were obviously different when normalized with 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The expression analysis of 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> indicated that a appropriate reference gene is crucial for obtaining accurate qRT-PCR results.
