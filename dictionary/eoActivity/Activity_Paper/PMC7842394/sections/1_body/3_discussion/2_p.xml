<p id="Par22">Here, the expression stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes were assessed in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone treatments (SA, MeJA, and ABA), and abiotic stress treatments (Cr, Cu, salt, drought, cold, and wounding) for qRT-PCR normalization. Additionally, 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic>, two genes belonging to the 
 <italic>CYP450</italic> family that are associated with hydroxyl transferase and are involved in the biosynthesis of baicalein and scutellarin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], were used as targets for verification of the selected reference genes.
