<p id="Par10">qRT-PCR was executed on a Roche Light Cycler 96 system (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Twenty microliters of the reaction mixture, consisting of 10 μL Master Mix (SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix), 2 μL cDNA diluted to 2.5 ng/μL, 0.5 μL 10 mM forward, 0.5 μL 10 mM reverse primer, and 7 μL DNase/RNase-free deionized water, was pipetted into a 96-well plate. The amplification was performed as the following conditions: initial 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s, final melt-curve analysis. From five-fold continuous diluted cDNA (5

 <sup>−1</sup>, 5
 <sup>−2</sup>, 5
 <sup>−3</sup>, 5
 <sup>−4</sup>, and 5
 <sup>−5</sup>) for each gene, we obtained the standard curve, correlation coefficient (
