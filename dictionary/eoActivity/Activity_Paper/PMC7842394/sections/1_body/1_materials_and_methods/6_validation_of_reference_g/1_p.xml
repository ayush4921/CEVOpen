 <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic>, two key genes associated with the biosynthesis of baicalein and scutellarein in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, were chosen as target genes to verify the applicability of the selected reference gene. Their relative transcription levels in different tissues were normalized by the top two most stable reference genes and their combinations, as well as the least stable reference genes. The 2
 <sup>−△△Ct</sup> method was applied to calculate the relative transcription levels [
