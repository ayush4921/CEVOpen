  <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi is a famous medicinal plant with its dried roots having been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal for more than 2000 years. Although its genome sequence has previously been published and molecular biology methods have been used to study this species, no suitable internal reference genes have been investigated for standardization of gene expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here, the stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes, 
  <italic>ACT11</italic>, 
  <italic>ACT7</italic>, 
  <italic>α-TUB</italic>, 
  <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
  <italic>GAPDH</italic>, 
  <italic>UBC</italic>, 
  <italic>RPL</italic>, 
  <italic>SAM</italic>, 
  <italic>HSP70</italic>, and 
  <italic>PP2A</italic>, were analyzed by four different procedures of GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Their expression stabilities were evaluated under various conditions, including different tissue types (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone stimuli treatments (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). The results indicated that 
  <italic>β-TUB</italic> was the most stable gene for all tested samples, while 
  <italic>ACT11</italic> was the most unstable. The most stable reference gene was not consistent under different conditions. 
  <italic>β-TUB</italic> exhibited the highest stability for different tissue types and abiotic stresses, while for hormone stimuli treatments, 
  <italic>ACT7</italic> showed the highest stability. To confirm the applicability of suitable reference genes, we selected to 
  <italic>SbF6H</italic> and 
  <italic>SbF8H</italic> as target genes to analyze their expression levels in different tissues. This study helps to the accurate quantification of the relative expression levels of interest genes in 
  <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> via qRT-PCR analysis.
