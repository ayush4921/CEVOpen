<p>Over the years human medicine has improved greatly; but infections caused by microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites remain a lingering hurdle to overcome, especially with the emergence of widespread drug resistant forms of these microbes and adverse side effects to certain antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B263-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. Research into plant sourced antibiotics has intensified and the antimicrobial potentials of certain yam species have been investigated and reported. Using crude extracts and compounds isolated from the bulbils of the African medicinal plant 
 <italic>D. bulbifera,</italic> Kuete et al. [
 <xref rid="B264-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>] showed that these extracts and compounds can be effective drugs against a wide range of resistant gram negative bacteria. The inhibitory effect of the extracts was dependent on the concentration but still less effective compared to standard antibiotics. Likewise tuber mucilage extract of 
 <italic>D. esculenta</italic> have exhibited antibacterial properties against three human bacterial strains including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B263-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. The inhibitory potential of 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> tuber extracts against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, 
 <italic>Shiegella flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, endophytic fungi isolated from rhizome extract of 
 <italic>D. zingiberensis</italic>, a Chinese medicinal plant, has shown its antibacterial potential for use for the production of antibacterial natural products [
 <xref rid="B265-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. The same trend was observed by Sonibare and Abegunde [
 <xref rid="B127-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Using the agar well diffusion and pour plate method, the authors reported extracts of 
 <italic>D. dumetorum</italic> and 
 <italic>D. hirtiflora</italic> tubers as possible sources of antimicrobial agents with their antimicrobial efficacy directly linked to the phenolic contents of the plants and DPPH scavenging activity. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] compared the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic> tuber extracts and antibiotics (penicillin and kanamycin) on five selected bacterial strains (
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>). Their findings revealed a significant inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic> tuber extracts against the tested bacteria. This activity was attributed to diosgenin content in the tubers.
