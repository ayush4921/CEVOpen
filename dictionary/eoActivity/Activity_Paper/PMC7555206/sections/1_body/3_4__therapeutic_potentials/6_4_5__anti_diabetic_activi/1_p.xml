<p>Notwithstanding the availability of numerous anti-diabetic medicines in the pharmaceutical industry and market, diabetes and related complications remain a medical burden. Plantsâ€™ anti-diabetic potential stems from their ability to restore the function of the pancreatic tissues which leads to three possible outcomes: increasing the insulin output, inhibiting the intestinal absorption of glucose and restoring the facilitation of metabolites in insulin dependent processes [
