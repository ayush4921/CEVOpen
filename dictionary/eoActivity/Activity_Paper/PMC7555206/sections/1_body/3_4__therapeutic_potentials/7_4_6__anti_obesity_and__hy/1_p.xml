<p>Jeong et al. [
 <xref rid="B300-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>] reported the anti-obesity effect of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> extract on diet-induced obese mice. In their study, a high-fat diet was given to female mice with 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> for 8 weeks. The authors observed a significant decrease in total body weight and parametrial adipose tissue weight; as well as decrease in total cholesterol, triglyceride level and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in blood serum; female mice associated with the ingestion of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia n</italic>-butanol extract. The observed effect of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia n</italic>-butanol extract is mediated through suppression of feeding efficiency and absorption of dietary fat [

 <italic>D. nipponica</italic> Makino powder, reported the effectiveness of the extract against body and adipose tissue weight gains in rodents induced by a high-fat diet [

 <italic>D. steriscus</italic> tubers extracted using a solvent cold percolation method have been reported [
 <xref rid="B302-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. When compared with a commercially available anti-obesity medication (herbex), 
 <italic>D. steriscus</italic> tubers extract showed a significantly higher anti-obesity activity. The author attributed the result to be associated with the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>D. steriscus</italic> tubers, which can act as lipase and Î±-amylase inhibitors and thus are useful for the development of anti-obesity therapeuticals [
