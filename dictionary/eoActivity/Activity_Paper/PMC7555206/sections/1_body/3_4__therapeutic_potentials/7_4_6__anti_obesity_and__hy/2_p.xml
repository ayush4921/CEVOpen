<p>Extracts of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species have been used in clinical management of other metabolic disorders such as abnormal cholesterol level. Several animal studies have shown the antilipemic effects of sapogenin and diosgenin-rich extract of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species like 
 <italic>D. polygonoides</italic> (Jamaican bitter yam) on hypercholesterolemic animals such as mice and rat, thus resulting in the reduction in the concentrations of blood cholesterol [

 <italic>D. alata</italic> L. on the mucosal enzyme activities in the small intestine and lipid metabolism of adult Balb/c mice showed constant improvement in the cholesterol profile of the liver and plasma of mice fed with 50% raw lyophilized yam for a duration of 21 days [

 <xref rid="B305-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>] observed a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol in male Wistar rat as a result of consumption of a 10% high cholesterol diet supplemented with 40%
