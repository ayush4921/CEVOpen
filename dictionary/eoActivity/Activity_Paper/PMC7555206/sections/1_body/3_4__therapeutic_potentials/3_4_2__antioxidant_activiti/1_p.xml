<p>Antioxidant activities have been reported in different species of

 <xref rid="B270-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. Using a DPPH assay, Murugan and Mohan [
 <xref rid="B268-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>] reported radical scavenging activity of 79.3% for 1000 µg/mL 
 <italic>D. esculenta</italic> extract with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 38.33 µg/mL, whereas IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 18.25 µg/mL was recorded for the reference standard (ascorbic acid). The same trend was observed by the author when the ABTS assay was used, with radical cation scavenging activity range of 46.1% to 64.1% at concentration between 125 and 1000 µg/mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 40.50 µg/mLwhile IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 20.67 µg/mLfor trolox. The author attributed the antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity to high content of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds. Similarly, Padhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B177-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] examined the antioxidant activity of nine different yams (
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>D. pubera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>D. wallichii</italic>, 
 <italic>D. hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>D. hamiltonii</italic>) cultivated in Koraput, India. Their findings revealed antioxidant capacity ranging from 1.63% to 5.59%, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 101–1032, 77.9–1164, 47–690 and 27–1023 µg/mLfor ABTS, DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide scavenging activity, respectively. Among the yam species evaluated, antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>D. pubera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic> and 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> were significantly higher with lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than the standards when compared to the other species. The variation in scavenging activities observed in the different yam species is attributed to the disparity in the content of the bioactive compounds in the yam species [
