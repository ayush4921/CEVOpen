<p>Pharmaceutical and phytomedical products derived from plants have a long history of use by natives as traditional medicine and a proven evidence of efficacy. Gurib-Fakim [
 <xref rid="B196-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] highlighted that tribal people in the tropics use plants for medicine as direct therapeutic agents and starting points for the elaboration of semi-synthetic compounds. A majority of secondary plant compounds used in modern medicine were identified through ethnobotanical investigations. Ethnobotany is an interdisciplinary field of research with specific focus on the empirical knowledge of indigenous people with respect to natural plant substances that influence health and wellbeing and their associated risk [
 <xref rid="B196-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Natives of different ethnic communities that either cultivate or have wild 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp. have utilized them for medicinal purposes (

 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> is still limited. Research has shown that yam bioactive compounds and its supplementations play vital roles in weight changes, activities of carbohydrate digestive and transport enzymes, changes in the morphology of intestines, alterations in blood lipids, lipid peroxidation reduction and liver damage prevention [

 <xref rid="B198-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] highlighted the high demand and robust market of four wild yam species including 
 <italic>D. coriacea</italic>, 
 <italic>D. lehmannii</italic>, 
 <italic>D. meridensis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. polygonoides</italic> in Bogota, Colombia. The four species have been implicated in blood purification probably because of their effect on reducing blood cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid and glucose. The general acceptability and long history of local consumption of yams among various communities across the continents may be attributed to its safety and portends high regulatory acceptability [
 <xref rid="B199-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Current research has shown that yams contain substantial amounts of secondary metabolites referred to as bioactive compounds that have pharmaceutical potentials as discussed and the health benefits associated with yam consumption is discussed hereafter.
