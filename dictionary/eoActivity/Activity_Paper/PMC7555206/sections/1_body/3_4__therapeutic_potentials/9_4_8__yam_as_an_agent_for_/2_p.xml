<p>Chinese anti-menopausal medicine formula containing rhizomes of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> L. have shown the potential to regulate serum levels of estrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone thereby alleviating some side effects in post-menopausal women [
 <xref rid="B325-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">325</xref>]. This is in line with the study by Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B244-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>], whose research result supports the use of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> in Chinese medicine for easing menopausal disorders. Proteins isolated from 
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. zingiberensis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> showed potential to upregulate the translational levels of estrogen receptor beta, thus possibly reducing the risk of ovarian cancer [

 <italic>D collettii</italic> var. hypoglauca have been implicated in the production of herbal formula 
 <italic>feng bei bi xie</italic> used primarily for the treatment of cervical carcinoma which is prevalent within female aging period [

 <italic>D. bartletti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B207-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]; while in Latin American communities, the use of decoctions to ameliorate pains of childbirth, painful menstruation, ovarian pains and vaginal cramping have been reported [

 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species as major constituents for commercial progesterone production used for treatment of menopausal hot flashes [
 <xref rid="B207-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. When administered orally to female Sprague Dawley rats, Higdon et al. [
 <xref rid="B328-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">328</xref>] reported an increase in uterine weight, vaginal opening, vaginal cell proliferation and reduced bone loss. This estrogenic influence mechanism is consistent with the findings of Michel et al. [
 <xref rid="B207-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>] who reported mild in vitro biding affinity for estrogen alpha and beta receptors in their test models. Although anin vitrobioassay does not necessarily correspond toin vivoefficacy, the data seem to implicate a significant influence of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species in management of issues related to womenâ€™s reproductive health.
