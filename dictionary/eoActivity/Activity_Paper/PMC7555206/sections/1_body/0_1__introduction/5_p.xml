<p>While there are pharmacological prospects of yam, its antinutritional components cannot be overlooked. The utilization of some species of yam, such as 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> and 
 <italic>D. hispida,</italic> have been hindered due to the bitter taste caused by the presence of furanoid norditerpenes (diosbulbin) and dioscorine, respectively [

 <xref rid="B29-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, in the context of extreme food scarcity, processing such as soaking, boiling and roasting are used to reduce or eliminate the bitterness. In addition, diosbulbin and dioscorine have been reported to trigger fatal paralysis of the nervous system [

 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] described histamine as one of the major compounds that induce allergic reactions such as an itch on the skin. Although histamine may be the principal allergen in yam, studies have also reported the potential of dioscorin from 
 <italic>D. batatas</italic> (presently known as 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic>) to cause allergic reaction [
