<p>Saponins are a diverse group of glycosidic compounds containing triterpenoid and steroidal aglycone that occur naturally in plants and in lower marine organisms. While triterpenoid saponins are mostly found in dicotyledonous angiosperms, steroidal saponins are mainly present in monocot species such as

Steroidal saponins vary in their structural constitutive frameworks, sugars and aglycones, leading to a broad range of biological activities exerted by these compounds. Depending on the aglycone moiety, steroid saponins can be classified into spirostane, stigmastane, furostane, cholestane, ergostane and pregnane families [

 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> genus mostly contain spirostane and furostane steroid glycosides; however, studies have reported the possible presence of other steroidal saponins [

 <xref rid="B137-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Predominantly, yams contain a spirostane steroidal sapogenin known as diosgenin with a structure of 25R-spirost-5-en-3b-ol consisting of a hydrophilic sugar moiety linked to a hydrophobic steroid aglycone with a molecular formula C
