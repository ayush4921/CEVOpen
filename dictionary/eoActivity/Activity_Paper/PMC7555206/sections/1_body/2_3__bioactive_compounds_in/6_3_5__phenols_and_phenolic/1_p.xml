<p>Phenols and phenolic acids are a group of abundant secondary metabolites found in plants. Simple phenol is characterized by one or more hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached directly to the aromatic system and comprising of resorcinol, phenol, phloroglucinol and catechol [

While the hydroxybenzoic acid (vanillic, gallic, protocatechuic and syringic acid) are the simplest phenolic acids found in nature consisting of seven carbon atoms (C
