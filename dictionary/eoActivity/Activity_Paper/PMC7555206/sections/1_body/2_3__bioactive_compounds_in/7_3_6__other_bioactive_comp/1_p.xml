 <xref rid="B187-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Their content in yams varies depending on species, variety, soil type and other environmental factors. The presence of tannin, phytate and oxalate ranging from 56–1970 mg/kg, 270.7–379.4 mg/kg and 487–671 mg/kg on a dry matter basis, respectively, were recorded in 43 genotypes from five yam species (

Tannins are water-soluble polyphenols known for their astringent taste and ability to bind to and precipitate various organic compounds including proteins, amino acids and alkanoids, thus decreasing digestibility and tastiness [
 <xref rid="B188-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Structurally, tannins are classified into two groups, the hydrolysable and the condensed tannins. Studies on experimental animals showed possible effects of tannins on feed intake and efficiency, net metabolizable energy, growth rate and protein digestibility [
 <xref rid="B189-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Their relationship with reduced sensory quality of food cannot be neglected. Other adverse effects of tannins such as increase in excretion of protein and essential amino acids and damage to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B189-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. On the other hand, studies have also shown the pharmacological potential of tannins including antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity; anticarcinogenic, antimutagenic, cardio-protective properties; and antimicrobial activities [
