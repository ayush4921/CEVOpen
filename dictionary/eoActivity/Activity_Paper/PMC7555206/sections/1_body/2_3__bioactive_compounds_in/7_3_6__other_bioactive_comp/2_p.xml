<p>Phytate (
 <italic>myo</italic>-inositol hexa
 <italic>kis</italic>phosphate), a salt form of phytic acid, is the major storage form of phosphate and inositol found in a wide range of plants [
 <xref rid="B191-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Its classification as an antinutrient is associated with its capacity to form complexes with nutrients especially dietary minerals including zinc, calcium and iron, thus reducing their availability in the body and causing mineral related deficiency in humans. In addition, the formation of insoluble complexes by phytate with other food components such as protein, lipids and carbohydrate have been reported thereby negatively impacting the utilization of these nutrients [

Notwithstanding these negative effects, dietary phytate exerts numerous positive health effects on humans including anticancer and antidiabetes activities and protection against renal lithiasis, dental caries, HIV and heart related diseases as extensively reviewed by Kumar et al. [

Oxalates may occur as insoluble calcium oxalate, soluble oxalate or in combination of the two forms as reported for yam tubers [
