<p>Flavonoids, ubiquitous in photosynthesizing cells, naturally occur as aglycons, glycosides and methylated derivatives [

 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>3</sub>-C
 <sub>6</sub>) contain a 2-phenyl-benzo(Î±)pyrane or flavane nucleus, which comprises two benzene rings (A and B) linked through a heterocyclic pyrane ring (C) [
 <xref rid="B174-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Based on the position of the carbon of the C ring (on which B ring is attached), the degree of unsaturation as well as oxidation of the C ring, flavonoids can be classified into subgroups [
 <xref rid="B175-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. For isoflavones, the B ring is linked in position 3 of the C ring, while the B ring of neoflavonoids is linked to position 4 of the C ring. Other subgroups of flavonoids in which the B ring are linked to position 2 include chalcones, flavones, flavonols, catechins, flavanonols, flavanones and anthocyanins. The pharmacological potential of these compounds cannot be overemphasized. Flavonoids have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, sedative, antidepressant, anti-proliferative, anticancer, cardioprotective, antiulcerogenic and hepatoprotective activity [
