<p>Yams also contain inorganic components such as minerals which play very important roles in the body metabolism (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These components can be divided into two groups based on their body requirement. They include the macrominerals (potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, chloride and sulfur), which are required in larger amounts; and the microminerals or trace minerals including copper, iron, manganese, zinc, iodine, cobalt, fluoride and selenium, needed in the body in small amounts. A study on the mineral profiling of 43 genotypes from five yam species revealed the intra- and inter-species variation in the mineral content of yam [

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of potassium in adults and children is 4700 mg/day and 3000 mg/day, respectively. Yams are better sources of potassium than other root and tuber crops (cassava, potatoes and sweet potatoes) as well as cereals (maize, rice, wheat) [

 <xref rid="B99-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] reported a range of 775 to 1850 mg/kg of potassium in yam, which correlates with the values previously reported [

 <italic>D. alata</italic> was also recorded by a much earlier study [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], thus suggesting that yam contributes immensely to the RDA of potassium for the consumers.
