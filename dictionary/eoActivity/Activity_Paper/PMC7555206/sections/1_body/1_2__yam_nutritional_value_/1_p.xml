<p>Over the years, several scientific studies have evaluated and reported the nutritional qualities of different 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species, as shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The nutritional abundance of yam varies depending on the species and variety, as well as the environmental conditions and agricultural practices engaged during planting [

 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The analytical method used for estimation also plays a significant role in nutritional levels recorded in yam. The major component of yam is water, which contributes up to 93% of fresh/wet weight of the tuber especially in 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. delicata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic> [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While the moisture content of other 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species ranges between 51% to 90% (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it is noteworthy to highlight that 
 <italic>D. hispida</italic> varieties were reported to have the lowest moisture content, ranging from 15.8%–37.8% of fresh weight [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. High values of moisture have also been reported in other root and tuber crops, with values ranging from 60%–79% in cassava, potato and sweet potatoes [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The moisture content of roots and tubers plays a very important role in determining the susceptibility of the crops to microbial spoilage and maintaining the shelf life of produce. Thus, species and varieties with low moisture content have longer shelf life and are more suitable for prolonged storage [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. According to FAO, an estimate of about 22% and 39% postharvest losses of yam occur in the major and minor seasons, respectively, due to high moisture content [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], hence contributing significantly to income loss for both farmers and traders. In addition to spoilage caused by high moisture content, it is important to highlight the importance of moisture as it relates to nutritional content of yam. A study on the effect of storage on nutritional content of yam revealed an increase in protein content, total sugar and reducing sugar from 13.0%–14.6%, 6.5%–9.8% and 1.7%–2.3%, respectively, as moisture decreased by 67.8% to 56.5% [
