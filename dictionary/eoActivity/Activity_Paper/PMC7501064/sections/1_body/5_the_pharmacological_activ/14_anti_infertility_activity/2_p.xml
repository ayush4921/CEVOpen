<p id="par0185">A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted whereby it was reported that 5 ml of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil improved sperm count and motility, semen pH, semen volume, and its round cells after 2 months treatment of infertile men (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds taken for 60 days increased the number of spermatocytes, total sperm count and motility, weight of the reproductive organs and the number of mature leydig cells (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil also demonstrated the ability to repair testicular degeneration, increase lipid peroxidation and abnormal sperms against sodium valproate testicular toxins. In relation to oxidative stress, TQ has exhibited some defensive roles such as superoxide anion scavengers, direct cytoprotective effects and androgen activities. Consequentially this leads to protect sperm and semen against testicular toxins. (
