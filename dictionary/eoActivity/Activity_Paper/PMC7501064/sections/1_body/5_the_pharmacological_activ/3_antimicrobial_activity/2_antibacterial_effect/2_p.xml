<p id="par0060">Thymohydroquinone obtained from the volatile oil of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> has a high significant effect against gram-positive microorganisms, including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Diethyl-ether extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was investigated to possess the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Aljabre et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> showed an additive effect with various drugs such as doxycycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and lincomycin (
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">Hanafy and Hatem, 1991</xref>). In the management of neonates with staphylococcal pustular skin infections, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract demonstrated almost similar results to topical antibiotic mupirocin (
 <xref rid="bib0600" ref-type="bibr">Rafati et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> exhibited promising outcomes against many multi-drug-resistant gram positive and gram negative bacteria including resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> possesses synergistic antibacterial effects in treatment of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. Chlorhexidine gluconate is a germicidal mouthwash that is used in bacterial infection. It was shown that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil extract exhibits better results than chlorhexidine gluconate when treating the infection of 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and other most common dental pathogens (
