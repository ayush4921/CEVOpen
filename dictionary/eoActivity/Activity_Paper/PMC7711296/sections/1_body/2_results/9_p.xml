<p>To investigate whether methanol extract could induce cell cycle perturbations in cancer cells, propidium iodide-stained nuclei were analyzed using flow cytometry. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 48 hr treatment with extract of 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> (300 Âµg/ml) increased the proportion of NCCIT cells in G0/G1 phase (20%) and reduced the proportion of S-phase cells (14%) compared to the control, indicating that the extract induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in NCCIT cells.
