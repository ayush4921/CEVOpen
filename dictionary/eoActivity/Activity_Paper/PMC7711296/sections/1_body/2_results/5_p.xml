<p>Capacity of a single cell to proliferate into a colony can be tested by clonogenic assays. We tested clonogenicity of NCCIT cells as embryonal carcinoma cells, after treatment with methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic>. Methanol extract dose-dependently inhibited colony formation ability of NCCIT cells. The minimum concentration of the extract (25 µg/ml) caused a reduction of approximately 4% in terms of colony formation and higher concentrations (100 and 200 µg/ml) significantly abrogated colony formation of NCCIT cells (

 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> extract on colony formation of NCCIT, confirmed its cytotoxic effect evaluated by MTT test.
