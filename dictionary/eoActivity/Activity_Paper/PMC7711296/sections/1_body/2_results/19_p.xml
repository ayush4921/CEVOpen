<p>The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>A. austro-iranicum</italic>, 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chlorostegium</italic> methanol extract was examined both qualitatively and quantitatively against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> were compared with ciproï¬‚oxacin. Inhibition zones and MIC values for bacterial strains were in the range of 3-13 mm and 0.39-50 mg/ml, respectively. The extracts showed higher inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as Gram-negative bacteria with inhibition zones of 11-13 mm and MIC range of 0.39-12.5 mg/ml and weaker antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with inhibition zones of 3-7 mm and MIC range of 25-50 mg/ml. Variation in the cell wall structure between Gram-negative and Gram-positive may have led to different inhibitory effects.
