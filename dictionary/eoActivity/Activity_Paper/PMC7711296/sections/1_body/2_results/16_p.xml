<p>To investigate antioxidant potential of methanol extracts of three species of 
 <italic>Acantholimon</italic>, the intracellular ROS levels were measured in control, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated cells incubated with different concentrations of the plant extracts. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, exposure of NCCIT cells to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (200 ÂµM) led to an increase in the fluorescent intensity (33-fold) as compared to the control cells which showed production of ROS by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>.
