<p>Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of living cells were determined using 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA). DCFH-DA can be deacetylated by cellular esterases to the non-fluorescent DCFH. DCFH is oxidized to fluorescent DCF (2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein) in the presence of ROS, which can be readily detected by a spectrofluorometer. Briefly, 25×10
 <sup>3</sup> NCCIT cells were cultured in 96-well microplates for 24 hr. Then, the medium was removed and cells were exposed to PBS containing 20 μM of DCFH-DA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and kept in a humidified atmosphere (with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C) for 45 min. Next, cells were treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (200 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in the absence/presence of each plant extract (50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/ml). After 3 hr, the fluorescence intensity was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 538 nm (FLX 800; BioTek).
