<p>MIC values were calculated for bacterial strains using micro-well dilution assay method (Baron, 1999
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Three replicates of the serial two-fold dilutions of each extract (0.003 to 200 mg/ml) were prepared in Mueller Hinton Broth medium in 96-well plates. Next, 10 µl of bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) was added into each well. The plates were placed in an incubator at 37°C for 24 hr. The wells containing 200 µl of the culture media and 10 µl of bacterial suspension without the test materials, were used as the negative control. The microorganism growth was shown by turbidity and the lowest concentration of the plant extracts required for inhibiting the growth of microorganisms (MIC value) was obtained. All tests were repeated twice.
