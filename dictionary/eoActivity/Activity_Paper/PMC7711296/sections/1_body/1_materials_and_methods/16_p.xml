<p>Apoptosis assay was performed on NCCIT cells treated with 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> methanol extract. Briefly, cells at a density of 3×10
 <sup>5 </sup>were grown in 60-mm petri dishes and allowed to attach for 24 hr and then they were treated with 700 μg/ml of the plant extract. After 24 hr incubation, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Afterward, the cells were suspended in 100 μl annexin V binding buffer and 5 µl of PE Annexin V and 5 µl of 7-AAD and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Annexin/7-AAD was evaluated by Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument using fl2 and fl3 filters for detection of annexin-PE and 7-AAD.
