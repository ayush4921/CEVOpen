<p>The inhibitory effect of plant extract on cellular proliferation was also determined using a colony-forming assay. NCCIT cells were plated in 6well dishes at 1x10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well and treated with various concentration (25, 50, 100, 200 µg/ml) of 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> methanol extract for 14 days. The colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Stained colonies containing&gt;50 cells were counted and plating efficiency was calculated according to the following formula: colony number/total cell number) × 100%.
