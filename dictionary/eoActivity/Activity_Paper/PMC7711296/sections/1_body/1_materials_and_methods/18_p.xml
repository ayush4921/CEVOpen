<p>NCCIT cells (5x10
 <sup>6</sup>) were seeded into 60 mm dishes and subjected to 300 µg/ml of 
 <italic>A. serotinum </italic>extract for 72 hr. Adherent cells were detached by trypsinization and washed twice with PBS. Cells were fixed using 70% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min and incubated with 20 µg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A for 1 hr at 37°C in the dark. The stained cells were subsequently analyzed using BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer at a wavelength of 488 nm, equipped with Cell Quest 3.3 software.
