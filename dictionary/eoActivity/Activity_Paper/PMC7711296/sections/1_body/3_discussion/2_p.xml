<p>For example, study on anti- proliferative effects of some species of the Plumbaginaceae (e.g. 
 <italic>Acantholimon longiscapum, Plumbago rosea </italic>and 
 <italic>Plumbago zeylanica</italic>) indicated good and moderate levels of tumor inhibition and cancer cell cytotoxicity (Ahmad et al., 2008

 <italic>Plumbago</italic> (Plumbaginaceae) such as 
 <italic>P. zeylanica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. rosea</italic> which have a high level of phenolic content (Nahak and Sahu, 2011

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Antimicrobial activity 
 <italic>P. zeylanica, P. scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>P. indica </italic>which belong to the family Plumbaginaceae, toward drug resistant and pathogenic bacteria were also indicated in some reports (Paiva et al., 2003

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Moreover, the hepatoprotective effect and their usage in the treatment of liver disease have also been demonstrated in some researches (Girish and Pradhan, 2012

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Gazor et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). According to the literature, plants from the Plumbaginaceae contain various secondary metabolites and active constituents such as alkaloids, glycoside, reducing sugars, simple phenolic, tannins, lignin, saponins, anthocyanin, quinines and flavonoids that contribute to their biological activities (Asen and Plimmer, 1972

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Pavela, 2013
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). For example, it was observed that one of the major secondary metabolites present in members of the Plumbaginaceae is plumbagin (Babula et al., 2005
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Jeyachandran et al., 2009
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Sharma and Kaushik, 2014
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Several pharmacological activities, e. g. antitumor, antimicrobial, insecticidal, would healing, anti- inflammatory and antifertility actions, have been identified for plumbagin (Kavimani et al., 1996
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Kini et al., 1997
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Reddy et al., 2002
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Sheeja et al., 2010
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). The genus 
 <italic>Acantholimon </italic>may also contain plumbagin which needs to be determined by phytochemical screening.
