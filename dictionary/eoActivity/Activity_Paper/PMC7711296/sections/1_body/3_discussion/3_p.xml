<p>In conclusion, our study can be considered the first study on anti-cancer, antioxidant and antibacterial potential of three Iranian endemic species of 
 <italic>Acantholimon</italic> including 
 <italic>A. austro-iranicum, A. serotinum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chlorostegium. </italic>The results showed a specific cytotoxic effect for the extracts against cancerous cells. Moreover, the significant antioxidant potential shown by the extracts demonstrates their ability to protect the non-target (normal) cells against oxidative stress and antibacterial tests indicated good activity of extracts against Gram-negative bacteria. Unexplored genus 
 <italic>Acantholimon</italic> needs more attention for detailed scientific investigations. For instance, there is no evidence in the literature about chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Acantholimon. </italic>Therefore, phytochemical studies for identification and elucidation of active constituents of the extracts from the three examined species of 
 <italic>Acantholimon</italic> are needed.
