    "<h4>Objective</h4><i>Acantholimon</i> is a genus of perennial plant within the Plumbaginaceae family. Here, we aimed to investigate anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial potential of methanol extract of three Iranian endemic species of <i>Acantholimon</i> including <i>A. austro-iranicum, A. serotinum</i> and <i>A. chlorostegium.</i><h4>Materials and methods</h4>MTT assay was used to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction was examined by annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit. Antioxidant activity was reported based on the DPPH-scavenging and DCF-DA assay. Antibacterial activity was measured by disc diffusion and micro-well dilution assay.<h4>Results</h4>MTT assay showed less cytotoxicity of methanol extracts against the HUVEC normal cell line (IC<sub>50</sub> values: 817-900 µg/ml) compared to cancer cell lines MCF-7, HT29, SH-SY5Y, NCCIT and A549 (IC<sub>50</sub> values: 213 to 600 µg/ml) that show the specificity of extracts toward cancer cells. Plant extract showed apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phases documented by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. According to antioxidant tests, extracts exhibited significant DPPH scavenging potential (IC<sub>50</sub> values: 30-37 µg/ml) and could protect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Antibacterial activities showed a stronger inhibitory effect on <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> as Gram- negative bacteria (diameter of inhibition zone: 11-13 mm and minimal inhibition concentration (MIC): 3.175 to 12.5 mg/ml) compared to Gram-positive bacteria including <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (diameter of inhibition zone: 3-7 mm and MIC: 25 to 50 mg/ml).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggested moderate cytotoxic and antibacterial potential and noteworthy antioxidant activity for the examined <i>Acantholimon</i> species."
