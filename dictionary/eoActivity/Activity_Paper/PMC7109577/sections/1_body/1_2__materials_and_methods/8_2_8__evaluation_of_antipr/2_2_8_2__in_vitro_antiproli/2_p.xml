<p>At the end of the treatment period, the medium was removed, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of WST-1 reagent was added to each well. The plates were incubated again (4 h at 37°C). Cell viability was performed by absorbance reading of each well at 450 nm using a Wallac Victor X3 multiplate reader. Untreated cells were considered as a negative control. Mitomycin was considered a positive control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value responsible for 50% of cell growth inhibition was determined by plotting the inhibition percentage versus the concentrations (
