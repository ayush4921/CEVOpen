<p>The antiproliferative activity was evaluated using WST-1 test (disodium mono{4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-tetrazol]-3-ium-5-yl]benzene-1,3-disulfonate}) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The concentrations tested for their antiproliferative effects ranged from 1.562 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Cells of a subconfluent culture were harvested and centrifuged at 100 rpm for 5 min. The prepared cells were seeded in 96-well plates, at a cellular density of 8000 cells/well. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h at 37°C (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). After this, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of fresh medium containing serial concentrations was added to cells for further incubation of 48 h at 37°C.
