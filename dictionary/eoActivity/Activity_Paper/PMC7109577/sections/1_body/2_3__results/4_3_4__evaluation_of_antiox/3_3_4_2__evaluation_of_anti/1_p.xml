<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the percentage of free radical inhibition of hydroethanolic extracts such as flavonoids, saponins, and mucilages was lower than that of ascorbic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The antioxidant activity of the flavonoids fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.51 mg/ml) was more pronounced compared to the other hydroethanolic extracts (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.628 mg/ml), saponins (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.94 mg/ml), and mucilages (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.674 mg/ml). The statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of all tested extracts and that of the ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.23 mg/ml) (
