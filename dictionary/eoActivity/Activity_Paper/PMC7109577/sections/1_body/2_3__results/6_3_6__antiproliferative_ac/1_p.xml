<p>The antiproliferative effect of hydroethanolic extract of

 <italic>europaea</italic> and its fractions against MDA-MB-231 cell lines was evaluated using the WST-1 assay. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7</xref> shows the effect of hydroethanolic extract and its fractions at different concentrations (15.6 to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) on MDA-MB-231 cell viability. Flavonoids fraction showed a remarkable antiproliferative effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 43.62 ± 0.06 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The saponins fraction significantly inhibited cell proliferation with the studied range of concentrations even with the lowest value (15.62 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). However, hydroethanolic extract and mucilage fraction were ineffective with the current used concentrations.
