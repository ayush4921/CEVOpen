<p>Numerous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have reported the antiproliferative activity of saponins on breast cancer, cervical colon, and hepatic carcinomas. It was reported that several signaling pathways have been identified to be responsible for cell death [

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The antiproliferative effect of saponins resulted in the activation of different signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], whereas the induction of apoptosis is the most involved pathway [
