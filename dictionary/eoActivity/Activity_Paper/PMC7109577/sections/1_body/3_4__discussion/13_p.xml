<p>In the present research work, flavonoids showed a significant antiproliferative effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 43.62 ± 0.06 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. This class of molecules possesses a large range of pharmacological activities including antiproliferative activity. The flavonoids constitute the most important group of polyphenolic compounds, which have been investigated for their antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and antiestrogenic effects [
