<p>Flavonoids and polyphenols are natural antioxidants, known to be very active scavengers of many free radicals [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DPPH test is a method for estimating free radical-scavenging activity of antioxidants. The FRAP test determines the ability of these complexes to break the free radical chain by donating an atom of hydrogen [

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> hydroethanolic extract was determined using DPPH and FRAP assays. Using the DPPH method, all tested extracts of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> showed a lower antioxidant power compared to ascorbic acid. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of hydroethanolic, flavonoids, saponins, and mucilages extracts were 1.628 mg/ml, 1.51 mg/ml, 1.94 mg/ml, and 9.674 mg/ml, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of the ascorbic acid (0.23 mg/ml). Furthermore, the obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values with FRAP test concerning hydroethanolic, flavonoids, saponins, and mucilages fractions were 5.196 mg/ml, 4.537 mg/ml, 3.05 mg/ml, and 6.02 mg/ml, respectively. These results can be attributed to the phenolic contents of the aerial parts of
