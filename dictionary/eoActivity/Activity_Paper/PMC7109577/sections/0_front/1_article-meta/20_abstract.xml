  <p>
   <italic>Caralluma europaea</italic> (
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>europaea</italic>) is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan popular medicine. 
   <italic>Objective of the Study</italic>. The present work was aimed at identifying the chemical composition and the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of hydroethanolic and bioactive compound classes of

   <italic>europaea</italic>) is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan popular medicine. 
   <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. The chemical composition was analyzed using HPLC. The antioxidant power was determined using both DPPH and FRAP assays. The antiproliferative activity was effectuated against cancerous cells using WST-1.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> The chemical analysis showed the presence of bioactive constituents such as quercetin, myricetin, and hesperetin. The polyphenol and flavonoid contents were estimated at 51.42 mg GA/g and 20.06 mg EQ/g, respectively. The EC
   <sub>50</sub> values of FRAP assay of hydroethanolic, flavonoid, saponin, and mucilage extracts were 5.196 mg/ml, 4.537 mg/ml, 3.05 mg/ml, and 6.02 mg/ml, respectively. The obtained IC
   <sub>50</sub> values with the DPPH test were 1.628 mg/ml, 1.05 mg/ml, 1.94 mg/ml, and 9.674 mg/ml, respectively. Regarding MDA-MB-231, saponins were highly effective even with the lowest concentration (15.62 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 43.62 ± 0.06 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 43.62 ± 0.06 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 43.62 ± 0.06
