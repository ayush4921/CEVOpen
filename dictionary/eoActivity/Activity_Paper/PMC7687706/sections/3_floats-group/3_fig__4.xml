  <p>Treatment of JIMT-1 cells with different solvent fractions of Ethiopian plants inhibits TNF-⍺-induced translocation of p65/NF-κB to the nucleus. 
   <bold>a</bold> p65/NF-κB positive nuclei in % of total nuclei number. The data are presented as mean ± SD with 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. 
   <italic>*p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <italic>**p</italic> &lt; 0.001. 
   <bold>b</bold> Representative images from independent experiments for each treatment. Control, no treatment. TNF-α, only treated with TNF-α. SO, aqueous fraction of 
   <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> (52 μg/mL) and TNF-α. CS, chloroform fraction of 
   <italic>C. simensis</italic> (80 μg/mL) and TNF-α. VL, ethyl acetate fraction of 
   <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> (0.87 μg/mL) and TNF-α. To visualize the p65/NF-κB expression (green), the cells were fixed in formaldehyde and labeled as described in the Methods section. All images were taken with a 40x objective
