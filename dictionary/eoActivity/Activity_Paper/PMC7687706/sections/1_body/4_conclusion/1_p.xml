<p id="Par33">Here we have found that solvent fractions of traditionally used medicinal plants have anti-CSC activity in the JIMT-1 cancer cell line at a desirably low concentration. With these data, we urge other researchers to investigate if there is a similar anti-CSC activity in other cancer cell lines. This may aid in the recommendation of medicinal plants in the traditional treatment of cancer in areas of the world. The fact that the solvent fractions show activity at very low concentrations implies that plant extracts used in traditional medicine may have anti-CSC activity. It is of importance to expand these studies using several cancer cell lines to investigate if this is a general phenomenon affecting CSCs of different cancer types. Also, we suggest isolation of the specific active compounds from these fractions.</p>
