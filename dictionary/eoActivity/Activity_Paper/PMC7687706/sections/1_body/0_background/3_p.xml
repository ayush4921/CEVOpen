<p id="Par15">In addition to finding compounds that kill cancer cells in general, searching for CSC targeting compounds is of importance. We have previously shown that solvent fractions of Ethiopian medicinal plants traditionally used in breast cancer treatment exert toxicity against a number of breast cancer cell lines at low concentrations evaluated using dose response assays [

 <italic>Sideroxylon oxyacanthum</italic> (Baill.) (Family: Sapotaceae), 
 <italic>Clematis simensis</italic> Fresen. (Family: Ranunculaceae), and 
 <italic>Vernonia leopoldi</italic> (Sch. Bip. ex Walp.) Vatke (Family: Asteraceae) for further investigation of their effects on CSCs. Here we present data on how treatment with these fractions affects the CSC subpopulation of the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line.
