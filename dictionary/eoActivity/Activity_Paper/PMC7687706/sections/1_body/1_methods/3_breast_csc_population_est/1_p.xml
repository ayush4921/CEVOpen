<p id="Par19">The JIMT-1 cells were seeded in Petri dishes at the density described above and incubated for 24 h. The solvent fractions were added to their final concentrations with dose ranges between IC
 <sub>25</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, and the cells were incubated for 72 h. Accutase™ (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) was used to detach the cells, and the detached cells were collected in PBS containing 1% FBS and counted using a hemocytometer. The ALDEFLUOR™ kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) procedures as given in the manufacturer’s protocol were followed. The BD Accuri C6 Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to analyze the samples. DEAB-treated cells for each sample were used to set the ALDH
 <sup>+</sup> region. The data was evaluated using CFlow software.
