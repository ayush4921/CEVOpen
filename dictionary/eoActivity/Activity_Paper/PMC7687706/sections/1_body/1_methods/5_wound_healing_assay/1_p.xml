<p id="Par21">The JIMT-1 cells were seeded at a high density (125,000 cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) in Petri dishes (3 cm diameter) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air for 24 h to allow them to attach and form a confluent layer of cells. Then, the medium was removed, and three parallel scratch wounds (left, middle, and right side of the dish) were made in the cell layer using a sterile 200 μL pipette tip [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The cell layer was washed twice with PBS and serum-free medium was added to minimize the influence of cell proliferation on the wound healing process. The respective solvent fractions were added to the final concentration of dose ranges, including IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>25</sub> concentrations, while the controls were treated with 0.2% methanol in PBS. Images of the wound areas were taken immediately before the incubation at 37 °C in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator (time 0). The wound area was photographed at 24, 48, and 72 h after time 0. To estimate the wound closure, the scratch areas were measured with ImageJ 1.47v software. The wound closure was calculated as percentage of the wound at time 0.
