<p id="Par20">The effect of the solvent fractions on colony forming efficiency (CFE) was evaluated using a serum-free soft agar assay. The JIMT-1 cells were seeded in Petri dishes at the density described above and incubated for 24 h. The solvent fractions of the extracts were added to the final concentrations of 0.633 μg/mL to 80 μg/mL (IC
 <sub>25</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> included), while the controls were treated with 0.2% methanol in PBS (i.e. the same final methanol concentration as for the solvent fractions). The Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air for 72 h. The cells were detached through treatment with Accutase™ for 10 min at 37 °C and kept on ice while determining the cell concentration by counting in a hemocytometer. MEBM basal medium containing hydrocortisone, insulin, epidermal growth factor (CC-4136 kit, Cambrex, Walkersville, Maryland, USA), B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), basic fibroblast growth factor (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA (20 ng/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) was heated to 42 °C and mixed with agarose to a final concentration of 0.4%. The cells were added to a final concentration of 1000 cells/mL. Then, 500 μL of this mixture was immediately added to the inner wells of hydrophobic 48-well plates, and the outer rows of the plates were filled with 1 mL PBS to minimize evaporation. The plates were wrapped in plastic wrap and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air for 14 days. The colonies were counted visually in an inverted phase-contrast microscope using the 10x objective.
