<p id="Par17">The identification and solvent fractionation of the medicinal plants were done as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Briefly, the medicinal plants were collected, and identification and authentication were done at the National Herbarium, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The voucher specimens were deposited at the herbarium with voucher numbers NT014 (
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic>), NT037 (
 <italic>C. simensis</italic>), and NT073 (
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic>). Crude methanolic extraction (80% methanol) was carried out by maceration using a rotary water bath shaker (DZK-2, Shanghai, China) (120 routes per minute) for 72 h at 21 °C. The extract was concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (BÜCHI, Germany) under reduced pressure at 45 °C, and then the sample was freeze-dried by lyophilization (CHRIST, Alpha 2–4 LDplus, Osterode, Germany). The solvent-solvent (1:1, v/v) partitioning was performed using a separation funnel. Briefly, the weighed amount of dried crude methanolic extract was dissolved in 250 mL of 10% methanol in Millipore H
 <sub>2</sub>O in an Erlenmeyer flask. An equal volume (i.e. 250 mL) of hexane (100%) was added, the solution gently mixed in the funnel, and the solution kept at room temperature for 1 h to allow the formation of aqueous and hexane layers. After successfully recovering the aqueous phase, an equal volume of chloroform (100%) was added, gently mixed, and kept at room temperature for 1 h to allow the formation of aqueous and chloroform layers. The same procedure was repeated with the solvent ethyl acetate (100%) and ethyl acetate and aqueous phases were separated. All the fractions were concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator and freeze-dried by lyophilization [
