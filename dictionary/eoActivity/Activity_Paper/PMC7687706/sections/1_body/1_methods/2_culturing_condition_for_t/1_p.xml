<p id="Par18">The JIMT-1 cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (ACC589) was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). Upon receipt, the cells were thawed and amplified, and ampules were frozen in a liquid nitrogen container. The JIMT-1 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium (VWR, Lund, Sweden) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (VWR), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (VWR), 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden), 1 mM L-glutamine (VWR), and 100 U/mL penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin (VWR). The JIMT-1 cells were seeded at the density of 0.015 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> in tissue culture vessel containing 0.2–0.3 mL per cm
 <sup>2</sup> of medium, and then kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air. After 4 days of culturing, the cell density was around 0.133 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, i.e. the cells had gone through approximately 3 population doublings. The lag phase of the cells after trypsinization is 24 h, giving a population doubling time of around 24 h. The JIMT-1 cells were kept under strict surveillance for these proliferation characteristics and also morphology and only used for 50 passages and then a new ampoule was thawed. The cells were tested for mycoplasma and were found to be negative (Eurofins GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany).
