<p id="Par32">The transcriptional activation of genes associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and suppression of apoptosis appears to lie at the heart of the ability of NF-κB to promote cancer therapy resistance [

 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> significantly reduced the number of p65/NF-κB positive nuclei in TNF-α-treated cells compared to TNF-α treatment alone. As the NF-κB pathway is supposed to be important for CSC function, our data imply that the inhibitory effect of the solvent fractions on CSCs may partly be exerted through an effect on this pathway. This can be an indication that the molecular mechanism involved in CSC maintenance may have been affected. Interference with the NF-κB pathway has been demonstrated with a variety of secondary metabolites from plants [
