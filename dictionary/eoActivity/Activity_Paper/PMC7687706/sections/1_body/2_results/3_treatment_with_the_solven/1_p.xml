 <italic>,</italic> the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> (80 μg/mL, i.e., IC
 <sub>50</sub>), and the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> (0.44 μg/mL) were evaluated in a wound healing assay. Treatment with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> and the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> (i.e., 0.87 μg/mL and 69 μg/mL, respectively)
 <italic>,</italic> resulted in a large amount of cell death and interfered with wound area measurement. Based on the results of the wound closure, defined as 0% closure at 0 h for each sample, JIMT-1 cells treated with the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> were arrested and unable to migrate after incubation for 24 h, when about only 27.5% wound closure was recorded, which was significantly less than control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Treatment with the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> resulted in a closure of 30.8% of the wound area at 48 h, and the inhibition was statistically significant compared to control at 48 h (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Treatment with the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> for 72 h resulted in 55.1% closure of the wound area. In the control, the wound closure was around 81% after 72 h of incubation, and the inhibition attained by treatment with the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> was significantly lower than in control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
