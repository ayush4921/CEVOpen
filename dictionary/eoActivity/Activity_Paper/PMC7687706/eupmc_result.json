    "<h4>Background</h4>The incidence and mortality of breast cancer in women is increasing worldwide. Breast cancer contains a subpopulation of cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). The CSCs are believed to be responsible for chemotherapeutic resistance and are also involved in tumor initiation, progression, evolution, and metastasis to distant sites. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-CSC potential of selected Ethiopian medicinal plants traditionally used for breast cancer treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>The solvent fractions of three medicinal plants (the ethyl acetate fraction of Vernonia leopoldi, the aqueous fraction of Sideroxylon oxyacanthum, and the chloroform fraction of Clematis simensis) resulting from the methanolic crude extracts were selected based on their previously demonstrated cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cell lines. The effect of these solvent fractions on the status of the cancer stem cell subpopulation of the JIMT-1 cell line was assessed by flow cytometric evaluation of the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase positive cells and by measuring colony forming efficiency in a serum-free soft agar assay after treatment. Effects on cell migration using a wound healing assay and on tumor necrosis factor-α-induced translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B to the cell nucleus were also investigated.<h4>Results</h4>The solvent fractions showed a dose-dependent reduction in the aldehyde dehydrogenase positive subpopulation of JIMT-1 cells. The chloroform fraction of C. simensis (80 μg/mL) completely blocked colony formation of JIMT-1 cells. The wound healing assay showed that all fractions significantly reduced cell migration. The ethyl acetate fraction of V. leopoldi (0.87 μg/mL) significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced nuclear factor-kappa B translocation to the nucleus.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The solvent fractions of the medicinal plants showed desirable activities against breast cancer stem cells in the JIMT-1 cell line, which warrants further studies."
