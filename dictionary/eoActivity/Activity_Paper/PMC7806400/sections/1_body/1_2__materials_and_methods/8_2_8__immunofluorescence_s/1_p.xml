<p>Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thickness were placed on slides, deparaffinized with xylene, and rehydrated with 95%, 85%, and 75% alcohol in sequence. The sections were placed in citrate buffer, repaired for 10 min, and blocked with goat serum (SL038, Solarbio Science and Technology) for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with the Nrf2 rabbit antibody (16396-1-AP, dilution 1 : 50 in PBS, Proteintech Group Inc., China) or LC3 mouse antibody (sc-376404, dilution 1 : 50 in PBS, Santa Cruz, USA) overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (A0516, dilution 1 : 200 in PBS, Beyotime Biotechnology, China) or goat anti-mouse IgG (A0521, 1 : 200, Beyotime Biotechnology) in the dark for 1 h. DAPI (C1002, Beyotime Biotechnology) was added to each slide for localization of nucleus, and the images were observed by using a fluorescent microscope.
