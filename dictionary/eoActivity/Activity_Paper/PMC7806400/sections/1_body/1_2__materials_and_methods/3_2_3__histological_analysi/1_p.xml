 <italic>μ</italic>m-thick sections from paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized with xylene, dehydrated using a graded ethanol series, and incubated with hematoxylin for 5 min. The sections were counterstained with eosin dye for 3 min. All sections were visualized under the microscope (BX53, Olympus, Japan). Histological changes in the joint space, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage erosion of rat ankles were scored in accordance with the previous research [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The histological scores were graded as 0–3 points: 0 = normal, 1 = mild mononuclear cell infiltration, 2 = moderate inflammatory cell infiltration and cartilage destruction, and 3 = massive pannus formation with extension of inflammatory cell invasion into the synovium and joint space.
