<p>Protein was extracted from treated tissues by the whole protein extraction kit (WLA019, Wanleibio, Shenyang, China) and the nuclear protein and plasma protein kit (WLA020, Wanleibio) according to the manufacturer's instructions, respectively. In brief, ankle joint tissues were lysed in lysis containing 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation (4°C, 12000 rpm, 10 min), the supernatant was collected as the total protein. The concentration of the protein was determined by the BCA kit (WLA004, Wanleibio). Proteins were electrophoresed on 5%, 8%, 10%, and 15% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, respectively. After being washed with TBST, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody (37°C, 45 min). The blots were detected using the ECL kit (WLA003, Wanleibio) and quantified with the Gel-Pro-Analyzer system (WD-9413B, Liuyi, China). 
 <italic>β</italic>-Actin and histone H3 were utilized as internal references, respectively. The antibodies used in this study were diluted with 5% skimmed milk, and the information is listed in
