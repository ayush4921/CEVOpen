<p>This study was performed to confirm whether ZSD could promote autophagy. It was found that MSU treatment decreased the protein expressions of p-AMPK, Beclin-1, and LC3II/I, but increased p-mTOR and p62 levels in ankle joints of rats (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>). However, administration of ZSD reversed these changes in MSU-treated rats. At the same time, there were no significant alterations in the levels of AMPK and mTOR. In addition, immunofluorescence assay was carried out to detect the localization of LC3 in the ankle joint. As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(d)</xref>, the control or MSU group showed little staining of LC3, whereas ZSD administration reflected an obvious staining distribution of LC3. These findings suggested that ZSD activated the AMPK signaling pathway and repressed the activation of the mTOR pathway, thus facilitating autophagy in MSU-induced GA.
