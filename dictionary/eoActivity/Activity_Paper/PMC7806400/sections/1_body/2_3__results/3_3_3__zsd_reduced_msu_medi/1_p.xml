<p>To explore the effect of ZSD on OS, some indices associated with OS were determined in GA rats. It can be seen from Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> that MSU administration for 72â€‰h resulted in a statistically significant decrease in GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT activities; however, treatment with ZSD dose dependently increased them in serum of treated rats. At the same time, ZSD administration facilitated a significant reduction on the contents of MDA and NO in serum (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref>). Moreover, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, the expressions of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the cytoplasm and nucleus in ankle joints were upregulated following MSU treatment when compared to the control rats. In contrast, administration of ZSD elevated the level of nuclear Nrf2, but the expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm was lowered. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4(b)</xref> shows that no pronounced alterations in the Nrf2 mRNA level were observed before and after treatment. Apart from these, immunofluorescence assay revealed that the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the ankle joint was enhanced by ZSD treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). These results indicated that ZSD alleviated OS and demonstrated the antioxidative property of ZSD.
