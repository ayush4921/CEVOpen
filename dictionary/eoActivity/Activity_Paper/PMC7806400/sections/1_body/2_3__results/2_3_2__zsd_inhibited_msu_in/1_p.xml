<p>In order to assess the role of ZSD in inflammation and articular damage, we measured the levels of inflammatory factors and the activity of articular elastase in MSU-induced rats. As depicted in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 levels in serum were elevated after MSU treatment for 72 h when compared to the control rats. Nevertheless, administration of ZSD dose dependently lowered the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(e)</xref> indicates that ZSD treatment obviously reduced articular elastase activity in the ankle joint of MSU-treated rats. Furthermore, mRNA levels of proinflammatory factors in ankle joints were increased in MSU-treated rats. On the contrary, ZSD administration noticeably downregulated the mRNA levels mentioned above (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(i)</xref>). Compared with MSU-treated rats, the protein expressions of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1, as well as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, in ankle joints were suppressed via administration of ZSD in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(j)</xref>). Meanwhile, there were no marked changes in pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> levels. These findings confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of ZSD on MSU-mediated GA in rats.
