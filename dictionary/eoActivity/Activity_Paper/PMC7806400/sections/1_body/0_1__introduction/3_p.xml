<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that ZSD could activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway and inhibit the mammalian target of the rapamyclin (mTOR) pathway to promote autophagy in a rat model of GA. Besides, ZSD reduced inflammatory response and inhibited oxidative stress (OS) in MSU-treated rats.</p>
