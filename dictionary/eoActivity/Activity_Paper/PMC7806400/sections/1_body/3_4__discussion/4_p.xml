<p>Autophagy is a critical physiologic process to maintain homeostasis by means of degrading cytosolic macromolecules, membranes, and damaged organelles, which was modulated via autophagy-related genes [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Beclin-1 is combined with type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Vps34 to form a complex, which allows the autophagic vesicle nucleation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. LC3 exists in 2 forms including LC3I as well as LC3II. In the period of autophagy formation, LC3-I in the cytoplasm is changed to LC3-II located at the autophagosomes by enzymatic hydrolysis. The degree of autophagy is dependent on the ratio of LC3II/I [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, p62 has been considered an essential autophagy regulator, participating in the clearance of impaired mitochondria [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Autophagy has been reported to modulate inflammatory response through affecting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and is one of the cellular defenses against elevated OS as well as other diverse cell stress conditions [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, the previous research indicated that autophagy was suppressed in osteoarthritis [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and lowered level of autophagy was associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inhibition of the Nrf2 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As reported by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], MSU-induced IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> generation could be diminished as a consequence of the activation of autophagy. In this study, ZSD decreased NLRP3 and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> levels and increased the level of Nrf2. Meanwhile, the expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3II/I were upregulated, whereas p62 level was downregulated by ZSD. Accordingly, we speculated that ZSD inhibited inflammation and OS probably through promotion of autophagy. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms that ZSD relieved GA via facilitating autophagy were also evaluated. AMPK/mTOR is the important modulator of cellular autophagy. Hepatic protein kinase B1 is able to activate AMPK in some circumstances such as starvation and energy consumption, which negatively regulates mTOR [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been reported that lowered expression of p-mTOR induced by AMPK phosphorylation is capable of facilitating autophagy in a variety of cell types [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Terkeltaub [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that p-AMPK significantly suppressed mononuclear phagocyte responses to urate crystals 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, containing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and chemokines. The previous work showed that hydrogen-rich saline protected lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via controlling autophagy through repression of mTOR signaling pathway activation [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our experiment results suggested that ZSD activated the AMPK pathway and inhibited the mTOR pathway to facilitate autophagy. As we all know, this finding that ZSD promotes autophagy in MSU-treated rats is the first found.
