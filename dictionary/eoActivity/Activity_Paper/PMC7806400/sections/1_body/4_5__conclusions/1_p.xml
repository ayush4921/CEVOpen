<p>In summary, this study implied that ZSD ameliorated MSU-induced GA in rats. The mechanism of action of ZSD was probably through inhibition of inflammation and OS and promotion of autophagy via regulation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, ZSD, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions, could be acted as a potential drug for preventing GA.</p>
