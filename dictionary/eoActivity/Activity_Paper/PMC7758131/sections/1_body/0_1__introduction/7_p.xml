<p>This open label prospective clinical pilot study, for the first time, was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of THCs in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis. While randomized controlled trials are considered to be the standard approach for testing the safety and efficacy of drugs, a “prospective study” of patients with chronic diseases with a well-known baseline is often suggested in the complementary and alternative medicine field. A good outcome from such prospective clinical pilot studies could provide strong preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of THCs and will form the basis for future large-scale clinical trials.</p>
