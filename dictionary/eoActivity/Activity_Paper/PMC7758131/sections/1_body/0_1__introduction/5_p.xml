<p>Tetrahydrocurcuminoids have also been isolated as a natural product from 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species, 
 <italic>Curcuma zedoaria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Tetrahydrocurcumin is nearly colorless and lacks the double bonds, despite THC and curcumin possess similar 
 <italic>β</italic>-diketone structures and phenolic groups [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the absence of a conjugated double bond in the hydrocarbon chain enables THCs to bind more efficiently with phospholipase A2 than curcumin [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Most importantly, THCs reported to have higher bioavailability and physiological stability than curcumin and are easily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Tetrahydrocurcuminoids possess an array of pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anticancer, and antiallergic, as well as hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and nephroprotective activities surpassing curcuminoids in some of these activities [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Antioxidant supplements with their anti-inflammatory properties may play a potential role in the prevention and successful treatment of disorders associated with gingival tissues [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that THC is a potent antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and recent studies reinforce the earlier findings [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Experimental evidence from animal studies shows that THCs are more potent antioxidants than curcumin [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and exert pronounced anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
