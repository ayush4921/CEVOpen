<p>Similarly, at the end of 21 days of treatment, a significant improvement in the gingival index score was observed compared to the baseline in all the patients. The mean gingival scores were further reduced, appearance to 0, bleeding to 0.10 ± 0.31, and gingival inflammation to 0.28 ± 0.45, from the baseline values. The mean total gingival score was also reduced to 0.38 ± 0.68 with a median of 0 from the baseline value. The Löe and Silness index score evaluated using the Friedman ANOVA test showed that the gingivitis appearance and bleeding scores were significantly reduced after treatment (
