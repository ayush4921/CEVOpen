<p>Physical examination after treatment, including the general appearance of the subjects, vital signs of the heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, and neurological functions, was found to be normal in all the subjects. In addition, a comparative evaluation of clinical parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, heart rate, respiratory rate, and BMI after treatment, was also found to be in the normal range for all the patients in both canker sore and gingivitis study groups (Supplementary Figures
