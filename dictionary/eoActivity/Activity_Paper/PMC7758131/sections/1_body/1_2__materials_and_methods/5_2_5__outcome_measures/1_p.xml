<p>The body mass index (BMI) was documented, before (baseline) and after 14 and 21 days of treatment. The number of ulcers healed, size reduction, and duration for the complete healing were assessed for efficacy evaluation. In addition, the VAS (Visual Analog Scale) score for pain reduction was also assessed to determine the efficacy. Further, the VAS pain scores of 0 (no pain), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe) were used for the assessment of pain intensity in canker sore patients. Clinical photographs of the lesion sites were captured to assess the treatment efficacy. Similarly, for gingivitis, LÃ¶e and Silness gingival index and subjective and objective criteria were assessed.</p>
