<p>The present study has some strengths and a few limitations. The limitations include relatively a small number of subjects and lack of a placebo group. However, this pilot clinical study provided strong preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of THCs against canker sore and gingivitis and will form the basis for future large-scale clinical trials.</p>
