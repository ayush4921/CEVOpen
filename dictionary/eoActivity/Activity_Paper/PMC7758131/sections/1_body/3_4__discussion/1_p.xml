The present clinical trial, for the first time, demonstrated that oral supplementation of THCs alleviated the symptoms within 21 days of treatment in patients with canker sore and gingivitis and effectively prevented further progression of the disease without adverse effects. Curcumin-based mouthwash was shown to reduce gingival inflammation and plaque in patients with chronic gingivitis [
