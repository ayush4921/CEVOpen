    "<h4>Background</h4>Tetrahydrocurcuminoids (THCs) are among the major metabolites of curcuminoids with a higher bioavailability and physiological stability and exhibit a broad spectrum of therapeutic activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of THCs in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis designed as an exploratory clinical trial.<h4>Methods</h4>This is an open label prospective pilot clinical trial carried out at two clinical centers: Noble Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, and Sri Venkateshwara Hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka in India. Participants were assigned to 21 days of treatment with chewable oral THCs supplement. Patients were instructed to self-administer one chewable tablet containing 100â€‰mg of THCs twice daily for up to 21 days. This clinical trial was registered at a public Clinical Trial Registry in India (http://www.ctri.nic.in). Thirty-one canker sore and twenty-nine gingivitis patients participated in this study. Body mass index, throat numbness/relief, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score, canker sore lesions, gingival appearance, inflammation and bleeding were assessed before and after treatment, at 14 and 21 days. Vital signs and laboratory parameters were assessed for safety.<h4>Results</h4>THCs treatment significantly reduced the reddening at the site, difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and VAS pain score in the canker sore patients. Further, both single and multiple lesions were completely healed. In gingivitis patients, gingival appearance, bleeding, and inflammation were significantly reduced. No adverse effects were observed during the study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, the findings of this study show that supplementation of THCs for 21 days reduced the pain and prevented the progression of the disease in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis without adverse side effects."
