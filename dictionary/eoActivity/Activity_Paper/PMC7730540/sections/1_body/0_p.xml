<p>The interest in opioids such as morphine, the prototypical opioid ligand, has been maintained throughout the years. Identification of endogenous opioid peptides and their receptors (µ, mu (MOR); δ, delta (DOR); κ, kappa (KOR); nociceptin (NOP)), along with molecular cloning and elucidation of crystal structures of opioid receptors represent key milestones in opioid research. With its ubiquitous distribution in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS), the opioid system has a central role in modulating pain and other physiological functions and pharmacological responses, with therapeutic as well as unwanted side effects. The dramatic increase in medical use and misuse of opioids with the rising number of opioid-related overdose deaths and diagnoses of opioid-use disorder has led to the 21st century opioid crisis.</p>
