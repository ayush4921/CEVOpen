<p>Using double-fluorescent knock-in mice co-expressing functional MOR and DOR, Derouiche et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that co-expression of native MOR and DOR in hippocampal neurons alters the intracellular fate of the MOR in a ligand-selective manner, with MOR-DOR co-internalization induced by the MOR-DOR biased agonist CYM51010, the MOR agonist DAMGO and the DOR agonist deltorphin II, but not the MOR agonists morphine and methadone or the DOR agonist SNC80. Their observations pointed out to MOR-DOR heteromerization as a means to fine-tune MOR signaling and neuronal activity with the potential for developing novel innovative therapeutics.
