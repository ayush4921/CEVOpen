<p>With the awareness that narcotic addiction is derived from the MOR, the KOR is emerging as a promising target for developing safer therapeutics without the common side effects associated with classical opioids, such as rewarding effects, respiratory depression and overdose. Schmidhammer et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reviewed recent chemical developments of SARs on diphenethylamines, a new class of structurally distinct and selective KOR ligands, with diverse profiles ranging from potent and selective agonists to G protein-biased agonists and selective antagonists. The first lead molecules in the series included the selective KOR full agonist HS665 and the partial agonist HS666. The combination of target drug design, synthetical efforts and pharmacology of diphenethylamines has enabled the identification of structural elements that determine distinct activity profiles, with the potential as candidates for future drug development for the treatment of pain and neuropsychiatric diseases.
