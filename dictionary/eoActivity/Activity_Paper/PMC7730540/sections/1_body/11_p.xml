<p>In their study, Zádor et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported on a new analogue of codeine, 14-methoxycodeine-6-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate (14-OMeC6SU), as a potent, peripheral MOR agonist. It was more effective than codeine, and equipotent to morphine in inducing antinociception in acute nociceptive pain, and it produced peripherally-mediated anti-hyperalgesic effects in inflammatory pain after subcutaneous administration in rats. Additionally, 14-OMeC6SU showed an improved in vitro and in vivo activity profile compared to codeine-6-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfat. Fürst et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reviewed the consequence of the activation of peripheral MORs in analgesia and analgesic tolerance, along with approaches that enhanced analgesic efficacy and decreased the development of tolerance to opioids at the peripheral sites. They also addressed the advantages and drawbacks of the activation of peripheral MORs on the sensory neurons and gut (leading to dysbiosis) in the development of central and peripheral analgesic tolerance. The reviewed data suggest that the development of peripheral analgesic tolerance to opioids is largely dependent on the pain entity, animal pain model, and the route of administration, local versus systemic.
