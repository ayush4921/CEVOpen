<p>The imperative need for safer therapies for pain and other human disease states involving the opioid system continues to drive the search for novel lead molecules and the development of new mechanism-based treatment strategies. Since the structural elucidation of morphine, its skeleton and its conversion to new analogues has been constantly in the attention of medicinal chemists, aiming to discover therapeutically useful drugs and research tools. Three reports present new research in the field of opioid morphinans [
