<p>In their study, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] elaborated on extended SARs in (âˆ’)-
 <italic>N</italic>-phenethyl analogs of 
 <italic>N</italic>-nor-hydromorphone. Within the designed series, 
 <italic>N</italic>-
 <italic>p</italic>-chloro-phenethylnorhydromorphone was a bifunctional MOR-DOR ligand with a potent partial agonism at the MOR and a full potent agonism at the DOR. This favorable combination of MOR and DOR activities in vitro was translated in vivo by potent antinociception without respiratory depression in squirrel monkeys after subcutaneous administration. In their communication, Kutsumura et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported on SARs between the thiol group-trapping ability of morphinans with a Michael acceptor and anti-
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> activities. Using the DOR antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX) as a lead structure, new derivatives were designed and a correlation between the antimalarial activity and the chemical reactivity of the BNTX derivatives with 1-propanethiol was established. Using naltrindole (NTI), the indolo-morphinan DOR antagonist, as a lead, Iwamatsu et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] designed sulfonamide-type NTI derivatives by targeting the effect of the N-substituent on functional activities at the DOR. They revealed SARs among the ligands with activities at the DOR ranging from full inverse agonists to full agonists, with cyclopropyl-sulfonamide (SYK-83) as the most potent full inverse agonist. The new NTI derivatives are expected to be useful tools for investigating interactions of ligands with the DOR, conformational changes of the DOR and induced functional activities.
