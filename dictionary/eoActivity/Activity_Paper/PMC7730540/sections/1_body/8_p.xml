<p>The SAR study by Brice-Tutt et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] studied the influence of the Phe residuesâ€™ stereochemistry in the macrocyclic tetrapeptide CJ-15,208 (
 <italic>cyclo</italic>[Phe-D-Pro-Phe-Trp]), from the fungus 
 <italic>Ctenomyces serratus,</italic> and its analogue [D-Trp]CJ-15,208 (
 <italic>cyclo</italic>[Phe-D-Pro-Phe-D-Trp]) on opioid activity profiles. Unlike the parent peptides, KOR antagonism was exhibited by only one stereoisomer, while another isomer produced DOR antagonism. They identified the stereoisomer [D-Phe
 <sup>1,3</sup>]CJ-15,208 as a potent antinociceptive after oral administration lacking respiratory depression and locomotor impairment and without preference or aversion in mice.
