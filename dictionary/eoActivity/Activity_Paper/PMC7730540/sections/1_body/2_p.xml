<p>The review by Sobczak and Gory≈Ñski [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] addresses the present opioid epidemic with literature showing that over-the-counter (OTC) opioids are misused as an alternative for illicit narcotics or prescription-only opioids. Three OTC opioid drugs, codeine, dihydrocodeine and loperamide, are discussed, including pharmacology, interactions, safety profiles and how pharmacology is being manipulated to misuse, focusing on abuse prevention and prevalence rates. Relatively easy access to OTC opioids is alarming and requires further attention and discussion on the rescheduling of their availability.
