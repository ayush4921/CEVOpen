<p>Parasitic infections in humans are caused by protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites that live on or in a host organism and make use of the host resources for their survival. Disease-causing parasites are known to contribute significantly to the rate of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide, especially in developing countries that have a large proportion of vulnerable populations [
 <xref rid="B84-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This, therefore, presents significant challenges to already overburdened public healthcare systems, thus resulting in huge economic losses. Approximately 48.4 million cases of parasitic disease resulting in one million deaths are reported annually [
 <xref rid="B84-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Despite this, there are limited highly effective antiparasitic drugs current available in the market, especially given the challenges faced with resistance of parasites to the drugs [
 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence which indicates that parasitic organisms are rapidly developing resistance against anti-parasitic drugs and the resistant strains are spreading at an alarming rate. This, therefore, calls for the need to intensify the search for novel, more potent, and less toxic compounds that may be more effective against these pathogens [

 <xref rid="B88-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. However, there is also substantial evidence which indicates that endophytes possess a pool of novel bioactive compounds that might be very useful in the discovery of anti-parasitic drugs.
