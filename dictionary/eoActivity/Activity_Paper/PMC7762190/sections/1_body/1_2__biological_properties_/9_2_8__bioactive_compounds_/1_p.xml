<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a life-threatening disease usually affecting the lungs and is caused by the bacteria 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The risk of contracting TB is significantly higher among individuals whose immune system has been compromised and children under the age of 5 years, particularly in developing countries, such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa [

 <xref rid="B113-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Given that TB is more common in people with compromised immune systems, there is evidence of co-infection between TB and HIV in patients, and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that of the 1.5 million patients who died from TB in 2018, 251,000 were also infected with HIV [

 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> against available drugs is increasing at an alarming rate and has eventually become an issue of severe public health concern [
 <xref rid="B113-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Approximately 484,000 new cases of resistance to the first-line antimicrobial drug rifampicin, which was regarded as the most potent drug, were reported, which is now a severe public health threat [
 <xref rid="B114-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] and, thus, requires urgent attention. Nonetheless, tuberculosis is curable and preventable; thus, the constant search for natural bioactive compounds, especially from endophytes, now paves the way for the discovery of new, more effective, alternative agents to combat tuberculosis. 
 <italic>Gliocladium</italic> sp. MR41 was capable of producing polyols 3 and 4 (

 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B115-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Other compounds with potential antituberculosis activities include phomoenamide, abyssomicin, tenuazonic acid and phomonitroester (
