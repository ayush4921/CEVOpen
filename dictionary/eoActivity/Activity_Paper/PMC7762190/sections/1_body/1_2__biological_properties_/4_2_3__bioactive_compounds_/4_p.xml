Camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin were utilized in the development of the drugs topotecan and irinotecan, which are chemotherapeutic. Since then, precursor 9-methoxycamptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin have been reported to exhibit powerful anticancer properties [

In addition to these findings, some reports have revealed that camptothecin and methoxy camptothecin are capable of enhancing the development of fruits and seed germination phases, thus assisting in protection against seed-borne pathogens [
