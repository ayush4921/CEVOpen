<p>Viruses are microorganisms that multiply only within living cells and are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in humans globally. Current antiviral drugs and vaccines are crucial in combating life-threatening diseases in humans [
 <xref rid="B100-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In addition, the emergence of resistance of viruses to the available antiviral drugs reduces the efficacy of their therapeutic potentials, thus resulting in a severe public health concern globally. In effect, ideal antiviral drugs should be potent against the target viral strains but with minimal side effects to the host cells. This therefore affirms that the modes of action of antiviral drugs are usually directed at preventing or inhibiting the infection by targeting viral proteins or the host cellular factors that viruses exploit in order to reproduce and gain control of cellular processes [

 <xref rid="B102-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. To address this problem, the search for and the discovery and development of new, cost-effective, and more potent antiviral drugs as well as vaccines is mandatory. Studies have been carried out to assess the potential of endophytes to produce promising natural bioactive compounds with antiviral properties [
