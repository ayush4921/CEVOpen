<p>An investigation of endophytes associated with 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. FKI-7127 led to the detection of the brefeldin A compound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01934-f008">Figure 8</xref>), exhibiting potent antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B108-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Several endophytic fungal strains, including 
 <italic>Fusarium equiseti, Scopulariopsis fusca</italic>, and 
 <italic>Geotrichum candidum</italic>, were obtained from brown alga 
 <italic>Padina pavonica</italic>, located in the Red Sea. Out of these fungi, 
 <italic>F. equiseti</italic> exhibited the highest antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-NS4A protease, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 27.0 Âµg/mL. Structural characterization using MS and NMR spectral analysis of the metabolites from this endophyte showed the presence of two diketopiperazines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01934-f008">Figure 8</xref>) (cyclo-L-AlaL-Leu and cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Pro)) and two nucleosides (cordycepin and Ara-A) [

To date, more than one hundred endophytic fungi isolated from desert plants have been established to possess potent antiretroviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The extracts from these fungi demonstrated less than 30% cytotoxic activities in T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B110-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Three unidentified chromanones were extracted from the fungal strain 
 <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp. CGMCC No. 5416, obtained from the stems of 
 <italic>Achyranthes bidentata</italic>. These compounds displayed promising antiviral activities against HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B111-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]; we therefore suggest that fungal secondary metabolites may serve as important sources for discovering new antiviral drugs or lead compounds.
