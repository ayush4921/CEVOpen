<p>The diversity of fungal species is currently estimated at 2.2 to 3.8 million worldwide, with soil fungal populations contributing a significant portion, and fungi are regarded as ubiquitous [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This suggests that there might be more fungal interaction, whether beneficial or pathogenic. Recently, fungal diseases were accountable for over a 1.6 million mortality rate per annum, with over one billion individuals in a state of severe morbidity. In the agricultural sector, fungal pathogens might lead to damage or loss of crops, economic losses, and, eventually, affect food security and food production [

In addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the resistance of microorganisms to current antimicrobial agents, including antifungal agents. Despite the inefficacy of antifungal agents, there is currently a lack of therapeutic agents on the market. Fungal diseases are generally underrated and overlooked, although they cause secondary infections to hospitalized patients. Pathogenic fungi are opportunistic and affect immunocompromised individuals, thus posing a serious burden on current health care systems worldwide [
