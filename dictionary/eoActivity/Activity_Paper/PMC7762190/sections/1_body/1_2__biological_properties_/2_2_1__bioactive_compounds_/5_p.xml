<p>Ding and colleagues (2019) also reported compounds 1 and 2 as novel isocoumarin derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01934-f002">Figure 2</xref>) with a distinctive butanetriol group at C-3 using NMR and MS. Furthermore, the bioactive compounds exhibited some activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Compounds 1 and 2 showed effectiveness against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with MIC values of 32 μg/mL [

 <italic>Vibrio salmonicida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These compounds were identified as 8,1′,5′-trihydroxy-3′,4′dihydro-1′H-[2,4′]binaphthalenyl-1,4,2′-trione, (1), and 2-methyloctanoic acid 6-oxo-2-propenyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-3-yl ester, (2) [
