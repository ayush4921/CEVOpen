Several studies have established that endophytes have resistance mechanisms in place to overcome pathogenic invasion through the production of secondary compounds [

 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Bioactive metabolites are low-molecular-weight, organic natural substances produced by microorganisms that possess activities at low concentrations against other microorganisms, in respect to bioactive compounds with potential antibiotic properties. Antibacterial compounds produced by endophytes have been shown to occupy a broad spectrum of structural classes, such as alkaloids, peptides, steroids, terpenoids, phenols, quinines, and flavonoids [
