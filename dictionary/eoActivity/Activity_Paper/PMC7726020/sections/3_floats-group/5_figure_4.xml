  <p>The hematopoietic functions of jujube. Jujube promotes erythropoiesis via activation of hypoxia inducible factor-induced erythropoietin, possesses potential capacity in recycling heme iron during erythrophagocytosis, exhibits bidirectional role in regulating immune response under different conditions, contains numerous minerals including iron. Red dots indicate iron, and yellow dots indicate cytokine. The arrow in red indicates the targets for jujube action. RBC, red blood cell; EPO, erythropoietin; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia response element; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; FPN, ferroportin; BVR, biliverdin reductase; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1.</p>
