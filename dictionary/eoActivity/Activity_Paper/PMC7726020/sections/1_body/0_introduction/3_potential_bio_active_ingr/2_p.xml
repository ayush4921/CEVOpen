<p>Polysaccharides from plant have been demonstrated to possess various bio-activities, e.g., anti-oxidation, anti-complementary and immunological activities (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen M. et al., 2016</xref>). Several polysaccharides have been isolated and purified from the jujube. The polysaccharides extracted from jujube usually consist of five monosaccharides, i.e., galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, glucose and xylose (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>). Fractions named as ZSP1, ZSP2, ZSP3 and ZSP4 with weight ratio of 29.3:17.6:37.2:15.9 have been purified from jujube (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The fractions of ZSP3 and ZSP4 at various concentrations (30–200 μg/ml) were applied onto peritoneal macrophages, and the cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. These two fractions were found to dose-dependently induce proliferation of spleen lymphocyte, having the highest response under the treatment of jujube polysaccharide at 200 μg/ml. This finding suggests the immunological activity of jujube polysaccharide. In line with this, Ju-B-2, a molecular weight of over 2,000 kDa polysaccharide from jujube, was shown to have the immune activity. Application of Ju-B-2 at 10–100 μg/ml onto cultured spleen cells for 3 days induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, the authors proposed the structures of rhamnogalacturonan and its side chains of Ju-B-2 polysaccharide contributing to the immune response (
