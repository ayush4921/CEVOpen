<p>The immune response is impaired in anemia condition. Here, the immune-modulatory properties of jujube under different scenarios are summarized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The intake of jujube extracts at concentrations of 150 and 250 mg/kg/day significantly stimulated thymus and spleen indices in mice, which indicated obviously strengthening the non-specific immunity in jujube-treated mice (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the authors described that jujube at various concentrations (30–200 μg/ml) showed a significant dose-dependent promotion of splenocyte proliferation, with the highest response at ∼100% increase. The effect of jujube extract on anti-complementary activity was also reported. Jujube extracts (25 and 125 μg/ml) exhibited ability to interact with the complement cascade (

In support of this notion, the water-soluble polysaccharide isolated from jujube stimulated proliferation of lymphocyte. In particular, the application of jujube polysaccharide at various concentrations (10–100 μg/ml) onto cultured lymphocytes for 3 days demonstrated an enlarging cell volume and an increasing cell number (

The extract dose-dependently stimulated the expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the highest effect was induced at ∼7-fold, ∼9-fold, and 4-fold, respectively (
