<p>The hydroalcoholic extract of jujube at 200–400 mg/kg was applied onto acute and chronic rat models of inflammation. The study revealed that jujube extract markedly declined granuloma tissue formation, as compared with model rat. Serum nitrite/nitrate level was notably up regulated in inflammatory rat; while pre-treatment with jujube significantly reduced the increased level of nitrite/nitrate (

In the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages, the pre-treatment with jujube water extract repressed the expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 (

On the other hand, the pre-treatment with jujube water extract (0–3 mg/ml) for 3 h in cultured macrophages, before the addition of LPS at 1 μg/ml for 24 h, dose-dependently repressed the activation of NF-κB activity. The reduction at 60% was observed under the pre-treatment of extract at 3 mg/ml (

In this study, mice were injected with azoxymethane followed by three cycles of dextran sulfate sodium, as to induce colitis-associated colon, before the intake of jujube extract for 70 days. The results showed that dietary jujube intake could attenuate inflammation in model mice. Moreover, the extract of jujube markedly inhibited the protein expressions of IL-6, NF-κB, JAK1, and STAT3 in colon tissues, as compared with model group. This result suggests that jujube can suppress the stimulation of NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling (
