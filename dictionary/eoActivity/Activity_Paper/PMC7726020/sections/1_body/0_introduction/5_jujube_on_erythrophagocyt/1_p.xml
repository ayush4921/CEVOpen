<p>Erythrophagocytosis is a process, where the senescent RBCs are phagocytosed by macrophage (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Klei et al., 2017</xref>). Within the macrophage, the senescent RBC undergoes hemolysis, and the components, such as heme iron, are being recycled. The reused iron will be carried back to bone marrow for erythropoiesis (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the disorders in iron recycling can result in anemia (
