<p>The promoter of 
 <italic>EPO</italic> gene contains HRE, and thus the activation of hypoxia-mediated signaling pathway is leading to activation of EPO expression (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Post and Van Meir, 2001</xref>). Cultured Hep3B cells were transfected with HRE promoter fragment (i.e., pHRE-Luc), and then jujube water extract was applied onto the transfected cells for 24 h, and which dose-dependently activated the transcriptional activity of HRE (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). To account for the possible mechanism of HIF signaling in jujube-induced HRE activation, the expression of HIF-1α was determined. The jujube extract at various concentrations (0.75–3 mg/ml) was applied onto cultured Hep3B cells for 6 h, and then total RNA was harvested from the cultures for PCR analysis. Jujube extract stimulated the expression of HIF-1α mRNA, and the induced expression was demonstrated to be in a dose-dependent manner, having the highest effect by ∼80% of increase. In parallel, the protein level of HIF-1α in the cultures turned to increase after 2 h, and subsequently HIF-1α protein was induced by ∼150% at 6 h after the treatment (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). These results support the effect of jujube on HIF-1α expression in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2014)</xref> reported that CREB-binding protein was required for HIF-α acetylation and efficient HIF-mediated EPO production during hypoxic stress. In consistent with this, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2014c)</xref> found that jujube extract (2 mg/ml) induced CREB phosphorylation in cultured cells, and this effect was fully blocked by H89, a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor. These results indicate that CREB-binding protein/HIF signaling can be involved in jujube-induced EPO production.
