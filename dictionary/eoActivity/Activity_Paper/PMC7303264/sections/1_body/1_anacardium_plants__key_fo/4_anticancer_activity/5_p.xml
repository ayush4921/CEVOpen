<p>Besides, marked effects were also reported by Sukumari-Ramesh et al. (
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>) on pituitary adenoma cells. Anacardic acid triggered polymerase cleavage induction, sub-G1 arrest, and annexin-V expression, reduced survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and anti-apoptotic proteins expression, all associated with cell survival. However, carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl)-fluoromethylketone failed to revert anacardic acid-induced cell death. Moreover, Chandregowda et al. (
 <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>), tested diverse benzamide derivatives synthesized for cytotoxic capacity on HeLa cells, being these compounds classified as potent as garcinol, with interesting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
