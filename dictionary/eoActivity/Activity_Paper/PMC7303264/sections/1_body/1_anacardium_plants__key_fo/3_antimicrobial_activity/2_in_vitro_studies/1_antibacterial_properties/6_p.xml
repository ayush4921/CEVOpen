<p>Campos et al. (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>) evaluated two 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> starch (10 to 60 mg/mL) samples (crude and purified) against 
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, Listeria innocua, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> strains. Both samples were able to inhibit growth, with MICs ranging from 20 to 30 mg/mL for the crude starch, and 40 to 60 mg/mL for the purified starch. The result was obtained for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (20 mg/mL). In the subculture assay (Minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC), only the purified starch sample displayed action at 50 mg/mL. In the cell's structural analysis, changes such as pili loss and cell lysis (10 mg/mL) were observed.
