<p>In the study by Akinpelu (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> bark methanol extract (60%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against 13 out of 15 bacterial isolates, obtaining the activity against 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, using the agar and broth microdilution methods (20 mg/mL). In the study by Melo-Cavalcante et al. (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), the antibacterial effect of fresh (25, 50, and 100 μL/plate) and processed (100, 500, and 2,000 μL/plate) cashew juices (
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic>) were assessed against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and all tested doses revealed to be effective. Melo et al. (
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>) demonstrated the action of the 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> stem bark hydroalcoholic extract against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic> using diffusion and microdilution techniques. The extract concentrations (50 to 0.04 mg/mL) presented halos varying from 19 to 0 mm for 
 <italic>S. mitis</italic>, 16 to 20 mm for 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and 18 to 20 mm for 
 <italic>S. sanguis</italic>. Chlorhexidine (0.12 to 0.001875%) obtained inhibition halos of 14 to 12 mm. The bacterial surface adherence analysis revealed the extract interferes with adhesion at 0.31 and 0.15 mg/mL.
