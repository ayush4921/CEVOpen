<p>The methanolic and n-hexane extracts from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> aerial parts showed inhibitory effects against bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>) with MICs ranging from 62.5 to 250 μg/mL (n-hexane) and 7.5 to &gt;250 μg/mL (MeOH), with the effect for both extracts being obtained against

 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> bark ethanolic extract (3.125, 6.25, 9.375, and 12.5 mg/mL) was investigated against 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> biofilm formation. The extract inhibited biofilm formation as the concentration increased, ranging from 67.22 to 94.20%. The chlorhexidine control (0.12%) presented 89.55% inhibition (
