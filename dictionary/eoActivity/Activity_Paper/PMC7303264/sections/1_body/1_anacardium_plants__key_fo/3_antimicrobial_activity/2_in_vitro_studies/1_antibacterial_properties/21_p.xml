<p>In the study by Green et al. (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>), a series of anacardic acid analogs (200 μg/mL) extracted from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> with different side chains were evaluated, where phenolic, branched and alicyclic analogs were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was tested against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) using microdilution method. The result was obtained for the side chain branched analog, 6-(40,80-dimethylnonyl) salicylic acid, and the side chain alicyclic analog, 6-cyclododecylmethyl salicylic acid (MIC = 0.39 μg/mL), respectively. This activity was greater than that of the most potent isolated antibacterial anacardic acid.
