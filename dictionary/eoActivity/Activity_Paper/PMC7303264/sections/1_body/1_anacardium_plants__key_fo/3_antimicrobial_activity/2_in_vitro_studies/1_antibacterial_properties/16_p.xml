<p>Quelemes et al. (
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>) evaluated the 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew starch (CG) antibacterial effect by microdilution, as well as that of its quaternized derivatives (QCG-1, QCG-2, and QCG-3) against a series of bacteria. QCG-2 and QCG-3 presented antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (standard and resistant) where a MIC of 31.5 to 250 μg/mL and a MBC of 62.5 to 500 μg/mL were obtained. These results show the quaternized derivatives may be a promising tool in the development of biomaterials with antiseptic action.
