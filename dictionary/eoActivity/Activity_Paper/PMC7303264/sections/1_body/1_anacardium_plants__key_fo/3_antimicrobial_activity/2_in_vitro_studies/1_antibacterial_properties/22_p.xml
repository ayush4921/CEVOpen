<p>Based on the previous antibacterial anacardic acid study, 6-pentadecenyl salicylic acids isolated from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew tree, a series of 6-alk(en)yl salicylic acids (200 μg/mL) were synthesized and tested for their antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> using broth microdilution. Among these, 6-(40,80-dimethylnonyl) salicylic acid was found to exhibit the most potent antibacterial activity against this cariogenic bacterium with a MIC of 0.78 μg/mL (
