<p>Mahata et al. (
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>) evaluated the cardanol activity extracted from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew, and its derivatives against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The best MIC values were obtained for 4-[(4-cardanyl)azo] benzoic acid (CABA) hydrogel derivatives (8 μg/mL), followed by Self-assembled CABA (16 ug/mL) and cardanol (64 μg/mL). Drastic damages (lysis) caused by products in the fungus's membrane and cell wall were observed using scanning electron microscopy, especially by the CABA compound.
