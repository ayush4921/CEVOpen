<p>Santos et al. (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>) observed that 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaf and bark hydroalcoholic extracts (70%) had their action improved when exposed to gamma irradiation (0, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 kGy). Disc diffusion assays showed that, against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the extracts (2,000 μg/disc) presented halos ranging from 14 to 0 mm and from 58 to 0 mm for bark and leaves, respectively. 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> tincture (200 mg/mL) obtained from a Homeopathic Pharmacy was tested by microdilution and presented action against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> with a MIC value of 100 mg/mL. No growth was observed with the control nystatin (100,000 IU/mL) (
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>). 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> dried leaf ethanolic extract (20 mg/mL) was tested by Anand et al. (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> presenting 15.67 mm inhibition halos, with gluconate (CHX) and povidine iodine (PI) presenting 14.67 and 19.67 mm, respectively. In the microdilution assay (10,000 μg/mL), the MIC and Minimum Fungicide Concentration (MFC) of the extract obtained a value of 1,250 μg/mL (CHX-−5 μg/mL and PI-−40 and 80 μg/mL, respectively). In the biofilm assay, the density for the extract obtained was of 0.107 nm, with a potent action compared to the controls (CHX: 0.102 nm and PI: 0.186 nm).
