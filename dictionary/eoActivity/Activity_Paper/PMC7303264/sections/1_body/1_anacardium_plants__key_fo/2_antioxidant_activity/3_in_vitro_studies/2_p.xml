<p>Different parts of 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> have strong antioxidant potency. For instance, ethanol extract of cashew nut skin demonstrated high total phenolic content and good antioxidant capacity as assessed by ABTS radical scavenging, superoxide scavenging, deoxyribose oxidation, and lipid peroxidation assays (

 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>) found that technical cashew nut shell liquid has high antioxidant capacity, perhaps due to its high content of cardanol and cardol, and thus it can be used as a natural antioxidant for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical purposes. The significant correlation between antioxidant capacity and the contents of anacardic acids, cardols, and cardanols was also reported, where anacardic acid content was found higher in cashew apple and fiber, whereas cardols and cardonols contents were higher in cashew nut shell liquid (
