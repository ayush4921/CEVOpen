<p>The antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>anacardium</italic> also depends on the extraction method. Razali et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) reported that 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> shoots methanol extract exhibited higher antioxidant activity compared to ethyl acetate and hexane extracts as assessed by ABTS, DPPH, superoxide anion, and NO radical scavenging assays; moreover, total phenolic content of methanol extract was found to be higher. De Abreu et al. (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>) reported that carotenoids content of cashew apple was higher compared to aqueous extracts. In another study, it was observed that ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> stem bark exhibited higher phenolic content compared to that of hexane and chloroform extracts (

 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>) recommended extraction at 34.7°C for 64 min with ethanol-to-solid ratio of 18:1 (v/w) as optimum conditions for cashew leaves extraction. Aqueous, ethanol and petroleum ether (60–80°C) extract from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaves were studied for antioxidant activities through NO production and DPPH radical assays. Ethanol extract revealed the higher potential, followed by aqueous and petroleum ether extracts (
