<p>There are changes in the antioxidant and phenolic contents of cashew during ripening. Gordon et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) observed a decrease in phenolic content of cashew apple during ripening compared unripe apple, but ascorbic acid concentration and antioxidant activity was increased during ripening. Thus, it is plausible that the antioxidant activity of cashew apple may depend on ascorbic acid rather than phenolic content (
