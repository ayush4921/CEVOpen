<p>Methanol, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> shoots were investigated through using ABTS and DPPH radicals, superoxide anion radicals, NO radicals, and ferric ions reducing assays. 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> methanol extract was the most potent reducing agent and radical-scavengers. In case of ethyl acetate extract, some antioxidant effects were detected, and hexane extract was the least reactive. Methanol extract revealed 7-fold higher total phenolic content than the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts, suggesting the possible contribution of phenolics in the observed effects (

 <italic>Anacardium microcarpum</italic> antioxidant effects were also investigated on human leukocytes and erythrocytes using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), for DPPH, varied from 27.9 (ethyl acetate fraction) to 32.9 μg/mL (ethanol fraction), and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> (10 μM)-induced lipid peroxidation was strongly inhibited by all fractions in rat brain and liver homogenates. Interesting, all the studied fractions were not cytotoxic to leukocytes and were able to inhibit against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. No effects was found on human erythrocytes osmotic fragility, thus suggesting that 
 <italic>A. microcarpum</italic> infusion can be safely consumed (
