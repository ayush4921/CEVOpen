 <italic>Anacardium</italic> plants have extensively been largely reported for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects. A number of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been reported with promising results. On the other hand, the anticancer potential of 
 <italic>Anacardium</italic> secondary metabolites is also quite prominent. Thus, 
 <italic>Anacardium</italic> plants should be further studied to better elucidate their therapeutic potential not only in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, but also the clinical application.
