<p>The MTT (tetrazolium bromide solution) viability assay was used to investigate the in vitro cytotoxic activity of the 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> HD oil and its nanoemulsions on Hep G-2 and THLE2 cell lines in comparison with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a reference drug.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04756-f004">Figure 4</xref> summarize the results. Generally, HD oils and their nanoemulsions showed some degree of cytotoxicity against the studied cells. This is revealed by a reduction in the cell viability percentage of the liver cancer cell line (Hep G-2) after treatment in comparison with THLE2 cells, which indicated a selectivity of the studied HD oil and its nanoemulsions. Oil nanoemulsions exhibited the highest growth inhibitory activity against the Hep G-2 cell line with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> (106 μg/mL) compared with the HD oil (274.8 μg/mL). However, both were lower than the reference drug, 5-Fu (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 40.95 μg/mL).
