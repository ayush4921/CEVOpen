<p>The dried aerial parts submitted to hydrodistillation produced a yellow oil with a yield of 2.1 ± 0.05%. Bendimerad et al. also reported similar results [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The identification of chemical composition using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) revealed the presence of 28 constituents, representing 99.80% of the total hydrodistilledessential oil (HD) content (

Borneol and α-terpineol were the predominant compounds with 25.71% and 25.61%, respectively, followed by thymol (12.8%), camphene (10.26%), α-pinene (5.68%), p-cymene (5.61%), and γ-terpinene (3.89%). From the qualitative and quantitative points of view, these results are in line with the findings of Laouer et al. [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Bendahou et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and Achraf et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, thymol was detected with a large predominance in comparison with borneol and α-terpineol. This could be due to endogenous and exogenous factors such as individual genetic variability, differences in growing locations, agronomical practices, and environmental conditions that were reported as the main reasons affecting the chemical composition of essential oils [
