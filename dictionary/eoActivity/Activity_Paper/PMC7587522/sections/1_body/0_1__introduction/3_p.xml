<p>Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of nanoemulsions using HPH techniques on the volatile constituents, antioxidant activities, and cytotoxic effects on liver cancer cell line Hep-G2 of the 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation. Healthy human hepatic cells (THLE2) were used as a control to examine the assumed selectivity of the examined oil and its nanoemulsion. The investigation of safe materials of botanical origin in this study represented a flourishing opportunity for applying nanotechnology and essential oils in various food and pharmaceutical industries.
