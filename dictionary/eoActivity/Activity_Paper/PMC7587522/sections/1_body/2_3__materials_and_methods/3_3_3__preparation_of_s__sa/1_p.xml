<p>The primary emulsions were obtained by mixing 1 g of essential oil and 1% of Tween 20 in 100 mL of deionized water using an Ultra Turrax T25 (IKA Labortechnik, Germany) at 18,000 rpm for 10 min. The obtained emulsions were subjected to high pressure homogenization (HPH) in a nano DeBEE electric bench-top laboratory homogenizer (BEE International, South Easton, MA 02375, USA) ten times at 350 MPa. At the end of HPH, hot nanoemulsions were rapidly cooled in an ice bath to crystallize oil droplets [
