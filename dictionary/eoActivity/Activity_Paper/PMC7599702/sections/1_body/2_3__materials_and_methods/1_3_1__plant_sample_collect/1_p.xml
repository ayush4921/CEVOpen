<p>Root samples of a flourishing medicinal plant 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic> (Forssk.) Sch. Bip. (Family 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic>) were carefully collected from area of Selebat (28.545493 N, and 33.933707 E), Saint Katherine, South Sinai, Egypt. The collected samples were stored in sterile bags, transported to the laboratory in the icebox, and subjected to selective isolation methods within 24 h of collection. The botanical identification of plant sample was achieved in the herbarium of Botany and Microbiology Department of Al-Azhar University. Surface sterilization of the root samples was performed according to Fouda et al. [
