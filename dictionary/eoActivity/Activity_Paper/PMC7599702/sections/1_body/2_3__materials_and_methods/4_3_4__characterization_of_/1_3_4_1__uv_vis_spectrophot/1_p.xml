<p>UV-Vis spectrophotometry (JENWAY 6305 Spectrophotometer) was used for assessing the absorption properties of the biogenic synthesized Ag-NPs. The mixtures containing Ag-NPs were examined in the wavelength range of 300â€“700 nm (10 nm intervals) using quartz cuvettes (1 cm path length). The presence of Ag-NPs can be observed by allocating a peak in the range of 400 to 500 nm. The endophytic actinomycetes biomass filtrate was used as a blank for the JENWAY spectrophotometer to confirmed the color change.</p>
