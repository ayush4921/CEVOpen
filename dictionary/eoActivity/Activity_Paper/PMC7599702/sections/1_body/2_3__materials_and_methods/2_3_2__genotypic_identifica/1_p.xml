<p>A single colony of the selected bacterial species was picked and washed in saline solution (NaCl 0.085%). The genomic DNA was extracted using a GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo K0721) according to the manufacturer’s criteria and was used as a template for PCR amplification. The 16S-rRNA gene was amplified using Maxima Hot Start PCR Master Mix (Thermo K1051) in 20 mL reactions using the universal primers of 27 f (50-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-30) and p1492r (50-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACT) [

The amplification products were checked by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and were commercially sequenced by the GATC Company using ABI 3730xl DNA sequences. The bacterial 16S sequences in this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession number of MT534273. The obtained sequences and those of their most closely related taxa retrieved from GenBank were aligned using the CLUSTAL X program [
