<p>Three agar plugs (6 mm diameter) of a freshly grown culture of the isolated endophytic actinomycetes were inoculated into autoclaved conical flasks containing 100 mL of starch nitrate broth (SNB) medium. The flasks were incubated for 5 days at 30 °C ± 2 in a rotating orbital shaker (150 rpm). At the end of the incubation period, the actinomycetes biomass was harvested by passing through four layers of wool fabric.</p>
