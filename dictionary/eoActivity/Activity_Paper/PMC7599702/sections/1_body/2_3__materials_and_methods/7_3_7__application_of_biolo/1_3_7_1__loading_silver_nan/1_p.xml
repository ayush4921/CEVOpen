<p>The cotton cloth was cut into pieces (15 × 30 cm); these pieces were washed with warm water and left to dry. The cotton fabric pieces were padded with Ag-NPs solution at a specific safe concentration (based on in-vitro cytotoxic results). For the successful treatment of textiles with colloidal silver, the solution was constantly stirred. All samples were immersed in this colloidal bath for one minute and then squeezed up to 100% wet pick up with a laboratory pad at a steady pressure. Samples were dried at 70 °C for 3 min, and then ironed at 150 °C for 2 min. The following treatments were performed: (1) Non-treated fabrics as a control, (2) Ag-NP-treated fabrics, and (3) Ag-NP-treated fabrics after repeated to 5 and 10 washing cycles. Washing was performed using a set of warm water machines (40–60 °C) containing 2% sodium carbonate. After each washing cycle (45 min), the fabrics were dried in a dryer at 80 °C.</p>
