<p>The antibacterial efficacy of the nano-treated fabrics was evaluated against selected pathogenic Gram positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633) and Gram-negative strains (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9022 and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 8739). Squares of the fabric samples were aseptically prepared and placed on the solidified Mullerâ€“Hinton agar plates that were pre-seeded with each bacterial pathogen. After incubation for 24 h, the plates were observed and the diameters (mm) of the inhibition zones around each sample were recorded. The experiment was conducted with these treatments; (1) Non-treated fabrics as a control, (2) Ag-NP-treated fabrics, and (3) Ag-NP-treated fabrics that were washed for 5 or 10 repeated washing cycles.
