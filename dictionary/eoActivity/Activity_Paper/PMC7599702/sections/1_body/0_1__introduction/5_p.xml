<p>Recently, the incorporation of Ag at the nanoscale to the textile industry has acquired increasing awareness due to new characteristics discovered for nanomaterials. Therefore, this study explored the efficacy of endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces laurentii</italic> isolated from medicinal plant 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic> as a biocatalyst for the green synthesis of Ag-NPs. The characterization of the green synthesized Ag-NPs was assessed, and the biological activity of Ag-NPs, including the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity, were investigated. Finally, the safe dose of green synthesized Ag-NPs that can be loaded onto cotton fabrics was determined and we explored the new features of the fabrics due to the Ag-NPs coating.
