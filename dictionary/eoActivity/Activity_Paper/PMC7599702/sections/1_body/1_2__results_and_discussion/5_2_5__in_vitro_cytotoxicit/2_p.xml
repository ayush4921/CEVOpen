<p>MTT is an accurate colorimetric screening method commonly used to estimate cellular toxicity as well as cell viability and proliferation. The microscopic examination showed that the silver nanoparticles were toxic to eukaryotic cells due to their efficacy regarding the loss of the mono layer, which characterized the epithelial cells. The response of cloned cells to nanoparticles was concentration-dependent. The time, size, and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles (especially particles of size â‰¤10 nm) were recently reported [
