<p>Recently, Ag-NPs have attracted great attention in developing new techniques for diagnosing and treating cancer [

 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Accordingly, this study was designed to investigate the toxicity of biogenic nanoparticles against human cancer cells. For this reason, an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic activities of Ag-NPs obtained from
