<p>The pieces of cloth were washed, loaded with bio colloidal Ag-NPs (100 ppm) using a pad-dry curing method. This concentration is safe for normal mammalian cells, according to our cytotoxicity examination. Immersing and washing fabrics with water before the treatment forms a negative surface charge on the textile fibers, which can then electrostatically attract the positively charged silver nanoparticles [

Microscopic micrographs of the pristine cloth showed a pure interlocking fibrous structure with a smooth surface, free from contaminating particles.
