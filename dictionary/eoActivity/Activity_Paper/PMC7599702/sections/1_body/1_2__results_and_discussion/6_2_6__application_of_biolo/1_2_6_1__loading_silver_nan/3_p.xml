<p>The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra provided an elemental chemical profile for the textile surface; in addition to the peaks of O and C, Ag-based fabric samples displayed an incoming peak at around ca. 3 keV, which could be assigned to the nanoscaled silver. The nanosized colloidal silver represented 1% of the total tissue surface elements, or approximately 0.19% of the total weight of these elements. These results proved the deposition of fine silver particles on the fabric surface (

 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] reported the successful use of biogenic colloidal silver as a nano-finishing agent for antimicrobial textiles. Their EDX analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver with the strong peaks recorded at 3.0 keV. The results obtained showed that the Ag-NPs dispersion was successfully incorporated into the surface of the treated fabric with high-density coverage, indicating the possibility of using silver particles as a nano-finishing agent for multifunctional textiles.
