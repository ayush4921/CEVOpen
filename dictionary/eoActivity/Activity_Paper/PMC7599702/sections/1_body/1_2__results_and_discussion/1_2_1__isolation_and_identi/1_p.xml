<p>Endophytic microorganisms, particularly actinomycetes, are known for their extracellular biologically active compounds, particularly those isolated from medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this regard, root samples of the medicinal plant 
 <italic>A. fragrantissima</italic>, located in Saint Katherine, South Sinai, Egypt, were collected. Only one actinomycete (R-1) was isolated from the root samples, and the molecular identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the R-1 isolate was closely related to 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. with a similar percentage of 99% to 
 <italic>Streptomyces laurentii</italic> (accession number: NR042299) and identified as 
 <italic>Streptomyces laurentii</italic> (R-1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00641-f001">Figure 1</xref>). To date, this is the first report for the isolation of 
 <italic>Streptomyces laurentii</italic> as endophytes from the medicinal plant of 
 <italic>A. fragrantissima</italic> and used as a biocatalyst for the green synthesis of Ag-NPs.
