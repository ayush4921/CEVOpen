<p>The green synthesis of nanoparticles using actinomycetes, fungi, bacteria, algae, and plants has better advantages than those of chemical and physical methods as they are environmentally safe and energy-saving; therefore, these biogenic nanoparticles can be used in various biotechnological and biomedical applications [

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, are considered one of the best nominations for the biological production of nanoparticles on a large scale with low costs due to their high biomass production and rapid growth, in addition to being environmentally friendly [
