<p>FT-IR analysis was performed to identify the functional components involved in the capping, reduction, and stability of biologically fabricated Ag-NPs, which may be associated with several chemical bonds in the 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> culture filtrates. The FT-IR spectral analysis for the synthesized Ag-NPs showed a broad peak at 3436 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00641-f003">Figure 3</xref>), which is characteristic to N–H aliphatic primary amine [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the peak at 2953 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is assigned to the carboxylic acid (OH) stretch [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while the peak at 2917 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicates the -CH
 <sub>2</sub> group [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The band at 2349 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is compatible with the C-H asymmetric stretching vibration for aliphatic groups [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The spectrum peak at 2096 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to the (OH) stretch of carboxylic acid. Bands at 1633 and 1557 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are correlated with the binding of the amide I band of protein with a (N–H) stretch [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The observed band at 1383 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be set to C–N stretching vibrations for aromatic and aliphatic amines [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The peak recorded at 867 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicates the amide IV (OCN) stretch bending for protein. Meanwhile, the (S–S) stretch band of protein was observed at 577 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be referred to a carbohydrate moiety [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The peak observed at 826 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is assigned for alkenes C–H vibration [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The presence of alkene (=C–H bending) was inferred by the peak recorded at 546 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00641-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The current results are consistent with previous reports, which concluded that proteins play a fundamental role in the formation of silver nanoparticles and act as a stabilizer and capping agent for biologically produced nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The carbonyl group of amino acids and proteins was shown to increases the stability of nanoparticles when bound to them [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
