<p>The structural properties of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs were demonstrated using XRD patterns. The XRD diffractogram depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00641-f004">Figure 4</xref>B shows four distinguished Bragg’s reflection planes at (111), (200), (220), and (311), which correspond to the 2θ values of 38.24, 44.26, 64.36 and 77.34, respectively. Analysis of the XRD profile was compared with the joint committee on powder diffraction standards (JCPDS) (No. 04-0783) [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The XRD study proved that the particles in the sample were silver nanoparticles, and the lattice planes were characteristics of the face-centered cubic (FCC) silver crystals. The mean crystalline size (D) of the Ag-NPs was determined from the diffractogram using the Debye–Scherrer’s formula, the mean crystalline size of the biogenic silver nanoparticles was ~28 nm. The absence of other peaks in the XRD spectra indicated the purity of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs. Similarly, Al-Bahrani et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported the biogenic synthesis of polydisperse silver nanoparticles with an average size of 28 nm.
