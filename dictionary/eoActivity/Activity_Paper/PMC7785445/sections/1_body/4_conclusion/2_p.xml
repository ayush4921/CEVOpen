<p id="p0200">The current research work is an exclusive study for finding phytochemical composition, radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> roots and leaves part. The results of AChE inhibition and radical scavenging assays were highly significant. Research data indicate that 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> is greatly enriched with antioxidants which can be implemented as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various neurological disorders. In the light of above mentioned pharmacognostic activity of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> extracts, further studies on bioassay guided separation of bioactive compounds and their mechanism of action is recommended.
