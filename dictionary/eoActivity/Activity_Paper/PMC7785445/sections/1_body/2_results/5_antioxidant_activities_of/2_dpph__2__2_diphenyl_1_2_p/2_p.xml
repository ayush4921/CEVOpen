 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a has shown the radical scavenging potential of different concentrations of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> extracts. BvRM extract at 25 μg/mL concentration attained the highest scavenging activity of 81.09% as compared to BvLM (73.81%). These results illustrated the competitive antioxidative potency of BvRM and BvLM extracts with purified standard. For the interpretation of results, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each extract was calculated. The results showed that BvRM exhibit IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.32 ± 0.72 μg/mL as compared to BvLM (2.20 ± 0.72 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). The reason why BvLM has lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value may be that it has more phenolic content as compared to the BvRM extract. Lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> with higher scavenging activity depicted the significant therapeutic potential of bioactive constituents found in extracts. However, we can say that both the extracts can possibly act as primary antioxidants. The scavenging activity of these extract was found to be comparable to gallic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 2.071 ± 0.72 μg/mL) (
