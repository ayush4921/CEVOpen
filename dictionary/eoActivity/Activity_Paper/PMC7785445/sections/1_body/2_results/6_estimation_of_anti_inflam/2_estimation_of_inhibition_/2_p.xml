<p id="p0160">The BvRM and BvLM extracts were analyzed for their inhibition of protein denaturation using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a protein of interest. Both extracts showed significant inhibition of protein denaturation. BvLM showed 96.45% inhibitory activity at concentration of 175 μg/mL. Both extracts displayed anti-inflammatory activity as compared to standard drug, aspirin (

BvRM depicted relatively constant inhibition potential (~80%) at multiple dilution concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 µg/mL while BvLM showed the same inhibitory pattern with the deviation of increased protein protective potency at 150 µg/mL and 175 µg/mL concentrations. Both extracts exhibited the same but higher inhibitory potency of protein denaturation as compared to standard drug. The
