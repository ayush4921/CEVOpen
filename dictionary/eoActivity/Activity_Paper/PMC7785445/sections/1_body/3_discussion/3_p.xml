<p id="p0185">Free radicals are produced during various metabolic processes in body and are associated with diverse range of disorders like diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, coronary heart disease, immunosuppression and many others (

 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Halliwell and Gutteridge, 2015</xref>). Generally, natural body defense mechanisms like chain breaking antioxidants generation and protective antioxidant systems neutralize the destructive effect of free radicals (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Jacob, 1995</xref>). Moreover devastative tissue injury occurs when rate of free radical generation exceeds the limit of natural antioxidant mechanisms. Therefore, various diseases like neurodegenerative disorders can be treated with drugs/agents (natural or synthetic) having radical scavenging potential. Natural flora is a valuable source of antioxidants which have been reported to provide protection from radicals induced damage (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). The significant anti-radical activities of BvLM and BvRM extracts were observed using DPPH (with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.20 ± 0.72 and 2.32 ± 0.72 μg/mL respectively) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> radical scavenging assays (with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.0519 ± 1.02 and 2.668 ± 0.49 μg/mL respectively). The antioxidant ability of BvLM and BvRM may be correlated with the presence of phenols especially BvLM since it showed a better radical scavenging ability as compared to BvRM due to the presence of phenols in a greater amount. These results are in concordance with the study done by
