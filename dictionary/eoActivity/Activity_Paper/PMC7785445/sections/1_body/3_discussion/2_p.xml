<p id="p0180">From botanical and health perspective, the importance of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> is highly appreciated. However, proving its importance in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is under consideration. It is now known that beetroots do have the ability to cure dementia â€“ a symptom shown by cognitive disorders, by providing oxygenation to the somatomotor cortex of the brain. In the current study, elaborative phytochemical investigation and pharmacognostic potential of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> extracts is reported. When subjected to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> testing, BvRM and BvLM extracts showed a plethora of characteristics. Presence of multiple secondary metabolites like saponins, flavonids, alkaloids, glycosides and phenolic compounds in preliminary phytochemical screening assays depicted extracts as rich nutritious source. Interestingly, quantitative analysis indicated the presence of phenolic compounds specifically in leaves extract (BvLM) which directly correlate with multiple bioactivities of extract. The phenolic compounds of BvLM extracts contain potential bioactive secondary metabolites (
