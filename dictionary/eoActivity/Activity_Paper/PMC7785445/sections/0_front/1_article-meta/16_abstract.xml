  <title>Research background</title>
  <p>Red beet (
   <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> L.) is commercially grown in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) regions while cultivated as vegetable in Baluchistan and Sindh regions of Pakistan. It is well known for its health-promoting role in several clinical and pathologic outcome due to abundance of betalains and other bioactive compounds. The purpose of study was to interpret bioactivity of of 
   <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> leaves (BvLM) and roots (BvRM) extracts for finding natural cure of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).

  <title>Experimental approach</title>
  <p>BvLM and BvRM extracts were evaluated for phytochemical composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticholinesterase potential using standard protocols with modifications.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Phytochemicals analysis of BvLM and BvRM extracts depicted the presence of flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, saponins and glycosides. The IC
   <sub>50</sub> values for free radical scavenging activity for BvRM and BvLM showed that BvLM (DPPH: 2.20 ± 0.72 μg/mL,

BvLM showed significant protection against heat induced hemolysis of HRBCs and protein denaturation (2.322 ± 0.1 &gt; 2.324 ± 0.06 μg/mL) as compared to BvRM (8.572 ± 0.2 &gt; 50.18 ± 1.0 μg/mL). Both extracts found to exhibit strong inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase enzyme.

  <title>Discussion/Conclusion</title>
  <p>Our study highlighted 
   <italic>B. vulagris</italic> extracts as rich and nutritious source of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and cholinesterase inhibitors that could be helpful in preventing and treating neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). In consideration of multifactorial and complex etiology of NDs, BvLM and BvRM extracts would be apt candidates for development of therapeutic strategy for management of multiple cognitive disorders.
