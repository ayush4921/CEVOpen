<p>Although our study included the largest dataset for medicinal plants used by Karen for treatments of infectious diseases in Thailand, our data most likely does not represent all plants used by Karen for the treatments. Many used plants had very low CI values. This is a weakness of meta-analytical studies that depend on available data. Our dataset is limited as it covers only 25 of the approximately 2000 Karen villages spread over northern and western Thailand [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. That number is only 1.5% of all Karen villages in the country. Another possible disadvantage is that ethnobotanical knowledge may be idiosyncratic and different from village to village as shown in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, a study found that that entire dataset on Thai ethnomedicinal plant species has not been completed [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This uncertainty can only be resolved by additional field surveys in other unstudied Karen villages.
