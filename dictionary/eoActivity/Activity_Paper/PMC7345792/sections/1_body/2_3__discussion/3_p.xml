<p>Fever is also a sickness caused by infections, especially viral infections. However, the comparison between ethnomedicinal plants used in this study and the ones used to treat fever by the Karen [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] shows interesting information. Two hundred and thirteen plant species were listed in both studies—127 plants were used to treat general infections and 125 species used for fever. However, only 39 plant species were used in both studies (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-09-00298">Table S2</xref>). Although fever, in general, is caused by infections, the human body creates sophisticated mechanisms to recover. Hence, medicinal plants that the Karen used to treat fever were not only used for antimicrobial infections but also for enhancing the recovery mechanism. Some species might be used as immunostimulants, for example,

 <italic>Tadehagi triquetrum, Scoparia dulcis, Rotheca serrata, Melicope glomerata, Cleidion javanicum, Chromolaena odorata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Alstonia scholaris</italic> (
