<p>Many modern pharmaceuticals were derived from plant sources and metabolic scaffolds, and a significant number were developed based on ethnobotanical knowledge [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In classical discoveries, drug researchers found hundreds of medicines, including opium, quinine, aspirin, and digitoxin. 
 <italic>Opium</italic> was known as a medicine for millennia. The world’s oldest clay tablet was made using this plant by the Sumerians and it was used for pain relief [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Today drugs such as morphine, codeine, and other opiate derivatives are extracted from opium as analgesic agents [

 <italic>Quinine</italic> is another example of a high impact drug, which was until recently the most potent medicine used to treat malaria [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Quinine was listed as the gold standard by the WHO in malaria treatment [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, after the discovery of 
 <italic>artemisinin</italic>, the WHO is no longer recommending quinine as a first-line to treat malaria, and it should be used only when artemisinin is unavailable, due to quinine’s undesirable side effects [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Artemisinin was also developed from botanical traditional use and discovered by the investigation of more than 2000 herb preparations from the Chinese pharmacopeia. An extract from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. emerged as an outstanding inhibitor of parasitic growth, and the enriched extract turned out to be non-toxic. The active ingredient, artemisinin, was identified [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and is now used globally to cure malaria. After becoming the first-line of essential medicines recommended by the WHO [

 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the discoverer, Professor Youyou Tu, was awarded the noble prize in 2015. In 2001, Fabricant and Farnsworth listed hundreds of drugs developed from traditional knowledge [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These examples of medicinal discoveries demonstrate the value of traditional medicinal knowledge.
