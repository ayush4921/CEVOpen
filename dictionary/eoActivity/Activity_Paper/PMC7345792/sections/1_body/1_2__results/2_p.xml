 <italic>Cleidion javanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Tinospora crispa</italic> had the highest total CI values. 
 <italic>Cleidion javanicum</italic> was used to treat bacterial, protozoal, and viral infections, whereas 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> was used to treat bacterial, helminth worm, protozoal, and unidentified infection types. 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> was another plant with high CI value for treatments of infectious diseases. The Karen used this species to treat bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections. Three species were used to treat four infection types, namely 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> (bacterial, fungal, protozoal, viral), 
 <italic>Tinospora crispa</italic> (bacterial, helminth worm, protozoal, unidentified), 
 <italic>Rotheca serrata</italic> (fungal, helminth worm, protozoal, unidentified). Six species were used to treat three infection typesâ€”
 <italic>Cleidion javanicum</italic> (bacterial, protozoal, viral), 
 <italic>Aristolochia tagala</italic> (helminth worm, unidentified, viral), 
 <italic>Acacia caesia</italic> (bacterial, helminth worm, viral), 
 <italic>Cajanus cajan</italic> (bacterial, small animal, unidentified), 
 <italic>Acacia concinna</italic> (bacterial, fungal, unidentified), and 
 <italic>Scoparia dulcis</italic> (bacterial, fungal, protozoal). Nine species were used to treat two infection types, and the remaining species were used to treat a single infection type (
