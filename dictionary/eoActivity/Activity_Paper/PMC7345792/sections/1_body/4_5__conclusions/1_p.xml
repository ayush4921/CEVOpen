<p>We identified medicinal plants used by the Karen for treatments of infectious diseases from 25 Karen villages in northern and western Thailand. We found 127 species in 59 families, which so far is the largest list of anti-infectious plants assembled for the Karen ethnic group. Among the families, Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Lauraceae, Apocynaceae, Menispermaceae, and Lamiaceae were the most commonly used. Among the species, 
 <italic>Cleidion javanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Tinospora crispa</italic>, 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, 
 <italic>Aesculus assamica</italic>, 
 <italic>Tadehagi triquetrum</italic>, 
 <italic>Senna alata, Tithonia diversifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Embelia sessiliflora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Combretum indicum</italic> were the most commonly used. We recommend that these could be candidates for pharmacological research in discoveries of modern medicines for treatments of infectious diseases.
