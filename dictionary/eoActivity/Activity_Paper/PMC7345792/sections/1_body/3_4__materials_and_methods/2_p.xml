<p>To rank the plants according to how important they were to the Karen for treating infectious diseases we calculated the Cultural Importance Index (CI) [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as:
 <disp-formula>CI = UR/N</disp-formula> where UR is the total number of use reports for a species and N is the total number of informants in the interview. Some studies might use other indices such as Use Value (UV) [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which is equivalent to CI, but they are calculated differently [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Because this study used ethnomedicinal metadata data, we used “Pseudoinformants” [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which refer to a studied village or a data source, instead of a person who is giving ethnomedicinal data. A CI value of one would indicate that a species was mentioned for the same use in all 25 villages, whereas a use value close to zero would indicate that a species was mentioned for a particular use in only one or a few of the 25 villages. The uses, which were reported as symptoms of infectious diseases, were specified as they appeared in the original reports and then they were classified into infection types such as bacterial, fungal, viral, helminth worm, protozoal, and infestations from small animals (insects, ticks, lice, etc.), and unidentified (some symptoms caused by many infection types).
