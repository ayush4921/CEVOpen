<p>Data were collected from published data in Thai university libraries, Thai online journals, online databases (Google scholar, Scopus, PubMed), and the database of the Thai Library Integrated System (
 <uri xlink:href="www.tdc.thailis.or.th" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.tdc.thailis.or.th</uri>), which includes almost all post graduate student theses, scientific articles, and scientific reports from all higher educational institutions in Thailand. Repeated data were removed by screening data from journal articles that repeated studentâ€™s theses. Reports that did not use ethnobotanical methods for their studies, and reports that did not provide scientific plant names were also excluded. All scientific plant names were updated following The Plant List website (
 <uri xlink:href="www.theplantlist.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.theplantlist.org</uri>), which is now merged into the World Flora Online website (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.worldfloraonline.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldfloraonline.org/</uri>). All plant uses for treatments of the category infections/infestations in the 
 <italic>Economic Botany Data Collection Standard</italic> (EBDCS) [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] were included in this study. However, we excluded ethnomedicinal plant uses for treatment of fever because the symptoms are so complicated, i.e., having viral infection, having high body temperature, having a running nose, having a headache, fatigue, etc. Therefore, it might be that some plants used for fever treatment were not used as anti-viral purposes. We had information on Karen ethnomedicinal plants from 25 villages reported in 16 references including one book, one journal article, and 14 theses (Additional Data 1 AD1).
