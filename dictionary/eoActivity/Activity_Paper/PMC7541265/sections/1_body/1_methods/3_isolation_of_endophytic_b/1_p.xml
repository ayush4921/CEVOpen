<p id="Par33">NA was used for the isolation of the endophytic bacteria. The disinfected leaves, without midribs, were ground in sterile 6 ml of aqueous saline solution (0.9% NaCl) using a sterile mortar, under aseptic conditions. The tissue extract was serially diluted in sterile aqueous solution. About 100 μl of each dilute (10
 <sup>− 1</sup> and 10
 <sup>− 2</sup>) and undiluted sample were pipetted on NA plates and spread evenly using a sterilized glass spreader. Plates were sealed and incubated at 28 °C for 5 days. The colonies were counted as colony forming units (CFU) per gram and expressed as population density. The colonies were selected based on divergence in morphology, size and colour. They were then sub-cultured twice on NA and stored at 4 °C [
