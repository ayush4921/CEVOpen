<p id="Par47">The ABTS free radical scavenging activity of the extract was evaluated by using serial dilution method. ABTS solution (0.003 g/mL) was mixed (1:1 v/v) with the extract at different concentrations. Each mixture was made to stand for 15 min at 25 °C and the absorbance was read at 734 nm by using microplate reader. The extract without ABTS solution served as blank. Ascorbic acid (AA) and butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA) were used as the positive controls. The percent inhibition of ABTS radical was calculated by the following formula: %ABTS scavenging activity = [Ao – A1 / Ao] × 100 where, A1 and Ao equal the absorbance recorded at 734 nm of the control and the test, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extract against ABTS was calculated graphically [
