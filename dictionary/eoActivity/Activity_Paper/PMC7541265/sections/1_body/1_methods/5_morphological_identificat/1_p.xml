<p id="Par39">Pure bacterial colonies were subjected to Gram staining to investigate their morphological physiognomies such as shape and Gram stain reaction. Briefly, the bacterial isolates were spread on the glass slides and heat fixed using Bunsen burner. The crystal violet was used as a primary stain, followed by iodine solution. It was decolorized by ethanol after washing with tap water. The slides were flooded with safranin and rinsed with tap water.
