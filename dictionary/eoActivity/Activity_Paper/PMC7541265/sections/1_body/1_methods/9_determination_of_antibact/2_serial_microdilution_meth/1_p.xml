Micro-serial dilution was carried out using MH broth in a range of 50–0.313 mg/ml. About 100 μl of the fresh selected bacterial suspension at a density of 1 × 10

The plates were sealed and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Afterwards, 40 μl of 0.2 mg/ml of piodonitrotetrazodium violet (INT) solution was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The MIC was perceived as the lowest concentration of the extract that inhibited the bacterial growth.
