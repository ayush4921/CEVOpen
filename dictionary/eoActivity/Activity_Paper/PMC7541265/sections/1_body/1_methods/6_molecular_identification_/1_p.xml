<p id="Par40">Five isolates (Isolate 1–5) were further identified using 16S rRNA sequence analysis by Inqaba Biotechnical Industries (Pty) Ltd. Briefly, DNA extraction was done using a ZR Fungal/Bacterial Kit™ according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was run to amplify the 16S rDNA gene of the endophyte with the primers 16S- 27F: 5′AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG- 3′ and 16S- 1492R: 5′- CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′, using DreamTaq™ DNA polymerase. PCR products were gel extracted and sequenced in the forward and reverse directions on the ABI PRISM™ 3500xl Genetic Analyser. The PCR products were cleaned with ExoSAP-it™ following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Purified sequencing products were analysed using CLC Bio Main Workbench v7.6, followed by a BLAST search using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to identify the closest bacterial species [
