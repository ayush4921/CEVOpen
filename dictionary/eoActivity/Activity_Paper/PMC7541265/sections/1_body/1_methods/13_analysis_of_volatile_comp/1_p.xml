<p id="Par48">The components of the extract were analysed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The temperature of the GC oven was initially set at 40 °C for 3 min and subsequently increased by 5 °C per minute to 220 °C. The temperature of the injector was programmed to 250 °C, and the flow rate of the helium gas was 1.0 ml per minute, with a 10:1 split ratio. The ion source temperature of the MS system was put at 250 °C with the voltage of 70 eV. The evaluation was performed two times [
