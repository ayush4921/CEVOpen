<p id="Par38">Pure endophytic bacterial isolates were pre-cultured overnight on NA at 37 °C. A loopful of fresh endophytic bacterial species were inoculated into 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of sterilised nutrient broth (NB). They were incubated at 28 °C, 130 rpm for 72 h. Two millilitres of the fermented broth were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 min. The culture supernatant was used for screening of antibacterial activity. An agar well diffusion method was employed to screen antibacterial activity of the isolates in accordance to [

 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 10102), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25925), 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (ATCC 25933) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) were adjusted to 106 CFU/ml. The test bacterial strains were streaked on Mueller Hinton (MH) agar with sterile swabs over the agar surface. About 6 mm diameter wells were made on the bacterial lawn using sterile cork borer. A total of 100 μl of the centrifuged endophyte broths-supernatants was pipetted into the wells. MH broth was set as negative control and ciprofloxacin (20 μg/ml) as a positive control. The plates were left at room temperature for 10 min to allow the diffusion of the supernatants into the agar. They were then sealed and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, the plates were observed for the inhibition of the selected bacteria. The zone of inhibition was measured and expressed in millimetres as an indication of antibacterial activity.
