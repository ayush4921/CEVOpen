<p id="Par36">Carboxy methyl cellulase production was evaluated using the method by Zamani et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The NA supplemented with 1% of carboxy methyl cellulose was inoculated with the isolates and incubated for 5 days at 28 °C. The negative control was 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) while 
 <italic>Cellulomonas humilata</italic> ATCC 2517 served as the positive control. The plates were then flooded with a solution of 0.5% Congo red. Isolates forming yellow coloured zones were considered positive for cellulase activity.
