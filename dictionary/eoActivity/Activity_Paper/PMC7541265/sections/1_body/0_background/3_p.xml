<p id="Par28">Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi can produce high quality metabolites on a large scale under optimized culture conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is because their metabolite production is reproducible, weather and season independent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Microorganisms often produce metabolites that display distinctive molecular skeletons which are not even available in the chemical libraries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Endophytes are microorganisms which inhabit within plant tissues and often occur as symbionts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Endophytes, especially those that are found from ethnopharmacologically noteworthy medicinal plants have attracted attention due to their diverse bioactive metabolites against pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They produce a plethora of metabolites with unique structures and profound biological activities. These include essential enzymes, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, quinines, steroids and terpenoids. Although these metabolites were primarily beneficially to the host plant, they have found a wide-ranging application industrially. They are harvested and used as agrochemicals, antibiotics, immunosuppressants and antioxidants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, most of research focuses on fungal-based bioactive products and a limited number has been isolated from bacterial endophyte [
