<p id="Par30">The study was designed to isolate and identify endophytic bacteria from 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic>. The bacteria were screened for extracellular enzyme and antimicrobial agent production. Moreover, its biological activities such as antibacterial and antioxidant activities were evaluated from the extracted secondary metabolites of one of the isolates. Lastly, metabolites composition was analysed. The other isolated bacteria will be investigated in future studies.
