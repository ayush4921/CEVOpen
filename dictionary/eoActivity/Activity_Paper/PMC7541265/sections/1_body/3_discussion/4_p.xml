<p id="Par63">All the morphologically identified bacterial endophytes were of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. The isolate of interest (Isolate 1) exhibited 99% similarity with 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aureuginosa</italic> CP043328.1. Most studies have reported that 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. are one of the main endophytic bacteria often found associated with most of the medicinal plants. Thus, our study affirmed these reports. Endophytic 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. have been used as biocontrols against phytopathogens [
