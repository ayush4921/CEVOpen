 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is known for producing a wide variety of metabolites with antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. The identified volatile compounds, xanthoxylin, trans-2-decenoic acid, [1, 2, 4] oxadiazole, 5-benzyl-(thiophen-2-yl), dodecenoic acid, 3-nonynoic, pyrrolo [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl), pentadecanoic acid and diisooctyl phthalate are recognised for possession of antimicrobial activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. cis-9-Octadecenoic acid, 2-dodecenoic acid and 9-octadecenamide are reported to possess antioxidant property [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It was therefore assumed that the profound antibacterial and antioxidant activity of extract was due to synergistical activities of the identified bioactive compounds.
