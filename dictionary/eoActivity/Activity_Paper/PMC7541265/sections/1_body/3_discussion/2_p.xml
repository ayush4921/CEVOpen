<p id="Par61">A variety of chemical disinfectants have been employed for surface sterilization of excised plant tissues to remove epiphytes. However, immersion of tissue in ethanol, sodium hypochloride and bicarbonate have shown significant success in different studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The effectiveness of surface sterilization of the leaves from 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> CIX1 was confirmed as there was no microbial growth observed after 5 days. This indicate that the surface sterility method was effective at inhibiting growth of epiphytic bacteria and fungi. Thus, the subsequence isolates can be considered as true endophytic bacteria. The leaves had CFU value of 9.2 × 103 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The diversity of isolated endophytic bacteria dependent on the media used during isolation [

 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> CIX1. It can therefore be assumed that the ecological success of 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> CIX1 in the north part of Kwazulu-Natal could not only be associated to the conducive climate and fertile soil but also to its association with active endophytes as they are known to have symbiotic relationship.
