 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and moderate activity against ABTS radical (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Molyneux, 2004 classified the antioxidant activity where the highly active compounds have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &lt; 0.05 mg/ml, the active category have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.05–0.1 mg/ml, medium category have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.1–0.15 mg/ml, and weak categories have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.151–0.2 mg/ml. Thus, the results clearly show that the extract has promising ABTS scavenging activity and could be a potential source of natural antioxidant.
