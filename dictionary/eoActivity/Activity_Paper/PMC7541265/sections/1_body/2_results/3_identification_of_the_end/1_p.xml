<p id="Par52">The isolates were selected for morphological characterization using Gram staining. Twelve isolates were Gram negative rods while one isolate was a Gram positive rod (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Molecular characterization of the endophytic bacteria indicate that they are different bacterial species. The final taxonomic status of 5 selected endophytic bacteria isolates was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequence alignment showed the similarity in a range of 97–99% in BLAST with different strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> namely; 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CP43328.1, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CP033432.1, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LR657304.1,
