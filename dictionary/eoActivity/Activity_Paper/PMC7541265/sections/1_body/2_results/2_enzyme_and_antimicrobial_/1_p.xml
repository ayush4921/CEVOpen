<p id="Par51">The isolates were all screened qualitatively on solid casein, cellulose, tween 80 and starch media for the four industrially important enzymes namely; proteases, cellulase, esterase and amylases. All isolates showed the ability to produce two or more of the tested enzymes. About 38, 62, 38 and 77% of the isolates produced proteinase, amylase, esterase and cellulase, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Isolate 1–5 showed the ability to produce all the tested enzymes. The isolates were further screened for antimicrobial agent production using broth fermentation cultures. Isolate 1 did also show broad spectrum against all tested clinical human pathogens (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
