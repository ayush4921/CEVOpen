<p id="Par68">Out of 13 isolates, Isolate 1 (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CP43328.1) produced all the tested enzymes and showed the ability to produce antimicrobials that were effective against all the tested pathogens. Its secondary metabolites demonstrated antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 0.098–0.391 mg/ml. It had bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25925) at 25 mg/ml. It also illustrated potent ABTS scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.051 mg/ml. The extract showed a total of 15 volatile compounds with diisooctyl phthalate (50.51%) and [1, 2, 4] oxadiazole, 5-benzyl-3 (10.44%) being the major compounds. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CP43328.1 has a potential to serve as a source of pharmacologically important compounds. Further studies, quantitative analysis of the detected enzymes and evaluation of the mechanisms involved in antibacterial activity are imperial.
