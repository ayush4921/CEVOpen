 <p>From a CHCl
  <sub>3</sub>-soluble extract of the stems of 
  <italic>Semecarpus caudata</italic> (Anacardiaceae), two new diarylalkanoids, semedienone (
  <bold>1</bold>) and semetrienone (
  <bold>2</bold>), were isolated. Their structures were elucidated based on NMR spectroscopic data interpretation. These compounds possess strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity with the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 0.033 and 0.11 
  <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. Docking studies of 
  <bold>1</bold> and 
  <bold>2</bold> with 
  <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase were carried out to analyze their interactions. Accordingly, semedienone (
  <bold>1</bold>) showed good interactions with the peroxide group and amino acid residues. The biosynthesis of the isolated diarylalkanoids was proposed.
