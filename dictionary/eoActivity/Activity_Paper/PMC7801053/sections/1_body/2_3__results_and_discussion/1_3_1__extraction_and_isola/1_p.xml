<p>The dried powdered stems of 
 <italic>S. caudata</italic> were exhaustively extracted in a Soxhlet extractor with MeOH to yield MeOH-soluble extract (700 g). This extract was successively partitioned to give the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (37 g)- and CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (500 g)-soluble fractions. The CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-soluble extract of stems of 
 <italic>S. caudata</italic> was repeatedly chromatographed using silica gel CC and preparative TLC to obtain seven compounds including two new diarylalkanoids named semedienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) and semetrienone (
 <bold>2</bold>). The known compounds were identified as 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (
