<p>In molecular docking study, the imperfect scoring results (false-positive hits), which may be considered as decoys, can be occurred by predicting incorrect ligand geometries or by applying nonbinding molecules. The active and decoy ligands are similar according to some physicochemical properties (molecular weight, number of rotational bonds, total hydrogen bond donors, total hydrogen bond acceptors, topological polar surface area, and the octanol-water partition coefficient), but decoy was presumed to be inactive against a target. According to Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], kojic acid and hypoxanthine showed the tyrosinase inhibitory constant (

 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, in this docking study, kojic acid and hypoxanthine was selected as the active inhibitor and the decoy molecule, respectively, to validate our docking protocol.
