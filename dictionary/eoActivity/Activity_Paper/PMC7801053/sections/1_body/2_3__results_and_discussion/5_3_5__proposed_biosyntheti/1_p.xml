<p>We have proposed plausible biogenetic pathways for two new diarylalkanoids (

 <italic>Î±</italic>-Ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase is responsible for the C-2 hydroxylation of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA to give 2,4-dihydroxycinnamoyl-CoA [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is condensed with four or five malonyl-CoA moieties to afford the corresponding polyketides, which undergo the intramolecular ring closure 
 <italic>via</italic> Claisen reaction. After that, reduction, dehydration, and enolization must occur to give rise to 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>.
