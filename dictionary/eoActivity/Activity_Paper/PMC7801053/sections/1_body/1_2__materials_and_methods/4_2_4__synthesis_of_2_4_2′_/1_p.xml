<p>2,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde (276.3 mg, 2.0 mmol) and 2ʹ,4ʹ-dihydroxyacetophenone (152.1 mg, 1.0 mmol) were dissolved in 1 mL·H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and then 1 mL KOH 14 M was added. The resulting mixture was kept in the ultrasonic water bath at 80°C for 8 h. This reaction was monitored by TLC using MeOH-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (1 : 9) mixture. After completion, the reaction mixture was quenched by acidification with HCl 3 M to pH ∼5 and cooled to 0°C to precipitate crude product, which was recrystallized with MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1 : 3) mixture to afford pure chalcone. It was identified as 2,4,2′,4′-tetrahydroxychalcone (
 <bold>8</bold>), by comparison with authentic sample.
