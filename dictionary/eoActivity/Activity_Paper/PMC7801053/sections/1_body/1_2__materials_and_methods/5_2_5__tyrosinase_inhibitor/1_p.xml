<p>All pure compounds were dissolved in DMSO and tested at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Assay mixtures in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.8 were prepared immediately before use, consisting of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of tyrosinase solution (15 U/mL) and 1900 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of test solution. These mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by addition of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <sc>l</sc>-DOPA 1.5 mM in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer and incubated at room temperature for 7 min. The absorbances (
 <italic>A</italic>) at 475 nm were acquired on Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. The inhibitory percentage (
 <italic>I</italic>%) was calculated according to the formula: 
 <italic>I</italic>% = ((
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>control</sub> − 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>sample</sub>)/
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>control</sub>) × 100%. Data were represented as means ± standard error (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by using GraphPad Prism software with multivariate nonlinear regression and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9. Kojic acid was used as positive control.
