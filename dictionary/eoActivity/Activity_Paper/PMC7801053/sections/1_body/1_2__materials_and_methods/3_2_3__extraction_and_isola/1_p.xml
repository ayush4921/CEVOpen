<p>The dried powdered stems of 
 <italic>S. caudata</italic> (7.0 kg) were exhaustively extracted in a Soxhlet extractor with MeOH (20 L, 3 h × 3) to yield MeOH-soluble extract (700 g). This extract was suspended in H
 <sub>2</sub>O (5 L) and successively partitioned with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (2 L) and CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (3 L) to give 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (37 g)- and CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (500 g)-soluble fractions. The CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-soluble fraction was chromatographed by silica gel column chromatography (15 × 150 cm) and eluted with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (0 : 100 ⟶ 100 : 0) and MeOH-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0 : 100 ⟶ 20 : 80) to afford 12 fractions (Fr.1−Fr.12). Fraction Fr.3 (4.5 g) was subjected to further silica gel column chromatography and was eluted with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (0–100%) to yield 4 subfractions (Fr.3.1−Fr.3.4). Subfractions Fr.3.2 (1.1 g) and Fr.3.3 (540 mg) were chromatographed over a silica gel column with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (0–100%) and purified by preparative TLC with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (20 : 80) and EtOAc-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (10 : 90) to afford 
 <bold>5</bold> (5.0 mg) and 
 <bold>7</bold> (6.0 mg), respectively. Fraction Fr.5 (5.2 g) was separated by silica gel column chromatography with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (0–100%) and MeOH-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0–20%) to yield 5 subfractions (Fr.5.1−Fr.5.5). Subfraction Fr.5.3 (850 mg) was subjected to further silica gel column chromatography, eluted with Me
 <sub>2</sub>CO-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0–80%) to give 
 <bold>4</bold> (5.0 mg). Fraction Fr.6 (0.9 g) was separated by normal-phase chromatography with EtOAc-
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (0 : 100 ⟶ 80 : 20) and MeOH-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0 : 100 ⟶ 5 : 95) and reversed phase chromatography with H
 <sub>2</sub>O-MeOH (0–100%) and then purified by preparative TLC with AcOH-EtOAc-PhMe (4 : 16 : 80) to obtain 
 <bold>3</bold> (4.0 mg) and 
 <bold>6</bold> (4.0 mg). Fraction Fr.8 (4.5 g) was loaded onto a silica gel column and eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-Me
 <sub>2</sub>CO (0–80%) and CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-MeOH (0–20%) to yield 5 subfractions (Fr.8.1–Fr.8.5). Subfraction Fr.8.2 (630 mg) was further purified using a silica gel column with EtOAc-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0–80%) and preparative TLC with MeOH-CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (5 : 95) to give 
 <bold>1</bold> (2.0 mg) and 
 <bold>2</bold> (2.0 mg).
