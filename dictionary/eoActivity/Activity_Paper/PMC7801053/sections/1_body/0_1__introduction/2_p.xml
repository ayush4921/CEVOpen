<p>A previous study on the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Semecarpus caudata</italic> (Anacardiaceae), collected at Dong Nai Province in Vietnam, led to the isolation of six flavonoid derivatives and the evaluation of their tyrosinase inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our continued phytochemical study on the stems of 
 <italic>S. caudata</italic> was carried out, leading to the isolation of seven compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>7</bold>) including two new diarylalkanoids named semedienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) and semetrienone (
 <bold>2</bold>). These compounds were found to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Semedienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) showed a strong effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.033 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, which makes it 1300 times more potent than that of kojic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 44.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). In addition, molecular docking studies of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> with the 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-form of the copper-bound 
 <italic>Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus</italic> tyrosinase were performed.
