<p>Parasites were cultured in O
 <sup>+</sup> and sickle-negative human blood and coincubated with different concentrations of the various extracts and growth inhibition determined as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the extracts on both parasites and human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated by coculturing the parasites with the extracts at the predetermined concentrations. The cytotoxic effect of the extract on the PBMCs was assessed by the colorimetric determination of human lactate dehydrogenase released into the supernatant of the culture media [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The genotoxic effect of the extracts on either the parasites or the PBMCs was evaluated by the comet assay [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] using a commercially available Comet assay kit (4250-050-K, Trevigen, USA). The parasite DNA was stained with silver stain, while the DNA of the PBMCs was dyed with Sybr green.
