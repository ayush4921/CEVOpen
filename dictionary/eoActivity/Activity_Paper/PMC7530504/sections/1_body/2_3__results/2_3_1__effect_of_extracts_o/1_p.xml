<p>The inhibitory characteristics of the various extracts and the standard drug, artesunate, on the growth of the two strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The least concentration 6.51 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml of each extract significantly inhibited the growth of either strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> used compared to the control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth inhibition by 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> was concentration-dependent which ranges from 18.86% to 71.67% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The highest concentration of 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml inhibited the growth of the 3D7 parasite up to 71.67%, while in the case of Dd2, the percentage growth inhibition reached a maximum of 66.67%. In the case of the 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam extract, the percentage growth inhibition of the 3D7 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ranges from 17.29% for the minimum 6.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml to 79.11% (for a maximum of 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml concentration used, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The 
 <italic>Morinda lucida</italic> Benth extract inhibited the growth of both strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites used (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). The least concentration of 6.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml inhibited the growth of 3D7 up to 18.06% with the maximum concentration of 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml inhibiting the parasite growth up to 61.94% (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref>). Similarly, the same minimum and maximum concentration of the extract inhibited the growth of Dd2 from 20.63% to 57.59% (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). The 
 <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic> L extract also inhibited the growth of both strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). The growth inhibition ranges from 27.29% to 62.19%. The most concentrated preparation at 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml inhibited the growth of chloroquine-sensitive parasite strain (3D7) up to 62.19%, and in the case of chloroquine-resistant strain (Dd2), the percentage growth inhibition was about the same (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). Similarly, the 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extract showed growth inhibition of chloroquine-sensitive strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ranging from 17.91% at 6.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml to 90.95% at 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml for the maximum concentration, whiles in the case of chloroquine-resistant strain, the minimum and maximum percentage growth inhibition were 16.61% and 84.22%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In general, the degree of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7 growth inhibition increased significantly with increasing extract concentrations up to 26.042 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.032) for 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> and (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.046) for 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> but to only 13.021 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml in the case of 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.003) and 
 <italic>M. lucida</italic> Benth (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.021). The rest, including data on Dd2, increased gradually and never reached significant levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There was no significant difference amongst the IC
 <sub>50</sub> when the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained for all the extracts for 3D7 (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.45) or Dd2 (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.11) were compared. Similarly, no differences were detected between the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the two 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strains (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
