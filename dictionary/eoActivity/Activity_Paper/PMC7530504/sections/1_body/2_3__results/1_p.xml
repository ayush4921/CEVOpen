<p>Two different laboratory strains of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite (3D7 which is chloroquine-sensitive and Dd2, chloroquine-resistant strain) were successfully cultured and used to evaluate the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of seven selected medicinal plant extracts. All the extracts were screened with the parasites, but three did not show any appreciable antiplasmodial activities and were dropped from further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses.
