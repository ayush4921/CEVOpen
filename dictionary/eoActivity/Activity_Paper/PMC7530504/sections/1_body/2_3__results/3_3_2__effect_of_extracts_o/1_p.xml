<p>The effect of the plant extracts on

A visual scoring and quantification of the extent of DNA damage produced an average score of 1.5 for the lowest diluted extract corresponding to 42% DNA in the tail of the comet. The highest score of 4 which translated to 75% DNA in the comet tail was recorded for the highest concentration of the 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extract (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 
 <italic>Acanthospermum hispidum</italic> DC extract also had a comet score of 4 (75% of DNA in the tail of the comet). The 
 <italic>Senna siamea</italic> Lam extract, on the hand, had a score of 3 (corresponding to 65% of parasite DNA in comet tail (
