 <italic>Alstonia boonei</italic> (De Wild) displayed high activity against chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. This confirms earlier 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reports which suggested the plant as a source of potentially useful lead substances for future antimalarial drugs. Currently, artemisinin, a plant-derived drug is the most potent drug against chloroquine-resistant parasites [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To minimize the development of resistance by 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites to artemisinin, artemisinin combination therapy has been recommended by the World Health Organization. The exact-active antimalarial agent in 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild) could, therefore, be identified and developed into an antimalarial drug that may be used as a standalone or be in combination with artemisinin to treat malaria.
