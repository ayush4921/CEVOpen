<p>The widespread resistance of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite to drugs being used to treat malaria poses a lot of public health challenges. Should the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> develop resistance to artemisinin, the last surviving most potent antimalarial drug, the havoc will be unprecedented. There is, therefore, an urgent need for novel and affordable drugs to either standalone or partner artemisinin for management of malaria; hence, this investigation into selected medicinal herbs that are used in treating malaria in Ghana and some other countries in Africa [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Aqueous extracts from all the plants tested showed various degrees of antiplasmodial activities against both chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 and chloroquine-resistant Dd2 laboratory strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The observed sensitivity of both parasite lines to the extract lends more credence to their use traditionally as antimalarial plants. From rankings of the IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of the extracts, the 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> extract was the most efficacious, closely followed by 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild) and 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam. They inhibited parasite growth in a concentration-dependent manner, and this seems to result from tempering of the integrity of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite DNA by the plant extracts. This observation is consistent with other studies that have demonstrated that herbal preparations [
