<p>It is not clear which phytoconstituents are responsible for the antiplasmodial activities observed in these studies. However, phytochemical studies have shown that alkaloids, saponins tannins, flavonoids, steroids and glycosides, terpenes, anthraquinones, and glycoside abound in the plants under study [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which have been suggested to possess varying degrees of antimalarial activities depending upon extraction media and parasite strains/isolates used [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is, therefore, reasonable to postulate that these phytoconstituents, either singly or in combinations may be responsible for the observed antiplasmodial activities recorded.
