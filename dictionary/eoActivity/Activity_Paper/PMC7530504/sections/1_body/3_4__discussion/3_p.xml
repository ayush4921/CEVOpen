<p>The 
 <italic>Senna siamea</italic> Lam extract displayed high antiplasmodial activity in this study. This corroborates reports of the use of the plant in countries in Central and West Africa, including Ghana for the management of malaria [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, the observed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.48 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml is about five-folds lower than what was reported by Sanon et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This might have arisen from the plant part used and the type of solvent used, as well as the duration of extraction of the active agent relative to other products during the preparation of the extract. The aqueous extraction employed in the current report was made from the root of the plant by boiling at 100°C for 60 minutes. However, Sanon et al. made their aqueous extraction from the leaves of the plant and the duration of extraction was shorter [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is, thus, possible that the active antiplasmodial ingredient in the plant was more concentrated in the root bark. These notwithstanding, it is very clear that extracts from either part of 
 <italic>Senna siamea</italic> Lam have antiplasmodial activity that can be isolated and developed into a novel, a readily available, and affordable antimalaria drug.
