<p>Malaria in humans is caused by five species of haemospozoan parasites, namely, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. malariae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. ovalae</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> and, lately, the Zoonotic 
 <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of these, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the most widespread and causes the most lethal infection with the female mosquito of the 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae complex</italic> being responsible for the transmission of the disease [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease threatens billions of people globally. Infection with the parasite may result in asymptomatic or clinical malaria [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with about 2% of the clinical cases resulting in severe disease [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] that accounts for thousands of deaths attributed annually to malaria [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa of which children are in the majority. Mortality in children under five years of age is quite high, but the disease affects all age groups, including pregnant women and nonimmune adults either residing in or visiting endemic areas. Low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth that are associated with placental malaria are some of the other effects of malaria on humans [
