<p>The six test pathogens were exposed to aqueous and ethanol extracts of different plant parts (leaves, barks, stems, and roots) by adaptation of the agar-well diffusion method. The growth media were prepared following standard procedures. After complete solidification of the media, separate cultures of each species of bacteria were spread aseptically onto each plate. Immediately following this procedure, small wells (each with 6 mm diameter) on each inoculated plate were prepared aseptically using a sterile cork borer, and extracts of varying concentrations (25 and 50 mg/ml) were added into the wells. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours [
