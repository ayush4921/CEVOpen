<p>Crude plant part extracts were obtained by separately suspending 200 g of each plant material in 1000 ml distilled water to give 20% (w/v) in a 2000 ml conical flask. The resulting leaf, bark, stem, and root powder suspension was then shaken at 121 rpm for 24 hrs using a shaker to produce the required infusion. After filtering the infusion using a double-layer cheesecloth and Whatman No. 1 filter paper, the filtrates were centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm. The supernatants of the extracts were then preserved in airtight bottles until further use in the refrigerator (4°C) [
