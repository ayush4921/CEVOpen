<p>The ethanol and aqueous extracts of the different plant parts that showed significant antimicrobial activity in the previous test were selected for the determination of MIC. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the crude extracts of the leaves, the barks, the stems, and the roots of 
 <italic>Calpurnia aurea</italic> was determined by the agar dilution method. The growth media were first prepared in the usual fashion and sterilized by autoclaving. The sterilized media were allowed to cool to 50°C, and 18 ml of the molten agar was added to test tubes which contain 2 ml of different concentrations of the crude extract and the control. The concentrations of the extracts used in this test ranged from 1.25 to 6.25 ml. The plates were dried at room temperature. The suspensions of the respective pathogens having density adjusted to McFarland 0.5 turbidity units (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) were inoculated onto the series of agar plates using a standard loop. Three loops of the suspension were transferred into each plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 hrs. The lowest concentration which inhibited the growth of the respective organisms was taken as the MIC [
