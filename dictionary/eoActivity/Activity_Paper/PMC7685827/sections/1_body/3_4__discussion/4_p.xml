<p>The present study indicated that the antibacterial activity of the ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> is much higher than aquatic extracts comparable to that of standard antibiotics. According to Adedapo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], stem extract by methanol had antibacterial activities, but in the current study, leaf extracts by ethanol had high antibacterial activities; the difference in the finding might be due to types of extracts.
