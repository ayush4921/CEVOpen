<p>The screening of secondary metabolic chemicals from parts of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> revealed that the major secondary compound groups were found in different parts of the plant and solvent type (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This finding has concurred with the report of [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, phytosteroids, saponins, terpenoids, and tannins from 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> parts by the ethanolic extract. The report of [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] indicated that alkaloid, tannin, flavonoid, and saponin were present, but terpenoid and steroid were absent in 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> leaves. The preliminary phytochemical analysis of 70% ethanolic extracts from the 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> seeds showed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, steroids, glycosides, and alkaloids compounds [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The stem and bark hexane extract of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> yielded the widely studied isoflavonoids and alkaloid-type phytochemicals [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
