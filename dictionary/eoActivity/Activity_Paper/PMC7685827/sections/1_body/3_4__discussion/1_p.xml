<p>The results of crude extract yields clearly showed that the percentage yield of the crude extracts of different plant parts varied from solvent to solvent. This could be attributed to different polarities and extracting potential of the solvents. Ethanol might be dissolved polar and nonpolar substances. As Justine et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported, most antimicrobial agents that have been identified from plants are soluble in organic solvents, and this reveals the better efficiency of ethanol as an extracting solvent than aqueous. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> also approved that the percentage yields of the crude extracts using the same extracting solvent varied from one part of the plant to the other. So, in the current study, when different plant parts were compared for their yield, the leaf extracts gave the maximum yield and the root extract the least for both extracting solvents. This indicates that the bioactive ingredients are not found uniformly through the plant, and some plant parts tend to have more bioactive compounds [
