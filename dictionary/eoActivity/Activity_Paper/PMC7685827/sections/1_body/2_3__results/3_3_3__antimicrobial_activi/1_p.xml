<p>In this study, the antimicrobial activities of the ethanol and aqueous crude extracts of the leaves, barks, stems, and, roots of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> were evaluated using the agar-well diffusion method. A total of 8 crude extracts (ethanol and aqueous) were prepared and screened for antimicrobial activities against the test pathogens. The antimicrobial activities of different extracts of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> against the six pathogenic bacteria (S. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes, E. coli</italic> O157 H:7, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic>) are presented in Tables

 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table"/>
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table"/>–
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. The antibacterial activities of plant parts extracted by ethanol 50 ml/mg against all tested isolates were not significantly different from one another (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Standard antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline) were used as positive controls and caused significantly higher zone of inhibition against all tested clinical isolates by both extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) except penicillin against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 H:7 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Sterile distilled water which was used as a negative control had no antibacterial activity against all tested isolates (Tables
