<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracts that showed significant antimicrobial activities in the previous tests. MIC was determined for extracts that showed diameter greater than or equal to 7 mm of the growth inhibition zone at 25 mg/ml. All pathogens were added to the diluted ethanol extracts of concentrations ranging from 3.125 mg/ml to 12.5 mg/ml. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The data revealed that the MIC of ethanolic extracts ranged from 3.125 mg/ml bark and root extracts for 
 <italic>C. jejuni.</italic> Leaf ethanol extract also scores 3.125 mg/ml on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Generally, the bark ethanol extracts had the lowest MIC, and the highest was for the leaf and stem ethanol extracts.
