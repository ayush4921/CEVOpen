<p>The leaf and stem bark of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> were obtained from Al Jabal Al Akhdar region, Northeast Libya in March 2016 and identified by Dr. Abdulamid Alzerbi, a botanist at Biology Department of Benghazi University, Libya. The leaf and stem bark were dried under shade before being pulverized into a powder using a mechanical grinder (model: MX1100XT11CE, Waring, S/NoB 8643, Atlanta, GA, USA). The powdered plant material was sieved with a steel sieve (80 mesh) to obtain a uniform fine powder. For extraction, 1500 g of the ground leaf and 500 g of the stem bark were separately mixed with methanol at 1:10 solid-to-liquid ratio. The mixtures were sonicated at 35 °C for 60 min with a frequency of 53 kHz using an ultrasonic water bath (Branson, model 8510E-MTH, Danbury, CT, USA). The crude methanolic extracts were filtered (Whatman No. 1 filter paper, USA), and the collected filtrate was concentrated at 45 °C under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, USA). The crude methanolic extracts were further fractionated using liquid–liquid fractionation to obtain solvent fractions of different polarities, namely hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (n-BuOH) fractions (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The yields and physical appearance of the various extracts and fractions are tabulated in
