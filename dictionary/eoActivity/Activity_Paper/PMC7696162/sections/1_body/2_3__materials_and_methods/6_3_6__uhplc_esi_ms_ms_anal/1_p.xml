<p>The bioactive fraction was separated using a Hypersil Gold C18 reversed-phase column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.9 µm, Thermo, USA) on a Thermos Scientific Ultimate 3000 (Bremen, Germany) with a mobile phase consisting of LCMS grade water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), each containing 0.1% formic acid flowing at 0.4 mL/min. The programmed gradient system consisted of 0 min (95% A), 1 min (95% A), 20 min (5% A), 25 min (5% A), 25.1 min (95% A) and 35 min (95% A). The sample of 1 mg/mL (

The resultant mixture was then filtered using 0.22 μm Nylon membranes, and then 10 µL of the filtrate was auto-injected. The MS analysis was done on a Q-Exactive Focus Orbitrap LC-MS/MS system. The ESI-MS parameters were set as follows: negative mode, collision energy of 3.5 kV, capillary temperature 350 °C, auxiliary gas heater temperature 0 °C, sheath gas flow rate 40 arbitrary units and auxiliary nitrogen gas (99% pure) flow rate 8 arbitrary units. Then, the mass resolution was set to 70,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a full scan of 150–2000 amu. The identification analysis was carried out by comparing the obtained MS/MS data with the literature.
