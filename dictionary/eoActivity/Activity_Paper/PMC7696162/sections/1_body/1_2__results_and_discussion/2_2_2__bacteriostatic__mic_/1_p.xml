<p>The antibacterial activity of the bioactive extracts and fractions was further investigated through the determination of the MIC and MBC values, as well as the total activity. The MIC and MBC values are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01539-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The MIC values of the crude leaf methanolic extracts ranged between 0.08 and 1.25 mg/mL, while the MBC values ranged between 0.16 and 2.50 mg/mL. The leaf methanolic extract was more potent against the two standard MRSA strains, i.e., ATCC 700699 (MIC 0.08 mg/mL; MBC 0.16 mg/mL) and KCCM 12255 (MIC 0.63 mg/mL; MBC 1.25 mg/mL), in comparison to the clinical isolates, against which it showed MIC of 1.25 mg/mL and MBC of 2.5 mg/mL for both strains. A similar trend of potency was observed for the leaf fractions, where the standard MRSA strains were more susceptible to the fractions while the clinical isolates were less affected. The MIC and MBC for the EtOAc fractions were in the ranges of 0.08–1.25 mg/mL and 0.16–2.50 mg/mL, respectively; the MIC and MBC for n-BuOH fractions were 0.04–2.50 mg/mL and 0.08–5.00 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, among the activities exhibited by the leaf extract and fractions on the MRSA strains, the n-BuOH fraction showed the highest potency against the ATCC 700699 strain with MIC and MBC values of 0.04 and 0.08 mg/mL, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of an extract is considered very interesting and is of significant scientific value when its MIC values are lower than 100 μg/mL [
