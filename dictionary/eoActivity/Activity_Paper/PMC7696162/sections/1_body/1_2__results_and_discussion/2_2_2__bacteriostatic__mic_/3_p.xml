<p>Overall, all the extracts and fractions showed different levels of antibacterial activity against the tested MRSA strains. This variation could be due to the different potencies of the bioactive compounds present in the extracts and fractions leading to different bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on the bacterial strains, as reported by Qaralleh [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several studies investigated the efficacy of plant extracts and their effective compounds as antibacterial agents to control infections by MRSA, suggesting that the bioactive component(s) of the plant extracts interact with enzymes and proteins of the bacterial cell membrane, causing its disruption, to disperse a flux of protons towards the cell exterior, which induces cell death or may inhibit enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of amino acids [
