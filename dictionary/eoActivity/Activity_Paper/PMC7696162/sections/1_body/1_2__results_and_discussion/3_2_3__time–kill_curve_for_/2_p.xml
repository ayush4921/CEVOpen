<p>The data demonstrated that the bactericidal ability of the leaf EtOAc fraction is dependent on concentration and the bacterial strain. Generally, the time–kill kinetics results reasserted the expectation that a more concentrated sample will kill the microorganism in a shorter period of time. An increase in concentrations of plant extracts leads to an increase in the diffusion of phytochemicals into the cell membrane of bacteria, thus causing membrane destruction [

Furthermore, the bioactive compounds in the fraction may inhibit the synthesis of essential metabolites such as folic acid by preventing the enzymatic reaction. The protein synthesis in the microorganisms also can be inhibited if the bioactive compounds interfere and change the shape of the ribosome, which may lead to misreading of genetic code on mRNA [

 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> leaf possesses bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against the tested MRSA strains, and the bioactive constituents could be largely present in the ethyl acetate fraction. Consequently, the EtOAc fraction was subjected to dereplication using UHPLC-MS/MS in order to gain an insight into the potential bioactive constituents.
