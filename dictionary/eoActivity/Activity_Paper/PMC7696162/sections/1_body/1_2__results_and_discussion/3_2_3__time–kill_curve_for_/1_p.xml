<p>A time–kill assay, using the four bacterial strains, was performed for the leaf EtOAc fraction since it exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity in comparison to the other fractions. Although MIC value gives a good indication of the efficacy of an antimicrobial agent, it provides limited information on the kinetics of the antimicrobial action [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A better method of assessing the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of an antimicrobial agent over time is by using time–kill kinetics assay, where the effect of various concentrations of the antimicrobial agent over time in relation to the growth stages of the bacteria is monitored [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The bacterial strains were thus exposed to the EtOAc fraction, at test concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 × MIC over a period of 4 h, and the time–kill curve was plotted. The assay results for MRSA ATCC 700699 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01539-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) revealed that the bacteria were completely killed after 4 h when a concentration of 4 × MIC (0.63 mg/mL) was used and after 2 h with the higher concentration of 8 × MIC (1.25 mg/mL). In terms of practical application, the 4 h killing time would be more preferred since the effect was obtained using a lower concentration (0.63 mg/mL) of the disinfecting agent. This condition is similar to that of a drug that exhibits a concentration-dependent bactericidal action, where the bactericidal effect is dependent on the dose of the leaf EtOAc fraction rather than on incubation time [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01539-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) showed that the time–kill endpoint was achieved after 2 h incubation with a higher concentration of 8 × MIC (2.5 mg/mL). Meanwhile, in the case of the clinical isolates, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01539-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D, the time–kill endpoint could only be achieved with a concentration of 4 × MIC (5 mg/mL) after 1 h of incubation.
