 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>14</bold> and

 <italic>z</italic> 169 and the characteristic fragment ions at

 <italic>z</italic> 271 and 211 in their MS/MS spectra [

 <bold>5</bold>, with a pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 169.0131, was assigned as gallic acid, showing the characteristic base peak at

 <sup>−</sup>. Compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>, eluting at three different retention times (0.78, 1.04 and 1.18 min, respectively), were identified as isomers of gallic acid hexoside (I-III). These compounds exhibited pseudomolecular ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 331.0668, 331.0669 and 331.0668, respectively, and all three produced a fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 169 for [M-H-162]
 <sup>−</sup>, due to the neutral loss of a hexoxyl moiety. This agrees with previous reports by Mendes et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Abu-Reidah et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>7</bold> exhibited a pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 343.0668. The compound was assigned as galloylquinic acid based on the presence of base peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 169 and fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 125 for a further loss of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, all of which were characteristic fragment ions of gallic acid moiety [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold> were identified as 
 <italic>di</italic>-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylhexose and 
 <italic>tri</italic>-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylhexose, respectively, based on similar fragmentation pattern showing losses of the corresponding number of galloyl moieties and the presence of a base peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 169 for the gallic acid aglycone.
