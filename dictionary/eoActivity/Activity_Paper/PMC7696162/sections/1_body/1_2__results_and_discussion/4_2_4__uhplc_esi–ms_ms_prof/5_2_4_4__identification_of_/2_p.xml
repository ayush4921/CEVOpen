<p>The UHPLC-MS/MS results showed that the flavonoids and phenolic acid components are major secondary metabolites in the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> leaf. Furthermore, among the identified compounds, several of them have been previously reported to possess antibacterial activity against MRSA. Shibata et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported that gallic acid has antibacterial activity against MRSA with MIC value of 62.5 μg/mL. Catechins are often linked to antimicrobial effects associated with their interactions with the microbial cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cushnie et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported that membrane disruption by catechins causes potassium leakage in MRSA strain, which is the first indication of membrane damage in microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, several studies have shown that the effectiveness of β-lactams can be enhanced by combining them with epigallocatechin gallate [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and epicatechin gallate [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Meanwhile, Su et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] reported that quercetin exhibited inhibitory effect against different MRSA strains, with MIC values ranging from 31.25 to 125 μg/mL, while rutin, a quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-deoxyhexosylhexoside, was reported to inhibit MRSA with MIC value of 250 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Besides, arbutin was reported to exert antibacterial activity against MRSA with MIC value of 10 mg/mL and MBC value of 20 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of these compounds, especially the flavonoids and phenolic acids, could have contributed significantly to the antibacterial activity of the leaf ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic>.
