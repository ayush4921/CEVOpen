<p>In this study, the leaf and stem bark of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> were evaluated for anti-MRSA activity. The antibacterial activity was performed using disc diffusion agar test, MIC and MBC assays, in which the methanolic extracts and fractions of leaf and stem bark of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> demonstrated potential antibacterial activity against the tested MRSA strains. Among the extracts and fractions, the EtOAc fraction of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> leaf revealed the highest antibacterial activity against all tested MRSA strains, with activity ranging from moderate to significant (MIC 0.08–1.25 mg/mL). In time–kill analysis, the MRSA strains were found to be completely killed after exposure to this fraction for 30 min to 2 h at 4× MIC and 8× MIC, revealing a remarkable capacity to inhibit or kill the MRSA strains. The UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS profiling of the bioactive fraction revealed that it contains high amounts of polyphenolic compounds. Phenolic acid and flavonoids were the main components and could be responsible for the bioactivity. The present findings add support for the traditional medicinal use of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> and highlight its potential as a source of natural antibacterial agents for future exploitation as natural antibiotics in the fight against MRSA prevalence.
