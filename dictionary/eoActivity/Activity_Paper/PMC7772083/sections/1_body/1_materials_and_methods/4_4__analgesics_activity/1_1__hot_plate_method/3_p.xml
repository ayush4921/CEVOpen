<p>The animals were individually placed on the hot plate maintained at 55 ± 0.5℃. The reaction time (in seconds) was noted as the time at which animals reacted to the thermal pain stimulus either by paw licking or jump response, whichever appeared first. The cut off time for the reaction was 15-20 seconds to avoid damage to the paw [
