<p>The analgesics effect of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>T. khasianum</italic> H. Wolff was evaluated through a hot plate test method using two different doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of plant extract. The percentage (%) inhibition time was recorded at an interval of 30, 60, and 90 min after administration of test extract in the experimental rats. About 30 minutes, the percentage inhibition of two different doses (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) were recorded as 128.9%, and 278.1% for aqueous extracts and 186.0% and 313.2% for ethanol extract, while compared with the standard drug showed 142.1%. Then, after 90 minutes, the percentage inhibition of two different doses (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) was recorded as 339.7% and 481.9% for aqueous extracts and 351.7% and 512.1% for ethanol extract respectively while compared with the standard drug as shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and shown graphically in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The results of the hot plate test revealed a significant therapeutic response at a dose of 200 mg/kg for both water and ethanolic extracts were reported as 13.5 ± 0.202 sec and 14.2 ± 0.336 sec respectively.
