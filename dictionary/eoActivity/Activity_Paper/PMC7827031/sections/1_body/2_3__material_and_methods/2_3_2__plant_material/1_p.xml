<p>Aerial parts and rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. postii</italic> Mouterde were separately collected on Korek Mountain (GPS position: 36°35′20″ N, 44°27′32″ E). The plant was identified by botanist A. H. Al-khayyat of Salahaddin University-Erbil/Iraq. A voucher specimen (accession number 7230) has been deposited at the Education Salahaddin University Herbarium (ESUH). The vegetal materials were cleaned and air-dried under shade at room temperature (20–25 °C) in a ventilated room until they reached constant weight. After drying, each plant part was finely powdered using a laboratory grinding mill, and powdered materials were stored in bottles at room temperature until analyses.
