<p>Compounds 
 <bold>112</bold> and 
 <bold>114</bold> (2.0 mg each) were separately dissolved in 3% aqueous H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in a sealed vial and heated at 90 Â°C for 45 min. After cooling to room temperature and extraction with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>, the aqueous layer was repeatedly evaporated to dryness with the aid of MeCN. The residues were identified as 
 <sc>l</sc>-(+)-rhamnose and 
 <sc>d</sc>-(+)-glucose, respectively, by TLC and optical rotation upon comparison with authentic samples.
