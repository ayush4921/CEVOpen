 <sup>1</sup>H) and 75.47 MHz (
 <sup>13</sup>C), respectively. Deuterated solvents (purity 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). ESI-MS experiments were carried out on a Thermo-TSQ mass spectrometer, by flow injection analysis (FIA), with the electron-spray ionization source (ESI) at 5 kV on TIP capillary. Spectroscopy grade solvents (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatographic (MPLC) separations were carried out on a Biotage Isolera instrument (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden).
