<p>A few known bioactive flavonoids (

 <italic>C</italic>-glucoside flavone isovitexin (

 <bold>55</bold>) showed a significant inhibitory activity that was higher than the well-known antitumor drug cisplatin, against MCF7, SkBr3, Ishikawa, BG-1, and A549 human tumor cells. Moreover, embinin showed a remarkable DPPH radical scavenging activity, that was comparable to that of the well-known antioxidant ascorbic acid [
