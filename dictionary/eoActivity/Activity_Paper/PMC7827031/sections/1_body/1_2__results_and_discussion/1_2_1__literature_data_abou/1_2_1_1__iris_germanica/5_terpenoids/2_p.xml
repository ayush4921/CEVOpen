 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00264-f006">Figure 6</xref>) are the odoriferous principle of iris oils. It is well known that freshly harvested iris rhizomes do not contain irones, but their triterpenoid precursors iridals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00264-f005">Figure 5</xref>). According to the traditional procedure, decorticated rhizomes of some 
 <italic>Iris</italic> species (e.g., 
 <italic>I. germanica</italic>, 
 <italic>I. pallid</italic>a, 
 <italic>I. florentina</italic>) are kept in a dry and aerated environment for 2–3 years, then powdered, incubated with diluted sulphuric acid, and steam-distilled to provide the precious “orris butter”. The mechanism of the oxidative degradation affording irones from iridals is still poorly understood. The traditional process is long, troublesome and low yielding; hence, the high cost of the essence (butter). Purification of the essence eliminates the fatty acids and yields the absolute, which is sold at several thousands of dollars per kilogram [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the average composition of an iris butter prepared from 
 <italic>Iris germanica</italic> is the following: 0.91% of (+)-
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-irone (ee = 96%, (+)-
 <bold>96a</bold>), 61.48% of (−)-
 <italic>cis</italic>-α-irone (ee = 82%, (−)-
 <bold>96b</bold>), 0.71% of β-irone (
 <bold>97</bold>) and 37.60% of (−)-
 <italic>cis</italic>-γ-irone (ee = 38%, (−)-
 <bold>98</bold>) [

 <bold>99</bold>–
 <bold>118</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00264-f006">Figure 6</xref>) are also occurring in the essential oil [
