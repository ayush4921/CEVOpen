 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). DPPH is a stable, nitrogen-centered free radical which produces violet/purple color in methanol solution and fades to shades of yellow color in the presence of a hydrogen radical/electron-donor compound. The antiradical activity was expressed as EC
 <sub>50</sub> value, i.e., the concentration (μg/mL) of the sample required to scavenge 50% of the initial DPPH concentration and as μg ascorbic acid equivalents/μg sample. In the case of isolated compounds, the activity was also measured as EC
 <sub>50</sub> (μM/L), which, in our opinion, is a more accurate measurement of the intrinsic antiradical activity of a compound. The results of the DPPH assay (
