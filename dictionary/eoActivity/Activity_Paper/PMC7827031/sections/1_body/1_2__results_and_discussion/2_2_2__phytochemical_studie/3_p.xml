<p>At first, powdered aerial parts and rhizomes were separately defatted by soaking in hexane at room temperature; most chlorophyll was also removed in this manner. Successively, each biomass was extracted with MeOH. The yields of the residues, IPA from the aerial parts and IPR from the rhizomes, were 1.3 and 2.75% (

 <sub>2</sub>O and dichloromethane and H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, respectively, to give fractions IPAD and IPRB, respectively. Multiple medium-pressure liquid chromatographic separations of a sample of IPAD on reversed-phase (RP-18) columns afforded L-tryptophan, androsin (

 <italic>O</italic>-diglucoside (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00264-f010">Figure 10</xref>) were established mainly by extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments and MS spectrometry. Comparing our spectroscopic data with the pertinent literature, we found some differences between our data and those reported from different laboratories, especially for the NMR signals of swertisin (

Therefore, although the isolated compounds are known, the physical and spectroscopic data determined by us are reported in the Experimental section, whereas the graphics are included in the
