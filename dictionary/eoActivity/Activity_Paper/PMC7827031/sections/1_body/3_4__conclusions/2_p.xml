<p>In conclusion, the few 
 <italic>Iris</italic> species growing in Kurdistan that have been investigated so far demonstrated to be novel viable sources of various bioactive compounds. Moreover, the remarkable antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of the methanol extracts of aerial parts and rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. postii</italic>, as well as the anti-inflammatory properties reported for different isolated compounds, validate the traditional medicinal use of this plant in Kurdistan. Further studies aimed to evaluate the in vivo potential of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> extracts in various models and to isolate and identify the antioxidant principles occurring in the most polar fractions of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>I. postii</italic> aerial parts shall be carried out in due time.
