<p>A dozen 
 <italic>Iris</italic> species are used in the traditional medicine of Kurdistan. In the first part of this paper, we have reported the structures of the main constituents, traditional uses and biological activities found in the literature for the few species growing in Kurdistan that have been investigated so far. The most characteristic secondary metabolites are various terpenoids, among which iridal derivatives are the most typical ones, and phenolic derivatives, among which isoflavones predominate. Most of these 
 <italic>Iris</italic> metabolites exhibited various bioactivities. Based on these data, we then investigated, for the first time, the contents of the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>I. postii</italic> aerial parts and rhizomes. L-tryptophan, androsin (
 <bold>66</bold>), apigenin 6-
 <italic>C</italic>-glucoside (isovitexin) (
 <bold>109</bold>), swertisin (
 <bold>111</bold>), and 2″-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnosyl swertisin (
 <bold>112</bold>) were isolated from the aerial parts, whereas chromatographic separation of the extract from rhizomes afforded 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ε-viniferin (
 <bold>113</bold>), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-resveratrol 3,4′-O-diglucoside (
 <bold>114</bold>), and isotectorigenin (
 <bold>115</bold>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finding of compounds 
 <bold>112</bold>–
 <bold>115</bold> in the genus 
 <italic>Iris</italic>. Isolated compounds showed a wide range of bioactivities, in addition to the excellent radical-scavenging properties exhibited in this investigation by 2″-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnosyl- swertisin (
 <bold>112</bold>), ε-viniferin (
 <bold>113</bold>), and resveratrol 3,4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-di-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>114</bold>). Thus, isovitexin (
 <bold>109</bold>) has been reported to be an anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, sedative agent with insulin secretagogue properties and to display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, antitumor effects [

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]; swertisin (
 <bold>111</bold>) exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic activities with insulin secretagogue and adenosine A1 receptor antagonist properties [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]; swertisin (
 <bold>111</bold>) and 2″-O-rhamnosylswertisin (
 <bold>112</bold>) exhibited strong α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and effective mechanical antinociceptive properties [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; ε-viniferin exhibited relatively strong inhibition of α-glucosidase in vitro [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and inhibited both human LDL and HDL oxidation in vitro [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]; resveratrol diglucoside 
 <bold>114</bold> decreased ethanol-induced oxidative DNA damage in mouse brain cells, possibly via inhibition of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and displayed highly selective antiproliferative activity against tumor cells [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].
