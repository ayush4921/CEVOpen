<p>Despite the wide use of herbal remedies, phytochemical studies on Kurdistan medicinal plants are still in their infancy and only a few papers have been published so far that describe the structures and bioactivities of isolated metabolites. As part of our ongoing project on scientific validation of Kurdistan traditional plants, we directed our attention toward the genus 
 <italic>Iris</italic>. This large genus of the family Iridaceae (Angiosperms) contains about 260–300 species [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of perennial plants growing from creeping rhizomes (rhizomatous irises) or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). The showy flowers are characterized by a violet-like scent. The plants grow in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere, from Eurasia to North America [

 <italic>Iris</italic> species are ornamental plants; however, they are also used in various traditional medicines for the treatment of inflammations, cancer, bacterial and viral infections, and other diseases. Extensive phytochemical investigations of the genus have led to the isolation of different isoprenoids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids and their glycosides, xanthones, quinones, and stilbene glycosides, among others [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, isolated bioactive compounds have shown antibacterial, anti-neoplastic, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-plasmodial, molluscicidal, anti-inflammatory, phytoestrogenic and antituberculosis properties [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, an essence called “orris butter” and an absolute essential oil with the scent of the flowers are derived from the bulbs of some 
 <italic>Iris</italic>, e.g., 
 <italic>I. florentina</italic> and 
 <italic>I. germanica</italic>; they are used in the manufacture of luxury expensive perfumes, such as Chanel 
 <italic>No. 19</italic> (1970) and 
 <italic>So pretty</italic> by Cartier (1995) [
