<p id="Par40">The acute dermal irritation/corrosion test was conducted as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guideline 404, 2002 according to Mengiste et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with modifications from Pinto et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Rats were used for this test. The animals were randomly selected, marked and placed in cages 5 days prior to the commencement of the test to facilitate acclimatization. Approximately 24 h before the test began, the rats were restrained and an area of approximately 3 cm
 <sup>2</sup> shaved using an electric shaver. Any residual hair was removed using a hair removal cream. Exactly 0.5 g of plant extract in 2 ml of 10% polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80) was applied to the cotton gauze, placed in contact with the animal’s skin and held in place with hypoallergenic tape. One rat was used as the control, to which 10% polysorbate 80 was applied. After 4 h, the test substance/control was removed. All animals were examined for signs of erythema and oedema, and the responses scored at 60 min, and then at 24, 48 and 72 h after removal of the test substance. The initial test was performed on one animal. If a corrosive effect was not observed in the initial test, the negative response was confirmed using two additional animals, each with one patch. The animals were observed for 14 days to record the occurrence and reversibility of any irritant/corrosive effects. They were then euthanized using CO
 <sub>2</sub>, placed in biohazard bags and incinerated.
