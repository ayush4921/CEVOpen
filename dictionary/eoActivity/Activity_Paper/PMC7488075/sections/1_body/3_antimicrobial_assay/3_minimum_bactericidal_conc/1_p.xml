<p id="Par38">The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assay adapted from Sánchez et al.
 <italic>,</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] was performed by subculturing the samples from each well of the MIC microtitre plates onto a fresh drug-free solid medium using sterile swabs. The petri dishes were then incubated overnight. Lack of visible growth was taken as an indication of the bactericidal ability at the particular concentration of the plant extract. From the results of the MBC and MIC assays, the MBC/MIC ratio was calculated to determine the bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties of active extracts recorded based on Konaté et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] where if the MBC/MIC ratio is ≤4.0, the test substance is considered bactericidal, and when the MBC/MIC ratio is &gt; 4.0 it is considered bacteriostatic.
