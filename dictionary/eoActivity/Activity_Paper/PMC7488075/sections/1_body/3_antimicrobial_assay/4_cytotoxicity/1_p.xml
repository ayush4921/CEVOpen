<p id="Par39">The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma, USA) assay reported by Radol et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of the plant extracts on Vero cell lines. The cells were cultured in T-75 cell culture flasks and incubated in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After a confluent cell sheet was achieved, it was dissociated using trypsin and the cells pooled in a 50 ml tube. MEM (40 ml) was added forming a cellular suspension of which a 100 μl of cell suspension containing 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells was seeded in 96-well microtiter plates. In row H, 150 μl of 100 μg/ml DMSO of the highest test sample concentration in duplicate, was pipetted. DMSO was used to solubilize the organic plant extracts. Serial dilutions were conducted by pipetting 50 μl from wells of row H and adding to wells of row G. Another 50 μl was transferred from row G to wells of row F up to row B discarding the last 50 μl of this row. A threefold dilution was performed from row H to B wells. Incubation was conducted for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> allowing the effect of the test sample on the cells to occur. Cells were observed under the inverted microscope. Into each well, 10 μl of MTT dye was added for the colorimetric determination of viable cells. Cells were further incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Media was removed from the wells and 100 μl of DMSO (Sigma) added to solubilize the formazan. Reading of the plates was performed on a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (Multiskan Ex labsystems) at 562 nm and 620 nm as reference. Doxorubicin (50 μg/ml highest drug concentration) was used as a positive control.
