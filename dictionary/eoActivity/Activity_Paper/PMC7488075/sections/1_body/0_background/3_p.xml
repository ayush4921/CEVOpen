<p id="Par26">Plants protect themselves from pathogens through the synthesis of secondary metabolites or bioactive molecules known as phytochemicals which exhibit antimicrobial properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Phytochemical studies on 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> have revealed that it contains terpenoids, flavonoids and terpenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bioactive compounds are produced by plants in small concentrations, the extraction method and solvents selected are crucial in the discovery of potential antimicrobial agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Phytochemical extraction depends on the polarity of the solvents used. A single solvent cannot therefore be expected to extract all the phytochemicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The use of methanol solvent has led to the extraction of the highest concentration of phenolics, terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Dichloromethane solvent is useful for the extraction of non-polar compounds while water extracts most of the polar compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the Lake Victoria Basin districts of Uganda, 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> fruits, stem bark and leaves are prepared for consumption using water through decoction, steaming or the leaves and fruits eaten raw for the treatment of toothache, malaria and syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study aqueous, methanol and methanol:dichloromethane (1:1) solvents will be utilized for extraction purposes to ensure the extraction of all the phytochemicals enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the antimicrobial properties against selected pathogens and a complete toxicological assessment of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic>.
