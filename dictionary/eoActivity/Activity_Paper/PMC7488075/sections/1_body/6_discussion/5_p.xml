 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The use of secondary metabolites isolated from medicinal plants in the development of drugs has helped in the fight against microbial infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, terpenoids, phenols, tannins and flavonoids were present in 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts while steroids and anthraquinones were not detected. Rayne &amp; Mazza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] also detected similar phytochemicals. Methanol extracts of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> demonstrated significant inhibitory and bacteriostatic activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> supporting its traditional use in the treatment of toothache. Further investigations on the cause of delayed hair re-growth after application of the 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> methanol extracts need to be conducted. The modern use of antibacterial agents with harmful side effects has resulted in a significant need for the development of alternatives which are safe and cost-effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The use of medicinal plants in drug production is preferable as they are biodegradable, affordable to produce and readily available [
