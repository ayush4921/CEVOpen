<p id="Par62">In cytotoxicity testing, MeOH:DCM extracts of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> exhibited marginal inhibition of proliferation against Vero cells while the methanol extracts supported cellular proliferation. Application of a single oral dose of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> up to 2000â€‰mg/kg resulted in no observable adverse effects in the test subjects. Further, no manifestations of toxicity were detected during gross pathology. As far as we know, there are no previous studies on the acute toxicity testing of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts in mice. The observations from this study, in addition to the history of traditional use are an indication of the safety of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic>. Moreover, dermal application of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> (SB) methanol extracts resulted in mild erythema and scaling. Reversibility of the skin reactions was achieved by the 8th day of the study. Dermal application of the extract additionally resulted in a slower rate of hair regrowth. Similarly, there are no prior reports on the dermal safety of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> in laboratory animals.
