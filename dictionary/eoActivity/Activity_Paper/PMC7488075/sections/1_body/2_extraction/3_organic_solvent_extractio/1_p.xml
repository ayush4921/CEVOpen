<p id="Par35">The ground plant material (100 g) was soaked in 300 ml of the solvent (methanol; methanol:dichloromethane (1:1)) for 72 h then and agitated periodically. The mixture was filtered twice using Whatman® No. 1 filter paper. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Büchi Rota vapor R-114). A temperature of 60 °C and 55 °C was applied for the methanol and methanol:dichloromethane extracts respectively. Residual solvent was removed by leaving the extracts in the open. The organic extracts were stored in glass vials at 4 °C.</p>
