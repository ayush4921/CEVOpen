<p id="Par51">In antimicrobial screening, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20.0. The means and the standard deviations were derived from the zones of inhibition to determine statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). In cytotoxicity testing, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Percentage cell viability was derived from absorbance readings in MS Excel data sheets and used to calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) using dose-response curves. Statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) was established through the comparison of the percentage cell viability after exposure of the cells to the extracts and the standard reference drug. In acute dermal corrosion testing, photographs were taken to document hair growth rate and any skin reactions. In acute toxicity testing, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were calculated using IBM SPSS statistics 20.0. Comparisons were made between the sample mean weights and control mean weights to establish statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).
