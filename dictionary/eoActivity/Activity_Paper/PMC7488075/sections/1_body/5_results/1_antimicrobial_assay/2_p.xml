 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> methanol extracts showed inhibitory and bactericidal activity against MRSA (0.391 mg/ml and 1.563 mg/ml),

 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (1.563 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml) with MIC and MBC values, respectively. The MeOH:DCM extracts also demonstrated antibacterial properties against MRSA (1.563 mg/ml, 3.125 mg/ml), 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (3.125 mg/ml, 12.5 mg/ml) and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (25 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml) with MIC and MBC values, respectively. Gentamicin, the positive control, also demonstrated antibacterial properties against MRSA (0.027 mg/ml, 0.055 mg/ml), 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (&lt; 0.014 mg/ml, 0.109 mg/ml) and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (0.007 mg/l, 0.027 mg/ml) with MIC and MBC values, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). According to Konate et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], if the MBC/MIC ratio is ≤4.0, the substance is considered bactericidal, and if the MBC/MIC ratio is &gt; 4.0, the test substance is considered to be bacteriostatic. Based on the MBC/MIC ratio (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), it was established that the 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> methanol extracts were bactericidal against MRSA and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> methanol extracts were bacteriostatic against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The MeOH:DCM stem bark extracts were bactericidal against MRSA, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> while gentamicin, the positive control, was bactericidal against MRSA and
