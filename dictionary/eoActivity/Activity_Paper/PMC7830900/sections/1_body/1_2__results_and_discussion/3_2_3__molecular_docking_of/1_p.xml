<p>CSE 
 <bold>9</bold> was docked with α-glucosidase to determine its binding modes and interactions. Since the protein structure of yeast α-glucosidase is unavailable, a homology model was built using yeast isomaltase (PDB ID 3A4A). The site of docking, as well as the amino acid residues that interact with the CSE 
 <bold>9</bold>, are presented in the binding modes and the Ligand Interaction Diagrams (LIDs) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 has three π-π stacking interactions with the amino acid residues, PHE178, ARG442, and TYR72. This corroborates with the increased inhibition observed in the in vitro results with the incorporation of the cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The cinnamoyl moieties at O-3′ and O-6′ interact with HIS280 and PHE314, respectively, through π-π stacking interactions. The cinnamoyl moiety at O-6′ also forms a salt bridge with LYS156 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f004">Figure 4</xref>). We hypothesize that the high inhibition value of CSE 
 <bold>9</bold> at 74 ± 9% is attributed to multiple π-π interactions, projection of the cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 (depicted in yellow 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f004">Figure 4</xref>) into the active site of the enzyme, and stabilization of its conformation facilitated by the other moieties at O-3′, O-4′ and O-6′. Unlike the cases of FSEs, though the number of hydrogen bonds that CSE 
 <bold>9</bold> forms is limited due to a lack of aromatic OH groups, π-π interaction, and other hydrophobic interactions make up for this to give high inhibition of α-glucosidase [
