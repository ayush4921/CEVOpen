<p>CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> were chosen since CSE 
 <bold>5</bold> has a restricted configuration due to the bridging of the glucose and fructose moieties by the diisopropylidene rings while CSE 
 <bold>9</bold> is more flexible. Binding mode pictures and the Ligand Interaction diagrams of CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f006">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f007">Figure 7</xref>, respectively. Both CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> docked in a similar region around amino acid residues 50–63; 145–151; 197–200; 233–240; and 300–306 (depicted in red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f007">Figure 7</xref>). From the LID of CSE 
 <bold>5</bold>, the cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 is involved in π-π stacking interactions with HIE 305 and TRP 58. This highlights the importance of the cinnamoyl at O-3 for inhibition of α-amylase. CSE 
 <bold>9,</bold> which has greater conformational flexibility, has greater interactions with the enzyme. Hence, the cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 forms a hydrogen bond with TYR 151, and the cinnamoyl at O-3′ shows π-π stacking with TYR 151. The cinnamoyl moiety at O-6′ shows π-π stacking with HIE 305, and OH-2′ forms a hydrogen bond with GLY 306. The high inhibition of CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> could be attributed to multiple π-π interactions and favorable projection of the cinnamoyl moiety at O-3 in the active site of the enzyme. It is noted that these compounds show similar interactions to the FSEs except they lack phenolic OH bonding with the residues.
