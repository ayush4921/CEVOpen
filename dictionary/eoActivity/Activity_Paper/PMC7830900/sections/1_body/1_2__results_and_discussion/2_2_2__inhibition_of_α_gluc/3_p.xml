<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> were calculated for α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition. In the case of α-glucosidase, both CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> showed similar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 9 ± 3 μM, which is over 36-fold lower than acarbose at 328 ± 7 μM making them much more potent inhibitors than acarbose (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00469-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the case of α-amylase, CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1 ± 0.2 μM and 0.8 ± 0.1 μM, respectively, which are five-fold less than the value for acarbose 5 ± 0.1 μM (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00469-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Unlike acarbose, which is far more potent inhibitor of α-amylase than α-glucosidase, CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> displayed potent inhibition of both the enzymes.
