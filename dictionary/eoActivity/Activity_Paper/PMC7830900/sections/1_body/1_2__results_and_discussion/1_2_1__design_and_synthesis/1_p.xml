<p>The inhibition activities of α-glucosidase and α-amylase using natural PSEs [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] depended on the structural features of these compounds. Therefore, CSEs 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> were specifically designed to differ in: (i) the number of cinnamoyl moieties, (ii) the degree of acetylation of the sucrose core, and (iii) the presence or absence of the diisopropylidene bridges on sucrose core (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These bridges control the degree of flexibility between the glucose and fructose moieties of the sucrose core. CSEs 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> were also designed to complement and compare with our inhibition studies using a small library of FSEs such as 
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f002">Figure 2</xref>). CSEs 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> were synthesized by cinnamoylation of 2,1′:4,6-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-isopropylidene sucrose with cinnamoyl chlorides in dry pyridine according to our previous work (

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Acetylation of the cinnamoylated compounds was then achieved using acetic anhydride to give the acetylated CSEs [
