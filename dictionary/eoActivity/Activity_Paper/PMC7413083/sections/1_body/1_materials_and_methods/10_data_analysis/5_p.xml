<p>The 
 <italic>p</italic> value for each test was calculated by testing the null hypothesis of independence between the genus/family variables and the utilitarian equivalence. The same approach was used to test the relationship between genus/family variables and utilitarian redundancy. The odds ratio calculations were performed by the oddsratio function of the fmsb package available in the statistical program R, version 3.2.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). For the processed tests, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered.
