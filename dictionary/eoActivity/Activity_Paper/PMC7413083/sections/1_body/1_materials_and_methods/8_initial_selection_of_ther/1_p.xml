<p>This study considered only the therapeutic indications cited by two or more people in a given region. For example, if the plant “A” of the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest was assigned only “analgesic” and “cancer treatment” uses and this information was cited by a single informant, this information was disregarded and consequently plant A was excluded from the analyzes. Similarly, if in a given region none of the information on how to treat a particular disease was shared by two or more informants, the disease was excluded from the study. This procedure was designed to prevent idiosyncratic information from biasing results and conclusions.</p>
