<p>We chose to compare different ecosystems because we intended to evaluate if, even under completely different social-ecological conditions, some taxonomic patterns on plant use could emerge. Therefore, these communities may not be seen as replicates, but rather as case-studies. Additionally, our choice for including more than one community in a single region was also not related to the production of replicates. We did not compare neighboring communities, as our intention was to consider them as a continuum. Thus, we adopted a meta-community approach, since, for both cases, we chose neighboring communities.</p>
