<p>Within the purpose to verify if certain use behaviors persist even between areas with different floristic compositions and social-ecological contexts, also minimizing the probability of results being skewed by knowledge transmission, it was decided to test the utilitarian equivalence model among communities inserted in two areas from different ecosystems and essentially distinct and distant from each other. In this sense, the study was conducted in four rural communities, two neighboring communities in an area in a tropical rainforest (TR), in a hot and humid climate region, and two neighboring communities in a seasonally dry tropical forest area (SDTF), in a hot and dry climate region with semi-arid regime, all located in the Northeast of Brazil.</p>
