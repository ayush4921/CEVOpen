<p>Another way to approach the influence of taxonomic affiliation on the utilitarian redundancy scenario is that the local population of each region studied may be selecting medicinal plants based on certain cultural traits and local perceptions of their own. Knowing that plants of the same family tend to share the same classes of chemical compounds (
