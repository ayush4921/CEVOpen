<p>If, on the one hand, the chemical efficacy provided by the chemical repertoire of each botanical family can explain the utilitarian equivalence among taxonomically close plants, this does not exclude the possibility that, processes of knowledge transmission among peoples of different regions may have contributed to the formation of the observed scenario. If we consider that 14 out of the 64 species analyzed are not native to Brazil (12 in the FTSS and 5 in the FTU), with most of these exotic species coming from the Old World, it is probable that the diffusion of knowledge of use is among the factors underlying the incorporation of these plants into local medical systems.</p>
