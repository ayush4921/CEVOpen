<p>Additionally, communities placed in the semi-arid region are established on the region longer than the TR populations, which may also have influenced the results (e.g., perhaps longer living in contact with the environment favored greater medical knowledge on native flora to treat a larger set of diseases, which could contribute to a more significant number of equivalent pairs). Therefore, we propose that future studies on utilitarian equivalence include TR communities with longer histories in the region.</p>
