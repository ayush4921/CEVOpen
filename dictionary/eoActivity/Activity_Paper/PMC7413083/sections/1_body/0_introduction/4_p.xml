<p>The Local Medical Systems of different peoples around the world have dynamics and structures that, directly or indirectly, reflect the different cultural traits of a given human population (

However, there is also evidence that two distinct human cultures, living far apart but inserted in similar environments, tend to select medicinal plants in a similar way, as there would be a strong positive correlation between the medicinal flora and the floristic environment (
