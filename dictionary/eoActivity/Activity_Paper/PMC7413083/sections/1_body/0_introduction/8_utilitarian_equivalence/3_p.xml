<p>Our model is based on the assumptions that: (a) utilitarian equivalence, understood as the high overlap of use between two species in distinct socioecological systems, is relative and not absolute, since, in the absence of intrinsically identical plant species or culturally equal peoples, the medicinal uses are not necessarily identical, but rather similar; (b) equivalence is due to two groups of complementary variables, cultural traits and environmental factors; (c) the evolutionary events that led to utilitarian equivalence may be associated with the similarity between intrinsic characteristics of useful species.</p>
