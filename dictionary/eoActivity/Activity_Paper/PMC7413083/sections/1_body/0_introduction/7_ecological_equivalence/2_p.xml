<p>For 
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum (1971)</xref>, distinct biogeographic regions presuppose “species composition of quite different communities”. Where there are physically similar habitats, similar ecosystems develop (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum, 1971</xref>). Thus, “functional niches are occupied by equivalent biological groups, regardless of the composition of the fauna and flora of the region” (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum, 1971</xref>). From this perspective, we can consider, for example, that a prairie ecosystem will occur in any region of the world that has a prairie-friendly climate, with local native species being organized to occupy available niches (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum, 1971</xref>).
