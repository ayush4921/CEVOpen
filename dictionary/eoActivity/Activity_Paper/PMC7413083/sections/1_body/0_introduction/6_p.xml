<p>One of the most interesting models to understand how environmental and cultural aspects can guide local systems is the study of the therapeutic use of plants in various human groups (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Medeiros, Ladio &amp; Albuquerque, 2015</xref>), considering that, if certain use behaviors persist even among areas that suffer different environmental pressures, these can be a pattern of behavior. Although the present study follows a similar approach to those discussed above, it is proposed to use the concept of utilitarian equivalence, a new framework, based on
