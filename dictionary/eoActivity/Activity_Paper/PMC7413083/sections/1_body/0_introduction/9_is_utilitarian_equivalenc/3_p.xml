<p>In the case of utilitarian equivalence, it can be used in the search for environmental or cultural selection criteria. Therefore, taxonomy is only one possible driver of utilitarian equivalence, but other aspects such as a plantâ€™s habit, flavor or availability may play important roles in such process. Furthermore, since our concept does not require independence of the studied human populations, any taxonomic patterns found may be due to (1) shared chemical characteristics of closely related plants, or (2) cultural diffusion leading to attribution of similar uses to closely related plants because of their morphological similarity.</p>
