<p>Here, both utilitarian equivalence and utilitarian redundancy have been taxonomically influenced, possibly due to the chemical similarities that taxonomically close plants tend to possess and due to cultural traits that modulate plant selection and the transmission of knowledge. However, the central element behind the taxonomic influence seems to be the therapeutic efficacy, that is, the success of the plant in curing a particular disease, which in turn is strongly related to the repertoire of chemical compounds of the species. In addition, the utilitarian equivalence approach between local medical systems of dry forests and wetlands has shown that even among communities that are subject to characteristic climates and distinct native floras, there are similar adaptive responses. In this sense, the mechanisms of selection of medicinal plants involve certain behaviors and perceptions common to different peoples. Regarding the choice of plants for pharmacological studies, our findings indicate the feasibility of using a chemosystematic approach, that is, selection of plants phylogenetically close to the species with previously proven pharmacological activity.</p>
