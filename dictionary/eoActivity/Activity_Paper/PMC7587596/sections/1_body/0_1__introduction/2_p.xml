<p>Noble nanomaterials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), offer attractive and unique optical properties, such as surface plasmon resonance, which can be used for different detection and therapeutic applications. Several AuNPs have been utilized to improve dressings for the treatment of skin wounds [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A key issue to be resolved before a nanoparticle can be integrated within a biological molecule is its surface chemistry, which determines its stability, functionality, and possible applications [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to the strong surface reactivity of free electrons, uncoated AuNPs are sensitive to pH, temperature, electrolyte levels, and solvents, and also tend to aggregate when used in such media [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To address this issue, various ligand protected AuNPs have been synthesized. Protective species, usually in the form of amine chemical groups, are typically added mostly during synthesis to obtain stable colloids.
