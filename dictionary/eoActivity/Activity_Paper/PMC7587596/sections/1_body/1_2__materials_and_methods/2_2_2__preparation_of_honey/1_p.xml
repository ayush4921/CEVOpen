<p>Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation of TPP with chitosan as reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, chitosan powder (5 mg) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid and double-distilled water (DDW) (

 <italic>v</italic> = 1:3) at room temperature with continuous stirring for 8 h using a magnetic stirrer. After a clear chitosan solution was obtained. Moreover, 2 mg/mL TPP was dissolved in deionized distilled water separately. Afterward, 20 mL of TPP solution was added dropwise into 50 mL of chitosan solution at ambient temperature with continuous stirring at a speed of 800 rpm. Thereafter, 30 g of honey was diluted in 40 mL of DDW, and the resultant solution was added to the chitosan/TPP suspension.
