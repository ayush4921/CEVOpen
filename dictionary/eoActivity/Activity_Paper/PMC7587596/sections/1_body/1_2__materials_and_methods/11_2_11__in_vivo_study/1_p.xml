<p>Thirty white New Zealand rabbits (2.5 kg/animal) were used as models to study the in vivo wound-healing process. The animals were housed in cages with dimensions of 140 cm × 120 cm × 90 cm under a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle at 25 ± 2 °C and 65% relative humidity with standard granulated food and water available ad libitum. All procedures were performed following the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 86–23, revised in 1996) and were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee at Biotechnology Division, Applied Sciences Department, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
