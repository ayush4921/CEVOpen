<p>Morphological characterizations of the prepared HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were estimated and observed via field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Supra 35 VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The diameters of the nanofibers were evaluated using the ImageJ software (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA). One hundred fibers from each fabricated nanofibrous mat were measured in three images, and the average size was estimated.</p>
