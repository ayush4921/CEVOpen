<p>The electrospinning setup consists of a syringe pump (PHD 200 Infusion, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA), stainless-steel spinneret needle (21 G × 1.5, Lexington, KY 40505, USA), high-voltage power supply (14-20000, FuG Electronik GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 10 cm × 10 cm collector, and 2 mL syringe. The distance between the needle and the collector was kept at 20 cm, and an applied voltage of 25 kV was used. Flow rates for all suspensions were set to 0.4 mL/h. All acquired nanofibrous mats were produced for 4 h. Due to the presence of capsaicin in the HTCs and HTCs-AuNP suspensions, electrospinning parameters were changed to a voltage of 28 kV and a flow rate of 0.7 mL/h. Due to the difficulty of electrospinning the suspensions, a distance of 15 cm was maintained between the collector and the needle.</p>
