<p>The HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag dressings were used on a sectional-1 cm wound created on the upper back of the rabbit samples. Wound images were collected on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 to study the changes in wound volume (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the wounds with HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP dressings decreased in size by day 3 compared with the negative control wounds. A significant decrease in wound size was obtained in all the examined dressings in addition to Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag, compared with that in the negative control on days 5 and 7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, all prepared nanofibrous dressings stuck easily to the wounds without the need for a biological adhesive. This performance was probably due to the hydrophilic properties of the TTP, chitosan, and honey and the remarkable water solubility of honey. The dressings, therefore, produced an eligible hydrated situation for the wounds. However, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows that all the developed nanofibrous dressings had a vigorous wound-healing ability. The results demonstrate a remarkable rapid tissue-repairing ability in all the developed nanofibrous dressings. Wound healing was noticeably increased with HTCs nanofibrous mats after the addition of capsaicin to HTCs-capsaicin mats. Wound healing was also enhanced after enriching HTCs with AuNPs but at a lower level than that of HTCs-capsaicin. The HTCs enriched with capsaicin and AuNPs produced superior wound-healing rates compared with HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-AuNP dressings (

However, unlike our results, the suspension they obtained was unable to achieve full wound closure after 10 days [

HTCs enriched with capsaicin and AuNPs separately and in combination achieved an increase in wound-closure effect compared with the commercial Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag. In summary, the novel nanofibrous wound dressings exhibit faster and more efficacious wound-healing abilities compared with many other nanofibrous types of wound dressings. An overview of the key features of the inherent properties of chitosan, its modification, and its use in biomedical engineering, particularly toward anti-inflammatory effects and wound-healing, has been published [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> but weak antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The developed HP-chitosan nanofibers showed no cytotoxic effects on cultured fibroblasts [
