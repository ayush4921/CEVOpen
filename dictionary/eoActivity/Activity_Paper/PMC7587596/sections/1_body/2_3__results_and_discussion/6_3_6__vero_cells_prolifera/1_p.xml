<p>A cell proliferation study was performed using the treatment of the Vero cells on the HTCs, HTCs- capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibers and Aquacel
 <sup>速</sup> Ag for 24 and 72 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and an MTT assay. The proliferation values of the HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibrous mats increased with culture time. HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were associated with the most significant increase in proliferation (

 <sup>速</sup> Ag showed a remarkable cytotoxic effect on cell proliferation, as indicated by its low OD value (

 <sup>速</sup> Ag (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f003">Figure 3</xref>). All nanofibrous mats show increased cell viability and proliferation compared with Aquacel
 <sup>速</sup> Ag (

Previous studies presented various nanofiber dressing mats with no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells, but herein, the developed nanofibrous dressing mats, in addition to its biocompatibility properties, produce a proliferative effect [

Chitosan caused the prompt emigration of the polymorph nuclear and mononuclear cells and subsequently degraded into its low-molecular-weight oligomers and monomers. This process led to cell migration and indirectly increased cell proliferation in vivo. Capsaicin reportedly induces osmotic stress and promotes key genes associated with cell-membrane biosynthesis [
