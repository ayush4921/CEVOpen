<p>Resistant bacterial strains is the major challenge affecting chronic non-healing wounds. Evaluation of the antibacterial efficiency confirmed that HTCs nanofibrous mats exhibited slight antibacterial efficiency against all bacterial strains used in this study. HTCs mats showed the same antibacterial efficacy as that of difloxacin antibiotics. To improve antibacterial efficacy, capsaicin and AuNPs and a combination of the two enriched HTCs nanofibers and the products were evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy against 
 <italic>P. multocida, K. rhinoscleromatis, S. pyogenes,</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic>. The antibacterial effect of difloxacin and chloramphenicol antibiotics was estimated and compared with that of the designed nanofiber mats. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the antibacterial efficiency of the developed HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibrous mats against that of difloxacin and chloramphenicol, which served as the positive control. The HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-AuNP nanofibrous mats exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy against 
 <italic>P. multocida and K. rhinoscleromatis</italic>. HTC-capsaicin/AuNP mats were the most effective against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Such superior performance is mainly due to the enrichment of HTCs with capsaicin and AuNPs. The results also reveal the antibacterial activity of HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats against all used bacterial strains. Moreover, a lower antibacterial effect of HTC-AuNP mats against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes,</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> were observed in comparison with that of HTC-capsaicin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f002">Figure 2</xref>). HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP and HTCs-AuNP mats exhibited the same antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>K. rhinoscleromatis</italic>.
