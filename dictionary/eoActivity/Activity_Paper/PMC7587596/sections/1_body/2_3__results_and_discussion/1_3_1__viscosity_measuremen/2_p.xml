<p>In this study, HTCs-based dressings were developed. The antibacterial activity of a developed dressing alone is reportedly insufficient for a complete wound-healing process. Other elements are required to increase the wound-healing percentage [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04770-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, HTCs suspension enriched with capsaicin and AuNPs resulted in a noticeable reduction in viscosity. The AuNPs, therefore, had a stronger effect on the decrease in viscosity compared with capsaicin. A decrease in the viscosity of HTC-capsaicin/AuNPs mats in contrast to HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-AuNP mats could enhance the antibacterial effect [
