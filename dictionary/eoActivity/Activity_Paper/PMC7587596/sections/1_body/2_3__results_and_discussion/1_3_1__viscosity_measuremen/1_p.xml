<p>The viscosity of the HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP blend suspensions was evaluated immediately after preparation (nearly 2 h after preparation) and after one week of aging (168 h after preparation). As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04770-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the electrospun HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibers resulted in significantly higher viscosities immediately after preparation compared with that observed after aging for a week at room temperature. The viscosity was lower after adding capsaicin, AuNPs, and capsaicin/AuNPs to HTCs. The viscosity of HTCs-capsaicin/AuNPs was lower than that of the other three blend suspensions.
