 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Fasted mice were treated with the vehicle, glibenclamide, and the three different doses of the latex according to their groups. After thirty minutes, oral glucose solution (40%) at the dose of 2 g/kg was given to the mice. Then, blood was withdrawn from the tail vein of each mouse to determine the glucose level at 0 h (before glucose administration) and at 0.5, 1, and 2 h after glucose administration [
