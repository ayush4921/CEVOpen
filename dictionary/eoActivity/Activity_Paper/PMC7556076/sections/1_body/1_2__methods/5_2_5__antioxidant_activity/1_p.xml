<p>Antioxidant capacity of the latex was evaluated in DPPH assay as described in the literature with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Three milliliters of 0.1 mM (4 mg/100 ml solution) was mixed with one milliliter of methanolic solution of different concentrations (25–800 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of the latex. Ascorbic acid with the same concentration was served as the positive control, and 4 ml solution of the free radical (DPPH) without the latex was used as the vehicle control. After 30-minute incubation, the absorbance of test solutions and the control were read at 517 nm via a UV spectrophotometer. Percentage was calculated by the following formula:
