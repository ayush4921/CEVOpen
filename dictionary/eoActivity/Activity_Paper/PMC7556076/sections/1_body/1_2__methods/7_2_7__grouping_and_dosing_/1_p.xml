<p>Male mice were used in the normoglycemic, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic model since female mice have low survival, insensitive to STZ and insulin [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In normoglycemic and OGTT, mice were randomly divided into five groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Groups 1 and 2 (negative and positive control) were treated with 10 mg/kg vehicle (2% tween 80 in distilled water) and 5 mg/kg glibenclamide (Julphar), respectively; groups 3, 4, and 5 were given 200,400, and 600 mg/kg of the leaf latex. In the STZ-induced diabetic model, mice were randomly divided into six groups (5 diabetic groups and 1 nondiabetic group,

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Groups 1 and 2 (normal and diabetic control) were given the vehicle, and group 3 was treated with standard drug. Groups 4, 5, and 6 (diabetic test groups) were treated with 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg of the leaf latex.
