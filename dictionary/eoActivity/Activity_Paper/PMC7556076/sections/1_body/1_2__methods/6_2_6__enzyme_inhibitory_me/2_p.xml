<p>The sucrase and maltase inhibitory assays of the leaf latex were determined by the glucose oxidase method [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Acetone solution (100 mg in 3 ml normal saline) was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for thirty minutes. A volume of 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>l sucrase and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l maltase solutions was incubated in 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>l sucrose (400 mM) and 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>l maltose (86 mM) solutions, respectively. Ten 
 <italic>μ</italic>l latex solution (15.6–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and then 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 6.9) were added to maintain the 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l final volume and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Then, the mixtures were suspended in boiling water for ten minutes to cease the reaction. The absorbance of glucose which was released from the reaction was read at 450 nm by the glucose oxidase method. Sucrase and maltase inhibitory activities were represented as % inhibition:
