<p>In this study, the leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> showed concentration-dependent antioxidant activity in DPPH assay. This finding is concordat with free radical scavenging activities of the latex of 
 <italic>Aloe schelpei, Aloe megalacantha</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aloe monticola</italic> in DPPH assay [

 <italic>κ</italic>B), necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), and interleukins (ILs) which reduces the expression of GLUT 4 and activates intracellular adhesion molecule-1 to stimulate the growth of insulin resistance [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, preventing oxidative stress might be one approach to reduce onset of diabetes and its complications [
