<p>The low dose of (200 mg/kg) the latex significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) induced hypoglycemia after 4 h, but did not sustain the effect for 6 h possibly due to early elimination from body. The medium and high doses of the latex brought significant hypoglycemia after 4 h and 6 h in the normoglycemic model. Hypoglycemic effect of glibenclamide was significant after 2, 4, and 6 h. This indicated that the leaf latex and glibenclamide changed blood glucose level though the same mechanism of action (increased insulin release or insulin-like effect). This finding is concordant with significant hypoglycemic effect of the leaf gel of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> and the latex of 
 <italic>A. megalacantha</italic> in the normoglycemic model [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Aloe species contain poly and monosaccharides that play blood glucose reduction by increasing insulin level, and hence, the plants show hypoglycemic activities [
