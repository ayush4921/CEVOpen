<p>Induction of diabetes by streptozotocin significantly elevated total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) while decreasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) compared to normal control. After two weeks of intervention with the leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima,</italic> the lipid level of diabetic mice was significantly improved compared to diabetic control. All doses of the latex significantly reduced the levels of TC and TG, and increased the level of HDL-C. Thus, the latex of 
 <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic> might serve as the potential candidate in the treatment of hyperglycemia induced dyslipidemia. The current result is in line with antidyslipidemic activity of the leaf of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> and 
 <italic>Aloe megalacantha</italic> in STZ diabetic rodents [
