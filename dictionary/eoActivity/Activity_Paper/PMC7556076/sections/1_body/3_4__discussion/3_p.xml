<p>The leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> showed sucrase, maltase, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory effects. Enzyme inhibition capacity of the latex was concentration dependent, and greater inhibition was observed on sucrase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.92 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) relative to maltase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.81 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.92 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) enzymes. This result is in line with concentration dependent 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory effect of the leaf latex and isolated compounds of 
 <italic>Aloe megalacantha</italic> and 
 <italic>Aloe monticola</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The successful prevention or control of postprandial hyperglycemia is through inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] since these enzymes facilitate carbohydrate digestion and absorption. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Glucosidase is the most important enzyme for digestion and absorption of starch and sucrose [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Modern 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitors have limited efficacy and induces deleterious effects [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, plant-derived bioactive molecules may serve as novel alternatives in postprandial glycemic control.
