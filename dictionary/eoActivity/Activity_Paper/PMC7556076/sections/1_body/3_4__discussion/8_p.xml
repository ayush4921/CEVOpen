<p>In this study, significant BW increment was measured in diabetic mice treated with all doses of the leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> and glibenclamide in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Compared to diabetic control, BW of the mice treated with all doses of the latex remarkably increased on week one and two. The study result indicated that the latex was endowed with preventive effect against diabetic-induced body weight loss.
