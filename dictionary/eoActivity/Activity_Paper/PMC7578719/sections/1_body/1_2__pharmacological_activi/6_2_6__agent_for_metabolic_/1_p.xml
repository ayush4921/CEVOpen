<p>Ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. demonstrates antidiarrhoea and antidiabetic activities in albino rats [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The water extract also showed activity as hypoglycemic in diabetic rats induced by normoglycemic and streptozotocin [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other studies also investigated the antidiabetic activity of the leaves water extract by exhibiting a positive effect on hypoglycemic activities [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The extract of goat weed has a hypoglycemic effect which is significantly comparable to glibenclamide [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Another study also reported that 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. demonstrates both hypoglycemic as well as hypolipidemic effects in rats [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].
