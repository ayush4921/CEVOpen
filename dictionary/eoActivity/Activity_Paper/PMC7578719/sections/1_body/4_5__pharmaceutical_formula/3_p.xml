<p>The success of EC formulation is developed from the aerial part making further formulation from this herb to be designed in a pharmaceutical gel dosage form. This dosage form then tested its activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>. In this work, 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> was extracted using the maceration method in ethanol 90%. The antibacterial activity was determined using the disc paper diffusion method, whereas the 
 <italic>minimum inhibitory concentration</italic> (MIC) and 
 <italic>minimum bactericidal concentration</italic> (MBC) were determined using the microdilution method. The extract was formulated into the gel basis containing various concentrations of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). The result showed that the dosage form performed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> with a MIC value of 2.5%. The best result was performed by the formula containing 4% of the sodium CMC and 2.5% of the extract. The antibacterial activity of the gel was able to inhibit 14.7 ± 2.3 mm and 15.43 ± 1.6 mm in the zone of the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, respectively [
