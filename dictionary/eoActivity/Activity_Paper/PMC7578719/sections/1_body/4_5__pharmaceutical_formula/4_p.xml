<p>A study related to the gel formulation was also developed by Taufid and Ameilia. In this study, the extract was prepared by macerating 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. using ethanol 96%. The gel was composed of sodium CMC as the bases using three different extract concentrations, i.e., 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5%, accordingly. The physical quality of the gel was evaluated employing physical appearance, homogeneity, pH, and its dispersion force. The gel met the requirement as a good dosage form, in particular with its dispersion force within 3–5 cm [
