 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> tabulates the molecular docking results performing binding energy of seven ligands identified in 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> in which the lower energy (more negative) is the stronger binding with the respected protein. In human tyrosinase (5m8s), the chromene compound class (precocene I, precocene II, and VMDC) has better interactions than other compounds, whereas the sterol compound class predominates the better interactions with ornithine delta-aminotransferase than chromene, flavonoid, and alkaloid. In cyclooxygenase-2, either sterol of flavonoid has a better interaction than others, whereas flavonoid is the best ligand to interact with 4-diphosphodicytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol synthase. In contrast, the chromene and alkaloids are even better in interacting with glycoside hydrolase than sterol and flavonoid. Compared with other proteins, all ligands have relatively poor interactions with the p53 gene, whereas the opportunity of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> as an MMP-9 inhibitor could be due to the presence of sterol and flavonoid than alkaloid and chromene.
