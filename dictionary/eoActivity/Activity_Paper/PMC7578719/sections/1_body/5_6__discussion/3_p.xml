<p>In the topical pharmaceutical formulation aspect, Ageratum combined with other herbals has been well applied. The choice in the topical route could be due to some reasons. First, this herb is most likely indicated as a wound-healing agent either in the common wound or burned, antimicrobe, and arthrosis, by a topical route, and the drug would be interacting faster with the target site via local effect. Second, the topical route is chosen according to the toxicological effect of the liver, kidneys, and blood cells after long-term exposure as confirmed by both

The gel formulation is suitable for its indication in burns healing process due to its water base preparation giving cool and comfortable feeling during application. Moreover, the water-based gel may easily be absorbed by the wound dissolving like an interface between the gel and the wound excretes.
