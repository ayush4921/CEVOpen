<p>Hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. could be toxic to the liver, kidneys, and blood cells after long-term exposure as confirmed by both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the use of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. in a longer duration should be carefully managed. This toxic effect could be due to the alkaloid total especially to pyrrolizidine. The hepatotoxic effect after oral administration of the leaves ethanolic extract has been shown in Wistar albino rats upon three regimen doses, i.e., 200, 400, and 600â€‰mg/kg of bodyweight within 21 days. The experiment shows that the total protein serum and liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) did not significantly change; therefore, it can be concluded that the extract is not toxic to the liver at those respective doses [
