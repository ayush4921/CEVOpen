<p>Herpes simplex viruses can cause cold sores (usually Herpes simplex virus type 1, HSV-1) or genital herpes (usually Herpes simplex virus type 2, HSV-2) and both can become chronic and recurrent infections sometimes resistant to antiviral drugs [

 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. RC-37 cells (monkey kidney cells) or the viruses were pre-treated with mānuka oil for one hour followed by inoculation. Pre-treatment of the virus with the oil significantly inhibited plaque formation in comparison to pre-treatment of the cells alone [
