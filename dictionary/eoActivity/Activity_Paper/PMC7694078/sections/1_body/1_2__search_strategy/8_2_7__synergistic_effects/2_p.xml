<p>Similar results highlighting the synergistic effects of mﾄ］uka oil were shown by Filoche (2005). The combined effect of chlorhexidine digluconate and a series of essential oils, including mﾄ］uka oil, found that mﾄ］uka oil inhibited the growth of two cariogenic bacteria, 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum,</italic> either as liquid cultures or as biofilms [

When mﾄ］uka oil and chlorhexidine were combined, the authors found an eight-fold reduction in the concentration of chlorhexidine required to achieve the same level of growth inhibition, suggesting the potential for novel anti-caries treatments [
