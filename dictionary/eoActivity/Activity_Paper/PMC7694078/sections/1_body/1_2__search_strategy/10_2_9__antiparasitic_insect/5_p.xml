<p>A study of the effects of essential oils on human scabies mites (
 <italic>Sarcoptes scabei</italic>) found mānuka oil to be moderately effective against the mites, with median lethal times of 30 min (± 7.5 min) after direct contact with a 10% manuka oil solution in paraffin oil. Vapor phase toxicity of mānuka oil was determined via fumigation assay, where mites were exposed to a filter paper treated with mānuka oil and mortality was checked every 5 min. Median lethal time for undiluted mānuka oil was 23 min (± 8.7 min) [
