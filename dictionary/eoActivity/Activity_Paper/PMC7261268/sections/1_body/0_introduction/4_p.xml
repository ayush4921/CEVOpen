<p id="Par5">Neither HLF3 nor HLF4 has been purified and functionally tested so far. Thus, the first aim of the present study was closing this gap. Furthermore, we wanted to elucidate the effects of alterations within the N-termini of HLF3 and HLF4 and finally investigate the effects of exchanges of the central globular domains on potential anti-coagulatory and thrombin-inhibitory activities of the respective synthetic HLF3 and HLF4 variants.</p>
