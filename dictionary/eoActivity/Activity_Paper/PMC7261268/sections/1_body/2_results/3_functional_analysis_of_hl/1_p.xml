<p id="Par15">Comparably to the HLF3 gene, the HLF4 gene may encode two different mRNAs/cDNAs as well. Whereas expression of the HLF4a mRNA could already be verified (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), attempts to detect the expression of a HLF4b mRNA failed so far, at least in leech salivary gland cells. A putative HLF4b protein comprises structural and biochemical features that resemble hirudins: a pI value of 4.46 and an acidic C-terminal tail. The N-terminus and the central globular domain, however, are distinct from those of HV1 and HLF1V (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition to HLF4b, we constructed a variant (HLF4c) that comprises the N-terminus of HLF1V. Subsequently, we tried to express, purify, and functionally test HLF4a, HLF4b, as well as HLF4c. For both HLF4a and HLF4c, the procedure turned out to be problematic due to the formation of inclusion bodies (HLF4a) or precipitation of the protein during dialysis (HLF4c). All factors were functionally tested at the highest possible concentrations of 3.2 μmol/l (HLF4b), 0.74 μmol/l (HLF4c), or 0.32 μmol/l (HLF4a). HLF4b and HLF4c (data not shown) did not exhibited anti-thrombin activity, whereas HLF4a had a weak thrombin-inhibitory potency (Fig.
