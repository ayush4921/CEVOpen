<p id="Par20">However, the exact composition of the N- and C-termini matters as well. The N-terminus of HLF1V (IVYGP) works well (HLF1V has thrombin-inhibitory potency which is almost as high as those of the hirudin variants HV1 and HV2; Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>), but the N-termini of HLF2 (IVFRP) or HLF3 (IVFKP) seem to work even better: the hybrid variants comprising the N-terminus of HLF1V (HLF-Hyb2a, HLF-Hyb3c and HLF-Hyb4b) consistently have lower inhibitory potencies compared to the otherwise identical hybrid variants comprising the N-termini of HLF2 or HLF3 (HLF-Hyb2b, HLF-Hyb3b, and HLF-Hyb4c). One might speculate that a variant of HLF1 comprising the N-terminus of HLF2 or HLF3 would be kind of a “super inhibitor” for thrombin.
