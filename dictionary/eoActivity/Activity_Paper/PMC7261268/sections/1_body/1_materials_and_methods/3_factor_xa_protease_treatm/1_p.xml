<p id="Par9">The treatment of fusion proteins containing the factor Xa protease recognition sequence consisted of three steps: (1) factor Xa protease cleavage, (2) removal of factor Xa protease, and (3) clean up of the digested protein. All steps were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purity of recombinant hirudins and HLFs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE on 20% gels. Molar concentrations of protein solutions were calculated by dividing the absorbance at 280 nm by the molar absorption coefficient according to the equation
