<p id="Par6">The biological material used in this study (specimen of 
 <italic>Hirudo medicinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Hirudo verbana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hirudo orientalis</italic> and salivary gland preparations) was already described by MÃ¼ller et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref> and 2017). Species identity was confirmed by visual inspection (body coloration pattern) and molecular genotyping. In detail, partial sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) as chromosomal marker and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (
 <italic>coiI</italic>) as mitochondrial marker, respectively, were determined and compared with database entries. All sequences were deposited in GenBank and obtained the accession numbers KR066919-KR066923 and KR066924-KR066928 (
 <italic>Hirudo medicinalis</italic>), KX215696-KX215698 and KX215704-KX215706 (
 <italic>Hirudo verbana</italic>), and KX215699-KX215701 and KX215707-KX215709 (
 <italic>Hirudo orientalis</italic>), respectively.
