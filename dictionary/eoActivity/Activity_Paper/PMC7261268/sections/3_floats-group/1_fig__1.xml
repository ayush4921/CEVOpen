  <p>Multiple sequence alignment of hirudin variant HV1 of 
   <italic>H. medicinalis</italic> and HLF variants HLF1V, HLF2, HLF3l, HLF3s, HLF4a, and HLF4b. The alignments were generated using the CLS Sequence Viewer software package v8.0 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Black background indicates conserved residues; gray background indicates similar residues. The six conserved cysteine residues giving rise to the three-dimensional structure are marked in bold, acidic amino acid residues are marked in red, and basic amino acid residues are marked in blue. The PKP and DFxxIP motifs are boxed. Abbreviations are used according to the IUPAC code
