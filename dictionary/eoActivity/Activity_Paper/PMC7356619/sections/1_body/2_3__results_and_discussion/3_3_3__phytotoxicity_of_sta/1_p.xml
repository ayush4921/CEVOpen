<p>In this experiment, the specific activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined based on the concentration of crude extract or pure compound and per cent inhibition of plant growth elongation. The fruit of star anise was chosen as the candidate species since it showed the highest growth inhibitory effect on lettuce radicle elongation. The seeds of lettuce (
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L.) were used for the bioassay test plant. Other weed and crop species including red clover, white clover, alfalfa, and bird’s-foot trefoil seeds were also used in this bioassay. Shikimic acid has been reported to be the main compound in the fruit of star anise. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported significant variation among samples from the different areas, with the shikimic acid content ranging from 2.2% to 15% in Chinese star anise. Shikimic acid is an intermediate of the shikimic acid pathway [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is involved in the synthesis of aromatic metabolites in plants and micro-organisms [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, shikimic acid is a phenolic acid that is known to possess several biological activities. Phenolic acids such as 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, and syringic, and ferulic acids are the main category of allelochemicals. These phenolic acids have been identified as allelopathic agents in natural and agroecosystems [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, we focused on the evaluation of inhibitory activity of star anise and shikimic acid. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00684-f003">Figure 3</xref>, both the extracts of star anise and pure shikimic acid showed strong inhibitory effects on lettuce growth. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of shikimic acid and the crude extracts of star anise fruit on lettuce radicle were 80 and 100 ppm, respectively. Both showed strong inhibitory activities, and it was observed that shikimic acid was the main compound in star anise with a relatively high content of 7.10% regarding the HPLC analysis. The results indicated that radicle growth inhibition of lettuce caused by the crude extract of star anise fruit could be explained by the contribution of the biological activity of shikimic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00684-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, the contributions of other compounds cannot be neglected. Shikimic acid also inhibited the growth of other test plants including 
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> L., 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> L., 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Lotus corniculatus</italic> L. Shikimic acid exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on the growth of bird’s-foot trefoil with a specific activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 60 ppm, followed by white clover (70 ppm), red clover (90 ppm), and alfalfa (100 ppm), in that order (
