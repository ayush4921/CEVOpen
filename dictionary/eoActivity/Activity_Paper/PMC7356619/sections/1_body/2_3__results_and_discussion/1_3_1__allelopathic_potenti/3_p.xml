<p>In this study, the fruits of 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> Hook. f. showed the highest inhibitory activity on growth elongation (14% of lettuce radicle growth). Moreover, the allelopathy activity of 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> Hook. F. fruit has not been widely reported. 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> Hook. f. (star anise) belongs to the 
 <italic>Illicium</italic> genus, and the highest percentage of shikimic acid was discovered in this genus. Avula et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported comparative data from 
 <italic>Illicium</italic> species in which shikimic acid content ranged from 3.56% to 24.8% and levels of shikimic acid in 
 <italic>Illicium</italic> species were higher than in most other plants. Star anise is native to southern China and northern Vietnam and is grown almost exclusively in southern China. 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> has also been reported to possess antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and antioxidative properties [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as significant anticancer potential [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the allelochemical involved in the growth inhibitory activity of the leachates of star anise fruits is not reported.
