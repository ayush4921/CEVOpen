<p>The potential allelopathy of the 50 medicinal plant species was evaluated using the sandwich method. The lettuce radicle and hypocotyl elongation percentages based on the effects of leachates from the oven-dried samples of 50 medicinal plants are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00684-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results of lettuce radicle elongation for 10 mg sample treatment conformed to the normal distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00684-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The allelopathic effect on lettuce radicle elongations varied among the different plant species evaluated. Some plant species showed inhibitory effects on lettuce growth and others showed stimulatory effects on lettuce growth. The radicle and hypocotyl elongations of lettuce seedlings, when treated with 10 mg of the samples, were in the range of 14–110% and 25–135% of the control. The lowest radicle elongation (14% of control) was caused by the fruits of 
 <italic>Illicium verum.</italic> Further to this, we observed radicle growth of 20–40% in 5 species, 41–60% in 9 species, 61–80% in 15 species, and 81–100% in 12 species. For the evaluation of the allelopathic activity, the concept of the “standard deviation value” (SDV) was adopted in this study [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mean and standard deviation were calculated, and the criterion of the SDV was evaluated. According to the result of the sandwich method, leaf leachates of five plant species showed strong inhibitory activity. These species were

 <italic>Stachys geobombycis</italic> C. Y. Wu. (22%),
