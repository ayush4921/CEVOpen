<p>The strength of allelochemicals can be assessed by the biological activity of a compound as expressed by EC
 <sub>50</sub>. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> is the effective concentration of a compound to induce half of the maximum action. This activity is expressed by the specific concentration of the compound and is termed as “specific activity” [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this experiment, specific activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined based on the concentration of crude extract or pure compound and the percentage inhibition of plant growth. Compounds with a high specific activity can potentially be used as pesticides. Another term that characterizes allelochemical action is the “total activity”. The total activity of a compound is a function of its specific activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and its content in the plant and, via this value, the role and influence of a compound on the allelopathic effect can be evaluated [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], L-3,4-dihydorxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), isolated from velvet bean (

 <italic>var. utilis</italic> (Wall. ex Wight) Baker ex Burck), and durantanins from golden dewdrop (
 <italic>Duranta repens</italic> L.), have a high total activity amounting to 200.
