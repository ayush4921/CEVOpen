<p>In this experiment, 0.4 g of powdered star anise fruit was weighed into 20 mL of 90% methanol. The extraction of the sample was done by sonification (Bransonic, M2800-J, Japan) for 60 min at 30 °C and further diluted to 1 mg/mL. As a standard, synthetic shikimic acid purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry was also dissolved in 90% methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Both the crude extract and the synthetic compound were filtrated through a 0.45 μm filter for the HPLC analysis. Triplicate injections of 10 µL to HPLC were performed. The HPLC (PX-8020) was equipped with a degasser, an autosampler (AS-8020). The separation of the samples was performed using TSKgel ODS column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; 5 µm, TOSOH Bioscience, Japan) and 0.1% o-phosphoric acid in water as the mobile phase. The analysis was carried out at a wavelength of 210 nm using a UV-VIS detector (UV-8020).</p>
