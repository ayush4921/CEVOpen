<p>This study focused on Chinese medicinal plants and the evaluation of their allelopathic activity. The results of the study indicated that among the 50 evaluated medicinal plant species from China, the fruits of 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> Hook. f. (star anise) showed the highest allelopathic activity. Chinese star anise is the main source of shikimic acid. In this study, HPLC analysis demonstrated that the shikimic acid content in Chinese star anise was 7.10%. The results of the phytotoxic test for synthetic shikimic acid and 
 <italic>I. verum</italic> crude extract showed that the radicle growth inhibition of lettuce caused by crude extract of star anise could be explained by the contribution of the biological activity of shikimic acid. For these reasons, shikimic acid has great potential in allelopathy and eco-friendly agriculture.
