<p>The antibacterial activities of latex were evaluated using agar well diffusion assay [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this method, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each test organism, which was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard, was inoculated on the MHA. Then, it was spread on to the surface of the agar using a sterilized glass spreader. After 10 minutes of inoculation, the wells were prepared using a sterilized steel cork borer (1 cm in diameter). Wells were made on each plate, out of which three wells were loaded with each latex. Each test was done in triplicate. All the plates were then incubated aerobically at 35 ± 2°C for 16–20 h. The antibacterial activities were evaluated by measuring the diameters of zones of inhibition (mm) against the test organism.
