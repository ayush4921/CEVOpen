<p>The agar well diffusion and microdilution methods were used in the present study due to their routine use as a quantitative method in clinical laboratories. In the agar well diffusion method, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each MDR organism, equal to a 0.5 McFarland standard, was inoculated on the MHA. The wells were prepared using a sterilized teel cork borer (1 cm diameter). Wells were made on each plate, out of which three wells were loaded with each of latex. All the plates were then incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 16–20 h. Antibacterial activities were evaluated by measuring the diameters of zones of inhibition (mm) against the MDR organism. In microdilution method, susceptibility test in 12 well microtiter plates contained various concentrations (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.19, 0.09, 0.04, and 0.02%) of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> latex. Then, the standardized numbers of MDR bacteria were inoculated into the wells of the microtiter plates and incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 16–20 h. The MIC value was observed as the lowest concentration where no viability was detected in the wells after incubation. Wells in MIC assays were subcultured using a 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L inoculating loop onto a BAP at 35 ± 2°C for 16–20 h incubation. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any growth.
