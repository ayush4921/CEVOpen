<p>The result of this study agree with those of 
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Olasope et al. (2016)</xref>, which reported that fasting blood glucose levels of alloxan-induced diabetic rats significantly decreased upon administration of cocoa powder. In addition, plantain root and stem juices have been reported to lower blood glucose levels (

 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adedayo et al. (2016)</xref>, which published the antihyperglycemic properties of certain 
 <italic>Musa</italic> sp. [
 <italic>Musa sapientum</italic> (Latundan banana), 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic> (Cavendish banana), and 
 <italic>Musa acuminate</italic> (red Dacca)]. Other plant extracts such as 
 <italic>Sargassum hystrix</italic> extract, have also been reported to exert significant blood glucose lowering potential (
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Gotama et al., 2018</xref>). The significant reduction in blood glucose levels in diabetic rats upon daily administration with the formulated beverages may arise from synergistic contribution of both plantain bulb juice and cocoa powder.
