<p>Blood glucose levels were measured daily over the 14 day study period (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Initial (day 1) blood glucose readings ranged from 433 to 594 mg/dL, showing that the rats were diabetic, whereas the NC rats had an average pre-prandial reading of 118 mg/dL. However, daily treatment with extract significantly decreased blood glucose levels of the diabetic rats, with final blood glucose levels ranging from 164 to 210 mg/dL after 14 days of treatment. The blood glucose levels of diabetic (untreated) and NC groups was maintained at high (545 to 579 mg/ dL) and low (97 to 162 mg/mL) concentrations, respectively. In addition, there was no significant difference (
