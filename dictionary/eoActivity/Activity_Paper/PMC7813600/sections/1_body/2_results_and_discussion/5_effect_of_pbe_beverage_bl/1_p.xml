<p>Reduction in NO bioavailability in DM is associated with increased free radical production (

In this study, low levels of NO (7.55 mmol NOx/mg protein) was observed in the liver and kidney homogenates of untreated STZ-induced diabetic rats. These contents represent an approximately 80% reduction in NO levels compared with homogenates from NC rats (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>), which may reflect increased utilization/conversion of NO to highly reactive peroxynitrite radicals as a result of oxidative stress (

STZ-ACA, STZ-PBE, and STZ-HPBE groups exhibited increased NO levels (15.59, 18.15, and 20.48 mmol NOx/mg protein, respectively) in liver homogenate; however, these values did not significantly differ among groups but STZ+CHPBE-2 group significantly differed from STZ-IND group at

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. However, diabetic rats treated with CHPBE-1 and CHPBE-2 exhibited significantly high NO levels relative to NC rats (23.21 and 31.57 mmol NOx/mg protein, respectively). These results confirmed that inclusion of cocoa powder promoted NO upregulation, possibly via increased production/bioavailability of endothelial NO within the normal threshold or physiological level, to improve vascular function (
