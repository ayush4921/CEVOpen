<p>The untreated diabetic group showed a greater increase in lipid peroxidation, as shown by increased levels of TBARS in liver (32.91 mmol/mg protein; 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) and kidney (31.57 mmol/mg protein; 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) homogenates compared with the NC group (liver: 1.62 mmol/mg protein; kidney: 11.94 mmol/mg protein). These results indicate occurrence of a higher rate of lipid peroxidation in the tissues as a consequence of hyperglycaemia. In addition, diminished enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defence systems may be responsible for increased lipid peroxidation. Diabetic rats have been reported to show increased levels of TBARS in the liver (

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Harini and Pugalendi, 2010</xref>). However, treatment with PBE and beverage blends decreased levels of TBARS in liver and kidney homogenates to near normal levels (liver: 2.05 to 5.39 mmol/mg protein; kidney: 11.75 to 14.45 mmol/mg protein). This indicates PBE and beverage can effectively scavenge free radicals and detoxify ROS. Treatment with PBE beverage blends was effective in depleting TBARS levels, thus, exhibited anti-lipid peroxidative activity. Similar to the current finding,
