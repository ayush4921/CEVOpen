<p>Carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes play pivotal roles in modulating carbohydrate hydrolysis. Pancreatic α-amylase is an important enzyme responsible for the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates (starch to monosaccharides) in the digestive system. Monosaccharides are further degraded to glucose by α-glucosidase, which is absorbed into the blood stream and elevates blood glucose levels (
