<p>Pathological conditions such as diabetes are characterized by increased production of free radicals and oxidative stress. Aerobic organisms have an integrated oxidative system to block the harmful effects of reactive species, however diabetes may undermine compensatory responses of endogenous antioxidant defences (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Betteridge, 2000</xref>). The activities of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, SOD, and GPx are the first line of defence against oxidative stress. The integrity of these antioxidant enzymes determine the potency of endogenous antioxidants in scavenging free radicals and preventing the development of oxidative stress-induced complexities such as diabetes. In this study, we evaluated enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules in organs important for metabolism (liver and kidney).
