<p>This study showed that the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GST, and GPx) were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) decreased in the livers and kidneys of untreated diabetic rats (STZ-IND). Decreased activities of CAT and SOD may be attributed to elevated endogenous production of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, by the auto-oxidation of excess glucose. This reduced antioxidant status may promote cell disruption and cell damage and, eventually, induce complications. However, daily administration of PBE or beverage blends improved antioxidant status of hepatic tissues by significantly (
