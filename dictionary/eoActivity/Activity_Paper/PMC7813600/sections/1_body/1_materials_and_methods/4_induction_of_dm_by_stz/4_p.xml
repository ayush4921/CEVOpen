The dose of PBE administered was pre-determined following the results of a toxicological assessment (200âˆ¼2,000 mg/kg bwt). The results showed that at all concentrations evaluated, there was no apathy, behavioural changes, damage to organs, or death (data not published); therefore, in the present study we used the lowest effective concentration of PBE (200 mg/ kg bwt). Furthermore, acarbose was chosen as the anti- diabetic drug for treatment of DM based on results from

Blood was obtained via cardiac puncture and poured into plain bottles for serum preparation. The liver, kidney, pancreas, and intestine tissues were quickly removed, washed with cold saline solution, and blotted individually with ash- free filter paper.
