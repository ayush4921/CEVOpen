<p>Reductions in GSH content were determined by the method described by 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Ellman (1959)</xref>. Supernatants (1 mL) were added to 500 μL of Ellman’s reagent [19.8 mg of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 100 mL of 0.1% sodium citrate] and 3.0 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and the absorbance was read at 412 nm using a spectrophotometer.
