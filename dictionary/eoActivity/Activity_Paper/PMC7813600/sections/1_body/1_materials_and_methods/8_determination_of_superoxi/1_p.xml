<p>SOD activity was determined according to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Misra and Fridovich (1972)</xref>. Approximately 40 μL aliquots of supernatant were pipetted into clean-sterilized test tubes containing 160 μL of distilled water to make a 1:4 (5 fold) dilution, and 2.5 mL of 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 10.2) was added. The reaction was initiated by addition of 300 μL freshly prepared 0.3 mM adrenaline, mixed by inversion. The absorbance was measured at 480 nm for 150 s (at 30 s interval) against the reagent blank (prepared by replacing the homogenate with distilled water).
