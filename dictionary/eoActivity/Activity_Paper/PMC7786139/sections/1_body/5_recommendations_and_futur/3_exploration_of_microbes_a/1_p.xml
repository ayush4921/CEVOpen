<p>In addition to length of time needed, the attrition rate in DDP is very high. The number of starting compounds that enters the DDP drastically thins out after each step and stage- from available records only 2.5% of stage-1 compounds make it to stage 2, of which just 2% pass to stage 3, and 5% of the stage-3 candidates may eventually end up getting approved to be in the market (Kola and Landis, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Tonkens, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The implication is that only 1 out of 250 candidate compounds that enters stage 2 may become an approved medicine. With limited funding for even stage 2 studies, critical selection of what enters this stage is essential to decrease the attrition rate. Bearing in mind the aforementioned, it is advisable to continue natural compound discovery and screening against target pathogens, in a coordinated fashion, in order to expand this collection of compounds. Since most of the compounds at hand thus far are from plants, we are recommending that we expand our efforts to less-explored sources of medicinal natural products such as the microbial and marine organisms. Nigeria, and Africa at large, is blessed with diverse ecosystems that are habitats to myriad aquatic and non-aquatic macro- and micro-organisms. While the antibiotic penicillin is a leading example of drugs from microorganisms, the analgesic drug, Ziconotide was the first approved medicine from marine source. After these, numerous drugs from microbial and marine sources have been successfully brought to market (Molinski et al.,
