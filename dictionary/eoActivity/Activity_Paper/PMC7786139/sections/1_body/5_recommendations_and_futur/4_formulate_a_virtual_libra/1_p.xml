<p>The recent advances in the fields of medicinal chemistry, and computer and information technology have resulted in a synergy that birthed an emerging field known as computational medicinal chemistry, which basically entails 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches for the curation, design, development, testing and synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> curation is simply the act of keeping a collection of information in computers and making it accessible to interested people remotely, this is simply a database or virtual library. This can be organized relatively easily and even after the establishment of a national repository as described above, would retain its relevance if actively curated and updated by the research community. Numerous relevant virtual libraries/databases are available containing information on parasitesâ€”e.g., for genomes PlasmoDB (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app</ext-link>); metabolism (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vm-trypanocyc.toulouse.inra.fr/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://vm-trypanocyc.toulouse.inra.fr/</ext-link>; Shameer et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and small molecules, e.g., ChEMBL (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/</ext-link>), PubChem (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>), and the recently curated TrypInDB (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trypindb.biomedinformri.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://trypindb.biomedinformri.com/</ext-link>; Vijayakumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Likewise, we propose the formulation of a virtual library/database to contain the 93 highlighted antiparasitic natural products of Nigerian origin, as well as information on all tested but inactive natural compounds in order to minimize needless replication, and continue to expand the library as new pharmacologically active compounds are being discovered. This database should further be expanded in collaboration, first to include natural compounds reported from other African nations, and potentially from other continents. As the database will be freely accessible, it will promote collaborations with scientists within and outside the continent and accelerate the process of drug discovery. As it grows, it should be explored whether this database could be linked to other resources such as TrypInDB or CHEMBL in order to promote its visibility.
