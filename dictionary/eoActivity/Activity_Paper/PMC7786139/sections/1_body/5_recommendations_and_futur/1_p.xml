<p>In this review we described and listed scores of phytochemicals isolated from Nigerian medicinal plants and, importantly, they have been reported to possess therapeutic capabilities against important Africa-endemic parasitic infectious diseases. The focus of this paper has been on the protozoan infections- malaria, African trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. Apart from malaria, these diseases are popularly termed neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they disproportionately affect the economically bottom billion (world's poorest) people; consequently, drug discovery for such diseases is not of interest to the pharmaceutical industry due to projected lack of profitable return on the investments. Since the majority of the people affected by these diseases are Africans, it would be fulfilling, and indeed transformational, to see a few of the novel natural compounds that are highlighted in this review make their ways to the market as drugs of choice for malaria or some of the NTDs. It should be noted that, according to the World Health Organization, Nigeria is the country most afflicted by malaria, shouldering 25% of the global malaria burden (World Health Organization,

In order words, the goal of this review is not only to provide a compendium of antiparasitic natural compounds from Nigerian bioresources, but also to stimulate and channel research focus toward further development of the compounds to marketable drugs. If successful, this will become a leading example of solutions to African problems from Africa, and by Africans. However, at this moment, every single compound listed here is still experimental and in the early stages of drug development. The subsequent paragraphs provide perspectives and steps to be taken toward genuine clinical development of African natural compounds for African diseases.
