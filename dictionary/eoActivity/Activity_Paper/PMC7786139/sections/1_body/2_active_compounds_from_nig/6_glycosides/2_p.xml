<p>Okunji et al. isolated a bioactive saponin, identified as Spiroconazole A (
 <bold>67</bold>), from the methanol extracts of the seed pulp of two “soap tree” species, 
 <italic>Dracaena mannii</italic> and 
 <italic>D. arborea</italic>. The compound showed significant antileishmanial and antimalarial activity (Okunji et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Three glycosides were obtained from the methanol extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Stachytarpheta cayennensis</italic>, which is used in Central and West Africa to treat malaria. The compounds were identified as apigenin (
 <bold>68</bold>), stigmasterol glucoside (
 <bold>69</bold>) and verbascoside (
 <bold>70</bold>), and displayed significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) antimalarial activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, with a dose of 2.5 mg/Kg lowering 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitaemia in mice by up to 89% (Ifeoma Chinwude et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Two antikinetoplastid irodid glucosides were isolated from the methanol leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Vitex grandifolia</italic>. Agnuside (
 <bold>71</bold>) showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.38 and 13.7 μg/mL against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes in THP1 cells and against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, respectively. However, the other compound, bartsioside (
 <bold>72</bold>), was essentially inactive, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;25 μg/mL against both parasites, suggesting that the hydroxyl group on C-6 and/or the 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy benzoic acid moiety at C-8 are probably essential for activity (Bello et al.,
