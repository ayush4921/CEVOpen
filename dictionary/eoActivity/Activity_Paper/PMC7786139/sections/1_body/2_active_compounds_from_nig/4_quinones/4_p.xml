<p>The crude hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Crateva adansonii</italic> showed moderate anti-trypanosomal activity with a MIC of 12.5 μg/mL (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In a further study, purpurin-18 ethyl ester 
 <bold>(58)</bold>, an anthraquinone derivative, was isolated from the extracts of the leaves of the related species 
 <italic>C. adansonii</italic> and displayed a MIC of 6.25 μM against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Molecular docking studies of 
 <bold>58</bold> with some trypanosomal proteins revealed glutathione synthetase as its most likely target, followed by sterol-14α-demethylase and riboflavin kinase, with riboflavin kinase showing highest affinity (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), although these models need experimental verification.
