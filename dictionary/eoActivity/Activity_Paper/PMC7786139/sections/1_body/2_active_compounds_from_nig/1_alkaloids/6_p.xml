<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antitrypanosomal activity of the aqueous extract of young leaves of 
 <italic>Holarrhena africana</italic> from Nigeria has been reported by multiple authors (Nwodo et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Alhaji et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Nnadi et al. investigated the antitrypanosomal, antileishmanial and antiplasmodial activity of this plant in more detail, using extracts and fractions from both stem bark and leaves (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The crude extract and alkaloid fraction both displayed potent antitrypanosomal activity. Bioactivity guided fractionation of the active alkaloid fraction led to the isolation of 19 compounds, 17 of which were steroid alkaloids. Remarkable activities (EC
 <sub>50</sub> in μM ± absolute deviation) against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> rhodesiense were recorded for some aminosteroids from the leaves: 3β-holaphyllamine (0.40 ± 0.28) 
 <bold>15</bold>, N-methylholaphyllamine (0.08 ± 0.01) 
 <bold>16</bold>, 3α-holaphyllamine (0.37 ± 0.16) 
 <bold>17</bold> and 3β-dihydroholaphyllamine (0.67 ± 0.03) 
 <bold>18</bold>. Related compounds from the stembark, Conessimine (0.17 ± 0.08) 
 <bold>19</bold>; isoconessimine (0.17 ± 0.11) 
 <bold>20</bold>; conessine (0.42 ± 0.09) 
 <bold>21</bold>; and holarrhesine (0.12 ± 0.08) 
 <bold>22</bold> also showed very high antitrypanosomal activity, with high selectivity to the parasites [selectivity index (SI) &gt;100] compared to mammalian L6 cells (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A 3D-Quantitave Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) study revealed that steric activity around the C-3 amino group tends to increase activity, while steric activity in the vicinity of the amino group of the pyrroline/pyrrolidine rings and the C-17β-acetyl or C-20 methyl groups tended to decrease activity (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Following on from this, the active aminosteroids together with 
 <bold>22</bold>, 3α- dihydroholaphyllamine (
 <bold>23</bold>), and holarrhetine (
 <bold>24</bold>) were also tested on animal trypanosome species using resazurin-based 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screening assay in our lab (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Interestingly, most of these compounds displayed no cross-resistance with pentamidine, isometamidium, diamidines, and melaminophenyl arsenicals in 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. The activity of these compounds varies between 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> and 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic>, suggesting possible differences in the mode of action of these compounds in the 2 species as seen with some trypanocides. The compounds with highest activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ± standard deviation) and selectivity [represented as Selectivity Index (SI)] against 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> were 
 <bold>20</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.22 ± 0.35 μM; SI = 123.5), 
 <bold>21</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.65 ± 0.92 μM; SI = 37.2), 
 <bold>22</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.22 ± 0.13 μM; SI = 65.9), and 
 <bold>23</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.045 ± 0.03 μM; SI = 2,130) (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Further exploration into the mechanism of action revealed that the compounds caused a slow but irreversible trypanocidal effect by targeting the mitochondrion, preventing kinetoplast division (Nnadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
