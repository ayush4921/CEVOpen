<p>The crude, semi-purified and purified aqueous extracts of the roots of 
 <italic>Fagara zanthoxyloides</italic>, known as Senegal prickly-ash, displayed highly promising antiplasmodial activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.90, 1.00, and 0.13 μg/mL, respectively, using the [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay. Further separation yielded a very potent antiplasmodial benzophenanthridine alkaloid, fagaronine (
 <bold>7</bold>) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.018 μg/mL against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7 (Kassim et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). A short and efficient synthesis for this compound was developed by Rivaud et al. (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), who also confirmed the compound's activity against chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates superior to chloroquine with half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of ~10 nM 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and comparable to chloroquine against 
 <italic>P. vinckei in vivo</italic> [median effective dose (ED
 <sub>50</sub>) of 6 mg/Kg/day for 4 days]. Moreover, the compound, displayed no toxicity against Vero cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Rivaud et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or by single injection in the mouse at up to 50 mg/Kg (Nakanishi et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The methanol extract of 
 <italic>F. zanthoxyloides</italic> also displayed &gt;90% inhibition of 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei in vivo</italic>, with an estimated EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 235 mg/Kg b.w. for the extract while the lethal dose 50 (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) was &gt;5,000 mg/Kg b.w. in mice (Enechi et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), providing independent confirmation of the antimalarial potential of this plant.
