<p>Several compounds including a bioactive sesquiterpene, 2β-methoxyclovan-9α-ol 
 <bold>(37)</bold>, two active labdane diterpenes, methyl-
 <italic>ent</italic>-3β-hydroxylabd-8(17)-en-15-oate 
 <bold>(38)</bold> and alepterolic acid 
 <bold>(39)</bold> were obtained from the methanol extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Piliostigma thonningii</italic>, a plant of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae in the legume family with myriad ethnopharmacological uses. Compounds 
 <bold>37</bold> and 
 <bold>39</bold> were antitrypanosomal with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 7.89 and 3.42 μM against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>38</bold> displayed a broader antikinetoplastid activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.84 and 7.82 μM in 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>, respectively. The authors suggested that hydroxylation of the sesquiterpenes at C-2 position improves the antileishmanial activity, while hydroxylation at C-3 enhances the antitrypanosomal activity of the labdane diterpenes (Afolayan et al.,
