<p>Column chromatography of the ethyl acetate extract of the roots of 
 <italic>Calliandra portericensis</italic> yielded a novel diterpene-substituted chromanyl benzoquinone, bokkosin, 
 <bold>40</bold>. The compound showed potent activity against the kinetoplastid parasites, 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (0.69 μg/mL), 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> (21.6 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (5.8 μg/mL). In addition, it exhibited very low prospects of cross-resistance to antitrypanosomal drugs, pentamidine and diminazene, and low toxicity to mammalian cell lines (Nvau et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The ethyl acetate extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus maculata</italic> also exhibited antitrypanosomal activity (12.3 ± 0.3 μg/mL, EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM). An ursane type triterpenoid, 3β,13β-dihydroxy-urs-11-en-28-oic acid (41) isolated from this extract appeared to be the active ingredient, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM of 1.58 ± 0.03 μg/mL against 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. Compound 41 showed no cross-resistance to diamidines and arsenicals, and was not toxic to HEK cells at concentrations up to 200 μg/mL (Ebiloma et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
