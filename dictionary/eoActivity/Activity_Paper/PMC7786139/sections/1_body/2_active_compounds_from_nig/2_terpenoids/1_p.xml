<p>Terpenoids are commonly found in plants and are biosynthesized from isoprene units (CH
 <sub>2</sub>=C(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)-CH=CH
 <sub>2</sub>). They are classified based on the number of units in the compound; monoterpenes consist of 2 units, while sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes consist of 3, 4, 6, and 8 units, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The number of carbon atoms in the compounds are thus 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 depending on the number of isoprene units. Terpenoids have shown good activity in various assay screens and constitute the active entities in many drugs. Compound
