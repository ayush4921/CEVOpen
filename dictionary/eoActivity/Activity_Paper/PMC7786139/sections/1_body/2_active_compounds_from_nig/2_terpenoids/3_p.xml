<p>The crude hexane extracts of the rhizomes of wild ginger, 
 <italic>Siphonochilus aethiopicus</italic>, showed promising activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> with an MIC of 6.5 μg/mL and low toxicity against several mammalian cells (MIC of 53.3–114.2 μg/mL). Two active diterpenes, 8(17),12E-labdadiene15,16-dial 
 <bold>(29)</bold>, 15-hydroxy-8(17),12E-labdadiene-16-al 
 <bold>(30)</bold> and two sesquiterpenes, epi-curzerenone 
 <bold>(31)</bold>, furanodienone 
 <bold>(32)</bold> were isolated from the extract (Igoli N. et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 
 <bold>29, 31, 32</bold> showed a MIC of 1.55 μg/mL while 
 <bold>30</bold> displayed an MIC of 6.25 μg/mL against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The compounds appeared to be selective for 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> as cytotoxicity tests with the mammalian cells showed MICs of 35.9–116 μg/mL, except for 
 <bold>29</bold>, which was toxic to Jurkat and SH-SY5Y cells (MIC 4.1 and 9.0 μg/mL, respectively) (Igoli N. et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
