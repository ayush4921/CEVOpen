<p>One antitrypanosomal peptide from Nigerian plants is aurantiamide acetate (
 <bold>73</bold>). It was isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Crateva adansonii</italic>, and displayed an MIC of 25 μM against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Further investigation into its possible mechanism of action through docking studies revealed strong binding interactions between 
 <bold>73</bold> and trypanosomal enzymes sterol-14α-demethylase and trypanothione reductase (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nwodo et al. (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>) isolated two dipeptides from the methanol extract of the roots of 
 <italic>Zapoteca portoricensis</italic> elucidated as saropeptide (
 <bold>74</bold>) and anabellamide (
 <bold>75</bold>). Compound 
 <bold>74</bold> was selectively active against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.63 μM, but had only low activity against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.6 μM), which is the causative agent of Chagas disease. On the other hand, 
 <bold>75</bold> displayed moderate activity against both species (
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.2 μM; 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.1 μM). Although both compounds displayed relatively low toxicity against mammalian L6 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 92.1 μM and 71.2 μM for 
 <bold>74</bold> and 
 <bold>75</bold>, respectively, this does not seem to leave sufficient selectivity for further development (Nwodo et al.,
