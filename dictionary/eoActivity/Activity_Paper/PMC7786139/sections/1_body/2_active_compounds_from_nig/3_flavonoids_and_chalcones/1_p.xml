<p>Flavonoids are secondary metabolites with diverse medicinal properties and are commonly found in fruits, leaves, and flowers of plants. They are phenolics, with structures based on a 15-carbon skeleton made of two benzene rings (A and B) connected by a pyran ring (C) (F1). The saturation (F3) or unsaturation (F2) of the pyran ring, absence of the carbonyl group at C-4 (F4), connection of ring B to ring C at C-3 (F5, F6, F7) and the opening of ring C (F8) is the basis for their classification into flavones, flavanones, flavans, isoflavone, isoflavanones, isoflavans, and chalcones (
