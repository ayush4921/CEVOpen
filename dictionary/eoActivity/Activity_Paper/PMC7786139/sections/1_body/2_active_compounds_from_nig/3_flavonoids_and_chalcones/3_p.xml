<p>The methanol extract of the leaves of the common tropical shrub 
 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic>, extracts of which are used to treat malaria in South-Eastern Nigeria, suppressed parasitaemia in mice infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> by 99.2 and 97.8% at 200 and 400 mg/Kg/day, respectively. The extract yielded a flavonoid identified as 3, 5, 7, 3′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone (
 <bold>52</bold>), which displayed high antiplasmodial activity, with 81.5% suppression of parasitaemia in mice infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> at 2.5 mg/Kg/day, even better than the control chloroquine and artemether (Ezenyi et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nwodo et al. (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>) isolated seven flavonoid derivatives from the leaves of 
 <italic>Vitex simplicifolia</italic> (family Verbenaceae), which is used to treat trypanosomiasis in Nigeria, and evaluated their activity against 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> as well as cytotoxicity in L6 cells. The most active and least toxic of the compounds were 2-(5′-methoxyphenyl)-3,4′,5,7,8-trihydroxychroman-4-one 
 <bold>(53)</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.2 μg/mL and SI = 9.8, as well as artemetin 
 <bold>(54)</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.7 μg/mL and SI = 9.8 (Nwodo et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). This level of selectivity seems insufficient for any clinical development.
