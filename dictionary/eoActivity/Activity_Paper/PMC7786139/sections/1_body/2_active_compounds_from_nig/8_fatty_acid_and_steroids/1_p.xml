<p>The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> exhibited promising antiplasmodial activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.6 and 12.8 μg/mL in chloroquine-sensitive 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> D10 strain, respectively. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extracts yielded two fatty acids, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid (linolenic acid; 
 <bold>76</bold>) and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid; 
 <bold>77</bold>) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.58 ± 0.22 and 6.88 ± 0.02 μg/mL in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The compounds were not cross-resistant to chloroquine but the level of selectivity for the parasite over Chinese hamster ovarian cells is quite low (SI = 7.43–15.27) and does not invite extensive 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> follow-on (Melariri et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In our own investigations of antiprotozoal natural products from Nigeria and beyond, we have reported the isolation of Taccalonolide A (
 <bold>78</bold>) and its novel derivative, Taccalonolide A 12-propanoate (
 <bold>79</bold>), from the tubers of 
 <italic>Tacca leontopetaloides</italic>. Both compounds showed activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM of 11.4 ± 0.39 and 3.1 ± 0.09 μg/mL. However, we have observed remarkable antitrypanosomal activity in one of the impure fractions (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.76 ± 0.03 μg/mL), suggesting a need for further investigation of 
 <italic>T. leontopetaloides</italic> as a source of more potent antiparasitic agents (Dike et al.,
