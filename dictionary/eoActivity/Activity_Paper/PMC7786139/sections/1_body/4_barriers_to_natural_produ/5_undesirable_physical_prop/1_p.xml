<p>Another fundamental challenge is that in the drug discovery setting, it is predicted that poor absorption becomes probable when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 5 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight of the compound is above 500, or the calculated partition coefficient (cLog P) is &gt;5 (Lipinski et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). This is known as Lipinski's rule of five. Unfortunately, most natural compounds do not obey this rule; hence, in the eye of the pharmaceutical companies, many natural compounds do not have the required drug-like characteristics, based on their structure. This is in addition to the solubility issues associated with some natural compounds; many are not completely soluble in the assay's aqueous environment, which can interfere with the reproducibility of research results. Many of these issues require increased troubleshooting in standardized assays, leading to higher costs and a high rejection rate for otherwise active compounds.
