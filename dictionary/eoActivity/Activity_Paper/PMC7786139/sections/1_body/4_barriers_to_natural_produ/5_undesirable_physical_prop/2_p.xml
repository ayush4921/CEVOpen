<p>Other undesirable physical properties of natural compounds like colouration make them more difficult to assay using contemporary drug discovery strategies such as the standardized high throughput screening of compound libraries, compared with synthetic compounds. For instance, deep colouration of some plant compounds may interfere with the assay methods involving color change in spectroscopic/colorimetric determinations.</p>
