<p>A range of processes known as “dereplication,” based on hyphenated techniques are standard procedures that are applied in plant metabolomics to avoid the re-isolation and re-characterization of known compounds by eliminating known entities (Carnevale Neto et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hubert et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Kildgaard et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, to systematically extract vital pieces of information from acquired data, chemometric tools are needed for the dereplication process. This is because biological samples such as plant extracts are complex in nature, with a very large concentration range. This notwithstanding, the GC-MS-based technique for identifying non-targeted metabolites is one of the emerging techniques to improve the dereplication method (Carnevale Neto et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but the procedures involved can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
