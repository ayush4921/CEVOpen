<p>Perhaps the most challenging impediments to natural product-based drug discovery over the past few decades are the resource intensiveness and the tedious purification protocols involved in the identification of bioactive molecules from the highly complex mixtures that are the initial extracts. When purified, the isolated bioactive compound is often obtained in tiny amounts (usually a few milligrams) that are unlikely to go the full length of the drug discovery process, especially in protocols involving the use of large cultures such as required for metabolomic studies and other assessments of drug action, or for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. This is compounded by the fact that this tedious process frequently yields subversive compounds with multiple behavior in assays such as covalent bond formation, chelation, membrane perturbation, and redox activity, which are collectively known as Pan Assay Interference compoundS (PAINS) (Baell and Holloway, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Baell, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Prominent natural (plant) products that frequently contain PAINS include catechols, quinones, phenolic manic bases, and hydroxyphenylhydrazones (Baell, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). PAINS and PAINS-like, despite a possible nano- or micro-molar potency, lack a distinct biological mechanism, exhibit poor SAR or optimisability, and thus have very low prospects for clinical development (Baell, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Thus, it is important to utilize assay techniques that will screen-out PAINS and to carry out structural studies of complexes of hits-target molecules and structure-activity optimization studies of the hits (Baell and Nissink, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Balogun et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
