<p>The challenges facing the development of new natural products-derived drugs discussed in this review are not peculiar to Nigeria alone but to many developing countries with richer natural resources than scientific infrastructure and funding. The identification of a pharmacologically active compound from a medicinal plant in a systematic and efficient manner is not an easy task. However, there is no gainsaying that specialized molecules of plant origin are the spine of our modern-day pharmacopeia, or that traditional herbal remedies continue to be successful in the treatment of many ailments. Notwithstanding this historic significance in drug discovery and development, there has been a steady drop in the number of new natural product-based drugs entering into clinical use in the past 30 years (Wright, 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The modern-day pharmaceutical industry has largely shifted from the traditional natural product-based drug discovery strategy to one that could easily be created with a synthetic approach such as combinatorial chemistry combined with high-throughput screening. Consequently, synthetic compounds are currently being favored by the global pharmaceutical industries over the natural product-based compounds as a more tractable alternative in their use to develop new drugs. This is a consequence of a combination of many factors.
