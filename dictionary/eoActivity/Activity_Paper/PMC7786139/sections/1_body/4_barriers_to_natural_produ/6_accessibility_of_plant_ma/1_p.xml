<p>Another significant challenge is the absence of specific government legislation and international agreements regulating the access to plant resources in the biodiversity-rich flora. Some of the indigenous plants used in folklore are rapidly disappearing due to indiscriminate use, deforestation, and deliberate bush-burning for farming activities and hunting. This makes subsequent access to these important medicinal plants for follow-up studies increasingly difficult, which in turn discourage further natural products research. This is a serious problem particularly in developing countries where the implementation of the Nagoya protocol is yet to be fully implemented. The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) is a build-up on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is a key regulatory document for sustainable development aimed at developing national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in all countries (Convention on Biological Diversity,

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Contrary to the opinions of critics of ABS who think it will create bottlenecks for scientific research and impedes new discoveries, the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol in Nigeria will prevent the extinction of plants from which useful medicinal products can be discovered. There can also be difficulty in physically gaining access to the natural habitats of these essential medicinal plants. This challenge is due to the absence of accessible roads to the often remote rural areas where the majority of these important medicinal plants are located.
