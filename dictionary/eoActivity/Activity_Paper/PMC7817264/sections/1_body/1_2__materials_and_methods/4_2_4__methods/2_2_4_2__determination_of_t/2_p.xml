<p>After 6 hours of intragastric administration of ethanol or normal saline, the blood samples were collected from the iliac vein and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 5 minutes, and the serum was collected. Oxidized forms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) were put into the blood standard solutions of different ethanol concentrations. The absorbance of the above reaction mixture was documented at 340 nm, and the standard curve of ethanol concentration was drawn. The regression equation of ethanol concentrations was presented as 
 <italic>C</italic> = 1237.6A − 11.862 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.967) through the above standard curve. The formula was used to calculate the concentration of ethanol in the blood of mice.
