  <p>The results showed that compound turmeric recipe could promote wakefulness and prevent acute alcoholism: it could significantly prolong alcohol tolerance time of AAI mice, shorten the time for soberness, and improve the 24 h survival rate of mice. First of all, its mechanism was likely related to the reduction of blood alcohol concentration: namely, compound turmeric recipe induced the increase of the activities of ADH, ALDH, and P450 in the liver, thus accelerating the metabolism of alcohol. In addition, the recipe reduced the activities of 
   <italic>β</italic>-EP and LENK in brain tissue, thus reducing the inhibitory effect of alcohol on the central nervous system.

  <p>Compound turmeric recipe has a protective effect on alcohol-induced liver injury: it could significantly reduce the activities of serum ALT, AST, and ALP of AAI mice. The mechanisms of liver protection were likely related to inhibiting the activities of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-8, and MDA in liver, enhancing SOD content. That is to say, it is related to alleviating the liver free radical damage caused by alcohol, raising the antioxidant capability in the body and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators.
