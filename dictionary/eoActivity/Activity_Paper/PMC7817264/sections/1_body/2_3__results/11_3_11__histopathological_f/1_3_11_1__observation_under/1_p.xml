<p>The mice in the control group had normal hepatocyte structure and orderly arrangement of liver cords. There was no obvious steatosis, necrosis, or inflammatory cell infiltration in hepatocytes. In the model group, the hepatic lobule structure was disordered, with obvious swelling around the central vein of hepatocytes. The cytoplasm is transparent with balloon-like changes, necrotic areas, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Compared with control group, parts of hepatocytes in RU-21 group and CTR group were swollen. The boundary between hepatocytes was clear with light staining of cytoplasm. A small number of inflammatory cells were found in individual portal areas, which were fewer than those of the model group. Under the microscope magnifying of 200, 10 microscopic vision fields were randomly captured on each pathological slice, and the pathological slices were graded according to the relevant standards [
