<p>When hepatocytes are damaged, the permeability of hepatocyte membrane increases, ALT, AST, and ALP can enter blood in large quantities, and their activities are increased. Therefore, high transaminase generally indicates liver damage [

The study indicated that it has a protective effect on alcohol-induced acute liver injury in mice. The mechanism was likely related to stabilizing the hepatic cellular membrane against alcohol-induced liver injury.
