<p>The results showed that the CTR treatment prolonged the alcohol tolerance time, significantly shortened the time for soberness, and prolonged the 24-hour survival rate of mice with acute alcoholism. In addition, the CTR treatment delayed the appearance of intoxication symptoms in mice with acute alcoholism and weakened the intoxication symptoms of mice such as hyperactivity. In the in vivo study, the CTR treatment increased the activities of ADH, ALDH, and P450 and decreased 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP and LENK levels. Besides, it also reduced ALT, AST, and ALP activities, increased SOD activity, and decreased MDA, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and IL-8 activities. Moreover, the ethanol concentration in blood was reduced after the CTR treatment, which could accelerate the metabolism of alcohol/aldehyde and/or inhibit the absorption of alcohol.
