<p>Alcohol intoxication can cause the anterior pituitary to release a large amount of 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP. A high level of 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP can directly inhibit the central nervous system. At the same time, 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP can cause cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting prostaglandin production and adenylate cyclase activity [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. High level of 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP also inhibits ATP metabolism, promotes the production of oxygen free radicals, and damages brain cells [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. LENK is an opioid peptide. When the body is stimulated by acute alcohol, the synthesis, storage, and secretion of related opioid peptides will change significantly, which may even make the opioid peptide become a self-damaging factor in the body and participate in the pathological process of body injury or disease [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results showed that CTR can significantly inhabit the release of LENK and 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP, alleviate central nervous system inhibition, and exert a good antialcohol effect. In addition, CTR inhibits the release of 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP and LENK more significantly than RU-21.
