<p>TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-8 are important inflammatory cytokines that mediate the body's inflammatory responses and have important roles in the physiological functions and pathological processes. Alcohol stimulates monocyte macrophages and increases the activation of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-8, resulting in the imbalance of cytokine network. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> cooperates with other cytokines to mediate inflammatory reaction and damage liver cells [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In recent years, animal experiments and clinical studies showed that the changes of inflammatory cytokines are closely related to the occurrence of alcoholic liver disease [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The results also showed that there were high levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-8 in the liver tissues of mice with acute alcoholism, which mediated inflammatory reactions and damaged liver cells, and CTR significantly reduced the activities of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-8, which suggested that CTR can effectively reduce the activities of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-8 and decrease the levels of inflammatory mediators, so as to reduce the inflammatory injury of liver in acute alcoholism.
