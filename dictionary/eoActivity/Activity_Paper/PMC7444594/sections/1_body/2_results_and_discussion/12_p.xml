<p>The anti-diabetic activity was analyzed by using amylase inhibition assay. The seeds and the aerial parts of the selected species revealed significant differences in anti-diabetic activity when compared with the standard drug metformin (

 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic> (85.65±0.34% Inh.) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity among all the selected species. It was followed by the seeds of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>eurypterum</italic> (83.63±0.63% Inh.), next highest value was found in 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic> (82.8±0.1%). The seeds of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>propinquum</italic> indicated (81.5±0.4%) activity. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.N) depicted (80.9±1.9%) anti-dibetic activity. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.P) revealed (80.3±0.6%) enzyme inhibition in the seeds of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.H) (79.5±1.0%) inhibition was found. The seeds of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic> var. 
 <italic>pterophorus</italic> reported (77.7±0.2%) enzyme inhibition activity. The endemic plant of the region 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>paulayana</italic> depicted (76.5±0.4%) anti-diabetic activity. 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic> showed (71.4±1.4%) anti-diabetic activity. Seeds of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>olivieri</italic> exhibited (69.8±0.8%) enzymatic inhibitory activity. The seeds of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic> were used as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-diabetic agents [
