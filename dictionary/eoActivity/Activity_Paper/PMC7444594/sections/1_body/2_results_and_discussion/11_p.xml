<p>Inflammation in medical terms is demarcated as a pathophysiological procedure described by soreness, fever, swelling of body parts, loss of function and discomfort [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The inhibitory effect among different plants of Zygophyllaceae on albumin denaturation is shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231612.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Significant inhibition of albumin was observed among different taxa. 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>eurypterum</italic> seeds depicted maximum inhibition with the highest value (96.85±1.85% Inh.). Seeds of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic> var. 
 <italic>pterophorus</italic> revealed the next highest value (95.85±2.85%), Seeds of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic> exhibited the (95.35±3.35% Inh.) activity. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic> depicted (91.1±1.1% of Inh.). Earlier in the fruit of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic> significant anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. All species of 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity significant and comparable with the standard drug diclofenac sodium. In the seeds extracts, the highest value was found in 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.H) (88.9 ± 4.9% Inh). 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>paulayana</italic> showed (84.8±0.8%) of inhibition. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>olivieri</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.N) showed (80.9 ±0.9 and 79.7±0.7% Inh., respectively). The seeds of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic> constituted (76.4±1.4% Inh.) activity for inhibition. The seeds of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.P) (66.2±1.2% Inh.) revealed less inhibition when compared with the standard drug. The previously anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>cretica</italic> was studied by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A minimum inhibition of albumin was observed in the seeds of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>propinquum</italic> (15.79±0.20% Inh.) in comparison with all studied taxa. Previously, 
 <italic>Nitraria schoberi</italic> from Zygophyllaceae fruit extract has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] that are quite in line with the presently observed activities for the seeds and the aerial parts. The aerial parts of all the studied taxa of Zygophyllaceae also exhibited a significant inhibition of albumin. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic> var. 
 <italic>pterophorus</italic> revealed the maximum inhibition (90.1±2.1% Inh.) followed by 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.H) (89.9±0.9 and 89.4±0.9% Inh., respectively) anti-inflammatory inhibition. 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>fabago</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>olivieri</italic> indicated (88.3 ± 1.3% Inh.) inhibition in both plants. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>paulayana</italic> (endemic to the region) revealed (87.1±1.1% Inh.) albumin inhibition activity. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>pentandrus</italic>, 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>simplex</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.P) exhibited inhibition activity as (86.5 ± 0.5, 83.2 ±1.2 and 80.4 ±1.2% Inh. respectively). 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>propinquum</italic> aerial parts also showed a significant inhibition as compared with the standard drug (79.6±0.6 and 75.9±1.9% Inh.). 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>indica</italic> (49.6±0.3% Inh.) depicted less inhibition when compared with all other taxa as well as the standard drug. Previously, chloroform and methanol extracts of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic> exhibited a significant anti-inflammatory activities at a dose of 200 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. All examined 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic> spp. in the present study exhibited therapeutic potential especially 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>bruguieri</italic> (F.b.H) suggested to be used as an anti-inflammatory as well as an anti-diabetic agents authenticating its folk use. Earlier, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>cretica</italic> was identified for its high therapeutic effects against various types of hematological, liver disorders, neurological and inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, aqueous extract is one of the seventeen ingredients in Norm acid syrup used in the treatment of high acidity and gastritis [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Also the endemic taxa of the region i.e. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>paulayana</italic> exhibited high anti-inflammatory potential. Previously, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>longipina</italic> traditionally was used as a preventive for cancer, also used for the treatment of inflammation of the urinary tract [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>schweinfurthii</italic> plant extract gel could be developed as a therapeutic agent for wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties [
