<p>The method of [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] was used to determine SOD activity by homogenizing the fresh aerial parts and fruits of selected taxa in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8), EDTA (0.1 mM) and DTT (1 mM) following the procedure of [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and was further analyzed by assessing its property to stop the photochemical reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium as explicated by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. One unit of SOD activity was demarcated as the amount of enzyme causing 50% inhibition of photochemical reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium. Absorption was measured in Double Beam Spectrophotometer (Hitachi u-2800).
