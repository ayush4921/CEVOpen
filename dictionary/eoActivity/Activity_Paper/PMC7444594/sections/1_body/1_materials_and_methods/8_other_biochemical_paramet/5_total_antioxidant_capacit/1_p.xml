<p>A modified method of TAC was followed as described by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to the presence of antioxidants in the sample, ABTS assay represents a decrease of 2, 2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonate) radical cation ABTS•+ (blue-green in color) into original ABTS (colorless compound). The antioxidants of the sample extract according to their content decolorize the ABTS•+ radical cation. The reaction mixture contained reagent R1 (mixture of sodium acetate buffer solution and glacial acetic acid, pH5.8), sample extract and reagent R2 (mixture of sodium phosphate buffer solution, glacial acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and ABTs). After 5 min, at wavelength of 660nm, the absorption of each reaction mixture was measured. This analysis used AsA (ascorbic acid) to develop a calibration curve. The results for antioxidant contents found in plant extracts were measured as μM AsA equivalent to one gram.
