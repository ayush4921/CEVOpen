<p>The α-esterase was determined by using the method as suggested by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. α-naphthyl acetate was used as substrates. The reaction mixture contained 30 mM α-naphthyl acetate (30 mM), acetone (1%), and phosphate buffer (0.04 M, pH = 7), and enzyme extract. The mixture obtained was incubated for 15 min at 27ºC in dark. After 15 min, 1 mL of staining solution was added (Fast blue BB 1% and SDS 5% with ratio of 2:5) and again incubated in the dark for 20 min at 27 ºC. Absorbance at 590 nm was measured for α-naphthol produced using standard curve, enzyme activity was α-naphthol produced in μM min
