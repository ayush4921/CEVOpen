<p>The assessment of POD activity was carried out using method [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with minor changes. The homogenized mixture of the aerial parts and fruits prepared in 1 mL phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8), EDTA (0.1 mM) and DTT (1 mM). The assay solution contained 535 μl distilled water, phosphate buffer 50 mM (pH 7.0), guaiacol (20 mM), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (40 mM) and 15 μl enzyme extract. The addition of enzyme extract initiated the reaction. At 470 nm, absorbance raise was noted at interval of 20 sec. Absorbance change of 0.01 min
 <sup>−1</sup> was demarcated as one unit POD activity. Enzyme activity was expressed on the basis of fresh sample weight.
