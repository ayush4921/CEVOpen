<p>Protein estimation of plant samples was based on quantitative protein analysis described by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Aerial parts and fruits samples were homogenized in potassium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.0). Supernatant 5Î¼l and NaCl (0.1N) mixed with1.0 ml of Bradford dye. Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes to get a protein-dye complex. Measure the quantity at 595 nm absorbance by a spectrophotometer.
