<p>Taken all together, tannins are phenolic compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, are widely distributed and have been broadly investigated for their biological properties. They can be classified according their structure and obtained mainly from vegetal sources and marine brown algae. Specific tannins of some genera or species, such as HTs, castalagin, vescalagin or punicalagin, seem to have relevance for biological activities. Important specificity differences were also observed for compounds belonging to ETs or GTs, due to the phenolic acids released after their hydrolysis (EA or GA, respectively). The most remarkable biological activities of tannins have been recorded as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, healing and antimicrobial. Nevertheless, many of the indicated activities act synergically, with the antioxidant capacity being the main axis of the connection between the different biological properties. Indeed, all these interactions among biological activities are easily demonstrable, since common molecular targets are described to be involved in the different biological activities. Therefore, considering all the biological properties described in tannins obtained from natural sources, valorization could be an efficient approach to revalorize agri-food by-products. However, further study is still necessary to completely elucidate the mechanisms of action of the biological activities and improve the extraction methods and conditions to obtain tannins in an optimal way.</p>
