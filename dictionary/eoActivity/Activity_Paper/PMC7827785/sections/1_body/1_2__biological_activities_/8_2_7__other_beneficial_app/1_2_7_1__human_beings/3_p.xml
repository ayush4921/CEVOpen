<p>Another uncharted potential application of tannins may be their use as anxiolytics. A recent study analyzed the performance of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> tannin extracts on anxiety behavior, the genetic expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and corticosterone markers, as well as in electroencephalogram assays in mice. The results appear to indicate that tannin extracts were able to ameliorate the expression of GABA receptors, selected biochemical markers and improve the oxidative status of cerebral tissue [
