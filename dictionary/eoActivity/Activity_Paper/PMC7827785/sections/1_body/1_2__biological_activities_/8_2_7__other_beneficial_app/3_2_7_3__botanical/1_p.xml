<p>Tannins have been subjected to further research to evaluate their potential use as antifungal compounds to treat or enhance plant resistance against plant pathogens. Yet, most studies have been performed in vitro and knowledge gaps on the ecological role of tannins remain. 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> peel extracts have been tested both in vitro and in vivo against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, a common and hazardous pathogen of tomato. The results demonstrated that bacterial growth was inhibited for up to 15 days after leaf inoculation [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic>) bur extracts, mainly composed of GA and EA moieties, as well as ETs and glycosylated flavonols, inhibited the growth and spore germination of common plant-infectious fungi
