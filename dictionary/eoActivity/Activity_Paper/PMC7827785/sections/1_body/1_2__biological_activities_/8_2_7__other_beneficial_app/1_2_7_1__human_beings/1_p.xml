<p>Nowadays, there is plenty of evidence for the ethnopharmacological use of tannin-rich plants as antidiarrheal treatments. Yet, some clinical studies employing tannin extracts have shown promising results regarding the efficacy of their use and their safety. A study described how the administration of tannins reduced the duration of diarrhea caused by rotavirus in infants. Similarly, a more recent study reported that children affected by acute diarrhea presented a significant decrease in the duration of the diarrheal symptoms when administered with tannins in comparison with the standardized rehydration treatment [

These findings not only support the use of tannins as effective antidiarrheal treatments, but also provide information on their safety, since the test subjects were children. In the same way, a recent study with quebracho and chestnut extracts studied the antioxidant activity and metabolization of these extracted tannins in in vitro digestionâ€“fermentation assays. The results evidenced the degradation of tannins by gut microbiota, producing metabolites like quercetin or sinapinic acid, as well as higher antioxidant capacity on residual solids after fermentation and increased production of short-chain fatty acids. Short-chain fatty acids are described as prebiotics in the gut [
