<p>An in vivo assay using mice applied an aqueous extract from the bark of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> by intraperitoneal injection to determine its antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity. The extract results displayed a slight reduction in paw edema. In addition, 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> treatment (150 mg/kg body weight) was able to inhibit the formalin-induced inflammation at values like those of diclofenac sodium. The antipyretic treatment was maintained for 3 h and showed a slight inhibitory effect on fever after inducing the pyrexia with yeast [

 <italic>A. mearnsii.</italic> The most active one possessed at least (epi)fisetinidol derivatives (with catechin, gallocatechin, additional molecules of fisetinidol or even robinetinidol) quantified at 12.6 mg/g as procyanidin B2 equivalents. This fraction, applied at non-cytotoxic levels (50 μg/mL) in RAW 264.7 macrophages, previously exposed to oxidative stress, was able to significantly inhibit ROS production and reduce nitric oxide (NO) back to non-stimulated levels. Later, the same cell culture was exposed to an inflammatory process through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. This assay showed that the 
 <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> extract inhibited the expression of cytokines like interleukin-1β or -6 (IL-1β, IL-6) and pro-inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar results were observed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with a 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> extract. Among the identified molecules, two GTs (chebulinic acid and 2,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose) applied at 50 µM could reduce NO production and decreasing the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory properties of extracts from the spiny burs of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> have also been tested in vitro using LPS induction in the BV-2 cell line, simulating a microglia model. The treatment showed cytoprotection of the downregulation of the expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Following similar approaches, an inflammatory process was induced in the HaCaT cell line using tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Then, the cells were treated with ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> obtained by maceration or cold extraction. The induction with TNF-α stimulates pro-inflammatory signals by the production of interleukins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). This inflammatory cascade was inhibited by both kinds of 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> extracts, except for VEGF, which was just decreased by the maceration extract [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Another study, performed in vivo, orally administrated 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> extracts to rats to study its ability to prevent or treat necrotizing enterocolitis. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic abilities of 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> were analyzed through the quantification of oxidative indicators and histological assays. The application of the treatment reduced the presence of inflammatory molecules in histological samples, while biochemical results reported lower amounts of IL-6, TNF-α and lipid hyperoxides. Besides, the negative effects of induced necrotizing enterocolitis were reversed [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In another in vivo study using rats, the ability of procyanidins obtained from grape seeds to reduce inflammation induced by a hyperlipidic diet was analyzed. The oral administration of these tannins produced a down-regulation of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α and IL-6 in liver and white adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, in a comparative work of extracts from 
 <italic>R. occidentalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Vitis labrusca</italic> seeds, the analysis of the former showed higher contents of tannins and also stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Indeed, many works have been carried out using, as a basis, species belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> to show their potential bioactivities. For instance, an extract of 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> was evaluated as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective agent in rats. The anti-inflammatory effects reported by the histological exam were attributed to cyanidin-3-glucoside through the reduction or inhibition of the activity of NF-κB, COX-1 and -2, NO and/or iNOS [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In vitro assays using another species of the same genus, 
 <italic>R. idaeus</italic>, demonstrated the reductio of inflammation and oxidation in hypertrophied adipocytes. Extracts from fruits of 
 <italic>R. idaeus</italic> were able to down-regulate the expression of IL-1β and -6, TNF-α and leptin but also up-regulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and CAT. Apart from these main mechanisms, the application of 
 <italic>R. idaeus</italic> extracts reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipid mobilization in hypertrophied adipocytes, which may help to prevent the future appearance of further metabolic disorders [
