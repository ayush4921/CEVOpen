<p>Tannins have been demonstrated to prevent the appearance of ulcers or to accelerate wound healing, which may have different further applications. That is the case of an experiment performed with 
 <italic>R. imperialis</italic>, whose anti-inflammatory and wound healing activity was investigated. In vitro assays demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and lack of cytotoxicity of the extracts, while in vivo experiments focused on their cytoprotective and healing effects, also including anti-inflammatory responses. The administration of 
 <italic>R. imperialis</italic> (100 mg/kg) via gavage was shown to block the migration of neutrophils, which had a positive effect in cutaneous wounds. Besides, in vitro assays using LPS to simulate inflammation and leukocyte migration showed that the application of 
 <italic>R. imperialis</italic> increased fibroblast migration up to 76% when compared with the control and reduced NO release. Additionally, the topical administration of 
 <italic>R. imperialis</italic> was shown to affect collagen proliferation with a better organizational pattern than the control. In addition, in vitro experiments displayed a very low hemolysis rate for the extracts and no skin irritation potential [

 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> was studied for its potential healing, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Anti-inflammatory markers, such as the activity of myeloperoxidase and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) enzymes, were reduced in animals treated with 
 <italic>R. coriaria,</italic> while healing indicators, such as hydroxyproline or collagen deposition, increased and the wound area was reduced, completing epithelization and scar formation by the 10th day of treatment. Different in vivo and in vitro experiments supported the antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> extract. Indeed, animals with wounds infected with 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> showed a slight delay in the healing process, reaching similar markers between the 10th and 13th day of treatment [

Hence, as described in this work, the healing activity of tannins exerts not just a cicatrizing effect but also an antimicrobial effect, which is crucial since wounds often get infected. The antimicrobial capacity of tannins is reviewed in the next sub-section.
