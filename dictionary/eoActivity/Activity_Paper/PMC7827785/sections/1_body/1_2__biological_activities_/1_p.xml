<p>As aforementioned, tannins represent a chemical defense barrier for plants and algae that improve the response against pathological attacks and adverse abiotic conditions. The biological activity in plants and algae has prompted their utilization as traditional remedies to treat numerous diseases or infections. Currently, the biological effects of purified tannins or tannin-rich extracts (containing additional biomolecules) have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo using animal models, and more recently by clinical trials performed on humans [

Most of these research works have been focused on the study of the bioactivities of plants containing high amounts of tannins or, less commonly, purified tannins, to disclose their potential for developing innovative applications in the field of medicine, pharmacology, cosmetics, botany and/or veterinary medicine [
