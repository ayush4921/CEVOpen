<p>In this context, the wide variety of biological activities exerted by tannins and their natural sources are the perfect scenario for the implementation of a valorization strategy. In recent decades, natural products and ingredients have gained an increasing demand instead of the use of synthetic additives. Consumers opt for this option as they are safer, ecofriendly and they show plenty of health benefits, while avoiding side effects associated with synthetic antimicrobials [

 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Several studies have suggested that the food production system could join the circular economy model by adapting its manufacture model and valorizing by-products of the agri-food industry [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hence, considering that tannins are widely distributed among vegetation of the terrestrial and aquatic environments and the disposal of by-products of the agri-food industry such as leaves, peels or seeds that can be used as tannin-rich sources, valorization of tannin recovery might be a feasible approach [

This sustainable approach must further be supported by the continuous search for and optimization of novel extraction methods (i.e., solid liquid, ultrasound, microwave, supercritical fluids or high-pressure extraction) together with the use of green solvents [

Altogether, these measures would contribute to lowering the environmental impact of human activity, generate new and affordable added-value products and reduce the economic cost of recycling and waste management [
