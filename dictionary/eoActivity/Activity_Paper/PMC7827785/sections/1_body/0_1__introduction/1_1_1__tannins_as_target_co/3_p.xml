<p>CTs or proanthocyanidins account for more than 90% of the world commercial production of tannins [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They are polymeric or oligomeric flavan-3-ols, formed by the combination of A (phloroglucinol or resorcinol) and B (catechol or pyrogallol) rings [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00137-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When these compounds are heated in ethanol solutions in acidic conditions, they are decomposed into anthocyanidins [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The combination of these flavan-3-ol monomers gives rise to the formation of procyanidins (PCs) (composed of catequins and epicatechins) or profisetinidin, prorobinetidin and prodelphindin (composed of (epi)fisetinidol, (epi)robinetinidol and (epi)gallocatechin units) [
