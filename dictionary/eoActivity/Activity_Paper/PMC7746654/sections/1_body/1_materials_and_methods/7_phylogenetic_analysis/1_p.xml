<p>A total of eight cp genomes, namely seven from Boraginaceae, one from Oleaceae, were used for phylogenetic analysis, along with 
 <italic>Forsythia suspensa</italic> (NC_036367) as outgroup. Of these, 4 chloroplast genome sequences were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We used two matrices, one composed of 72 conserved protein-coding genes (CDS) and one of the whole chloroplast genomes. Using MAFFT ver. 7.388 (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) two data set were aligned, respectively. Each aligned gene was extracted using Geneious program

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) and the GTR+I+G model was chosen for Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis and GTR+G model was selected for Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis. ML analysis was performed using RaxML v 8.0.5 (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. BI analysis was carried out using MrBayes 3.2.2 (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>), with two independent runs of four simultaneous chains that were run for 5,000,000 generations using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Trees were sampled every 5,000 generations, with the first 25% discarded as burn-in. Trees were determined from 50% majority-rule consensus to estimate posterior probabilities. The reconstructed trees were visualized using Figtree V.1.4.2 (
