<p>We sequenced four Boraginaceae accessions: 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> at approximately 601X, 324X, 447X, and 433X coverage, respectively. This generated 1.6–2.0 Gb raw paired-end reads and 1.3–1.7 Gb trimmed reads (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). The complete circular cp genome was 149,316–150,465 bp and matched the quadripartite structure of cp genomes, consisting of a pair of IRs (17,144–17,311 bp) separated by LSC (80,411–81,348 bp) and SSC (25,856–25,979 bp) regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The complete cp genomes were all of high quality (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Overall GC content was approximately 37%, and slightly higher in the IR (43%) than LSC (35%) or SSC (31%) regions. The four cp genomes comprised 112 genes, namely 78 protein-coding, four rRNA, and 30 tRNA genes. They had 18 intron-containing genes, 15 of which had a single intron and two of which (
 <italic>ycf3</italic>, 
 <italic>clpP</italic>) had three introns with duplicate genes (
 <italic>ndhB</italic>, 
 <italic>trnI-GAU</italic>, and 
 <italic>trnA-UGC</italic>) in the IR regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). Analysis of codon usage and anticodon recognition patterns revealed 24,529–25,929 codons, among which leucine, isoleucine, and serine were the most abundant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). To identify codon patterns, we analyzed codon distribution in six cp genomes using the hierarchical clustering method (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Red and green indicate weak (RSCU &gt; 1) and strong (RSCU &lt; 1) codon bias, respectively. Codons with an A or T in the third position had a strong codon bias. Most Boraginaceae displayed a similar pattern, with high RSCU values for GGT (Guanine), AGG (Arginine), and GGG (Guanine); only 
 <italic>B. officinalis</italic> presented particularly low RSCU values.
