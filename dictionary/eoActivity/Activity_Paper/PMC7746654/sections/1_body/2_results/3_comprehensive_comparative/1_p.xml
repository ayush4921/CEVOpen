<p>We compared IR contraction and expansion of the Boraginaceae accessions with those of 
 <italic>Forsythia suspensa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). In spite of similar IR length, from 25,217 to 25,979 bp, differences in IR expansions and contractions were observed. The 
 <italic>rps19</italic> gene of five Boraginaceae (
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>guttata</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>tibetana</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>euchroma</italic>, 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. officinalis</italic>) was located entirely in the LSC region, but was expanded beyond that in 
 <italic>Tiquilia plicata</italic>. The 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> gene was located at the junction of IRb/SSC and SSC/IRa, with the border between IRa/SSC extending into 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>. The IRb/SSC border was also located in the 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> gene, but it expanded by the same length also into the 
 <italic>ψycf1</italic> gene. Overall, IRb was found to be expanded in all cp genomes assessed. The 
 <italic>trnH</italic> gene was located in the LSC region, 16–40 bp from the IRa/LSC boundary. The 
 <italic>rpl2</italic> gene of 
 <italic>T. plicata</italic> was duplicated in the IR regions flanking border junctions. Generally, 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> appeared to be highly conserved.
