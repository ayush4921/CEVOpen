<p>All studied borages presented cyme inflorescences: 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> had scorpioid cymes with paired flowers, 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> displayed crowded cymes with many flowers, and 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> exhibited terminal cymes with numerous flowers. The corolla was yellow with or without dark spots on corolla lobes in 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>), dark purple to purple in 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and white in 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The calyx of the three 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species was 5-lobed; whereas that of 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> was 5-parted and more deeply lobed than in 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> specimens.
