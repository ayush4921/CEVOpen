<p>The family Boraginaceae comprises 90 genera and 1,600 to 1,700 species according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) IV classification system (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2014</xref>). Previous studies based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and a few cp loci have clarified the evolutionary relationships of Boraginaceae. 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cohen (2014)</xref> classified 224 species of Boraginaceae based on their morphological characteristics, whereas 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chac√≥n et al. (2016)</xref> reclassified the monophyletic relationship between previously recognized clades and the position of various unplaced genera using 170 Boraginaceae species. However, lack of genomic resources has prevented the resolution of existing controversies regarding the 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> genus (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Coppi et al., 2015</xref>). At present, the cp genome has been fully sequenced solely in 
 <italic>Borago officinalis</italic> (NC_046796.1), 
 <italic>Onosma fuyunensis</italic> (NC_049569.1), and 
 <italic>Tiquilia plicata</italic> (MG573056). Only additional cp genome data will reveal the phylogenetic relationship between 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and other genera in the Boraginaceae family, as well as correct species classification.
