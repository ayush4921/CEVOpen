<p>Chloroplasts are key organelles in plants, where they mediate photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and biosynthesis of starch, fatty acids, amino acids, and pigments (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Jansen and Ruhlman, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Daniell et al., 2016</xref>). Chloroplast (cp) genomes of angiosperms reach 72 to 217 kb in size (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura, 1992</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and exhibit a quadripartite structure consisting of a large single-copy (LSC) and small single-copy (SSC) of a large inverted repeat (IR) region. Most angiosperm cp genomes contain approximately 80 protein-coding genes, four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and 30 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Wicke et al., 2011</xref>). The angiosperm cp genome structure and gene content are highly conserved due to lack of recombination, maternal inheritance, and elevated copy numbers (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 1987</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Delannoy et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, cp genomes have facilitated species classification, construction of high-resolution phylogenetic trees, and identification of evolutionary relationships in Plantae (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Parks et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, comparative studies of cp genomes provide useful information on gene rearrangements, including expansion or contraction of IR regions, as well as gene content, gene duplication or loss, genetic variance caused by insertion/deletion (indel), single sequence repeats (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism. These genetic markers can be used for species identification and classification, population genetics, and evolutionary studies (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The remarkable reproducibility of methods based on these markers has facilitated the authentication and quality control of herbal medicine (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2018a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Several studies have compared cp genomes to develop indel markers aimed at identifying herbal medicinal plants (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2017</xref>,
