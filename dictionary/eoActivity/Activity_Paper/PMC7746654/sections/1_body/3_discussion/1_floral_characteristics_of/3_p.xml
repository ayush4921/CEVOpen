<p>The observations of members of the tribe Boragineae (genera 
 <italic>Gastrocotyle</italic>, 
 <italic>Hormuzakia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phyllocara</italic>) have revealed that the floral trichome characteristics, such as trichome surface pattern, density, length, and cell number, have taxonomic implications in the context of their generic classification (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bigazzi et al., 1999</xref>). Our floral micromorphological data also confirmed the usefulness of trichome types for the identification of medicinal borage species. The morphology and the distribution of trichomes in 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> were similar to those of 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> (verrucate, non-glandular trichome on both the outer calyx and corolla). In contrast, smooth, hirsute non-glandular trichomes on the outer calyx were exclusive to 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic>; whereas non-glandular and glandular trichomes with stalk on both the outer calyx and corolla were unique to 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>. Hirsute, rigid trichomes form physical barriers against insects as part of a “greasy pole strategy” (

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Sudd and Sudd, 1985</xref>;

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Baker-Meio and Marquis, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Guesdon et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, outer calyx trichomes and outer floral glands on the studied species are probably associated with attracting anti-herbivore protectors. Further morpho-anatomical and histochemical studies are required to confirm their detailed internal structures and functions.
