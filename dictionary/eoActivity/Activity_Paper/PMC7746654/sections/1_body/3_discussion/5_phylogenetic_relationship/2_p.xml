<p>Since 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> was firstly described by 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Kurz (1874)</xref>, this species has been regarded as a synonym of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Kazmi, 1970</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ambrish and Srivastava, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Urgamal et al., 2014</xref>) or as an independent species (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Lazkov and Sultanova, 2014</xref>). In Flora of China, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> is placed as a subspecies owing to its narrow distribution in Xizang, Xinjiang in China, and adjacent Xinjiang in Kyrgyzstan and its absence of blackish purple spots on corolla lobes (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Lazkov and Sultanova (2014)</xref> recognized and listed 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> as independent species in the Flora of Kyrgyzstan on the basis of the different life cycles (
 <italic>A. guttata</italic>, perennial; 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, biennial). During our field survey, we found that the flowers with or without blackish purple spots on corolla lobes in both 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>. The blackish purple spots appear during the flowering season, but disappear after pollination and at withering in 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>. Thus, this traditional diagnostic character for distinguishing 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>) is not useful because they are the seasonal variation. However, based on our consistently observed floral morphological characteristics, such as style lobation, and stigma shape, and genetic distance of cp genomes reported in this study, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> is recognized as an independent species following 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Kurz (1874)â€™s</xref> taxonomic concept with newly found diagnostic characteristics, 2-fid style and oblong stigma.
