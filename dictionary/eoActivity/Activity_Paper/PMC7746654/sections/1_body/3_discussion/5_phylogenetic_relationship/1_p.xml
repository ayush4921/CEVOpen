<p>Complete cp genomes provide sufficient information to study the phylogenetic relationships among plants, including at low taxonomy level and for unresolved taxa (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). ITS and cp loci have confirmed the correct classification of numerous Boraginaceae species and inference of their evolutionary relationships based on morphological characteristics (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2014</xref>). However, the 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> genus maintains an ambiguous phylogenetic position with respect to other monophyletic species and genera, such as 
 <italic>Onosma</italic>, 
 <italic>Cerinthe</italic>, 
 <italic>Moltkia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cystostemon</italic>. This phylogenetic relationship derives from the use of only two 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species out of 224 Boraginaceae. The monophyletic relationship between previously recognized clades and the position of various unplaced genera in Boraginaceae have been reclassified (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chacón et al., 2016</xref>); however, infrageneric classification of 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species has remained unresolved (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Coppi et al., 2015</xref>). Although it comprises only 25–30 species, the genus 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> is valuable in traditional herbal medicine. Here, we attempted to determine phylogenetic relationships within Boraginaceae using cp genomes. ML and BI values based on the whole chloroplast genome and CDS dataset offered powerful evidence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>) of clear species clustering within families according to the APG IV classification system. In Boraginaceae, 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> were found to group monophyletically with a sister group, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, which is consistent with previous findings (
