<p>Usually, angiosperm cp genomes are highly conserved in length, structure, gene number, and gene order (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Jansen and Ruhlman, 2012</xref>). IR contraction and expansion cause the length of the genome to vary (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Raubeson et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we compared six Boraginaceae cp genomes, including 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic>, against 
 <italic>F. suspensa</italic> (family Oleaceae) as reference (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The six Boraginaceae cp genomes were well conserved in terms of gene order and positions. Moreover, except for 
 <italic>T. plicata</italic>, they all indicated IR contraction. Specifically, 
 <italic>rps2</italic> was located in LSC/IRa and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> was identified in the IRa/SSC junction, which overlapped with 
 <italic>ndhF</italic>. These findings revealed the occurrence of IR contraction and expansion, as well as their effect on genome length.
