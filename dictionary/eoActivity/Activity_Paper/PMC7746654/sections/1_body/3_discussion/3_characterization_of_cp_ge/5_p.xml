<p>Taken together, we demonstrated that Boraginaceae chloroplast genomes are similar to other angiosperm genomes, whereas sequence divergence of the chloroplast genome was identified between 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Previously, species identification of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> based on only general morphological characterization was difficult, and their taxonomic classification was also unclear. However, we found the noticed evidence for distinguishing this group. The complete sequences of 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> chloroplast genomes enabled accurate comparative analysis and the identification of species-specific traits for accurate classification of 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species.
