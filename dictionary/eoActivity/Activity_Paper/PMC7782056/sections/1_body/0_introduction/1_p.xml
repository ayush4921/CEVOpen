 <italic>Senna tora</italic> (family: Fabaceae) is ornamental plant belonging to 
 <italic>Cassia</italic> species which is widely distributed in South American and tropical countries. Traditionally, plants belonging to 
 <italic>Cassia</italic> species are believed to possess medicinal values. The wood of 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> can be used to make paper pulp and its fruits are said to be edible (Mak etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which is an important medicinal plant for preventing and treating vascular dementia and widely distributed in China, which has persisted largely in an undomesticated state that is highly resistant to different environmental stresses. Vascular dementia refers to a disease caused by cerebrovascular disorders, with dementia as the main clinical phase. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> can significantly increase the number of capillary networks and accelerate blood flow, thereby restoring the function of microcirculation. At the same time, it can also reduce plasma lactic acid content and improve metabolic disorders caused by cell hypoxia. It plays an important role in preventing and treating vascular dementia. Studies have shown that 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> can reduce the content of lipid peroxide and erythrocyte sorbitol, increase the level of superoxide dismutase, reduce the oxidative stress reaction, and has an antioxidant effect. Studies have also found that 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> can improve the role of vascular dementia. The mechanism may be: the antioxidant effect of drugs, by restoring the structure and function of nerve cells, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, improving blood rheology, and protecting against ischemia. Damaged neurons improve the pathological response of vascular dementia. 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> has high ecological and economic value with high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity. 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> has wide geographic distribution, high intraspecific polymorphism, adaptability to different environments, combined with a relatively small genome size. Consequently, 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> represents an excellent model for understanding how different evolutionary forces have sculpted the variation patterns in the genome during the process of population differentiation and ecological speciation (Neale and Antoine 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, we can develop conservation strategies easily when we understand the genetic information of 
 <italic>S. tora</italic>. In the present research, we constructed the whole chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> and understood many genome varition information about the species, which will provide beneficial help for population genetics studies of 
 <italic>S. tora.</italic>
