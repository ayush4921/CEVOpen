 <p>The complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
  <italic>Senna tora</italic> was characterized from Illumina pair-end sequencing. The chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>S. tora</italic> was 161,050 bp in length, containing a large single-copy region (LSC) of 90,411 bp, a small single-copy region (SSC) of 18,537 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,050 bp. The overall GC content is 36.20%, while the correponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions are 64.5%, 69.4%, and 60.2%, respectively. The genome contains 129 complete genes, including 8 rRNAs, 37 tRNAs and 84 protein coding genes. The Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>S. tora</italic> and 
  <italic>S. bicapsularis</italic> clustered together as sisters to other 
  <italic>Senna</italic> species.
