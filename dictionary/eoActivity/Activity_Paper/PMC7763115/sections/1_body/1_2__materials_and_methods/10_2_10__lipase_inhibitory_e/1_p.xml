<p>EO, 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts of the 
 <italic>Soo</italic> species studied were evaluated for lipase (PPL) inhibitory assay by the modified method, using 
 <italic>p</italic> -nitrophenyl butyrate ( 
 <italic>p</italic> -NPB) as the substrate [39–41]. First, all fractions were dissolved with buffer solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.0) in 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL concentrations. Orlistat, used as a positive control, was prepared in 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL concentrations. The test procedure was designed as I, II, III, and IV wells, described as follows: I, 90 enzyme solution (crude porcine PL type II, 200 units/mL), 5 µL substrate solution (10 mM 
 <italic>p</italic> -NPB in acetonitrile), 5 µL buffer solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.0); II, 90 µL enzyme solution, 10 µL buffer solution; III, 90 µL enzyme, 5 µL sample solution, 5 µL substrate solution; IV, 90 µL enzyme solution, 5 µL sample solution, 5 µL buffer solution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following incubation, substrate solution (10 mM 
 <italic>p</italic> -NPB in acetonitrile) was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a 96-well microplate using a spectrophotometer (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG LABTECH Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Each sample was tested in triplicate. The percentage of PPL inhibitory effect was calculated using the following equation:
