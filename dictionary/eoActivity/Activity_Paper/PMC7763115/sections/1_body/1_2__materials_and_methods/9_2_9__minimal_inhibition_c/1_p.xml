<p>The antimicrobial properties of EO, 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were investigated quantitatively in respective broth media by using double microdilution; the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values (μg/mL) were examined [37,38] and used in our previous work [25,26]. The antibacterial and antifungal assays were carried out in Mueller–Hinton broth (MH) (Difco Laboratories Inc.) at pH. 7.3 and buffered yeast nitrogen base (Difco Laboratories Inc.) at pH 7.0, respectively. The microdilution test plates were incubated for 18 h at 35 °C. Brain heart infusion broth (BHI) (Difco Laboratories Inc.) was used for 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> , and incubated for 48–72 h at 35 °C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that showed no growth. Ampicillin (10 mg/mL), streptomycin (10 mg/mL), and fluconazole (2 mg/mL) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, respectively. The 1/10 dilution of each solvent was used as a control.
