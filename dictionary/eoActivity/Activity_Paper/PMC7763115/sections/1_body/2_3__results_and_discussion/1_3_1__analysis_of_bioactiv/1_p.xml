<p>The VOCs in EO, SPME, and SPME of extracts ( 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) of fresh 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were investigated by GC-FID/MS analysis. The chemical names of the identified volatile constituents of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> , together with their retention indices and percentages, are given in Table 1, where the compounds have been listed in the order of elution on the Restek Rxi-5MS column used [42]. Volatile compounds were identified by comparison of the registered mass spectrum libraries (NIST, Wiley7NL, FFNSC1.2, and W9N11), and by using the Kovats index [23â€“36].
