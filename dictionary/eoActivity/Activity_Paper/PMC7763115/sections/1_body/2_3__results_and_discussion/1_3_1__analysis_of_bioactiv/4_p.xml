<p>In the literature, the relevant components of 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> species were listed as α-amorphene (28.85%), ethyl oleate (15.33%), heneicosane (4.14%), heptadecane (3.96%), 2-heptadecanone (3.42%), and ethyl elaidate (3.39%) in 
 <italic>S. cordigera</italic> [19]; α-amorphene (38.06%), pentadecane (11.13%), propyl undecanoate (5.15%), heptadecane (4.55%), ethyl elaidate and oleate (3.47% and 2.66%, respectively), ethyl stearate (3.33%), and 8-heptadecene (3.02%) in 
 <italic>S. cordigera</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Lucana</italic> [19]; pentadecane (25.43%), 5-nonadecene (14.48%), 1-nonadecene (5.16%), 3-heptadecene (4.33%), benzyl benzoate (4.18%), 2-undecanone (3.31%), and octadecane (3.24%) in 
 <italic>S. vomeracea</italic> [19]; heptadecane (11.70%), 3-heptadecene (8.73%), isopropyl myristate (7.80%), pentadecane (7.41%), nonadecane (6.38%), isopropyl palmitate (4.86%), octadecane (4.49%), and benzyl benzoate (3.80%) in 
 <italic>S. lingua</italic> [19]; pentadecene (7.05%), hexadecane (3.96%), heptadecane (6.38%), nonadecane (4.28%), and ethyl elaidate (4.31%) in 
 <italic>S. parviflora</italic> [19]. In that reported work, most of the volatile constituents were mentioned to be alkanes and alkene-type compounds. In another work, GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane extract of 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> species ( 
 <italic>S. lingua</italic> , 
 <italic>S. parviflora</italic> , 
 <italic>S. cordigera</italic> , and 
 <italic>S. vomeracea</italic> ) revealed C20–C29 alkanes and alkenes [20]. In our study, 
 <italic>n</italic> -decane was the only hydrocarbon found in the EO of 
 <italic>S. orientalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>orientalis.</italic> However, aldehydes (88.6%) in the EO and limonene (76.5%, 41.7%, 61.3%, and 45.3%) and 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) respectively in the SPMEand SPMEs of 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts of fresh 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were the major constituents differing from other 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> species in previous work. Comparison of the present results with the literature suggests that limonene and 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol might be used as taxonomical markers for the future classification of 
 <italic>S. orientalis</italic> . The variations in the VOCs in 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> species may be due to environmental, storage, and analysis conditions. The dominant compounds of the SPME and SPMEs of extracts of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> showed similarities, since all of them are from the same plant. However, they also had several uncommon compounds due to the differences in the extracts.
