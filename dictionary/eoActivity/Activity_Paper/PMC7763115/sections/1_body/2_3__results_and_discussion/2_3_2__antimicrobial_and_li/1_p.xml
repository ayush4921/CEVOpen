<p>Antimicrobial activity of EO and solvent extracts ( 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) obtained from 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were screened by using the agar well diffusion method with the microorganisms seen in Table 2. In general, EO and 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane extract showed moderate antimicrobial activities with inhibition zones of 8/12 mm, 9/12 mm, and 20/8 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> , 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> , and 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> , respectively. Water extract gave better activity against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> , 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> , and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with 15-, 20-, and 10-mm inhibition zones, respectively. Methanol extract showed moderate antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms except for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> The results indicate that antimicrobial activity of EO, 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, and water extracts are more susceptible to gram-positive bacteria. The MIC of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>S. orientalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>orientalis</italic> was within the range of 121.4–3885.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> , 
 <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> , 
 <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic> , 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> , 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> , 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> , and 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> . EO and solvent extracts which contain limonene, 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol, and aldehydes as major components of the samples have been reported to have antibacterial properties [43–46]. Therefore, the bactericidal activity of the EO and solvent extracts obtained from 
 <italic>Soo</italic> may be mainly related to these compounds. Other compounds which were also present in the samples, including capronaldehyde, 2( 
 <italic>E</italic> )-heptenal, octanal, heptanoic acid, pelargonaldehyde, caprylic acid, decanal, methyl nonanoate, undecanal, dodecanal, tridecanal, hexadecanal, palmitic acid, octadecanal, and ethyl oleate, have been reported to have antibacterial properties, and may also collectively have a remarkable contribution to the bactericidal activities of the EO and solvent extracts. Recently, a series of aliphatic aldehydes from olive has been shown to exhibit noticeable activity against several microfungal and bacterial strains [45,46].The antibacterial activity investigation showed variations which may be due to factors such as composition and concentration of the EO and solvent extracts. However, the investigated methanol extract of this plant with its major compound of 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) and limonene (45.9%) showed the highest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> , with 121.4 µg/mL MIC value [38].The greatest lipase enzyme inhibitions [39–41] were obtained for EO and 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane extract of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> with IC 
 <sub>50</sub> values of 59.87 µg/mL and 64.03 µg/mL, respectively (Figure).
