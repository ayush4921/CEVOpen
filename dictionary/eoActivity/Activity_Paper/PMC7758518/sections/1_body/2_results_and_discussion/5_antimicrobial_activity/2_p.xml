 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> show the diameter of the inhibition halos generated by the methanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, respectively. The positive control (Gentamicin) was taken as a reference to determine the antimicrobial activity, presenting a diameter of the inhibition halo ranging from 26 to 33 mm depending on each of the evaluated microorganisms. Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic which action mechanism is through active transport, crossing the cellular membrane of susceptible bacteria and irreversibly binding to the 30S ribosomatic subunits, preventing the start of protein synthesis, and inducing cell death (
