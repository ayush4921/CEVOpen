 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Mostafa et al. (2014)</xref> identified different classes of phytochemicals as fatty acids, sterols and flavonoids in some 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> species. In the present research, the most abundant identified compounds in the extracts of 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> were esters, however, there is a considerable portion of fatty acids such as Erucid acid, which has been reported in the Brassicaceae family, specifically in 
 <italic>E. sativa</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gulfraz et al. (2011)</xref> reported that the Erucic acid present in seeds of 
 <italic>E. sativa</italic>, in both free and tryglyceride form, are responsible for the antimicrobial activity in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, there are also compounds of interest such as Digitoxin, Imidazole, and α-Tocopherol. Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside with a potent antiviral and cancer cell growth inhibition activities (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Imidazole is a heterocyclic ring and a structural part of some alkaloids that confers antifungal and antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Shalini et al., 2010</xref>) and α-Tocopherol is an important natural antioxidant with antiproliferative and protein kinase C-supressing effects (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Engin 2009</xref>). Due to the diverse compounds found with the GC-MS analysis, the phenolic profile of the 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> extract suggests that flavonoid quercetin in conjunction with esters, fatty acids, and other organic compounds could be responsible for the biological activities found in this study.
