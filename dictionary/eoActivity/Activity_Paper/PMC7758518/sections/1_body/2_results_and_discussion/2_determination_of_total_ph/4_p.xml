<p id="p0085">The amount of tannins differed significantly depending on the solvent medium, obtaining minor concentration for the methanol extract in comparison to the aqueous extract (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The concentration of tannins presented by the 
 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers is lower than those presented by other types of hibiscus flowers (2849.4 ± 121.1 and 4420.9 ± 110.7 mg CE/100 g DW), and 
 <italic>Cassia</italic> flowers (1779.8 ± 139.2 and 103.3 ± 6.9 mg CE/100 g DW for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively) (

 <italic>Limonium delicatulum</italic> flowers for methanol and aqueous extracts (48.38 ± 0.70 and 8.14 ± 0.44 mg CE/g DW, respectively) (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Medini et al., 2014</xref>), presenting higher values than these of flowers of 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic>. The presence of tannins can contribute to the elimination of free radicals depending on the number of aromatic rings, molecular weight, and nature of the hydroxyl group substitution (
