<p id="p0075">Plants have a secondary metabolism responsible for the biosynthesis of compounds called secondary metabolites which are involved in various non-essential processes, as stress adaptation, plant-to-plant communication, and pollinator attraction. Phenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins, among other compounds, are examples of secondary metabolites. Phenols are organic compounds that contain at least one phenolic group and an aromatic ring attached to a hydroxyl group. Various biological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal, have been attributed to these specialized compounds (

They are a subclass of polyphenols with an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, antiviral, antibacterial, vasodilator, as well as an antiallergic, and hepatoprotective properties, making these components a focus of scientific interest as possible adjuvants in treatments of a wide variety of diseases including those of microbial origin (
