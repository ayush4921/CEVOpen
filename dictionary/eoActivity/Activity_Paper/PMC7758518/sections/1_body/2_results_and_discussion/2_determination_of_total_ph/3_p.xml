 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers have a higher amount of total phenols, expressed as mg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g DW (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), compared to seed oil (0.02793 mg GAE/g) reported in 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Van-Nieuwenhove et al. (2019)</xref> and compared to the aqueous extracts of flowers reported by 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al. (2013)</xref> (49.80 mg GAE/g), both of the same species. Similarly, the results reported in the present research for total phenols are higher than those reported by 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2014)</xref> for 51 types of edible and wildflowers, with ranges from 0.13 to 11.48 mg GAE/g DW for the water-soluble and fat-soluble fractions, additionally, the total phenolic contents varied from 0.50 to 24.36 mg GAE/g DW. The same trend was observed for Jambu (
 <italic>Acmella olerarea</italic>) flowers, which are used in Amazon food and medicine, for both, in a dry and wet basis (5.65 ± 0.44 and 0.58 ± 0.04 mg GAE/g DW, respectively) (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mak et al. (2013)</xref> showed lower results for ethanol and aqueous of hibiscus flower extracts (45.98 ± 1.07 and 54.36 ± 1.69 mg GAE/g DW, respectively), while for 
 <italic>Cassia</italic> flower extracts (262.24 ± 4.50 and 94.68 ± 1.92 mg GAE/g DW, respectively) the results were superior compared to 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> flowers (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The intrinsic (genetic, extracting solvent) and extrinsic (environmental, handling and development stage) factors have a strong influence on the production of phenolic compounds of plants (
