<p id="p0050">ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethyl benzothiazolin-6-ammonium sulphonate)) assay was performed according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nenadis et al. (2004)</xref>. It was measured at 734 nm (MULTISKAN GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Finland), analyzing the samples in triplicate. The results were expressed as the percentage inhibition of ABTS based on the following formula: 
 <italic>%ABTS_inhibition = [(A.Control)-(A.Sample)/A.Control]∗100 where A.Control</italic> represents the absorbance of the ABTS solution and 
 <italic>A.Sample</italic> represents the absorbance of the sample with ABTS solution.
