<p id="p0010">The abuse and inappropriate utilization of antibiotics to combat infectious diseases caused by microorganisms such as

 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> has generated an increase in antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and a diversification of resistance genes in bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">OMS, 2016</xref>). The immoderate use of these substances in humans, animals, and agriculture, combined with the not biodegradable characteristic of several of these compounds facilitate the transfer of resistant genes (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alós, 2015</xref>). Natural extracts are traditional components in drug development with a special use as natural preservatives that have raised as an alternative for antibiotic treatments. Some of their health-promoting properties are attributed to the presence of compounds with antimicrobial activities (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). The use of natural plant-derived antimicrobials can be highly effective in reducing the antibiotic dependence, minimizing the possibility of pathogen resistance to these components, and representing an alternative to cope with this global problem.
