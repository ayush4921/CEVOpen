  <p>Inhibition percentage of the methanol and aqueous extracts of 
   <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers against microorganisms of interest. White bars indicate percentage inhibition for methanol extract and gray bars correspond to the aqueous extract. Gentamicin was used as a positive control (black bar), presenting a minimum or null bacterial growth. Negative controls (methanol and water) showed no inhibition halos. The results express the average of three independent experiments with three replicates each. Different letters per bar color indicate statistical difference between microorganisms (Tukey Test p &gt; 0.05).
