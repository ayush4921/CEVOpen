<p id="Par119">The survey of cannabis and cannabinoids legalization for medical purposes in Ukraine has covered only the pharmacy students from the Bogomolets National Medical University, which certainly does not present a full picture of the health specialists’ opinion on the issue studied. However, considering its small size, the research is representative and reflects the attitude towards the medical cannabis problem among the students seeking a Specialist’s or Master’s degree in Pharmacy. In reviewing the literature, we have analyzed only those countries’ legislation with medical cannabis and cannabinoids legalized that are the main players in the market of these products. Besides, this analysis is quite workaround and superficial, as it lies beyond the aims of this research. It is necessary for preparing recommendations to develop the relevant legal framework in Ukraine which would enable a decent development of the medical cannabis market. This article also presents the stakeholder and SWOT analyses results. However, since the market of these products is still prohibited in Ukraine, it is rather difficult to identify and evaluate all concerned parties, their goals, interests, expectations, as well as weak and strong points of a potentially new branch and opportunities and threats of its development.</p>
