<p id="Par55">We have developed a questionnaire to study the awareness level of pharmacy students at the Bogomolets National Medical University. The survey took place during April to May 2019. The questions cover such issues as the necessity to provide Ukrainian patients with CBMP, legalization of these products, expediency of conducting this research, incorporation of information on properties of cannabis and cannabinoids in courses for pharmacists, and regulation of these products market. Structure of the questionnaire consists of three parts, namely respondents’ details, main part, and feedback (see the 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">online Appendix</xref>). There are two types of questions in the main part. Some questions include a brief analysis of the problems with medical cannabis and cannabinoids to determine the awareness level of respondents or their opinion on different initiatives on CBMP. The answers to these questions are illustrated in the pie and bar charts. Another type of questions rate the importance of certain issues regarding cannabis for medical and scientific purposes on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is ‘not important’ and 5 is ‘very important’. The survey results were processed with Microsoft Excel. It is worth saying that the developed questionnaire also bears an educational character. Since the information on CBMP is very contradictory and imperfect in Ukraine, there exist many prejudices as to its use-related risks. Besides, many people, including healthcare professionals, are ill-informed on cannabis and cannabinoids use for medical purposes. Thus, 64.5% of respondents noted that they received useful information on medical cannabis and cannabinoids throughout the survey, and 21.8% noted that they would rather receive this information. Also, 50% of students considered the information obtained to be very important for them, and 35.5% marked it as important.
