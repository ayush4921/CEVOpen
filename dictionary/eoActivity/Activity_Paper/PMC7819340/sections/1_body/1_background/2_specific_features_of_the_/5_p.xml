 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). According to the results, 30% of respondents heartily supported to legalization of medical cannabis, 28% partially supported it. However, a quarter of respondents expressed their strong opposition to this initiative. Most often, respondents approving legalization of medical cannabis and cannabinoids are males aged between 18 and 35, having a high-income level and living in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. Opponents of legalization are normally females over 50, with a low-income level, living in the western regions of Ukraine. It stands to reason, that generally a higher education level, broader knowledge, absence of established prejudices influence the positive attitude to medical cannabis legalization.
