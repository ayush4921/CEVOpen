<p id="Par36">Today, the only country in the post-Soviet territory, where cannabis and cannabinoids for medical purposes are legalized, is 
 <bold>Lithuania</bold>. On October 11, 2018, the Saeima of Lithuania voted for amendments introduction into the Laws on Pharmacy and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which came into effect on May 1, 2019. Thus, according to legislative changes, physicians are allowed to prescribe registered cannabis and cannabinoids-based medical products only for certain indications: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, severe forms of epilepsy and oncology diseases (Marijuana Business Daily

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>). In fact, legalization is allowed only for medicinal products based on herbal or synthetic cannabinoids like Sativex, produced by GW Pharmaceuticals, in a similar way to the majority of EU states. The main disadvantage of this approach is the low economic accessability of cannabinoid-based products, because of their high cost and narrow scope of application. At present, despite the official legalization of cannabis and cannabinoids, preparations based on them are practically unavailable for Lithuanian patients.
