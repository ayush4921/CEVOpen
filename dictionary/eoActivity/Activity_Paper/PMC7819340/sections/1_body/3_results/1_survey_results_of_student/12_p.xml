In this respect, it is vital to learn the future pharmacists’ attitude to cannabis legalization not only for medical but also for recreational purposes. So, according to the research result, the majority of students (46%) support only legalization of cannabis and cannabinoids for medical purposes, and 14% do not support it at all.
