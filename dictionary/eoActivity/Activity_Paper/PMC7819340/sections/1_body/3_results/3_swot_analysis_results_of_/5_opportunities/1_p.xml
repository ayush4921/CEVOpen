   <p id="Par88">About 2 million people in Ukraine, according to the Petition “To regulate cannabis for science and medicine means to defend citizens’ constitutional rights”, suffer from diseases that can be relieved by CBMP. Among them are patients with chronic pain, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple sclerosis and other illnesses (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine

   <p id="Par89">The use of cannabis for medical purposes can affect the consumption rate of other preparations, opioid analgesics, in particular, taking into consideration the research results and experience of other countries (Wiese and Wilson-Poe 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2018</xref>; Khan et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>). However, considering a low availability rate of opioids (morphine, fentanyl) in Ukraine, using medical cannabis will allow patients not to substitute, but rather to compensate for their deficit (Institute of Analysis and Advocacy 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>).

   <p id="Par90">CBMP markets are attractive: fast growth rate, high demand index, possibility of differentiating the product portfolio for different market segments, relatively low barriers for entering a new market, which, as a consequence, influences the formation of sustainably profitable business (Grand View Research 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Besides, the emerging new markets facilitate formation of new workplaces, development of small and medium businesses and budget revenues.

   <p id="Par91">Market legalization, concerning cannabis-based products for medical purposes, will facilitate a reduction of illicit volume. As for patients, quality standardized products on a doctor’s recommendations will be available. Potential market participants, for instance, plant growers, will be able to ‘come out of the shadows’ and run their business activity on a legal basis (Global Commission on Drug Policy 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>).

   <p id="Par92">Decriminalization of use and storing cannabis in a limited quantity not for sales can be good for patients because legalization of CBMP, especially in the initial stage, does not always presuppose physical and economic availability of these products. Besides, decriminalization will ease the burden on the state penal setting of Ukraine: 80% of criminal law violations relating to narcotic and psychotropic substances trafficking comprise their use and storage, and not sales. Among narcotic and psychotropic substances seized by law enforcement authorities during 2018, over 70% was cannabis (Center for Mental Health and Drugs and Alcohol Monitoring of Ministry of Health of Ukraine 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).
