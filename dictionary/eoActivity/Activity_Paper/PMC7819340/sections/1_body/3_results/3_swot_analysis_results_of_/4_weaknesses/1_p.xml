   <p id="Par81">The attitude of Ukrainian society towards cannabis is rather constrained. There are prejudices against, for instance, the idea that legalization of medical cannabis can facilitate access to it in the illicit market. According to the survey, 65% of future pharmacy specialists, who support cannabis legalization for medical and scientific purposes, at the same time, believe there is a risk of its illegal circulation.</p>

   <p id="Par82">Evidence-based medicine provides insufficient information regarding the efficiency and safety of medical cannabis for treating various diseases. Its data base is quite moderate and weak so far. Clear evidence relates to cannabis and cannabinoids use in the treatment of muscle spasm in patients with multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain and intractable childhood epilepsy (Barnes and Barnes 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>; European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>).

   <p id="Par83">The absence of clear and unified classification and terminology concerning medical cannabis: there are different definitions to describe the products containing cannabis and cannabinoids and allowed for medical purposes in various countries. Besides, the additional findings are required regarding the scientific research on cannabis plant, interoperation of phyto- and endocannabinoids and other biologically active substances in a human organism (Health Canada 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>).

   <p id="Par84">Low availability of complete and actual data on therapeutic efficiency, possible advantages and risks of cannabis and cannabinoids use for medical and scientific purposes. Thuswise, according to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) report of 2018, the main factors limiting controlled substances availability for patients are the lack of knowledge, addiction development concern, including that of health professionals (International Narcotics Control Board 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>).

   <p id="Par85">Due to a complete statutory ban on cannabis use for medical and scientific purposes in Ukraine, there is almost no practical experience of its cultivation, manufacturing, production, conducting scientific research, etc. As a consequence, the effective functioning of national participants on new potential markets depends also on the time scale. The absence of articles (monographs) in SPhU about cannabis plant and cannabinoids is a restrictive barrier to the production and quality control of CBMP, including an extemporaneous production under pharmacy conditions.</p>

   <p id="Par86">There is a big risk of fungus diseases and microbiological contamination for cannabis plant. These factors are of critical importance for providing the needed quality of herbal substance and, consequently, finished herbal product (Greenwell 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>). Besides, growing of cannabis strains aimed at obtaining a herbal product with a high rate of CBD and/or THC suggests using only female plants: cultivation of a crop containing male plants reduces the rate of cannabinoid contents considerably (Spitzer-Rimon et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>).
