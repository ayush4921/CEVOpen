<p>The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were further evaluated for their cytobiocompatibility analysis against the Vero cell lines (Kidney epithelial cells) in comparison to plant leaf extract and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. As per International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-5, a material could be considered toxic, moderately toxic, weak toxic, and cytobiocompatible if the cell viability (%) is less than 40%, 40 to 60%, 60 to 80%, and greater than 80% respectively. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f009">Figure 9</xref>a. The results of cell viability (%) demonstrated that the chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exhibited the least cytobiocompatibility (77.46 ± 0.31%). On the other hand, plant extract and green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles presented excellent cytobiocompatibility (93.63 ± 0.24% and 88.50 ± 0.85%) with the Vero cell lines, respectively. Our green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exhibited good cytobiocompatibility with the normal cells compared to previous reports [
