<p>Further, the elemental analysis was also carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results are presented are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f003">Figure 3</xref>f. XPS spectrum results indicated the presence of five peaks at binding energies of 284.5, 400.9, 530.9, 576.9, and 586.8 eV. These XPS peaks correspond to C1s, N1s, O1s, Cr2p
 <sub>3/2</sub>, and Cr2p
 <sub>1/2</sub>, respectively [

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles of interest have been successfully green synthesized.
