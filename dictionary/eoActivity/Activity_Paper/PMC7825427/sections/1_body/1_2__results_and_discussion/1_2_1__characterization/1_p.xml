 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet leaf extract was used as a reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. The Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles synthesis was monitored visually by detecting color change upon the addition of metal salt precursor in leaf extract. The color change of the reaction mixture from red to black indicated the formation of desired nanoparticles. This color transition occurred due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon on the nanoparticle’s surface [

 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet leaf extract contains a rich source of biologically active phytomolecules (polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, proteins, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These phytomolecules can act as ligands and chelate with different metal ions to reduce and stabilize their ions to nano form [

 <sub>2</sub>(SO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>), upon dissolution in water, becomes a freely moving ion. The freely moving Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> ions due to electron-deficiency are attracted towards the plant’s phytomolecules (polyphenols, etc.). As a result of this, chelate complex formation occurs between metal ions and the plant’s phytomolecules upon transferring electrons (donor–acceptor mechanism) from oxygen to Cr
 <sup>3+</sup> (

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This leads to the oxidation of polyphenols, flavonoids, etc., and converts them into keto form (

 <sup>3+</sup> is reduced to zero-valent specie Cr
 <sup>0</sup> and simultaneously stabilized by the other plant’s phytomolecules (alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, etc.) present in their vicinity. During air-drying and calcination, they are readily oxidized and converted into Cr
