<p>The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were evaluated for their antibacterial potential compared to the plant extract, chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, and the standard drug against four different pathogenic bacteria, including two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative. The results showed that all the samples presented concentration-dependent antibacterial activity, and the maximum inhibition in the bacteria’s growth was observed with a 20 µg/mL concentration (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exhibited superior antibacterial activity in terms of ZOIs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria compared to the plant extract and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. At all the concentration levels, they presented comparable inhibitory efficacy compared to the standard drug. The results further demonstrated that Gram-positive bacteria were found to be more susceptible than Gram-negative bacteria towards the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. This might be due to the variances in the chemical structure and composition of both the bacteria’s cell wall, and further, their different level of susceptibility towards metal oxide nanoparticles. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, and phospholipids. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria’s cell walls include a thin layer of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid and large pores. Moreover, compared with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria have a high negative charge on the cell wall surface, attracting nanoparticles more efficiently. Hence, the small size of nanoparticles at low temperatures can penetrate, spread, and damage the bacterial cell wall, which leads to bacteria demise [
