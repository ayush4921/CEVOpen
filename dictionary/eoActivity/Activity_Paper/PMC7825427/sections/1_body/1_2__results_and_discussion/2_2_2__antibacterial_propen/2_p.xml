<p>The antibacterial activity of the green synthesized nanoparticles was further confirmed by CLSM, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f005">Figure 5</xref>. SYTO-9 is a membrane-permeant dye which stains live/dead cells. In comparison, PI is an impermeant dye and can only stain dead cells upon its penetration. The PI penetrates the cells only via the dead cells’ burst membrane and subsequently binds to the DNA, emitting a strong red fluorescence [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles appeared red, which showed that the nanoparticles destroyed the bacterial cell’s membrane’s permeability and integrity, leading to cell demise.
