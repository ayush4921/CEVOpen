<p>To further affirm the anticancer activity against MCF-7 cancer cells, the live and dead fluorescence staining assay was employed using CLSM. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f007">Figure 7</xref>eâ€“h shows the live/dead MCF-7 cancer cells stained with green and red dye, respectively. The results demonstrated that green synthesized Cr

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exhibited a maximum cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 carcinoma cells, and they had killed almost 90% cancerous cells (

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles induced a mild toxic effect on MCF-7 cancer cells and destroyed almost 50% of cancer cells. It is interesting to note that leaf extract also presented toxicity on MCF-7 cancer cells indicating that
