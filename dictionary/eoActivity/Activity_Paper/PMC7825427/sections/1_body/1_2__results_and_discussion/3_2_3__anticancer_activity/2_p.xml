<p>Using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200), we further observed the morphological changes in MCF-7 carcinoma cells after their treatment with green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, plant extract, and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles at the concentration of 120 µg/mL. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f007">Figure 7</xref>a–d shows the inverted micrograph of MCF-7 cancerous cells. The images show that after treatment, drastic changes occurred in the morphology of MCF-7 cancer cells. The MCF-cells’ volume and cytoplasm have been decreased, and the shape of the cells changed to round. All the samples induced toxicity, but green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were appeared to pose a significant and severe cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cancer cells.
