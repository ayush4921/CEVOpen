<p>The green synthesized Cr

 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet leaf extract, chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, and the standard drug. The results were shown that all the samples presented concentration-dependent anticancer activity. The maximum cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cancer cells was observed with 120 µg/mL concentration of all the samples (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles compared to 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet leaf extract and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles at all tested concentrations. Moreover, the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles displayed slightly less anticancer activity against MCF-7 carcinoma cells than the standard drug. However, this difference was not sufficient, so we can suggest that they presented comparable levels of anticancer activity to the standard drug at all the tested concentrations. Our green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles displayed better anticancer activity against human breast cancer cells at the 120 µg/mL concentration compared to (500 µg/mL) single-phase Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles synthesized using
