<p>In this work, we synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles using leaf extracts of a medicinal plant (
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet) for the first time, as per the authorâ€™s best knowledge. 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet has been widely employed for treating different kinds of diseases in Tamils, Siddha, Chinese, and traditional Ayurvedic medicine [

 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet is a rich source of different biogenic phytomolecules such as terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, polyphenols, tannins, etc., with various biological applications [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Many useful and biologically active compounds have been isolated from leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many reports are available that highlight the biological importance of this plant [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Till now, many plants have been utilized for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Among the plants used, some are either not biologically active or they are biologically active but have toxic effects. Therefore, nanoparticles for biological applications need to be synthesized with such plants that are biologically active with no toxic effects. In this regard, 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet appeared as a more prominent plant that has both of these properties compared to other plants [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many nanomaterials such as nanoparticles (gold, silver, ZnO, etc.) and nanorods (1D-MoO
 <sub>3</sub>, etc.) have also been synthesized using leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We have previously reported the green synthesis of MnO and CuO using leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we have further utilized this plant for the green synthesis of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. The synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles using leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet were further evaluated for antibacterial, anticancer, biocompatibility, and antioxidant activities. They have presented excellent antioxidant and anticancer activities. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited outstanding antibacterial activity by inhibiting the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Moreover, the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles demonstrated excellent biocompatibility compared to chemically synthesized and already reported Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles.
