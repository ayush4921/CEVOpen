<p>Nanobiotechnology is the intersection of biology and nanotechnology that deals with nanotechnology’s application in different biological systems. Nanobiotechnology further deals with the fabrication of biocompatible, ecofriendly, and biogenic nanomaterials and nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The nanoparticle Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, is of high significance and interest among various metal oxides-based nanoparticles because of its unique physicochemical properties such as a wide bandgap (~3.4 eV), high melting temperature, and increased stability [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles have been widely utilized in different applications, including catalysis, photonics, coating materials, advanced colorants, etc. [

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles are considered the most stable compared to other chromium oxides [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite being a promising material, few studies have evaluated Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles for different biological applications because of their potential toxic effects that have been reported in many studies [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The biocompatibility of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles is an essential parameter for their utilization in different biological systems. The poisonous effects of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles can be reduced by coating or functionalization their surfaces with biogenic materials. One of the most promising ways of achieving this, is surface coating Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> with plants’ biogenic phytomolecules [
