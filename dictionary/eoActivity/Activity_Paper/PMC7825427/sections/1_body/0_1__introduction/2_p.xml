<p>The synthesis of nanoparticles using plants as a precursor has attracted much attention recently. As an alternative to conventional chemical and physical methods, the green synthesis of nanoparticles using biological sources (plants) is an economical, robust, ecofriendly, and easily scalable technique [

Most importantly, nanoparticles synthesized using plants appear to be more biocompatible than those prepared with chemical and physical methods. This is because of the fact that toxic chemicals are used in traditional chemical and physical techniques for synthesizing nanoparticles. After several rounds of washing, these toxic chemicals cannot easily be removed from the nanoparticle’s surface. Therefore, poisonous chemicals present on the nanoparticle’s surface making them less biocompatible and limiting their biological applications. Instead, plant based green synthesis of nanoparticles uses phytomolecules as the reducing and capping agents, and no additional chemicals are required. Moreover, plant biogenic phytomolecules have molecular functionalities that are biologically active and have antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, etc. properties. So, green synthesis using plants enhances the nanoparticle’s biocompatibility and is responsible for the synergetic effect [
