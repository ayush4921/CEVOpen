<p>The XPS of green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was performed using ULVAC-PHI Quantera II (Ulvac-PHI Inc., Chigasaki. Kanagawa, Japan) with the following conditions monochromatic AlKα (hυ = 1486.6 eV) at 25.6 W with a beam diameter of 100 µm. Additionally, pass energy of 280 eV with 1 eV per step was used to perform a wide scan analysis.
