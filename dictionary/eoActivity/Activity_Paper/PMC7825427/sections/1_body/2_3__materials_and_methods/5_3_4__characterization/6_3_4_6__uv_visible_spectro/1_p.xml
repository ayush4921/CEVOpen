<p>The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were dissolved in DI water and sonicated for 5 min at 25–30 °C. The nanoparticles solution and plant extract were then transferred in a quartz cuvette, and after being placed in the cell, the absorption maxima were determined from 200 to 800 nm using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1700, Columbia, Maryland, U.S.A.) at 25–30 °C [
