<p>The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were dissolved in DI water and sonicated for 5 min at 25–30 °C. About 10 mm sample solution was taken out and placed on glass cuvette. After that, the cuvette was placed in the cell holder, and scanning was performed using a dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS, Worcestershire, WR14 1XZ, UK) from 1 to 100 nm at 25–30 °C [
