<p>The antioxidant activity of the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles in terms of linoleic acid (%) inhibition was determined compared to plant extracts and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, following the protocol reported by [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In detail, 100 µg/mL concentration of each sample was added to the solution mixture of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 10 mL), 99.99% ethanol (10 mL), and linoleic acid (0.13 mL). The resulting solution’s total volume was made up to 25 mL with DI water and subsequently incubated for 360 hours at 40 °C. The extent of oxidation was measured using the thiocyanate method. Accordingly, 0.2 mL of the sample solution was taken and then added to 10 mL of ethanol (75%). Subsequently, 0.2 mL of aqueous ammonium thiocyanate solution (30%) and 0.2 mL FeCl
 <sub>2</sub> (20 mM in 3.5% HCl) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 min, and the absorption maxima were then measured at 500 nm wavelength. The percentage inhibition of linoleic acid was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = [100 − (Absorbance of sample)/(absorbance of control)] × 100
