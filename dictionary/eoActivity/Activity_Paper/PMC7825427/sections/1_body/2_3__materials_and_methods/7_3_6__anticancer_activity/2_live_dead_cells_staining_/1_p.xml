<p>We further investigated the MCF-7 carcinomatous cell viability with the fluorescent staining technique to affirm the cytotoxicity using the live/dead double staining kit (viable cells stain with green and dead cells with red). The same experiment was repeated as described above till cancer cells treated with different samples (10 µL of 120 μg/mL) and subsequent incubation. After, the staining solution (4 μg/mL) was added to each well at 37 °C and incubated for 20 min. Photographs were taken with a fluorescence microscope (excitation wavelength 488/545 nm for viable/dead cells).</p>
