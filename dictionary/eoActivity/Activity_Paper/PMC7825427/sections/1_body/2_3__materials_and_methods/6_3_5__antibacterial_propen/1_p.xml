<p>The antibacterial propensity of the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was determined using agar well diffusion assay against four different bacterial strains (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 23235™, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 6051™, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 25922™, and 
 <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 4617™), following the protocol previously reported by [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The antibiotic drug (Leflox) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. Four concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 µg/mL) of each sample were prepared in DMSO. For antibacterial activity, washed petri-dishes and freshly synthesized media (nutrient agar) were sterilized by an autoclave for 15 min at 121 °C. The sterilized molten nutrient agar (30 mL) was poured into petri-dishes as a basal layer and set aside for a moment to form a solid gel, and subsequently, 3.5 mL of inoculum of each bacterium inoculated. The inoculum of each bacteria strain was prepared at 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. The holes were then bored at four peripheral positions using a sterilized hollow iron rod. The holes were then filled with 20 µL of sample, positive and negative control dilutions. The petri-dishes were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in an incubator. After 24 h, the clear zones of inhibition (ZOIs) were observed around the holes. The diameter of the ZOIs was recorded using a ruler in millimeters. The experiment was repeated three times.
