<p>To further confirm the antibacterial activity of green synthesized Cr

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, a live and staining assay was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, FV-1200, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) following the protocol reported by [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The two fluorescent dyes SYTO-9 and propidium iodide (PI) were used for staining the live (green) and dead (red) bacteria, respectively. Each bacterium was cultured in a nutrient broth and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to obtain the confluence of 10

 <sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU) per mL. After, bacteria were inoculated onto pasteurized cover glass coated with poly-L-lysine in 24-microtitre well plate and placed in an incubator for incubation for 1 hour to allow bacterial cells to attach to the cover glass. The suspended bacterial cells were then removed, and the cover glass was gently rinsed three times using a saline solution. Each bacterium on the cover glass was treated with 20 µg/mL concentration of green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles and incubated again at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacteria on cover glass were then stained with a live/dead bacterial viability kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The bacterial cells were analyzed with CLSM at 485 nm excitation wavelength for SYTO-9 and PI and 530 nm emission wavelength for SYTO-9 while 630 nm for PI. We only considered green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles for live/dead staining assay as they presented excellent antibacterial properties in terms of ZOIs.
