<p id="p0165">The five selected phytoconstituents of 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> have been docked against the prostaglandin – 1 (PDB ID: 2OYE) and prostaglandin – 2 (PDB ID: 6COX) receptors. The docking score and glide energy has been determined and presented in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Besides, the best docking figures are presented in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. From the table, it can be distinguished that, pongamol uncovered the highest (−10.42 kcal/mol) docking score through the binding of residues (ser353, ile523, gly526, tyr385, trp347 and ala527). Besides, milletenone showed the lowest (−7.43 kcal/mol) docking score with the interaction of 2OYE receptor. The ranking of the docking is as follows: pongamol &gt; Kanjone &gt; Lanceolatin–B &gt; Ovalitenone &gt; milletenone. Similarly, the interaction of the selected compounds and the 6COX enzymes yields the docking score ranging from −6.27 kcal/mol to −8.33 kcal/mol. The docking scores are ranked as follows: Lanceolatin– B &gt; Kanjone &gt; Ovalitenone &gt; Milletenone &gt; Pongamol. Lanceolatin – B binds with the receptor through the glu43, asp40, arg35, tyr113, leu89, asp83 and arg87 residues.
