<p id="p0170">In this study, the selected phytoconstituents have been docked against 5-HT3 receptor (PDB ID: 5AIN). The ranking of the molecular docking is: Milletenone &gt; Lanceolatin–B &gt; Ovalitenone &gt; Kanjone &gt; Pongamol. The docking score range from −4.68 kcal/mol to −6.94 kcal/mol. Milletenone showed highest docking score through the binding of hydrogen bond by the series of residues namely arg87, glu43, asp40, arg35, tyr113, leu83, asp83 and arg87 which are represented in
