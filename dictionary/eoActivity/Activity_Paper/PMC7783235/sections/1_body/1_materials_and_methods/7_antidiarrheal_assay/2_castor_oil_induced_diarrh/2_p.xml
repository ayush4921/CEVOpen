 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Shoba &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>) with minor modification. In this study, mice were randomly allocated to four groups comprising of six mice in each group. The test animals fastened overnight with free access to water. 0.5 mL castor oil was administered to the mice and then only those indicating diarrhea were chosen for the experiment. Besides, the animals of group I (control) received vehicles (distilled water containing 1% Tween-80); Group-II (positive control/standard drug) received a standard anti-motility drug named loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight). Group III, group IV, (test groups) were treated with a suspension of MEMP at the oral dose of 200 and 400 (mg/kg body weight) respectively. One hour after administering test samples, all mice received 0.5 mL of castor oil, and afterward, they were independently placed in the enclosure’s floor of which was fixed with transparent paper. During the observational period, the onset of diarrhea, number and weight of wet stools, the total number and the total weight of feces yields were recorded. The count continued until the four hours before the administration of castor oil, and the average values were considered final results.
