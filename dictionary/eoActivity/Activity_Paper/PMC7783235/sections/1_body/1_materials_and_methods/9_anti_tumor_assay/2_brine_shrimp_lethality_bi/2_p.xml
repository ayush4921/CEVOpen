<p id="p0090">The brine shrimp lethality bioassay was performed to evaluate the possible cytotoxicity using related techniques (
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1982</xref>). In this study, 38 g NaCl salt was dissolved in 1000 mL of distilled water to make simulated seawater and pH (8.0) was maintained by adding NaOH. The plant extract was dissolved in DMSO (50 μL in 5 mL solution) to prepare the test sample with simulated seawater followed by the preparation of serially diluted concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 μg/mL. Vincristine sulfate was used as a positive control in a serial concentration dilution of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 μ /mL as the preceding form. Then ten matured live shrimp were put in all the test tubes at ambient temperature (25 ± 1 °C) and each test tube was measured after 24 h. The number of death nauplii was counted as well as recorded.
