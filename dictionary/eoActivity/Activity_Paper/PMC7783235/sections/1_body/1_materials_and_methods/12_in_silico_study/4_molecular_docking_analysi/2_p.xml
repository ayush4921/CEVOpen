<p id="p0115">PyRx Autodock Vina has been used for the protein-ligand linking process of the chosen protein-ligand complexes (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Herowati &amp; Widodo, 2014</xref>). The docking study was employed with a semi-flexible docking system. Using PyRx AutoDock software, PDB files of phytochemicals and proteins have been transformed into PDBQT format. This study has maintained the rigidity of proteins and the flexibility of ligands. Ligand molecules had 10 degrees of liberty. AutoDock defines the steps to transform molecules into pdbqt format, sort of box, grid box creation, etc. The grid box was generated in the center of the box with an active site. Finally, BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020 (
