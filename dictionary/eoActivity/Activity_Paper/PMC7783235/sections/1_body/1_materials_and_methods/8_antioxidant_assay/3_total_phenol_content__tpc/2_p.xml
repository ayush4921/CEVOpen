<p id="p0085">The total phenolic content of 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> leaves was estimated by following the previously described technique of Skerget et al (
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Škerget et al., 2005</xref>). The Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was employed as an oxidizing agent, whereas gallic acid was considered as a reference. In addition, 2 mg 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> leaves extract was used to prepare a sample solution, vehicle (2 mg/mL), MEMP (0.5 mL) and FCR (2.5 mL) and sodium bicarbonate (2 mL) solution were mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then the absorbance values were measured by a UV spectrophotometer at 760 nm and from this data the total phenol content values were measured. The standard curve was also prepared from gallic acid solution using different concentrations. The unit of phenol content is expressed as mg of GAE (gallic acid equivalent)/gm of the extract.
