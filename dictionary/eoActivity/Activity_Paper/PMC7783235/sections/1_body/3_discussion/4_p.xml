<p id="p0210">Diarrhea is an alteration of intestinal motility and accumulation of fluids along with heightened peristalsis by interfering with the electrolyte permeability of the intestinal membrane (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Bristy et al., 2020</xref>). Infectious diarrhea is caused by the colonization and spreading of infectious agents, mostly 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2012</xref>), and traditional approaches have been found effective against these pathogens (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Kone et al., 2004</xref>). Phytochemicals extracted from various plants have been reported to function as antidiarrheal agents by increasing the absorption of liquids from the intestine and decreasing gastric motility (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Agbor et al., 2004</xref>). The MEMP study reported promising antidiarrheal activity due to the presence of several phytoconstituents, namely flavonoids which can display antidiarrheal potentiality (
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Otshudi et al., 2000</xref>). Flavonoids may also express this activity through the reduction of small and large intestinal motility (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Capasso et al., 1991</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Meli et al., 1990</xref>) and bowel contraction. Methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> exhibited prominent antidiarrheal property at higher doses (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and revealed a dose-dependent pattern. The leaves displayed notable antidiarrheal efficacy by alleviating the average weight of both total and wet faeces along with a total number of faeces at 400 mg/kg dose which is close to loperamide introduced as a standard drug to treat diarrheal state in this study.
