<p id="p0225">Among the docking study of the 5 selected compounds i.e. flavonoids suggest that kanjone, lanceolatin – B, milletenone, ovalitenone and pongamol may be the responsible bioactive phytochemicals for potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. kanjone, lanceolatin – B, milletenone, ovalitenone are highly accountable for the antidiarrheal activity. Lanceolatin - B is modestly responsible for the antioxidant activity. kanjone, lanceolatin – B, milletenone, and ovalitenone are significantly responsible for the cytotoxic activity. kanjone and ovalitenone are responsible for the antibacterial potentiality. Furthermore kanjone, lanceolatin – B, milletenone, ovalitenone and pongamol and highly liable for the thrombolytic potentiality of the plant. According to the Glide Docking score and Glide energy we can see that among these five compounds lanceolatin – B, ovalitenone, kanjone, and pongamol are the potent compounds, although further biological studies are needed to explore their in-depth mechanism of action. All the compounds obsessed a higher fascination towards the ligand binding domain of prostaglandin – 1, prostaglandin – 2, 5-HT3 receptor, urate oxidase, crystal structure of GABA (B), 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> exonuclease I and human tissue-type plasminogen activator enzyme and strong ligand-receptor complex creation may be responsible for the antagonism of these receptors. For naturally occurring product, virtual testing is important to search for active principles with attractive ADME/T profiles that have formerly been separated but not analyzed for activity against specific drug targets (
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The ADME and toxicity profiles of the compounds kanjone, lanceolatin – B, milletenone, ovalitenone and pongamol are found good with very mild toxicity which is essential to be a possible drug.
