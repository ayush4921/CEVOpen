<p id="p0205">The human body produces thousands of chemical reactions through various catabolism and anabolism processes. These different reactions that encourage pain, inflammation, oxidative stress are triggered by inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) (
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>). Sources of inflammation like microbial attack or tissue injury cause the rush of defense cells like leukocytes to the site of injury which is set off by receptors like TLRs (toll-like receptors) and NLRs (NOD-like receptors) (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) inhibition of writhing and licking compared to standard. The result exhibited that increasing the dose of MEMP can promote better inhibition of writhing as well as paw licking in mice model which indicated a potential dose-dependent relationship. Thus, it can be assumed that the secondary metabolites specially flavonoids, present in MEMP may suppress the analgesia by reducing inflammatory response.
