<p id="par0160">The gas chromatogram shows that the relative concentration of various compounds getting fractionated at their specific retention time. A total set of 40 peaks were obtained from the chloroform crude extract of KD155 run for 26.59 min (
 <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). All the compounds and their molecular weights present at respective peaks were analysed using NIST database to locate the probable compound as well as their molecular weight (
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The heights of the percentage of peak area indicate the relative concentrations of the components present in the chloroform crude extract of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155. 4 peaks at RT 15.24, 16.21, 18.49 and 20.55 showed more % area coverage i.e., 23.27, 17.69, 12.95 and 6.82 respectively. Phenol, 3,5 bis (1,1dimethylethyl), Phenol, 2,4 bis (1,1dimethylethyl) and Phenol, 2,5 bis (1,1dimethylethyl) were identified as major contributor at retention time of 15.24 min.
