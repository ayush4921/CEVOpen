<p id="par0120">The bacterial strain KD155 was found to be Gram-negative rod shaped bacterium. The colony showed blue green colouration having entire margins. The cell was found to be motile and non-spore former. The strain KD155 could grow up to 35 Â°C and pH 8 with 3 % NaCl tolerance. KD155 demonstrated positive result towards oxidase production, gelatine hydrolysis, citrate utilisation, nitrate reduction and could only utilized glucose as the carbon source out of four tested carbohydrate sources. The isolate showed clear zone in casein and starch hydrolysis indicating the production of extracellular enzymes i.e., gelatinase and amylase respectively. The cultural, morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of the strain KD155 are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain KD155 was analysed using NCBI GenBank database. The phylogenetic tree of the strain KD155 was constructed from the sequences of closely related strains using neighbor-joining method is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The strain has got maximum 16S rRNA gene sequence homology (100 %) with 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain BUFF12 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence (MH375412). Therefore, on the basis of cultural, morphological, physiological, biochemical and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, the isolate KD155 was designated as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain KD155. The 16S rRNA gene partial sequence of the isolate KD155 has been deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number MK801234.
