<p id="par0200">The FT-IR analysis of chloroform extract of KD155 proved the presence of aliphatic compounds, alcohols, nitro compounds, alkanes and hydrogen bond alcohols at their respective peaks. The OH group detected is able to form hydrogen bonding that probably related with the higher inhibitory activities of alcohols and phenolics against microorganisms [

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also indicated the presence of –OH group and the appearance of bands between 3000−2900 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> is an indication of C aromatic compound [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Due to the presence of aromatic compound, vibrations of carbon stretching in the aromatic ring shows absorptions in the regions 1618–1660 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. It is suggested that, less hydroxyl groups in the molecular structure of compound may reduce the antimicrobial activity [
