<p id="par0175">Among both of the tested extracellular extracts, chloroform extract showed better inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in comparison to ethyl acetate extract. Metabolites obtained from 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed good antimicrobial property against 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella sp, S. typhi, Shigella sp.</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Apart from this, some pathogens were not inhibited by the crude extracts which may be due to the disintegration of some metabolites during extraction process [

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The results clearly demonstrate difference between the activity of crude extracts and pure antibacterial and antifungal drug (tetracycline and ketoconazole) showing higher, equivalent or lesser zone of inhibition. Rex et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] observed a marked difference in the crude (unpurified) extracts in comparison to pure drug that was already in clinical use. Kennedy et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] isolated 
 <italic>P. putida</italic> from rhizospheric soil, which produces 5-methyl phenazine-1-carboxylic acid betaine (MPCAB) showing considerable amount of antimicrobial potential against human pathogen. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. isolated from wheat rizosphere soil was known for its antifungal potential which is due to the production of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid [
