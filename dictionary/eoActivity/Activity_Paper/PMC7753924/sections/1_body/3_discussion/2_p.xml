<p id="par0165">For the development of novel or more potent bioactive metabolites, screening of microbial strains belonging to underexplored or extreme environments is among one of the most efficient approach [

 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The ability of these strains for producing antimicrobials may be associated with defensive or aggressive roles in order to maintain their ecological niche in such environments, which on the other hand is known to be strongly influenced by natural selection [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. With this perspective, an antimicrobial agent producing bacterial strain KD155 was isolated from the cow dung of desi breed from Uttarpradesh (India). Previously, this bacterium was reportedly isolated from cow dung slurry [
