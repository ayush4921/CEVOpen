<p id="par0115">GC-MS analysis of the crude extracellular extract of cow dung bacterial isolate KD155 was performed using the Thermo Scientific TSQ 8000 Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer, Thermo MS DSQ II. The equipment has a DB 35-MS Capillary Standard non-polar column with dimensions of 30 mm × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film. The carrier gas used is Helium with at low flow of 1.0 ml/min. The injector was operated at 350 °C and the oven was operated at an range of 60 °C–280 °C for 15 min-30 min. The identification of components was based on NIST libraries by comparing their retention indices. The constituents were identified with those available in the computer library (NIST and Willey) attached to the GC-MS instrument [
