<p id="par0105">HPTLC analysis was performed with CAMAG-Linomat and TLC Scanner in pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 of uniform thickness 0.2 mm and a size of 5 × 10 cm. The method was standardized by running different solvents at 254 and 366 nm. Approximately 10 μl of samples and the standard solution was used for the spotting. After saturation time, the spots were analyzed in UV spectra for the similarity of peaks and retardation factor (Rf) value [
