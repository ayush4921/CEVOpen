<p id="par0110">The IR spectra of chloroform extract was determined on Perklin Elmer spectrophotometer in the mid IR region from 4000−400 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> at a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> using FTIR spectrophotometer coupled with TGS (Triglycine Sulfate) detector. For FTIR analysis, 1 mg of dried sample was mixed with 100 mg of pure Potassium bromide (KBr) of AR grade, dried under vacuum at 100 °C and compressed to prepare salt disc (3 mm). Intensity was plotted against wave number to get the desired spectrum [
