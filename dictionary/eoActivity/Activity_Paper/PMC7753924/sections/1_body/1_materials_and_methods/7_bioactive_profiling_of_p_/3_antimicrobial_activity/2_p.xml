<p id="par0080">Antimicrobial activity of crude extracts was carried out against test strains using agar well diffusion method [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Petri plates were prepared and test strains were swabbed on solidified media. Agar wells (4 mm diameter) were prepared and 100 μl of both crude extracts and positive controls were carefully dispensed into each well, allowed to diffuse for 2 h, and incubated at 35 ± 1 °C for 24−48 hrs. After incubation, zone of inhibition around each well was recorded. Solely DMSO was included as negative control while tetracycline (30 mcg) and ketoconazole (10 mcg) were incorporated as positive control. Each experiment was performed in duplicates.
