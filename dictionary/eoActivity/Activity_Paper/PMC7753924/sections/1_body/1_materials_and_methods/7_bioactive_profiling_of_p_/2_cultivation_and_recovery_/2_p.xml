 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 culture was transferred into the flask containing 500 ml of beef peptone broth and incubated in shaker incubator at 150 rpm for 2 days at 35 Â± 1 
 <sup>o</sup>C. Following incubation, the liquid culture and biomass was separated through centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min, and cell-free supernatant was collected separately. Metabolites from supernatant were extracted by manual shaking thrice with equal volume of ethyl acetate and chloroform (1:1) in a separating funnel. The organic layer was concentrated using the vacuum rota evaporator. The resulting crude extract was recuperated in DMSO and bioassayed against test strains [
