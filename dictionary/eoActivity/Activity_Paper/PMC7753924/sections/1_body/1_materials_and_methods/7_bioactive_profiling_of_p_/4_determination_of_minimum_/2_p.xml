<p id="par0085">MIC of crude extracts was determined by two fold dilution methods with minor modifications as described by Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The sterile 96 well micro-titre (12 × 8) plate was labelled accordingly and crude extract (200 μl) was pipetted into the first well acting as stock solution. Further, 100 μl of Mueller Hinton broth fortified with 0.01 % of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride salt (TTC) as growth indicator was added in remaining wells. 100 μl of crude extract were transferred from stock to the next well subsequently so that each well had test material in decreasing concentrations. The test strains were added at a concentration of 10 μl to each well [
