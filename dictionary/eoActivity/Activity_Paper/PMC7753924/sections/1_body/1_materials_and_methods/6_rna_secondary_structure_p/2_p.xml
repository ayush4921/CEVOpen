 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> KD155 were submitted to the Mfold web server. Different parameters such as exterior loop type, bulge loop size, base numbering frequency, structure draw mode, structure annotation and structure rotation angle were fixed. The folding process was predicted at 37 Â°C and under ionic conditions of 1 M NaCl deprived of divalent ions and restriction site was identified using NEB cutter online tool version 2.0 (nc2.neb.com/nebcutter2/) [
