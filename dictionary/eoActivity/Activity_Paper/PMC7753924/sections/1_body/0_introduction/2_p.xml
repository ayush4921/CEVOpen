<p id="par0030">Disease causing pathogens are constantly become resistant towards commercially available antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This problem is of great concern for clinicians, public health officials and researchers due to substantial morbidity, mortality and increasing cost of treatment [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>]. World health organisation (WHO) has already warned that the world is heading back to the pre-antibiotic era regarding therapy for these multiple antibiotic-resistant pathogens [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There is a gradual increase in infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. Because of the production of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) by bacteria, even fourth generation of cephalosporin and other antibiotics are now being threatened [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to the development of pathogen resistance against existing medicines and appearance of new diseases leads towards an alarming scarcity of new antibiotics [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Bacteria living in stressful ecological habitats may give rise to novel and potent metabolites which may serve as broad-spectrum antibiotics, targeting the medically important pathogens. Researchers around the world are continuing their effort to isolate bacteria capable of producing bioactive compounds from a range of different habitat such as Camel milk [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], soil [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], marine habitats [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], fermented foods [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], sponges [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and endophytes [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>]. Thus, continuous search of bacteria capable of producing useful bioactive compounds from untapped sources especially natural ones like wild plants, endophytic microorganisms, marine environment and even from the gut of animals and insects is a significant aspect of ongoing research.
