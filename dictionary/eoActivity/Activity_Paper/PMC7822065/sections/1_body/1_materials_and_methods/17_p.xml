<p>Methyl 4-(4-(1H-indol-3-yl)butanamido)benzoate (
 <bold>I1b</bold>). To a solution of IBA (a) (1.0 g, 5 mmol) in DCM (50 ml), Et
 <sub>3</sub>N (0.55 g, 5.5 mmol) and TBTU (1.8 g, 5.5 mmol) were added in turn. After 20 min, methyl 4-aminobenzoate hydrochloride (0.94 g, 5 mmol) and Et
 <sub>3</sub>N (0.50 g, 5 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. Then, the solvent was evaporated with the residue being taken up in EtOAc (50 ml). The EtOAc solution was washed with saturated citric acid (3 × 20 ml), NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (3 × 20 ml), and brine (3 × 20 ml), dried over MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, and evaporated under vacuum. The desired compound 
 <bold>I1b</bold> (1.2 g, 72% yield) was derived by crystallisation in EtOAc as white powder. HRMS
