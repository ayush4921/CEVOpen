<p>All commercially available starting materials, reagents and solvents were used without further purification. All reactions were monitored by TLC with 0.25 mm silica gel plates (60GF-254). UV light and ferric chloride were used to visualise the spots. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX spectrometer at 500 MHz, using TMS as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra were performed in Weifang Medical University.
