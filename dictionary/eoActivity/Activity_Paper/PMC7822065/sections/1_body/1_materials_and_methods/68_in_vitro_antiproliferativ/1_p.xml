<p>Tumour cell inhibition was determined using the MTT assay using SAHA as the control. U266 and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The stock solutions of tested compounds were diluted with culture medium. Briefly, the cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plate, which were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until confluency 90–95%. Then, the cells were treated with compound sample at various concentrations for 48 h. Afterward, 20 MTT working solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 h. After incubation, the medium formed from MTT was extracted by adding DMSO (200 µl). The optical density (OD) at 490 nm and 630 nm were measured by Universal Microplate Spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell growth inhibition was calculated according to the formula: % inhibition = [1 – (Sample group OD
 <sub>490</sub> – Sample group OD
 <sub>630</sub>)/(Control group OD
 <sub>490</sub> – Control group OD
 <sub>630</sub>)] × 100%. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated with Origin 7.5 software (Originlab Corporation, Northampton, MA), and standard deviations of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained through at least 3 independent experiments.
