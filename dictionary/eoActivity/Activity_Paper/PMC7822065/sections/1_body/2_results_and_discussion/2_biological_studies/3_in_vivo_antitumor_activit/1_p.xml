<p>To further investigate anticancer potency of the derived molecules, molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited both good water solubility and high antiproliferative potency was selected for the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-proliferation assay. Considering the tumourigenicity and sensitivity to the synthesised molecules, HepG2 cell line was selected for the inoculation of xenograft model. To preliminarily investigate the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-proliferation ability of molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold>, only one concentration (50 mg/kg/d) was utilised and SAHA (100 mg/kg/d) was used as a positive control. After 16 days of intragastric administration, the mice were executed, and the tumour weight was measured. The mean weight of tumours in the negative control group was 0.453 g (SD 0.10), and the values of SAHA groups and 
 <bold>I13</bold> group were 0.322 g (SD 0.06) and 0.303 g (SD 0.07), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The inhibitory ratio of molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> was 33.1% compared with SAHA with a value of 29.0% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The result showed that 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited anti-tumour activity at dose of 50 mg/kg/d compared with a higher dose of SAHA (100 mg/kg/d). The tumour volume was measured every two days, and the result has correlation with the tumour weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figures 2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">3</xref>). No evidence of mice body weight (measured every two days) loss indicated that molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> is safe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(d)</xref>). Moreover, no obvious toxic signs in liver and spleen were detected.
