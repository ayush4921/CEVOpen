<p>To investigate the enzyme inhibitory potency of the synthesised molecules, an enzymatic assay was performed using HeLa nucleus extract containing a mixture of HDAC isoforms. In the screening, percentage inhibition rate (PIR) at the concentration of 1 µM was used as a measure of compound potency. The overall result revealed that molecules with hydroxamic acids as ZBGs have better inhibitory activities (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) than those with hydrazide ZBGs (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited the highest inhibitory potency with PIR of 82.19. Small sized alkyl substituents in the R
 <sub>1</sub> position showed optimal HDAC inhibitory activity, such as 
 <bold>I3</bold> (R
 <sub>1</sub> of ethyl group, PIR of 78.94) and 
 <bold>I13</bold> (R
 <sub>1</sub> of methyl group, 82.19). While molecule 
 <bold>I12</bold> with bigger sized n-butyl group exhibited reduced activity with PIR of 62.70. Among the aromatic substituted R
 <sub>1</sub> groups, the 1,6-2F and 4-CF3 substitution in the phenyl ring showed good inhibitory activities with PIR values of 79.10 (
 <bold>I10</bold>) and 68.50 (
 <bold>I4</bold>), respectively. In the hydrazide series, 
 <bold>I1e2</bold> and 
 <bold>I2e2</bold> with n-propyl substituted R
 <sub>2</sub> group exhibited good performance with PIR of 61.34 and 57.16, respectively, compared with SAHA (PIR of 59.91). The lysate-based enzymatic test method may affect the performance of hydrazide containing molecules. The recombinant HDAC enzyme based assay will be used for further more accurate illustration of derived HDACIs.
