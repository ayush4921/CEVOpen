<p>Based on lead structure IBHA, a series of indol-3-ylbutyric acid derivatives were synthesised according to the procedures described in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH001">Scheme 1</xref>. The starting material IBA was coupled with a series of bromobenzene. The other material, 4-aminobenzoic acid, was protected by a methyl ester. The intermediates I1b窶的13b were derived by conjugation of b and I1a窶的13a. Target molecules I1窶的17 were synthesised by treatment of corresponding intermediates (I1b窶的13b) with NH
 <sub>2</sub>OK in methanol. The hydrazide compounds were generated by hydrazinolysis, condensation, and reduction reactions.
