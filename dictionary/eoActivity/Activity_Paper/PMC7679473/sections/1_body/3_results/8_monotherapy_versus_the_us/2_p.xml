It is important to note that the mixture of two or more ingredients was the most common mode of use described among the informants. The storage and consumption of dried medicinal plants was also reported especially for species which are not available throughout the year. The most indicated remedies consisted of mixtures of more than one natural product associated with additives or excipients such as honey, olive oil, milk, butter, vinegar, animal fat or even Zamzam water.
