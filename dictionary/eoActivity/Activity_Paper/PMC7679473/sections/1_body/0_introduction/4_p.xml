<p id="p0015">Moreover, natural products have received an increasing consideration for their potential use as novel cancer therapeutic agents since they hold a variety of important bioactive compounds acting as inhibitors of various stages of tumorigenesis and associated inflammatory processes (
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Amaral et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, more than 60% of anticancer drugs are derived from natural products although medicinal plants are considered the most important source by around 75%. Over 3000 plants have been reported at present worldwide to hold potential anticancer molecules and most of those are yet to be discovered (
