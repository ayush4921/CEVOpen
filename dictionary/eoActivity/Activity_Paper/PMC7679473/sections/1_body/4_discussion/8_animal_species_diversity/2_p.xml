<p id="p0210">Likewise, zootherapy based on the use of animals or animal derived products has been practiced in traditional medicine of various cultures at the same extent as phytotherapy (

 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Alves and Rosa, 2007</xref>). Recently, animal products are increasingly used as raw materials in the preparation of modern medicines and herbal preparations (
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Alves and Rosa, 2005</xref>). In this study 10 animal species have been reported for the treatment of cancer. With regards to their habitat type, 7 animal species are terrestrials, 2 are aquatic species and 1 amphibian. In fact, the use of zootherapy in traditional medicine is related to the faunal composition and the relative abundance of animal species in the given region in which the people live (

Interestingly, several natural products secreted from frog skins have been reported as novel and potent antimicrobial and anticancer peptide agents; 
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. (2012)</xref> have described Brevinin as potentially useful new anticancer peptide agent against several tumor cell lines namely skin (SK-MEL-2), lung (A549), stomach (MKN45), colon (HCT116), kidney (A498), prostate (PC-3) and ovary (SK-OV-3). Later, 
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Hassanvand Jamadi et al. (2019)</xref> have stated the significant anticancer activity of Brevinin in vitro on human breast (MCF-7) and lung (A549) cancer cells with less cytotoxic effects on human red blood cells. By the same, Temporin is another natural frog product characterized by its cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and capable to induce cell death (
