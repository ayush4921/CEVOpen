 <sub>IC</sub> values ranged from 0.50 to 0.90 revealing high homogeneity in the reported cancer types mainly for breast, colorectal, lung and stomach cancers. These values are higher in comparison to those reported by

 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Bouasla and Bouasla (2017)</xref> from 0.09 to 0.66. It should be noted here that these cited studies are not designed for specific ailment such as cancer which is the case in our study. 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Andrade-Cetto and Heinrich (2011)</xref> have stated that higher values of the index are obtained when the use of inventoried plant species is reported by a high proportion of informants for the treatment of a particular cancer, whereas low values indicate that informants disagree over which plant to use. As an indicator of the relative medicinal importance of the inventoried plant species (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), the Medicinal Importance index ranged from 1.92 for neck cancer to 10.43 for breast cancer. These values are in the same range of those reported by

 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Carrió and Vallès (2012)</xref> in Balearic Islands (Spain). This could be attributed to the high number of informants engaged in this study in comparison to the others mentioned studies from apart, and to the low number of disorders (cancer types) in our study which are healed nearly by the same number of plant species from another part (
