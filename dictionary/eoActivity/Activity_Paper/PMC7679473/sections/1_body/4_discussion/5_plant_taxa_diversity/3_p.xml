<p id="p0190">The most represented families were Asteraceae (11 species, 20%), Lamiaceae (10 species, 19%), Apiaceae (9 species, 17%) and Fabaceae (8 species, 15%) respectively. The predominance of these plant families in the medicinal flora is well established in Algeria (

 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">González-Tejero et al., 2008</xref>). Probable reason for the high number of anticancer plant species reported in these families could be due to the presence of special and effective bioactive ingredients holding potential biological activities, e.g. flavonoids, sesquiterpenes lactones, tricyclic sesquiterpenes and germacranolide sesquiterpene lactones in the Asteraceae family (

 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">Shoaib et al., 2017</xref>), and terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, polyacetylenes, steroids, sesquiterpenes and flavonols in the Apiaceae family (

 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Chua, 2013</xref>). Some other bioingredients are specific to this family such as clerodendranoic acid (
