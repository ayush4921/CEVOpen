<p id="p0200">The medicinal plants reported in this study are not all locally cultivated and most of them grow naturally in the wild. Furthermore, many species pass the borders from other countries without proper inspection and quality control verification. Other species are grown around the homesteads or along roads borders and rural infrastructures which makes them susceptible to pollution and toxicity problems. The most common plantsâ€™ life-forms used by the traditional healers for the preparation of ethnomedicines in treating cancers were herbs (60%), shrubs (20%) and trees (20%). The use of herbs could be due to their higher abundance, easy collection and therapeutic efficacy (

 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Dolatkhahi et al., 2014</xref> have reported similarly the predominant use of plant leaves followed by flowers, fruits and stems. Moreover, roots harvest was also reported in this study (9%). This is possibly due to their richness with bioactive components (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Adnan et al., 2014</xref>). The unsustainability of roots harvesting is well known by conservationists who labeled those used medicinal plants as highly threatened (
