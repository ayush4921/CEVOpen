<p id="Par5">Encouraged by the aforementioned findings, we aimed to isolate novel bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>kesum</italic> in our continued investigations on 
 <italic>kesum</italic> as a medicinal plant. In the present study, we isolated a new polyoxygenated aromatic compound (polygonumins A
 <bold>)</bold> from the stem of 
 <italic>kesum</italic>. Polygonumins A demonstrated cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines, which indicated that it has potential value in the treatment of cancers such as leukaemia. These data provide baseline information for possible use in controlling cancer diseases, particularly leukaemia. In addition, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>minus</italic>. We also examined the potential of polygonumins A to serve as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Finally, a molecular docking study was performed to support our findings, which could lead to a new drug discovery in the near future.
