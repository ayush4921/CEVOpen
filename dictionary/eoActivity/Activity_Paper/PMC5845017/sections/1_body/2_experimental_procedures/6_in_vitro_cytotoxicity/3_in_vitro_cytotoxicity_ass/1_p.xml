<p id="Par29">Cells were plated in 96-well microplates and cultured for 24 h. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added at different concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13 µg/ml) to the plate in triplicate. The cytotoxicities against K-562 and H1299 cell lines were measured using a colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)−2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Exponentially growing cells were harvested and suspended in DMEM, and a 100 µl cell suspension was added to a 96-well plate. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of the test compounds (100 µl). The medium was removed, and cells in each well were incubated with PBS containing 1 mg/ml MTT for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. DMSO (100 µl) was added to each well to dissolve the insoluble formazan crystal, and plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C for complete solubilization of formazan. The level of coloured formazan derivative was analysed on a microplate reader using the results at wavelengths of 570 nm and 630 nm as references
