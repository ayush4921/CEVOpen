<p id="Par31">The HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor Screening Kit (Fluorometric) from Biovision Incorporated (Milpitas, CA, USA) was used to measure the inhibitory effect of each sample on HIV-1 protease activity. Pepstatin A (1 mM) was used as a known standard for HIV-1 protease inhibition, and 1% DMSO was used as a solvent control. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each sample (1 mg/ml) was incubated with HIV-1 protease enzyme at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, the HIV-1 protease fluorescent substrate was added. The fluorescence (excitation/emission = 330/450 nm) in kinetic mode over a period of 90 minutes at 37 °C was determined using a PerkinElmer EnSpire plate reader.</p>
