<p id="Par27">V79–4 cells were grown in tissue culture flasks using DMEM as the growth medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air. Cultures were examined daily to ensure they remained healthy. The confluent monolayer was removed by trypsinization, and the number of viable cells was calculated. Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a seeding density of 10 000 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C. The test substance was prepared by dilution with an appropriate volume of complete growth medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) to obtain the highest working concentration of 100 µg/ml (weight/volume). Procedures were performed aseptically.</p>
