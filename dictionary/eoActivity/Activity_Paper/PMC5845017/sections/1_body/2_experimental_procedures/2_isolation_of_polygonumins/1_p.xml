 <italic>minus</italic> stem bark powder (230–250 mesh) was extracted using methanol 3 times for 24 hours each time at room temperature. The extracts were concentrated by a vacuum rotary evaporator at low pressure to yield a dark-green gum (260 g). A total of 150 g of methanol extract was fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) using a column (Φ 10 cm) with silica gel 60PF
 <sub>254</sub> (0.063–0.200 mm) as an adsorbent and a chloroform:methanol mixture with increasing polarity (100% chloroform, 90–10%, 80–20%, and MeOH 100%) to yield 5 fractions i.e., F
 <sub>1</sub> (2.1 g), F
 <sub>2</sub> (4.4 g), F
 <sub>3</sub> (8.4 g), F
 <sub>4</sub> (10.3 g), and F
 <sub>5</sub> (88.3 g), respectively. Based on the spot size produced by thin layer chromatography (TLC), F
 <sub>4</sub> was refractionated by the VLC method using a column (Φ 5 cm) with silica gel 60PF
 <sub>254</sub> (0.063–0.200 mm) as an adsorbent and a chloroform:methanol mixture (100% chloroform, 90–10%, 80–20%, and MeOH 100%) as an eluent to produce 4 fractions: F
 <sub>41</sub> (0.8 g), F
 <sub>42</sub> (1.3 g), F
 <sub>43</sub> (1.8 g) and F
 <sub>44</sub> (3.3 g), respectively. The selected fractions, F
 <sub>43</sub> and F
 <sub>42</sub> (1.8 g), were combined and further purified by radial chromatography (RC) with silica gel 60PF
 <sub>254</sub> containing gypsum as an adsorbent with a chloroform:methanol mixture as an eluent with increasing polarity (95:5% 100% MeOH) to yield Fraction 4232 (0.4 g). Radial chromatography was then performed iteratively using the same eluent mixture to obtain polygonumins A (107 mg) as a white amorphous compound with a melting point of 150.2–152.0 °C. The schematic representation of polygonumins A isolation is summarized in Fig.
