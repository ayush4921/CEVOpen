 </sup>. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 0.2 ml of sample (1 mg/mL) and 1.5 ml of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent dissolved in water. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 5 minutes and then mixed with 1.5 ml 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution. After incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 725 nm against a blank using a spectrophotometer. The blank was prepared by using DMSO instead of a sample. The sample procedure was repeated for gallic acid at different concentrations, i.e., 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1 mg; the results were used to produce a calibration curve. Total phenolic content was calculated as the milligrams of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of sample (mg GAE/g) by using the gallic acid calibration curve, y = 0.0016× + 0.0295, R² = 0.9548.
