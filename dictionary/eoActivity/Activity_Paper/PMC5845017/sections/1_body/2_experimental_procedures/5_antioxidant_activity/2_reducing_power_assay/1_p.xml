 </sup> with slight modifications. Different concentrations of samples (50 µg/ml to 500 µg/ml) were mixed with 2 ml of 0.2 M, pH 6.6 sodium phosphate buffer and 1.25 ml of potassium ferricyanide. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes of incubation, 1.25 ml of trichlorocetic acid (10%) was added. Finally, 0.5 ml of FeCl
 <sub>3 (0.1%)</sub> was added to the mixture and incubated for 10 minutes. The intensity of the blue-green colour was measured at 700 nm. Increases in the absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated an increase in the reduction capability. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (µg/mL) associated with the reducing power-the extract concentration at which the absorbance was 0.5 was calculated from a graph of absorbance at 700 nm against the extract concentration. Gallic acid was used as a positive control.
