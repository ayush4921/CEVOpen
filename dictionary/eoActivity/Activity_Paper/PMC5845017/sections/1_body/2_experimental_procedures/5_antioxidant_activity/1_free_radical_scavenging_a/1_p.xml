<p id="Par23">Radical-scavenging activities were determined by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Various concentrations of the experimental samples were obtained, and the volume was adjusted to 200 μl with ethanol. Approximately 100 μl of 0.5 mM DPPH in methanol was added to the samples or standard (ascorbic acid and gallic acid) in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 30 min in the dark, changes in absorbance at 600 nm were measured on a 96-well plate reader. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated as the sample concentration required for a 50% decrease in the absorbance of a control solution of DPPH
