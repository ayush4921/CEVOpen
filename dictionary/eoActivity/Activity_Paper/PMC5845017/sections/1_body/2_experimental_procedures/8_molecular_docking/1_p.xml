<p id="Par33">The structure of wild-type HIV-1 protease (PDB ID: 3OXC) was downloaded from the protein databank for molecular docking. The protein model was prepared by removing all non-standard residues that included antiviral drug saquinavir, sulfate ion and formic acid in their structure. Water molecules were removed from the structure and hydrogen atoms added using AutoDockTools-1.5.6 prior to conversion of the file format to PDBQT for docking analysis. A grid box with dimensions of 50 × 40 × 40 A
 <sup>3</sup> was generated with HIV-1 protease as the centroid using AutoDockTools-1.5.6. Vanicoside, pepstatin, and polygonuminss were docked in the HIV-1 protease using AutoDockVina 1.1.2
