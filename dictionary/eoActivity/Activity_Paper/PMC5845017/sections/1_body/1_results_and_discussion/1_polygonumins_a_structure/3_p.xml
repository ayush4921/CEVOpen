<p id="Par8">According to HRESIMS data, polygonumins A has a molecular weight of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 1010.2697 and a molecular formula of C
 <sub>52</sub>H
 <sub>50</sub>O
 <sub>21</sub>. FTIR spectra indicated that the compound has various functional groups i.e., hydroxyl absorbance at 3334.8 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, aliphatic carbon absorbance at 2953.3 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, carbonyl absorbance at 1704 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and aromatic absorbance at 1629.4, 1605.3, and 1513.7 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The results are supported by NMR data (
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR), which showed that the structure of polygonumins A comprises four phenylpropanoid units and a sucrose unit, which could be well distinguished from the structure of vanicoside A. NMR data for vanicoside A and polygonumins A are compared in Table
