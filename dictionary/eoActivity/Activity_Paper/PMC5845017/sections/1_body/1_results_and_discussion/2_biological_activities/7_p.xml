 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we evaluated the anticholinesterase activity of polygonumins A relative to that of tacrine. However, the compound showed only weak anticholinesterase activity at concentrations of up to 2 mg/ml. (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and the compound did not show potential to serve as an anticholinesterase drug. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for this compound could not be determined due to its low activity; but we managed to determine the IC
 <sub>20</sub> value for this compound (1980 µg/ml).
