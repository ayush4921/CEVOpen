 <sub>50</sub> 2.25 µg/ml) and MCF7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.87 µg/ml), indicating that polygonumins A could be defined as an anticancer compound. Polygonumins A was most effective against K562 (human leukaemia cell line), with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.25 µg/ml, lower than that of doxorubicin (2.97 µg/ml), highlighting the anti-leukaemia potential of polygonumins A. It has been well observed that leukaemia is more sensitive to chemotherapy than other malignancies are
