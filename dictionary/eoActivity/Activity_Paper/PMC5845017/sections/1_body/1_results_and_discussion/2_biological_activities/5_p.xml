 </sup>. As polygonumins A possesses a structure similar to that of vanicoside A, we performed an HIV-1 protease inhibition test against the newly isolated compound. Based on our results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), polygonumins A showed potential activity as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. A relative inhibition level of 56% towards HIV-1 protease was detected compared with pepstatin A as a positive control. This is the first report indicating that

 </sup>. Based on the results of this study, we believe that the phenyl propanoid glycoside moiety in the structure of polygonumins A is associated with the activation of anti-HIV protease activity. Moreover, previous study have shown that the phenylpropanoid glycoside group acts as an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase activity, thus supporting our findings
