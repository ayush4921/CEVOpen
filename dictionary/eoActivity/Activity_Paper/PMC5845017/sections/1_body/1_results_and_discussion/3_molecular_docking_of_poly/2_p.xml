 </sup>. The current study examined the anti-HIV activity of polygonumins A, and the compound’s potential activity was further evaluated to identify the potential interactions of the compound with mutant HIV-1 proteases through molecular docking simulation. Mutant HIV-1 proteases available in the protein databank were downloaded and submitted to docking analysis using VinaAutodock. Polygonumins A was found to engage in potential interactions with mutant HIV-1 proteases with the following PDB IDs: 3PWM, 4HDB, 4HDF, 4HEG, and 4YHQ; the affinities recorded were lower than −10 kcal/mol. The potential interaction was found to be particularly significant for the mutant 4YHQ, for which the affinity was as low as −13.8 kcal/mol. These results are comparable to those obtained for the positive control drug pepstatin, which showed a significant binding affinity towards the mutant HIV-1 proteases. The results are summarized in Table

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. This analysis indicated that polygonumins A possesses the potential to inhibit a range of HIV-1 protease mutants that are currently known to resist available antiretroviral drugs. The potential anti-HIV activities against different protease mutants were predicted based on a complementary fit of polygonumins A with the target HIV protease mutants relative to the positive control drug pepstatin. This approach is well established for identifying potent HIV protease inhibitors
