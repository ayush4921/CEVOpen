<p>The present study demonstrated that the crude leaves extract of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> (200 and 400 mg/kg.bw) and 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> (400 mg/kg.bw) possessed significant antidiarrheal activity due to its inhibitory effect on castor oil-induced gastrointestinal fluid secretion. The antidiarrheal activities of these crude extracts could probably be attributed to the presence of bioactive agents in both medicinal plants.
