<p>The mice were randomly allocated into five groups of six animals per group. The first group was assigned as a negative control and administered 2% Tween 80 at a dose of 10 ml/kg.bw. The second group was assigned as a positive control and administered with standard drug loperamide at a dose of 3 mg/kg.bw. The rest of the groups were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg.bw of the crude extract. Effective dose selection was based on an oral acute toxicity study of the crude extract as well as pilot experiments. Since there were no observed signs and symptoms of toxicity at 2000 mg/kg.bw, 1/20
 <sup>th</sup>, 1/10
 <sup>th</sup>, and 1/5
 <sup>th</sup> of 2000 mg/kg.bw doses were used for the actual experiment. The extract was reconstituted with 2% of Tween 80 during the day of the experiment and administered orally.
