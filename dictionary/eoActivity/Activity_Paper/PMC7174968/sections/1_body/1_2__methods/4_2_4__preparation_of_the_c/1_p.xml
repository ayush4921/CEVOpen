<p>Three hundred grams of powdered plant material of each plant was macerated in an Erlenmeyer flask with 80% methanol for a period of 72â€‰h with occasional shaking using an orbital shaker. It was then filtered two times with Whatman filter paper (NO.1). To increase the percentage yield of the extract, the residue was remacerated two times for a total of 6 days. Then, methanol was removed from the filtrate using a rotary evaporator. Finally, the filtrate was placed in an oven to remove water. After drying and removal of methanol, the percentage yield of the semisolid crude leaves extracts of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> was found to be 26.7% and 23.3%, respectively.
