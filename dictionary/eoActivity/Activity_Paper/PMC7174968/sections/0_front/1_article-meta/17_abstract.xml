  <title>Background</title>
  <p> The herbal medicine practitioners in Ethiopia have used a wide range of medicinal plants as antidiarrheal agents. Among these, 
   <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> and 
   <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> were claimed to have antidiarrheal activity in Ethiopian folklore medicine. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of the crude extracts of 
   <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> and 
   <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> in mice.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p> The crude extracts were obtained by cold maceration with 80% methanol, and its antidiarrheal activities were evaluated using a castor oil-induced diarrheal model. The test groups were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight (bw) of the crude extract of each plant, while the positive controls and negative controls were given loperamide (3 mg/kg.bw) and 2% Tween 80 (10 ml/kg.bw), respectively. </p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> In the castor oil-induced model, the crude extract of 
   <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> (200 and 400 mg/kg.bw) significantly prolonged the onset of diarrhea in mice. Besides, it also showed a significant reduction in the frequency of stooling and weight of feces. Contrastingly, the crude extract of 
   <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> had a significant effect in delaying the onset of time of diarrhea and reduction of the frequency of stool and the weight of feces only at the maximum tested dose (400 mg/kg.bw).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> The present study demonstrated that the crude leaves extract of 
   <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> (200 and 400 mg/kg.bw) and 
   <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> (400 mg/kg.bw) possessed significant antidiarrheal activity in the castor oil-induced diarrheal model.
