<p>All nine edible 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species mentioned in this review are critical because they possess culinary and medicinal properties, and thus, have great potential for use as functional foods and medicines. Studies related to consumer safety, clinical trials, in vivo investigations, and cytotoxic studies will be beneficial as information related to this area is limited. Additional research on the nutritional values, along with pharmacological studies of new uninvestigated compounds, is desirable and will provide immense opportunities for the development of new plant-based food and pharmaceutical products. Therefore, it is concluded that the genus 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> is a significant source of anti-inflammatory agents, justifying its traditional uses, but this genus has not undergone enough scientific investigations yet. However, scientists should consider this genus to develop alternative and complementary anti-inflammatory agents with its dosage formulations and other specifications. Moreover, regular consumption of alternative and complementary herbal products may become an effective and safe strategy to treat chronic inflammatory diseases.
