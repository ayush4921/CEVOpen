<p>There are very few studies regarding this species that describe the anti-inflammatory effects. A study compared six species of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> drugs, including 
 <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> Val., in adjuvant arthritis model mice. When the 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic> methanol extract was administered orally one day before and after the adjuvant injection, paw swelling and serum haptoglobin levels were significantly inhibited, while curcuminoids were missing [

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>phaeocaulis</italic> and its fractions showed that the ethanol extract from it had some anti-inflammatory effects at certain concentrations but its three sub-fractions had only limited anti-inflammatory action [
