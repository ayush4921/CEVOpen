<p>A few articles that include research and review are more specific in that these studies directly relate different constituents extracted from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and their anti-inflammatory actions (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00063-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Curcumin is one of the most important compounds extracted from rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and was shown to be an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, arthritis, chronic anterior uveitis, etc. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It inhibits arachidonic acid metabolism, cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), cytokines (interleukins and tumor necrosis factor), nuclear factor ÎºB, and discharge of steroidal hormones, and might stabilize the lysosomal membrane and cause detaching of oxidative phosphorylation with high oxygen radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another review article summarized the safety and anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin and supported the above mechanisms regarding providing anti-inflammatory actions [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>Helicobacter</italic>-
 <italic>pylori</italic>-infected gastritis patients underwent investigations for the effectiveness of curcumin, but alone it may have limited the anti-bactericidal effect on 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> and the production of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Curcumin I, curcumin II (monodemethoxycurcumin), and curcumin III (bis-demethoxycurcumin) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00063-f001">Figure 1</xref>) from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> have demonstrated good inhibition of the COX-II enzyme [
