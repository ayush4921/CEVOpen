<p>Different extracts and their fractions of 
 <italic>Curcuma mangga</italic> Val. exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, as described in a few studies (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00063-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The use of carrageenan-induced rat paw edemas and croton-oil-induced mouse edemas in inflammatory models was investigated using 
 <italic>C. mangga</italic> ethanol extract (CME) and its fractions, such as water, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and hexane fractions from rhizome. CME and its fractions, especially chloroform and hexane fractions, displayed significant anti-inflammatory activities [

 <italic>C. mangga</italic> extract and its compounds against nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release using RAW 264.7 cells. Their constituents were found to down-regulate the mRNA expressions of iNOS and COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner [
