<p>Inflammation is regarded as a complex biological process that is mainly mediated by the disruption of tissue homeostasis. Inflammation is triggered by the presence of different biological, chemical, or physical agents and can be defined as acute or chronic depending on the type of stimuli. The immune system is always active to eliminate the damaging effect of acute inflammation; however, the failure of this response paves the way for a chronic phase, leading to an inflammatory cascade, which can ultimately develop several diseases, including chronic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Experimental studies and clinical epidemiological data have established chronic infections and inflammation as significant risk factors for different forms of cancer [

Although several therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and biologics drugs, are used mainly in the case of inflammation, they possess not only various adverse effects but these biologics are expensive. Therefore, to limit the drawbacks of both synthetic and biologic drugs, phytocompounds obtained from numerous medicinal plants have been used as ideal substitutes. The enormous research work on medicinal plants consolidates the hypothesis for using plant extracts as therapeutic agents due to the synergistic and additive effects of individual constituents [
