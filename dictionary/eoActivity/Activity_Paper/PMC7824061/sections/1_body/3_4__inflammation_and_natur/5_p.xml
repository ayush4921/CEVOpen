<p>Overall, most studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds focus on plant extracts and isolated phenolic compounds. The studies on different extracts and their fractions of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> are rich in phenolic compounds, which displayed significant suppression of lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub>, and pro-inflammatory cytokines by reducing the levels of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in a concentration-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophage cells [

 <italic>C. mangga</italic> rhizome extracts and their fractions, namely, demethoxycurcumin, 15,16-bisnorlabda-8(17), 11-dien-13-one, (E)-15,15-diethoxylabda-8(17), 12-dien-16-al, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, displayed positive effect against inflammation. In this study, the result clearly revealed a decreased regulation of mRNA expression in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Additionally, the extract and fraction of the 
 <italic>C. mangga</italic> rhizome exhibited a decrease in the production of COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner [

The phenolic compounds known as curcuminoids display antioxidant activity that helps to inhibit the production of ROS, resulting in anti-inflammatory properties because of the blockade of COX, LOX, NO synthesis, and other inflammatory enzymes, and also disrupts the transduction of cellular signals through different mechanisms, including protein kinase C inhibition. Recent scientific evidence on the impact of curcuminoids on their anti-inflammatory effect using in vitro and in vivo studies is shown in
