<p>The 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> genus is a rhizomatous annual or perennial herb in the Zingiberaceae family. Almost all of the 120 species of this genus have already been included in many works of literature [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most of the species of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> are naturally present in tropical evergreen areas. Malaysia, Indochina, northern Australia, Thailand, India, etc. are the most favorable places to grow 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The chromosome number of these genus ranges from 2
 <italic>n</italic> = 20 to 105 [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The morphological features of various species in the 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> genus were examined by several authors [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. When we analyzed the anatomy, 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species differ considerably in terms of taxonomic characteristics. Four tribes of the Zingiberaceae family, namely, Zingibereae, Hedychieae, Globbeae, and Alpinieae, have received attention on the basis of morphologic traits, such as the locules count and the location of ovaries, alterations of the productive anther, staminodes development, and the orientation of rhizome shooting leaves in which 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> forms part of Zingibereae [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic>â€™s rhizomes are sometimes considered to be fleshy, aromatic, and branched. Rhizomes become stuck with roots that often contain ellipsoid or conical tubers [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Basal leaf blades are typically lanceolate, broad, or rectangular in form, and are seldom linear [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To recognize the 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species, flowers form single flexible anthers and spiral bracts with large compound spike inflorescences are prominent characteristics. The marginal bracts are indeed long and sometimes vividly colored and form a sterile cluster [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has two separate flowering cycles. Prior to the growth of leafy shoots, short flowering plants produce flowers laterally from rhizomes and delayed flowering species typically develop terminally from the leafy shoots [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The heights of the plants are approximately between 50 and 200 cm. The species of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> are mainly triploid and asexually replicate via rhizomes; they are incapable of developing seeds [
