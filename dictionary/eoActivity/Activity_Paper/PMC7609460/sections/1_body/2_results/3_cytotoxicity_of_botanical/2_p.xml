<p id="p0080">The cytotoxicity of the crude extract, ASL and its fractions ASLa to ASLc was first performed against a panel of 9 cancer cells lines and the normal AML12 hepatocytes. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Botanicals ASL, ASLb and ASLc displayed observable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values towards all tested cancer cell lines while ASLa had selective activity. The recorded IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 13.45 μg/mL (in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 33.20 μg/mL (against the resistant MDA-MB-231-
 <italic>BCRP</italic> breast adenocarcinoma cells) for ASL, from 16.42 μg/mL (in CCRF-CEM cells) to 29.64 μg/mL (against MDA-MB-231-
 <italic>pcDNA</italic> breast adenocarcinoma cells) for ASLc, and from 22.94 μg/mL (in MDA-MB-231-
 <italic>BCRP</italic> cells) to 40.19 μg/mL (against the resistant HCT116 (

 <italic>ΔEGFR</italic> cells to ASLb (D.R. of 0.72 and 0.74, respectively) and ASLc (D.R. of 0.68 and 0.75, respectively) compared to their respective sensitive counterparts was also noted (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Observable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained with ASLa on 6/9 cancer cell lines tested. This fraction (ASLa) was less active than ASLb and ASLc and was no further processed for the isolation of its active constituents. The purification of ASLc led to phytochemicals 
 <bold>1–5</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> while that of ASLb afforded compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold>. The cytotoxicity of phytochemicals 
 <bold>1–6</bold> was further evaluated on the tested panel of cancer cell lines and AML12 hepatocytes. The results summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that all the tested compounds had selective cytotoxic effects, with obervable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in 7/9, 7/9, 6/9, 3/9, 3/9 and 1/9 for 
 <bold>3, 6, 5, 1, 2</bold> and

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). From the cytotoxicity data, it appears that the best activity was obtained with the crude extract, ASL. Consequently, the cellular mode of action of ASL was investigated towards the most sensitive CCRF-CEM cells.
