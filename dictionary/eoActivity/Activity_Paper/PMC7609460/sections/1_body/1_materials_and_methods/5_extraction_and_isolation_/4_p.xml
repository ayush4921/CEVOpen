<p id="p0040">Fraction ASLb (23.217 g) was further column chromatographed using the Flash cartridge (Isolera) with silica gel (63–200, 60 Å) eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10:01 to 80:20:02); 81 new sub-frs of 20 mL each were collected as follows: CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90 : 10: 01): sub-frs 1 to 32; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (85 : 15: 1.5): sub-frs 33 to 61; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80 : 20: 02): sub-frs 62 to 81. They were further pooled into two main sub-frs based on their TLC profiles as follows: ASLb1 (sub-frs 1 to 47) and ASLb2 (sub-frs 48 to 81). Sub-fraction ASLb2 was further column chromatographed similarly to the methanol sub-fr above, eluting with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20:02). 34 new sub-frs of 10 mL each were collected. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (15 mg) was obtained from sub-frs 22 to 30 whilst sub-frs 8 to 17 afforded compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (12 mg).
