<p id="p0050">The cytotoxicity of botanicals (ASL, ASLa-ASLc), phytochemicals (
 <bold>1–6</bold>) and doxorubicin was determined using the well-described resazurin reduction assay (RRA) [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] at identical experimental conditions as documented earlier [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After 72 h incubation in the standard culture condition (humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C), the fluorescence was measured with Infinite M2000 Pro™ plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at 544 nm as excitation wavelength and 590 nm as detection wavelength. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentrations of botanicals, phytochemicals or doxorubicin required to inhibit 50% of the cell proliferation, and were determined by linear regression using Microsoft Excel 2007 [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. If both sensitive cells and their corresponding resistant counterparts were tested, the degree of resistance (D.R.) against the tested samples was determined as the ratio of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the resistant cell line divided by that of the corresponding parental sensitive cell line. The selectivity index (S.I.) was determined as the ratio of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the normal AML12 hepatocyte divided by that of HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells.
