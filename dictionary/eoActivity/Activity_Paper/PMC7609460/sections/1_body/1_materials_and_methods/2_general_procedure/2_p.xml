<p id="p0015">Optical rotations were taken with a Polarimeter (Perkin-Elmer) using a sodium lamp operating at 589 nm. Infrared (IR) spectra (KBr disc) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 881 spectrometer. UV spectra were obtained on a Kontron model spectrophotometer. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were performed on a Bruker DRX-400 MHz (400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and 100 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal reference. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) was carried out in the positive-ion mode. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) employed precoated silica gel plates 60F
 <sub>254</sub> (Merck). For flavonoids, the TLC solvent system CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>–MeOH–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80-20-02 to 70-30-03) was used. Detection by UV at λ = 254 and 365 nm was followed by spraying with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80-20). Column chromatography (CC) and Flash cartridge (Isolera) were carried out with SiO
 <sub>2</sub> gel (63–200, 60 Å) in normal phase, and DIAION HP-20.
