<p>Antioxidant properties of these extracts were detected by several assays including DPPH radical [
 <xref rid="B29-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> free radical scavenging [
 <xref rid="B30-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], cupric ion (CUPRAC) and ferric ion (FRAP) reducing power [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], phosphomolybdenum method [
 <xref rid="B33-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and ferrous ion chelating [
 <xref rid="B34-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (the half inhibitory concentration). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the graph of percentage (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>, DPPH and metal chelating) against the concentration of the extracts. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for other assays (reducing power and phosphomolybdenum) reflect that the concentration at which absorbance is 0.5. For this purpose, we used the graph of absorbance against the concentration of the extracts. Trolox (TE) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (disodium salt) (EDTA)) were used as positive controls. In addition, the results were expressed as equivalents of these standards.
