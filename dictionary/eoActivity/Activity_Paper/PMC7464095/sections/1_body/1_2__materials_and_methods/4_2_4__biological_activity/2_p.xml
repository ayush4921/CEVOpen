<p>The key enzymes inhibition activity of the extracts against tyrosinase, and α-amylase were measured using the protocols as published by [
 <xref rid="B35-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The enzyme inhibition abilities were evaluated by IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values calculated as antioxidant assays and we used a graph between concentration and percentage of enzyme inhibition. Standard enzyme inhibitors (Kojic acid (KAE) for tyrosinase and acarbose (ACE) for α-amylase) were used as positive control and also, the results were expressed as equivalents of these standards. The details for experimental methods are given in the
