<p>Obtained results were given as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the results were evaluated by ANOVA assay (with Tukey’s test, significant value: 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustered analysis (HCA) were applied to the experimental data under FactoMineR (Factor Analysis and Data Mining with R) package (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). The antioxidant activities of the extracts were analyzed using various methods. As is well known, each of the antioxidant activity methods has a different mechanism of action on the extracts. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the results obtained with each other. Relative antioxidant capacity (RACI) index values were calculated to make the results comparable, and the correlation between the results obtained from each test and RACI values were presented separately [
 <xref rid="B36-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The RACI values of the samples were determined for each test by dividing into standard deviation after subtracting these mean values from the raw data. Total RACI values were calculated by averaging the RACI values obtained from all antioxidant tests of the relevant sample (including phenolic and flavonoid).
