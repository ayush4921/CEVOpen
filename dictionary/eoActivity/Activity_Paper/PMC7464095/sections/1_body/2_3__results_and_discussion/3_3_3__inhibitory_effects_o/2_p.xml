<p>Amylase and tyrosinase inhibition of

 <italic>finitimus</italic> extracts were investigated and the results are reported in 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Similar to antioxidant assays results, the best inhibitory ability was detected in leaves extract (IC50: 3.36 mg/mL for amylase and 1.02 mg/mL for tyrosinase). In addition, the flowers exhibited the weakest inhibitory activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 4.94 mg/mL for amylase and 1.41 mg/mL for tyrosinase). The findings could be related with chemical profiles of the tested extracts and some compounds in extracts such as hyperoside [

 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> is present. Therefore, our results could provide new information on the biological activity poof for the genus 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic>. At this point, 
 <italic>A. microcephalus</italic> could be considered as a valuable source of natural enzyme inhibitors to combat global health problems including diabetes mellitus and skin disorders.
