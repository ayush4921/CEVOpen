<p>Enzyme inhibition theory is one of the most important strategies to combat global health problems including Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. In theory, some enzymes are targets to alleviate observed symptoms in the diseases [

Thus, several compounds (acarbose for amylase and kojic acid for tyrosinase) have been developed as enzyme inhibitors in pharmaceutical industries. However, most of them have serious side effects such as gastrointestinal disorders and toxicity [
