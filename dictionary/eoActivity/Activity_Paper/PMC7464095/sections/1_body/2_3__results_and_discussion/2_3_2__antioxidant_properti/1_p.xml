<p>Oxidative stress is the main etiological factor for the progression of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the balance between the production of free radicals and the endogenous antioxidant defense system plays a pivotal role in healthy physiological function [
 <xref rid="B52-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At this point, we need to support the defense system with dietary antioxidants. Plants are the main sources of the dietary antioxidants and several studies have reported a negative association between the consumption of plants and the frequency of these diseases [

 <xref rid="B55-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the present study, to evaluate the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>finitumus</italic> extracts, several chemical methods were performed, and their results are shown in 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. We used IC
 <sub>50</sub> values and standard equivalents (trolox (TE) and EDTA (EDTAE)) to express antioxidant abilities. Based on 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the strongest antioxidant abilities were detected in leaves extracts. For example, the lowest IC50 values were detected in the leaves extract for radical scavenging (ABTS and DPPH) and to reduce power (FRAP, CUPRAC and phosphomolybdenum). Observed antioxidant effects for leaves extract could be explained with the high level of phenolics and we obtained a good correlation between these parameters 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In accordance with our findings, several researchers reported a positive correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant properties. Interestingly, the metal chelating abilities of the tested extracts can be ranked as flowers&gt;stems&gt;roots&gt;aerial parts&gt;leaves. In addition, a negative relationship was observed between total bioactive compounds (phenolics and flavonoids) and metal chelating ability. Taken together, we could imply that observed findings could be linked with the presence of non-phenolic chelators such as peptides, polysaccharides, and ascorbic acid. In earlier studies, several authors reported antioxidant properties of some 
 <italic>Astagalus</italic> species such as 
 <italic>A. ponticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 
 <italic>A. lagurus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], 
 <italic>A. spruneri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. With this in mind, the members of the genus 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> could be considered as valuable sources of natural antioxidants.
