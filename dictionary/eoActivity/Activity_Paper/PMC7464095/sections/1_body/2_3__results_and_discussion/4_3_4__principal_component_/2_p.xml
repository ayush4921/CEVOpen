<p>Further, it can be noted the involvement of polyphenols namely hyperoside, (−)-epicatechin, caffeic acid and 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid in these activities. Caffeic acid, an important members of hydroxycinnamic acid, (−)-epicatechin and 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid are reported to be a good antioxidant with an excellent tyrosinase inhibition properties [
