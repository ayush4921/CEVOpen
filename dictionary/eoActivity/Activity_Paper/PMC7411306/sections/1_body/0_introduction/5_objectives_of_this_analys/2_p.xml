<p>In accordance with the strategic objectives outlined in the Traditional Medicine Strategy of the World Health Organization (
 <xref rid="B477" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2013</xref>), we aim at establishing a consensus-driven knowledge base on herbal drugs used in Mesoamerican traditional medicine. The focus is on plants used as medicine by traditional healers in rural indigenous communities. The quantitative nature of the review will allow for the prioritization of taxa for pharmacological and clinical studies. The pharmacological evidence for the safety and efficacy of the cross-culturally most salient taxa is reviewed and important knowledge gaps are indicated. The review is intended as a baseline of evidence for regulators, health professionals, and consumers for making informed decisions on herbal drugs and phytomedicines. Hence, this review and the MAMPDB is seen as an essential first step for an improved integration of traditional medicine into the national health systems of Mexico and Central America.
