<p>T&amp;CM contributes significantly to the health coverage of the population of MA, particularly in poor and underserved indigenous communities (
 <xref rid="B477" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2013</xref>). Similarly, to the situation in MA, in most regions of the world, a wealth of information on T&amp;CM has been recorded. Yet these data are often scattered, making it difficult for policy makers to regulate and integrate herbal products into primary health care. Despite over 400 million estimated regular users of T&amp;CM in Latin America, systematic approaches to integrate T&amp;CM in formal health systems are widely lacking (

 <xref rid="B477" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2013</xref>, p. 41). A lack of pharmacological and toxicological data on even the most commonly used herbal drugs is often considered the principal limitation to integrative medicine in MA (

National and international efforts have been conducted in Guatemala in order to establish integrative medicine at academic and public health levels and although official acceptance is limited, national interest and expectations are high (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Alonso-Castro et al., 2017a</xref>). Hence, creating quantitative regional databases based on internationally published literature can be an effective means for advancing the integration of evidence-based T&amp;CM and therefore contribute to achieving UHC.
