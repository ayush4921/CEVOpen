<p>A well-studied case of toxic plant materials are aristolochic acids containing botanical drugs deriving from the 
 <italic>Aristolochiaceae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Arlt et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B317" ref-type="bibr">Michl et al., 2014</xref>). Aristolochic acids are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic and potentially contained in botanical drugs obtained from 14 different 
 <italic>Aristolochia</italic> species present in the MAMPDB. The drugs obtained from 
 <italic>Aristolochia</italic> spp. are often used for digestive problems and totaled 95 use-records in the MAMPDB (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Table 4.1</bold> in the 
  <bold>Supplementary Material</bold>
 </xref>). The time lag between the onset of chronic intoxication and the manifestation of eventually lethal kidney disorders is the reason why the resulting pathology is difficult for the general population to associate with the consumption of 
 <italic>Aristolochia</italic> spp. Clearly safety concerns prevail above all with systemic applications. Also the use of castor oil plant seeds as an emetic and purgative is risky (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Aplin and Eliseo, 1997</xref>) and due to the high content of the hepatotoxic and carcinogenic safrole the leaves of 
 <italic>Piper auritum</italic>, which are also widely used as a condiment for pork tamales (wrapped maize dough cakes), should be used in low doses when applied orally. Anthranoid rich material (bitterness as a proxy) of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> is regarded as unsafe upon prolonged oral applications and particularly during pregnancy as the resulting increased blood flow to the uterus can induce abortion (
 <xref rid="B405" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>, p. 250). The leaves of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum pinnatum</italic> contain cardiotoxic bufadienolids, the aromatic leaves of 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> hepatotoxic metabolites, the leaves of 
 <italic>Phyla scaberrima</italic> high amounts of neurotoxic camphor, and the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> toxic sesquiterpenelactones and are thus all unsafe depending on the dose ingested. Also applying the latex of 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic> to the eyes, the latex of 
 <italic>Asclepias curassavica</italic> to aching teeth and using 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> during pregnancy are to be regarded unsafe.
