It highlights the most frequently cited taxa in the MAMPDB, which have roots in Olmec, Maya, Zapotec and Aztec as well as traditional Mediterranean medicine. Most of the 98 herbal drug species are either grown in home-gardens or thrive in the vegetation surrounding the villages and are thus easily available.

 </xref>). Of those 22 considered effective and safe for skin problems (S) 17 are native to MA while of the 13 considered effective and safe for respiratory ailments (R) only 3 are native. For digestive (D), skin (S) and respiratory (R) problems as well as for the category ‘general and unspecified’ (A) among the 98 species a range of effective and safe herbal drug-based treatment options exist (
