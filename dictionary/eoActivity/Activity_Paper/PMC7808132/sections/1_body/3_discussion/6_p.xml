<p>Describing μOR interactions helps us to identify the responses and initiate the selective activation of signaling pathways which may be exploited to develop novel and potent anti-inflammatory agents/analgesics. The solved crystal structures of μOR-bound antagonists and agonists provided a detailed analysis of the ligand–receptor-binding pattern. The first three-dimensional structure of μOR in complex with the irreversible antagonist β-FNA was published in 2012 (PDB ID = 4DKL). The antagonist displayed hydrogen-bond interactions with Asp147 and Tyr148. It was also involved in hydrophobic interactions with Met151, Tro293, Ile296, and Val300.

 </sup> Later, insights into the binding pattern of the agonist BU72 into the binding site of μORs were published.

 </sup> The agonist BU72 showed hydrogen-bond interactions with Asp147, Tyr148 (water-mediated), and His54.
