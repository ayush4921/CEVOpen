<p>Computational studies have led to the developing of new drugs especially analgesics. Docking simulations predict the binding orientation of a compound of therapeutic interest into the active site of the target and also helps in understanding the biological activity. Moreover, the binding orientations and interactions also help in structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies. Computational docking simulations demonstrated that the isolated compound (
 <bold>1</bold>) has shown favorable binding orientations and binding energy values against the μ-opioid and GABAnergic receptors. The μ-opioid receptors (μORs) are membrane proteins and members of the opioid neuromodulatory system. These receptors are the therapeutic targets of opioid drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, the binding pattern of μOR-targeting drugs (antagonist 
 <italic>vs</italic> agonist) is not unclear. There are some hypotheses about the substitution pattern at the nitrogen atom on these receptors. It is assumed that bulky groups such as allyl or cyclopropylmethyl are associated with antagonist activity. The N-methyl group is considered to show agonist properties.

 </sup> However, there are a number of examples displaying agonist activity with bulky groups on nitrogen atoms.
