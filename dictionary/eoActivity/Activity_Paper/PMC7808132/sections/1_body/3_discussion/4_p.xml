<p>Naphthoquinones are structurally diverse secondary metabolites found in bacteria, fungi, and higher plants and exhibited several biological activities including anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity. Soares 
 <italic>et al.</italic> for the first time explored the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity of five naphthoquinones isolated from tubers of 
 <italic>Sinningia reitzii</italic>.

 </sup> Considering the key role of natural products especially naphthoquinones in nociception, we planned the study to evaluate peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold> for its central analgesic, muscle relaxant, and sedative effects. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> belongs to the naphthoquinone class of chemical constituents, which have been reported to have various biological activities, such as anticancer, sedative, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. The structure of peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold> bears minor resemblance with benzodiazepines which are significant sedative hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and adjuvant analgesics.

 </sup> The biological actions of benzodiazepines are attributed to their strong interactions with GABA channels.

 </sup> Once the GABA channels are occupied at allosteric sites, the chloride channel opens, and more chloride influx occurs, which shifts the membrane potential toward being more electronegative, and the cell becomes inhibited. Once the membrane potential becomes more electronegative, the calcium channels remain closed, and no calcium influx occurs. These intracellular cascades hinder the release of neurotransmitters and thus mitigate the interactions of neurotransmitters with postsynoptic receptors. This attenuated situation keeps the muscles relaxed and induces sedation, decreasing pain sensation. The significant analgesic potential of peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold> might be due to the interaction with GABA channels or with opioid receptors. If peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold> is considered an agonist for opioid receptors, it might be a muscle relaxant.

 </sup> Opioid receptors are known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Once an agonist binds with these inhibitory heptahelical receptors, intracellular signaling inhibits protein kinase A and stimulates the potassium channel to stay open, and more potassium efflux occurs, which causes the membrane potential to become more electronegative. Again, calcium channels are not opening, and no calcium is available for neurotransmitter exocytosis. Once the exocytosis of neurotransmitters (especially substance p) diminishes, the pain threshold level is set to convert algesia into analgesia. These cascades show potential muscle relaxation effects and probably sedative effects as well.
