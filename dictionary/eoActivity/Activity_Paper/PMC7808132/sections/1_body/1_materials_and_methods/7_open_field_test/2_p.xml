<p>This experimental system was used for the evaluation of sedative potential. Animals were classified as described above. The apparatus used for this activity comprised an area of white wood (150 cm diameter) surrounded by stainless-steel walls and was divided into 19 squares by black lines. The open-field apparatus was placed inside a light- and sound-attenuated room.

 </sup> Thirty minutes after treatment, each animal was allowed to move from the center of the box. The maximum number lines crossed by the animal were considered no sedation. Animal was considered to be sedated with hindered movement. The number of lines crossed by each animal was used to find sedative effects in statistical calculations. The doses of diazepam, normal saline, and compound
