 </sup> The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the enzymes with their cocrystallized ligands were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. The 3D crystal structure of the μ-opioid receptor has a native ligand (PDB id = 5C1M). The GABAnergic homopentamer from humans was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB id = 4COF). The docking algorithm was authenticated by the redocking of native ligands. The computed root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the experimental and redocked poses was found within the threshold limit (&lt;2 Å). The 3D structure of the compound was built in an MOE using a builder module. Energy minimization of the ligand, preparation of structures of the downloaded enzymes, and active site identification were carried out according to a previously reported procedure.
