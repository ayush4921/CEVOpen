 </xref>. The muscle relaxant effect was significant at the tested dose of 15 mg/kg in both experiments. The percentage of effect at the higher dose was 43.76% at the early period, which was improved up to 52.12% after 90 min postadministration (inclined plane). In the case of the traction test, the same pattern of muscle coordination effect was observed.
