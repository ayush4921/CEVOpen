<p>Subsequently, the muscle relaxant effect of the isolated compound was explored using docking simulations. The docking simulations were carried out on GABAnergic receptors. The GABAnergic homopentamer from humans was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB id = 4COF). The receptor was in complex with an agonist benzamidine located in each extracellular domain (ECD).</p>
