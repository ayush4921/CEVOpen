 </xref>a. The 3D interaction plot showed two hydrogen-bond interactions with Asp147 and Tyr326 
 <italic>via</italic> hydroxy groups. Tyr148 forms a bifurcated π–π interaction with the naphthalene-1,4-dione ring. Another bifurcated π–π interaction was observed between naphthalene-1,4-dione and Trp318 (
