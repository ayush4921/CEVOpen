  <italic>Quercus</italic> species, also known as oak, represent an important genus of the Fagaceae family. It is widely distributed in temperate forests of the northern hemisphere and tropical climatic areas. Many of its members have been used in traditional medicine to treat and prevent various human disorders such as asthma, hemorrhoid, diarrhea, gastric ulcers, and wound healing. The multiple biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, anticancer, gastroprotective, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities have been ascribed to the presence of bioactive compounds such as triterpenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. This paper aimed to provide available information on the medicinal uses, phytochemicals, and pharmacology of species from 
  <italic>Quercus</italic>. However, further investigation is needed to fully clarify the mode of action of its bioactive compounds and to evaluate 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> chronic toxicity, before exploring their potential use as a supplement in functional foods and natural pharmaceutics.
