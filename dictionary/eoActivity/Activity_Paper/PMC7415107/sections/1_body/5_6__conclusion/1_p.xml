<p>For a long time, 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species have been used as a traditional medicine in various countries and tribes. The bark, fruit, and leaves of the species from the genus were reported to possess a broad spectrum of biological effects, such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial. The current phytochemical studies of the species from the genus 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> showed that phenolic acids (particularly gallic and ellagic acids and their derivatives), flavonoids (particularly flavan-3-ol), and tannins are somehow ubiquitous in all 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species. From these researches, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids, and flavonoids have a positive effect on anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer actions which can be considered as promising candidates for the development of novel pharmaceutical agents. For this, additional research on other 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species need much attention from biochemists for studying their detailed chemical profile and health effect, and also more studies are required to evaluate the safety, side effect, and efficacy of extracts.
