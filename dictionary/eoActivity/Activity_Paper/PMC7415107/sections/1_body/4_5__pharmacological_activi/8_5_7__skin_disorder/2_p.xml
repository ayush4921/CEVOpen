<p>Sari et al. [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] showed that polydatin isolated from the 
 <italic>Quercus coccifera</italic> bark displayed potent tyrosinase inhibition compared to the positive control kojic acid, with an IC50 value of 4.05 ± 0.30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. In addition, Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] analyzed the effect of some polyamine derivatives from the bee pollen extract of 
 <italic>Q. mongolica</italic> against the tyrosinase enzyme. They observed that polyamine derivatives with coumaroyl and caffeoyl moieties exhibited higher tyrosinase inhibitory potential than the others isolated with IC50 values of 19.5–85.8 Μm. Lee and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] explored the antidermatitis effects of 
 <italic>oak wood vinegar</italic> (OWV) in the DNCB-induced contact dermatitis mice model and showed that OWV has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activity in a DNCB-induced contact dermatitis mice model. This activity may be linked to STAT3 inactivation.
