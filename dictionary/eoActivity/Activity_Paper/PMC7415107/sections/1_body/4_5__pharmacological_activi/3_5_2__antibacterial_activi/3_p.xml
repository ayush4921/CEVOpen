<p>In an agar-well diffusion assay, the methanol and acetone extracts of the gall of 
 <italic>Q. infectoria</italic> showed activity against oral pathogens such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586</italic>. The MIC ranged from 0.16 to 0.63 mg/mL, and the most susceptible bacterium was 
 <italic>S. salivarius,</italic> which suggested that the oak extract might be used against dental caries and periodontitis etiological agents [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In another study, the extracts of 
 <italic>Quercus infectoria</italic> were assessed against many microbial species and used for eggshell decontamination. The antimicrobial activity was evidenced against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and the results showed disinfection of eggshell microbial contamination, by immersion in 1% 
 <italic>QIE</italic> solution, sharply reduced total colony count, yeasts, and molds, and Enterobacteriaceae, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>and S. aureus</italic> were completely inhibited after 60 min of immersion in QIE [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Another investigation demonstrated that the extract of the 
 <italic>Quercus infectoria</italic> gall possesses antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Leptospira interrogans serovar Javanica</italic> and 
 <italic>Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae</italic> with MIC values of 0.125 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].
