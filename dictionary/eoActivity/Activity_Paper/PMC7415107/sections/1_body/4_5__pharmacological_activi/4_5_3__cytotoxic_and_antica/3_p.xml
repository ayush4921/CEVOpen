<p>Recently, apoptotic and antimetastatic activities of betulin isolated from 
 <italic>Quercus incana</italic> leaves were investigated against non-small-cell lung cancer. The results indicted significant dose-dependent induction of apoptosis after the treatment with betulin, followed by increased expression of the caspase family (i.e., caspase-3, -6, and -9), proapoptotic genes (BAX and BAK), and inhibiting antiapoptotic genes (BCL-2L1 and p53). Additionally, betulin was found to be highly and selectively active against the cancer cells at much lower doses (11.55

 <italic>Quercus suber</italic> L. cork extracts induce apoptosis in human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells. The extracts showed a time-dependent and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cells [
