<p>Neurodegenerative disorders are diseases that influence the nervous system, such as brain tumors, glioblastoma, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. It was reported that extracts from 
 <italic>Quercus suber</italic> and 
 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> showed neuroprotective effects through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and protection of the human dopaminergic cell line SH-SY5Y [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Indeed, Gezici and Sekeroglu [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported that extracts from the shell, cup, and acorn parts of 
 <italic>Quercus coccifera</italic> had notable AChE and BChE inhibition. Inhibitors of this enzyme are used to alleviate symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In another investigation, Lei et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed potent antineuroinflammatory activity of triterpenoids isolated from Chinese acorns (
 <italic>Quercus serrata</italic> var. 
 <italic>brevipetiolata</italic>), which suggested that these triterpenoids might have activities against Alzheimer's disease.
