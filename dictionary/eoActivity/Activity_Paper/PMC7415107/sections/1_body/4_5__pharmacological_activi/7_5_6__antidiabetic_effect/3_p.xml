<p>Furthermore, Lin et al. [

 <italic>Quercus fabrei Hance</italic>. These results further support the potential use of the acorn for preparation of low glycemic index foods. In a particular study, Ahmadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] reported that prebiotics from the acorn can ameliorate HFD-induced defects in the glucose metabolism via positive modulation of the gut-microbiome-brain axis.
