<p>Using advanced spectroscopic techniques, Indrianingsih et al. [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] isolated catechin, epicatechin, and tiliroside from 
 <italic>Q. gilva</italic>. The tiliroside found in 
 <italic>Q. gilva</italic> can inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity. Flavonoids are also found to be important bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> leaves. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] conducted a study on acorn leaves (
 <italic>Quercus liaotungensis</italic>) and isolated one new flavonoid glycoside, namely, 2,3-diol acetonide-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-L-rhamnopyranoside-kaempferol, and 25 known polyphenolics. Recently, a study carried out on the infusion of the leaves of the six different species of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> revealed the presence of 7 flavan-3-ols, 2 flavonols, 18 flavonols/flavanone glycosides, 1 flavanone, 1 flavone, and 4 other unknown compounds. In this context, the presence of 4 procyanidin dimers in infusions was also documented [
