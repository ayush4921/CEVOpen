<p>The 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> genus contains various classes of compounds such as glycosides, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, fatty acids, sterols, and tannins. The polyphenols isolated from the 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> genus are reported in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Despite the phylogenetic variability, phenolic acids (particularly, gallic and ellagic acids and their derivatives), flavonoids (particularly flavan-3-ol), and tannins are abundant in all the species of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. To date, seven compounds were isolated from 
 <italic>Quercus gilva Blume</italic> (QGB) and identified as picraquassioside D, quercussioside, (+)-lyoniresinol-90
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-xylopyranoside, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, procyanidin B3, and procyanidin B4. The presence of these compounds suggests that QGB could be used in the treatment of urolithiasis [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In addition, Gul et al. [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] successfully isolated a new compound, quercuschin, with six other compounds which were identified as quercetin, methyl gallate, gallic acid, betulinic acid, (Z)-9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-sitosterol glucoside from 
 <italic>Q. incana</italic>. Indeed, the compounds such as eupatorin (5,3′-dihydroxy-6,7,4′ trimethoxyflavone), cirsimaritin (4′,5, -dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone), betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3, 28-diol), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin acetate (12-oleanen-3yl acetate) were also observed in the leaves of 
 <italic>Quercus incana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
