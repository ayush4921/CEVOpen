<p>Triterpenoids have also been isolated from the species of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic>. Recently, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] have identified 3 new pentacyclic triterpenes which were elucidated to be 3-O-galloyloleanolic acid, 23-acetoxy-3-O-galloyloleanolic acid, and 3-acetoxy-23-O-galloyloleanolic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>), along with 22 compounds known from the 
 <italic>Q. liaoningensis</italic> acorn which showed antidiabetic effect. Lei et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] successfully isolated new triterpenoids which were identified as ursane, oleanane, and lupinane type and were found to be associated with the antineuroinflammatory activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In another study, ten pentacyclic triterpenes, three of which were novel, were isolated from acorns 
 <italic>Quercus serrata var. brevipetiolata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>).
