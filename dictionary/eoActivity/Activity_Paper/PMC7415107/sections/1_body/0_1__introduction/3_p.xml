<p>Pharmacological effect reported for the 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> genus plant includes antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, gastrointestinal disorder, skin disorder, antiobesity, anticancer, and neurogenerative effect [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. All mentioned effects are attributed to the specific chemical composition, comprised mainly of triterpenoids, flavonoids, and tannins. As an example, Endo et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] investigated the antitoxoplasma effect of the 
 <italic>Quercus crispula Blume</italic> outer bark. The authors identified three pentacyclic triterpenoids, namely, 29-norlupane-3,20-dione, oleanolic acid acetate, and ursolic acid acetate, and concluded that these compounds exhibited notable activities against the 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasite. Moreover, Lei et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] successfully isolated new triterpenoids, which were identified as ursane, oleanane, and lupinane type and were found to be associated with the antineuroinflammatory activity. Even so, numerous studies describing the bioactivities of acorns are focused on their strong antioxidant activity, which are believed to be useful in treating oxidation-associated diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases [
