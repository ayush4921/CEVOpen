<p>The oak family (
 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp.) plays a major ecological role in terms of sheer abundance of standing biomass [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> is among the most widespread and species-rich tree genera in the northern hemisphere [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The highest diversity is exhibited in Mexico and East Asia [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Europe exhibits lower species richness (up to 30 species), but the genus is nearly as widespread there as it is in North America and East Asia, as a limited number of European species have expanded across the continent [

 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp. (oak) represent an important genus of the Fagaceae family which consists of 600 species worldwide, which includes monecious, deciduous, evergreen trees, and rarely shrubs. The genus 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> has long been considered one of the most imperative clades of all woody plants in terms of species diversity, ecological dominance, and economic value. The leaves of many oak species are conspicuously lobed, but some species reveal variations in shape from small to large and pointed. Oaks are considered monecious plants, having separate male and female flowers on a single tree. Generally, the male flowers occur in clusters but sometimes are organized in a form called catkin. The female flowers are borne on solitary spikes in the axils of leaves or bracteoles of the new growth [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The flowers mostly ripen in the sepals, which later mature into the fruit. The fruit identified as acorn, which is a nut, is characterized by the absence of an endosperm and the presence of an achlorophyllous embryo.
