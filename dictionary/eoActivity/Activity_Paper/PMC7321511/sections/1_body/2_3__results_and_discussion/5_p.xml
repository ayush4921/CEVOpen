<p>The presence of efflux pumps in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains SA-1199B (NorA pump) and XU212 (TetK pump) did not have any effect on the antibacterial activities of the hexane extract and methanol fraction. This indicated that antimicrobial compounds within the extract and fraction were not susceptible to these prevalent efflux pumps or that the target(s) lies externally to the cell.
