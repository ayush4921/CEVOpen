<p>The extract and fraction were further screened at a sub-inhibitory concentration (100 mg/L) for anti-conjugal activity in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This test concentration was used to ensure that any observed anti-conjugal activity may not be due to growth inhibition. Both hexane extract and methanol fraction showed significant anti-conjugal activity against the transfer of the IncW plasmid R7K, reducing the transfer frequency by 76.5 ± 2.0% and 79 ± 1.2%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The anti-conjugation activities of the extract and fraction were specific to the IncW plasmid R7K; they did not significantly inhibit the conjugal transfer of IncN plasmid pKM101, IncI
 <sub>2</sub> plasmid TP114, and IncP pUB307, rather the extract and fraction increased the conjugation frequency of plasmids pKM101 and TP114 by a further 20% or more. We therefore suspect that the extract and fraction might be targeting different sites on the conjugation machineries, which may be plasmid incompatibility group specific; hence, the difference in activities. This is plausible, as published literature has shown component variations in the conjugation machineries and the mobilizable (MOB) and mating pair formation (Mpf) systems between different plasmid incompatibility groups [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 2</xref>) revealed that their cytotoxic-IC
 <sub>50s</sub> were 154.0 mg/L and 92.6 mg/L, respectively. A comparison of cytotoxicity of the extract and fraction with effective anti-conjugative activities revealed that the cytotoxic-IC
 <sub>50</sub> level of the hexane extract was above the concentration (100 mg/L) needed to reduce conjugal transfer of the IncW plasmid R7K by 76.5 ± 2.0%. This suggested that the hexane extract showed anti-conjugal activity at a non-toxic concentration. For the methanol fraction, the cytotoxic-IC
 <sub>50</sub> level was slightly below the effective anti-conjugation concentration (100 mg/L), which indicates that cytotoxicity may be an issue for one or more components in the fraction, but whether there is an association with inhibition of plasmid transfer is yet to be determined. No antibacterial activity was observed at a concentration of 512 mg/L for the methanol fraction against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We propose that the activities of the extract and fraction might be through disruption of the conjugative machineries in a highly specific manner, and the slight variation in their anti-conjugal activities against IncW plasmid R7K may be due to the variations in their chemical structure.
