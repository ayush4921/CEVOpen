<p>These findings show that 
 <italic>M. lowiana</italic> possesses potent anti-conjugant and antimicrobial phytochemicals that are worthy of further explorative investigation. The development a potent anti-conjugant molecule and/or new antimicrobial molecule with a new mechanism of action has the potential in reducing transfer and spread of resistance and virulence within important Gram-negative organisms such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
