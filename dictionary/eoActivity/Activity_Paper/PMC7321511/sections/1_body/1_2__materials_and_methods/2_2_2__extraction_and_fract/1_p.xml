 <italic>M. lowiana</italic> stem bark (592 g) was subjected to ultrasound-assisted extraction and extracted successively with hexane, chloroform, and methanol. The powdered plant material was placed in a 5 L glass beaker and covered with the extracting solvent (2.5 L), hexane. This was then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 4 h. The resulting extract was filtered and dried under vacuum. The marc was then dried to remove all residual solvents. The procedure was repeated with the dried marc and chloroform and finally with methanol to obtain extracts of increasing polarity. This yielded a 0.7% hexane extract, a 1.1% chloroform extract, and a 2.2% methanol extract. The extracts were further fractionated using the solid phase extraction. Nonpolar extracts were subjected to normal-phase solid phase extraction (Phenomenex® Strata Silica S1) using a step gradient system, 10% chloroform increments in hexane. Polar extracts were subjected to reverse-phase solid phase extraction (Phenomenex® Strata Silica C18) using a step gradient system, 10% methanol increments in water.
