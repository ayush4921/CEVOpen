<p>The extract and fraction of 
 <italic>M. lowiana</italic> were subjected to qualitative phytochemical screening as per the standard methods. For the test of sterols, the test samples were treated with chloroform and concentrated sulphuric acid. A red colouration at the upper layer and a yellow with green fluorescence at the sulphuric acid layer indicated the presence of sterols. For the test of terpenoids, the test samples were treated with acetic anhydride and concentrated sulphuric acid; formation of blue green rings indicated the presence of terpenoids. The biuret test was used to test for the presence of amide bonds; aqueous solutions of the test samples were treated with 2 drops of 2% copper (II) sulphate solution and 1â€‰mL of 5% sodium hydroxide solution. A violet or bluish violet or pink colouration indicated the presence of amide bonds. For flavonoids, the test samples were treated with a few drops of 1% lead acetate; a yellowish precipitate indicated the presence of flavonoids. For saponins, the froth test was used. The test samples were diluted with distilled water and shaken; formation of foam indicated the presence of saponins. For reducing sugars, Benedict's test was used. For tannins, the gelatin test was used where the test samples were treated with 1% gelatin solution containing sodium chloride. Formation of a white precipitate indicated the presence of tannins.
