<p>The donor cells with plasmids pKM101, TP114, and pUB307 were mated with the recipient ER1793, while plasmid R7K donor cells were mated with the recipient JM109 in the assay. Conjugation was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with minor modifications. Twenty microliters of predetermined inocula (cfu/mL; Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 1</xref>) of donor and recipient was mixed with 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>L Luria Bertani (LB) broth and extract or control drug. This was incubated at 37°C for 18 hours after which the number of transconjugants and donor cells were determined using appropriate antibiotic-containing MacConkey agar plates. Linoleic acid, a known inhibitor of IncW plasmid conjugation, was used as a control in this experiment. The extract and fraction were evaluated for anti-conjugant activity at subinhibitory concentration (one-quarter of their MIC against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> NCTC 10418). Antibiotics and the concentrations used in MacConkey agar for positive identification of donors, recipients, and transconjugants (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were amoxicillin (30), streptomycin sulphate (20), nalidixic acid (30), and kanamycin sulphate (20 and 30). Conjugation frequency was calculated as the ratio of total number of transconjugants (cfu/mL) to the total number of donor (cfu/mL) and expressed as a percentage relative to the negative control. This experiment was performed as duplicate in three independent experiments and anticonjugation activity has been reported as mean ± standard deviation.
