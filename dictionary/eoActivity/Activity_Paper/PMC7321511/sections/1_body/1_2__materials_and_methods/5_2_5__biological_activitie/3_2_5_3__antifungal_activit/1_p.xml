<p>The antifungal activity was determined using the broth dilution method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Fungal strains were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. A fungal suspension equivalent to 1–5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/mL was added to supplemented RPMI-1640 and test sample, which had been serially diluted across the 96 well microtitre plate. Control compounds included the known antifungal agents itraconazole and amphotericin B. The MIC was visually determined under light after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours and 48 hours for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, respectively. MIC values were determined in duplicate per plate and repeated in at least two independent experiments.
