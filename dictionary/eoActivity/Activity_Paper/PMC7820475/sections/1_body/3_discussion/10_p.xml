<p id="p0195">According to the results from the acute oral toxicity test, the median lethal doses (LD50) were greater than &gt;2000 mg/kg for both leaves and the root bark extracts. Generally, the [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] guideline recommends the test chemical to be categorized under experimentally safe substance for use if the LD50 value of the test chemical is more than 3 times the minimum effective dose. Since the hydroalcoholic extract of the leaves and the root bark had an LD50 value of more than the recommended dose (100 mg/kg), it was taken as a good candidate for further studies. Based on the LD50 value, (LD50 &gt; 2000 mg/kg) both extracts can be designated as “unlikely to be hazardous‟ [
