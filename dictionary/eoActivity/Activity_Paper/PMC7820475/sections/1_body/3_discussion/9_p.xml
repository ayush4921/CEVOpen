<p id="p0190">Another metabolites termed as flavonoids reduce lipid peroxidation by preventing or slowing the onset of cell necrosis and improving vascularity which in turn increases the viability of collagen fibrils by increasing the circulation, preventing cell damage, and promoting DNA synthesis. These compounds and Triterpenoids are also promote the wound-healing process mainly due to their anti-microbial and antioxidant ability, which seems to be responsible for wound contraction and increased rate of epithelialization period [

The relationship between antibacterial activity to steroids, anti-inflammatory activity to saponins, and anti-bacterial and anti-analgesic activities to alkaloids is also reported by Kumar Bargah where all these metabolites attributed to fast wound contraction and shorter epithelialization period [
