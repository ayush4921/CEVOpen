<p id="p0165">Wound contraction role is crucial as it decreases wound dimension and increases amount of extracellular matrix required to repair the defect cell and assists re-epithelization [

The wound reduction effect of the extracts here may be due to inhibition of microbial growth particularly in the inflammatory phase, their mitogenic activity which enhances motility of the fibroblast and its cellular proliferation as well as subsequential conversion to myofibroblasts through the healing process mainly being dermal [
