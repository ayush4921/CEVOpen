<p id="p0065">As per the excision wound model, wound site was made by anesthetized the experimental animals. The surgical processes were done under sterile conditions by utilizing ketamine (80 mg/kg) plus diazepam (5 mg/kg i. p) and a full-thickness of circular excision wound measuring 314 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and 2mm depth was prepared on the shaved dorsal thoracic region. The dose of ketamine and diazepam was selected at the indicated range due to the limited cardiovascular effects including minimal hypotension and better anesthetics effect during the actual experiment. Then both medicated and simple ointments were applied topically on daily bases as described under grouping and dosing section. Wounding day was considering as day 0. Wound closure to the wounded area and its period of epithelialization were observed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14
 <sup>th</sup> days of post wound [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The percentage of wound contraction effect of the extracts was calculated (Taking the initial size of wound i.e. 314mm
 <sup>2</sup> as 100 %) using equation [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as follow [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
