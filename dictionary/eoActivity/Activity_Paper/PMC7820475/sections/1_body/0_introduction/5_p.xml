Accordingly, the tissue injury caused by cuts or surgical incisions in acute wound is going on through orderly and timely reparative process, results in sustained restoration of anatomic and functional integrity and the healing process has been completed within the predictable time frame [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If this orderly and timely reparative process of healing is failed and goes to a state of pathologic inflammation; the wound is considered as chronic [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this type of wound, healing process is delayed, incomplete, and does not proceed in a coordinated manner, resulting in poor anatomic and functional integrity over 3 months [
