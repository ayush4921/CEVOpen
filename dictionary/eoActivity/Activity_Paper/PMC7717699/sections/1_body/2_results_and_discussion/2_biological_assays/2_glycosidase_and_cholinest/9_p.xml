<p>Compounds 
 <bold>11e–g</bold> turned out to be either mixed or non-competitive inhibitors, as evidenced by the Cornish–Bowden plots. This means that the title compound can bind either the free enzyme (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>ia</sub>) or the complex enzyme-substrate (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>ib</sub>). In order to illustrate this issue, Cornish–Bowden plots for derivative 
 <bold>11e</bold> against BuChE (mixed inhibition) are depicted in
