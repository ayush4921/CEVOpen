<p>To analyse the potential cytotoxicity of title compounds, their antiproliferative activity was measured. For that purpose, one solid tumour cell line (SH-SY5Y, glioblastoma) as a model of brain cells, and one non-tumour cell line (BJ-hTERT human fibroblasts) were used. Data show no disruption of cell growth for most of the compounds tested. Only catechol-containing 
 <bold>11d</bold>, exhibited a moderate antiproliferative effect against the non-tumour cell line (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 39 ± 5 µM). Interestingly, the rest of the compounds, and particularly the lead compounds (
 <bold>11e–g</bold>) lacked significant growth inhibition effects when tested as a concentration as high as 100 µM (GI
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM).
