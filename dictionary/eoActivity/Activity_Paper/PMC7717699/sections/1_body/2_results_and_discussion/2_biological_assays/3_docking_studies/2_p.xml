<p>Docking calculations also predict that compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> forms a complex with BuChE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). The iminosugar moiety establishes H-bond interactions with Trp82 and Glu197 at the cationic active subsite (CAS) and with His438 at the catalytic subsite. Additionally, the aromatic ring moiety is involved in van der Waals interactions with residues Thr284, Pro285, Asn289 at the peripheral anionic subsite (PAS). Taken together, these calculations predict that 
 <bold>11e</bold> interacts in similar modes with both enzymes (as seen in the 3D figures) except for the interaction with His438 in BuChE which is missing in AChE. The Ï€ stacking interactions with Trp286 seen in AChE are not present in BuChE because there is no equivalent residue at the BuChE peripheral anionic subsite.
