<p>Selected results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and inhibition constants values, together with the mode of inhibition are depicted. 1-DNJ is a good inhibitor of α-galactosidase and moderate of α-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16 and 35 µM, respectively), and a weak inhibitor of β-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 71 µM). However, compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold> lacked significant activity against α-glucosidase and α/β-galactosidases (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Table S1), and regarding β-glucosidase, compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> ranged from good (
 <bold>11b</bold>, 
 <bold>d</bold>, and 
 <bold>e</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 12–15 µM) to strong competitive inhibitors (
 <bold>11a</bold>, 
 <bold>c</bold>, 
 <bold>f</bold>, and 
 <bold>g</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 4.6–8.4 µM). This means a complete reversal of selectivity towards β-glucosidase, with a 15-fold increased activity compared to natural 1-DNJ, suggesting that the more lipophilic substituents favour interaction with β-glucosidase. The same behaviour was found upon alkylation on

 </xref>. Interestingly, a decrease in the tether length (compounds 
 <bold>12</bold>) was found to be detrimental for the inhibition of β-glucosidase (e.g. 4‒6-fold for 
 <bold>12a</bold>, 
 <bold>c</bold>), showing the great influence of such structural motif.
