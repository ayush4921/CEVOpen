<p>In terms of inhibition, AChE contains two key regions

 </xref>: the catalytic anionic site (CAS), which enables cation–π interactions with the quaternary ammonium fragment of acetylcholine, the natural substrate of the enzyme, and the peripheral anionic site (PAS), enriched with aromatic amino acid residues, and located roughly 15 Å from CAS through a narrow gorge, capable of establishing interactions with planar and aromatic residues. It is important to mention that PAS is also involved in the initial step of β-amyloid aggregation

 </xref>. Accordingly, dual inhibitors establishing favourable interactions with both, CAS and PAS, can be not only strong inhibitors, but they can also contribute to ameliorate the formation of neurotoxic amyloid plaques.
