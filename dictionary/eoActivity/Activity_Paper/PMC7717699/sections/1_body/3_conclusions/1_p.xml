<p>We have accomplished the straightforward preparation of hitherto unknown cholinesterases inhibitors based on the use of the iminosugar 1-DNJ as the key pharmacophore for struggling with the low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in Alzheimer’s disease. Appendage of an ether-connected aromatic motif with different substitution patterns allowed the modulation of the activity towards cholinesterases. Compounds bearing relatively lipophilic disubstituted phenyl moieties (3,4-diOMe, 3-OH/4-OMe, 3,4-OCH
 <sub>2</sub>O) turned out to be strong inhibitors of AChE, and particularly of BuChE, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and

 <sub>i</sub> values within the low micromolar range. The presumptive binding mode of the lead compound to cholinesterases was analysed using molecular docking simulations, revealing interactions with two key regions of the enzyme, CAS, and PAS. Moreover, as well as the strong anticholinergic activity, the lack of remarkable growth inhibition effects at a concentration as high as 100 µM suggests a good profile for the development of future anti-Alzheimer’s drugs based on iminosugars.
