<p>Imino- and azasugars, that is, carbohydrate mimetics where the endocyclic oxygen or a carbon atom, respectively, has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that has attracted great attention within Medicinal Chemistry since several decades ago

 </xref>. The key structural motif of such glycomimetics is a protonable nitrogen atom, which might allow them to mimic transition states (in terms of charge and geometry)

This choice is strongly supported by the World Laureates Association Shanghai Centre. Some iminosugars have also been found to act as chaperones
