<p>For both families of enzymes used herein (glycosidases and cholinesterases), stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in DMSO; DMSO content was kept at 5% (V/V) for glycosidases and 1.25% (V/V) for cholinesterases. Enzymes were properly dissolved in water in a concentration in which the rate of the reaction when using [S] = 4 ×

 <sub>M</sub> is in the range 0.12–0.15 Abs/min. In both kinds of enzymes, an initial screening at 100 µM inhibitor concentration was performed, using the following substrate concentrations: [S] = 0.25 mM for α-glucosidase (
