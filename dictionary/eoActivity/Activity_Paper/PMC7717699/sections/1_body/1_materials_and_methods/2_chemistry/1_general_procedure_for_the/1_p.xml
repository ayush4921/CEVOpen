<p>To a solution of the corresponding 2-arylethanol derivatives 
 <bold>14a–g</bold> (2.19 mmol) in DMF (5 ml), 60% NaH (525 mg, 13.14 mmol, 6.0 equiv.) was added and the resulting mixture was kept stirring at rt under an inert atmosphere for 30 min. Then, 1,6-dibromohexane or 1,5-dibromopentane was added (17.52 mmol, 8.0 equiv.), and stirring was kept for a further 5 h in the case of 
 <bold>7</bold>, and 4 h in the case of 
 <bold>8</bold>. The reaction was quenched by the careful addition of water at 0 °C. After that, the crude reaction mixture was diluted with brine (50 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 ml). The combined organic fractions were dried over Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography, using the eluent indicated in each case to give compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> as colourless oils (See
