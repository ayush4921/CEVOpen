 <sup>1</sup>H (300.1 MHz) and 
 <sup>13</sup>C (75.5 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer using the deuterated solvent indicated in each case. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C assignments were confirmed by 2D COSY and HSQC experiments. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. TLCs were performed on aluminium pre-coated sheets (E. Merck Silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>); spots were visualised by UV light, and by charring with 10% vanillin in EtOH containing 1% of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, or with 10% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in EtOH. Column chromatography was performed using E. Merck Silica Gel 60 (40–63 μm), using the eluent indicated in each case.
