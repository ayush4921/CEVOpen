<p>Since the local villagers’ attempt to grow 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> from its seeds failed, seeds of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> were collected to initiate germination trials. Although a straight forward germination attempt of the seeds did not produce satisfactory results, application of contemporary seed germination procedures, such as cold stratification, successfully produced sprouting seeds (

 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> were generated from the sprouting seeds over the period of two subsequent years and then, both one- and two-year old plants were transported to the Cappadocia region for reintroduction and replanted in their parent plants’ location by local villagers (
