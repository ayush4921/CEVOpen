<p>Despite the failure of establishment of seedlings and one-year-old saplings during the summer months, two-year old saplings were well established in the orchard and continued to grow in the following years. Over the next eight years, the basal leaves of re-established plants continued to grow to reach the maturation stage. However, they did not produce a fruiting stem. This unusually slow growth of the mature plant indicates that 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> must be a monocarpic species, that is the development of a fruiting stem requires several years of rhizome development to reach such enormous size and then formation of the fruiting stem signals the end of 
 <italic>F. drudeana’s</italic> life cycle. Comparison of the basal leaf size of the replanted plants at their eighth year of development stage with those of wild growing plants suggests that the fruiting stem of replanted 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> might develop at the ninth or tenth year of the plant’s development stage (
