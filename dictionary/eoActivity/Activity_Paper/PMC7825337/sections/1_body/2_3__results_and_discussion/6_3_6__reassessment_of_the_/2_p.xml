<p>As was depicted by the numismatic figures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f013">Figure 13</xref>), herbivore animals love to feed on the fruits of the silphion plant. In fact, due to consumption by livestock residing in the nearby shelter, we were not able to find a single stalk with fruits in the small population of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> growing in the adjacent lot of a stone-walled orchard. If the garden where 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> is growing was not protected by the piled stone-wall (

 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> population growing there might have been destroyed by now, as happened in the neighboring lot. Interestingly, Arrian (96â€“180 AD) mentions that in Cyrene they fence off the silphion growth sites so that the animals cannot get to them [
