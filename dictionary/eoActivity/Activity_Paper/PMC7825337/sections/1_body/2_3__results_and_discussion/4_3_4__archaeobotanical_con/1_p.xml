<p>In 1979, “The Manchester Museum Mummy Project” investigations identified the use of “
 <italic>galbanum</italic>” oleo-gum-resin to secure bandages during the wrapping of the mummy. The investigation team arrived at this conclusion by the chromatographic comparison of various organic extracts of mummy bandages with 
 <italic>galbanum</italic> extracts and, more specifically, with umbelliferone [

 <xref rid="B160-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. It is highly problematic to rely on umbelliferone, a ubiquitous plant coumarin, as a marker substance of 
 <italic>galbanum</italic>. Nevertheless, umbelliferone is also one of the major coumarin of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> oleo-gum-resin that may indicate the use of silphion during the mummification process. Especially, the known use of silphion in “Egyptian ritual of renewal of the King’s vigor” [
