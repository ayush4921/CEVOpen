<p>In 2015, an ancient Roman necropolis was discovered ca. 30 km NE of Rome. In order to understand the lifestyle adopted by the Roman Imperial community of 
 <italic>Ager Curensis</italic>, a combined approach of morphological and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses was applied on the dental plaques of skeletal remains to identify their edible and/or medicinal plant species use [
 <xref rid="B161-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. One of the sesquiterpene derivative identified during the GC-MS analyses was shyobunol and authors suggest that this compound should be considered as a potential biomarker of a 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species. This assumption was derived from the presence of shyobunol in the essential oil of 
 <italic>F. vesceritensis</italic> Coss. et Dur. [
 <xref rid="B162-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], an endemic 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species from Algeria. However, elemene sesquiterpenoids are not common secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species. There are five published essential oil analyses of 
 <italic>F. vesceritensis</italic> in the literature and just one of them reports elemene sesquiterpene (i.e., shyobunol) as its major component (i.e., 18.1%) [

 <xref rid="B163-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B164-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>,
 <xref rid="B166-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Furthermore, comparisons of essential oil analyses of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species from Turkey and Iran indicate that out of 35 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species analyzed by GC-MS, only one species, 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic>, contains a high level of elemene-type sesquiterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B167-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>,
 <xref rid="B168-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Essential oil of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> contains ca. 65% shyobunone isomeric mixtures and the essential oil composition of major 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> populations were consistent [
 <xref rid="B168-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Nevertheless, the elemene-type sesquiterpenoid identified by the GC-MS analyses of dental plaques was mentioned as shyobunol, not shyobunone. This discrepancy may be explained by the chemistry of the derivatization procedure applied to the samples before the GC-MS analyses; the calculus samples were treated with 3% hydrochloric acid overnight and then extracted with hexane. Following the extraction and concentration of analysis samples, they were treated with Burgessâ€™s reagent to produce dehydrated derivatives of elemene-type sesquiterpenoids which were subjected to GC-MS analyses. This derivatization procedure may yield the same derivatives for shyobunone(s) and shyobunol(s). Additionally, it should be noted that elemene-type sesquiterpenoids can isomerize to germacrane derivatives via Cope Rearrangement at high temperatures during the GC analyses which could muddle the results of such analytical procedures. Nevertheless, we may speculate that the person who had this elemene-type sesquiterpenoid in his/her dental plaque might have indulged a meal with silphion sauce [
 <xref rid="B169-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>] or orally taken a silphion containing medication before their demise.
