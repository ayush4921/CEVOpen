<p>Dioscorides described the oleo-gum-resin of the silphion plant as the juice of the plant [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], there were two kinds of juice obtained from the silphion; stalk juice and root juice which were produced by the incision of stem or root of plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f003">Figure 3</xref>), respectively. Dioscorides described the juice of silphion as the most effective part of silphion, indeed, the oleo-gum-resin of the plant contains virtually all of the bioactive chemicals produced by the plant, which justifies the statement of Dioscorides. Dioscorides also reiterated that the smell of resin is predominant and gentle. In contrast, the resins obtained from Syrian and Median (i.e., Persian) plants were weaker in activity and had a poisonous smell. Such description sets silphion clearly apart from the resins produced by the other

 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> These descriptions closely match the organoleptic characteristics of the oleo-gum-resin of 
 <italic>F. drdeana</italic>. It has a very pleasant-smelling odor but an acrid taste due to the high terpenoid content of the resin.
