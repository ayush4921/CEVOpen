<p>Most ancient scientists have mentioned silphion in their manuscripts, including Theophrastus of Eresos, father of Botany, who provided some morphological description of the plant in his “Enquiry into Plants” [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hippocrates extensively used silphion in his recipes [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], for example, he reported preparation of a poultice made with silphion to treat a protruded gut (i.e., hernia) in his book “On Fistulae” [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Soranus of Ephesus advised drinking of a chick-pea sized Cyrenaic balm (i.e., silphion) once a month with two cyaths of water to induce the menstruation in his “Gynecology” [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Asclepiades of Bithynia described an oral prescription as well as a plaster containing silphion for the treatment of cardiac disease defined as “inflammation in the heart” [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pliny the Elder described an early account of the extinction of the silphion plant in his “Natural History” as well as thirty-nine remedies made with silphion [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dioscorides dedicated a comprehensive monograph in his “De Materia Medica” for this drug. In addition to the description of the silphion plant [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], he provided a detailed documentation of its medicinal uses for the treatment of several diseases such as goiter, sciatica, tooth ache, intestinal disorders, hormonal disorders, epilepsy, tetanus, polyps, and malignant tumors in his monograph [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Ironically, the consensus of the experts in classical studies is that the only direct source of information about the silphion plant is Theophrastus, and that later descriptions were commentary and none of the other ancient scientists had actually seen the plant itself [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to some medicinal historians, silphion was used as an aphrodisiac [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and as a powerful contraceptive [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Perhaps due to these virtues, silphion was over harvested and became extinct in the first century AD [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, there are some references suggesting that silphion was cultivated and continued to exist well into the fifth century. Synesius, a Cyrenian aristocrat and bishop of Ptolemais, claimed that he had seen the plant itself and sent lots of silphion juice to his friend Tryphon in Constantinople (i.e., now Istanbul, Turkey) [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the extinct status of silphion, it is still a hot research topic among the academicians, and several master and doctorate theses have been dedicated to this subject [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
