<p>Unfortunately, no specimen of the silphion plant exists to confirm its genus or family, but descriptions provided by Theophrastus in the “Enquiry into Plants” [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and descriptions of the other ancient scientists strongly suggest that this plant, most likely, is a member of the genus

 <italic>Ferula</italic> (Apiaceae) comprises ca. 190 species worldwide and includes well known medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> L. and 
 <italic>F. gummosa</italic> Boiss. that are sources of the medicinal oleo-gum-resins asafoetida and galbanum, which have been used since ancient times. In addition to silphion, Dioscorides also described other oleo-gum-resins obtained from 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species such as ammoniakon (African ammoniacum), sagapenon (
 <italic>sagapenum</italic>), narthex and chalbane (
