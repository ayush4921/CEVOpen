<p>Air-dried and coarsely powdered roots (900 g) of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> were extracted successively in a Soxhlet extractor with hexane, dichloromethane and methanol in the following manner; plant material was briefly soaked (ca. 10 min) in the solvent at room temperature and then the solvent was allowed to siphon. The room temperature maceration procedure was repeated three times, and the solvent of combined plant extracts was distilled on a rotary evaporator in vacuo. Following the room temperature maceration procedure, additional solvent was charged on the plant material and continuous extraction procedure was allowed to continue for 24 h in the Soxhlet extractor. The plant material was removed and dried completely after each extraction step before continuing the extraction with more polar solvents (i.e., dichloromethane and methanol). After the completion of the sequential extraction process, extracts of each solvent were combined and concentrated using a rotary evaporator in vacuo. The yields of each extract as follows; hexane extract 46 g (5.1%), dichloromethane extract 18 g (2.0%) and methanol extract 68.5 g (7.6%).
