<p>Thanks to the ancient smugglers who presumably have brought the seeds of the silphion plant to Anatolia [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this precious species may have survived the extinction that its relatives had suffered in the Cyrenaic region of Libya ca. 2000 years ago. However, currently there is a greater danger lurking around 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> growing in Anatolia perpetrated by the onslaught of publications appearing in various journals that the 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species growing in Anatolia has aphrodisiac qualities [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and can help people that have erectile dysfunction problems [
 <xref rid="B171-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>,
 <xref rid="B172-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>,
 <xref rid="B173-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. If short-term commercial exploitation is unchecked, the very large-scale destruction of their roots certainly will drive many endemic 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species in Turkey to extinction, as has happened with the large population of 
 <italic>F. elaeochytris</italic> Korovin growing on Mt. Cassius (i.e., Kel Dağı). Ironically, the same circumstances that caused the over-exploitation and extinction of the silphion plant in the Cyrenaic region 2000 years ago, also haunts its close relatives in Anatolia. Unfortunately, if subjected to this destructive scheme, the remainder of surviving silphion plants may become completely extinct.
