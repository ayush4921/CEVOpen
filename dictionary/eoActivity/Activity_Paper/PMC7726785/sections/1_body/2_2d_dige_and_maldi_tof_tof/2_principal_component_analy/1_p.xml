<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on all 172 spot features demonstrated significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 by ANOVA) changes in abundance, as identified by MS. Also, PCA revealed that the three groups clustered markedly from one another based on different proteins, with 82% as the cutoff score (

 </xref>A,B). The clustering pattern showed that the change in protein intensity for selected spots between ME, SE, and the control sample was significantly different. A heatmap was generated using all the 119 significant proteins identified by MS. The heatmap (

  <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>
 </xref>) showed that most of the 119 identified proteins had upregulated expression patterns among the ME-treated and control samples when compared with the SE-treated sample, as indicated by shades of red for high expression or green for low expression.
