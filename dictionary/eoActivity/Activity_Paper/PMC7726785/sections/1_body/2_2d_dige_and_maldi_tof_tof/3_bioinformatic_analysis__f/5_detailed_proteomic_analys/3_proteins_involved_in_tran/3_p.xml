<p>Another translation elongation protein in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is elongation factor G, which is highly sensitive to oxidation.

 </sup> The expression of elongation factor G was increased in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> subjected to ME in contrast with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE. Oxidation might show that ROS could enhance 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce elongation factor G because the latter is highly sensitive to oxidation and carbonylation in stressed 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> after H

 <sub>2</sub> exposure.

 </sup> However, different trends were detected for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> subjected to both extracts. A decrease in translational elongation processes in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> under hyperosmotic conditions has been observed, which suggests a reduction in protein synthesis under stress conditions.

 </sup> Moreover, Tu is a component of the elongation of peptides.

 </sup> The expression of the elongation factors Ts and T1 was upregulated and the expression of the elongation factor T2 was downregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated by ME and SE, respectively. In growth media that contain an excess of zinc, the expression of the elongation factor Tu was downregulated as a stress-response mechanism.

 </sup> The expression of the RNA polymerase-binding transcription factor DksA was upregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with both extracts separately, which might indicate that transcription was favored. An identical observation was recorded when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was tested under alkaline conditions by Gonzales-Siles and colleagues.

 </sup> The expression of 16 gene expression-related proteins was affected by treatment with SE (mostly downregulated), which suggested that the activity of the extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> could be related to protein suppression, which might not be the case after treatment with ME. Furthermore, FU reported that a 60-kDa chaperonin enhanced polypeptide folding and refolding of damaged proteins
