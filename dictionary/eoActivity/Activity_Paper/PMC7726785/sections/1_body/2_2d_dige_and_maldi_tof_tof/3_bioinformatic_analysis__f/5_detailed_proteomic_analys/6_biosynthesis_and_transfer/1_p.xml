<p>A total of 16 differentially expressed proteins involved in the synthesis of organic compounds in cells were identified in treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Of these, the expression of nine was upregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME; the expression of 12 was downregulated and the expression of 1 was upregulated in SE-treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (

 </xref>). Amino acids have a vital role as the building blocks of proteins. Under stress, it has been suggested that the expression of some proteins might be upregulated to enable protein adaptation. Upregulation of the expression of several enzymes involved in amino-acid synthesis has been documented for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> under heat stress.
