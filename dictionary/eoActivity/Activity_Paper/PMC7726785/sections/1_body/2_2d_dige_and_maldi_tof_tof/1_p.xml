<p>Proteomic analysis of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was carried out to discover the mechanism of action for the test extracts. 2D-difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was employed to assess significant changes in protein abundance among 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), SE (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), and the untreated control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). Representative profiles of fluorescent proteins using 2D-DIGE included the control labeled with Cy3 (

 </xref>A), ME-treated microbes labeled with Cy5 (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>A,B, respectively. Upon mapping all spots on the gels, 1580 spots were identified. Of these, 172 were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 by ANOVA and a fold change ≥1.5) between the treatment group and control group (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>). All gels reproduced spot patterns across them, resulting in alignment and further analyses. Cy2 labeling was used as an internal standard to allow normalization across the complete set of gels and for quantitative differential analysis of protein expression. Then, the 172 significant spots identified were excised manually from the preparative gel for protein identification using mass spectrometry (MS). Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) identified 119 out of the 172 protein spots, of which 81 spots were found to be unique protein sequences by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-
 <italic>time of flight mass</italic> spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and were matched to entries in the SWISS-PROT database (

Proteins identified by PMFs had a sequence coverage ranging from 12 to 93%. Variants of the same protein were found at several locations on the gel at a few places (

 </xref>). Among the 119 proteins identified, the expression of 42 proteins was upregulated and that of 6 proteins was downregulated in the ME-treated sample in comparison with that in the control; the expression of 12 proteins was upregulated and that of 104 proteins was downregulated in the SE-treated sample in comparison with the control group; the expression of 11 proteins was upregulated and that of 108 proteins was downregulated in the SE-treated sample in comparison with the ME-treated sample (

The highest upregulated proteins were formate acetyltransferase 1 and CTP synthase in the ME-treated sample compared with the control; elongation factor Tu 2 and the DNA-binding protein HU-α in the SE-treated sample compared with the control; and the DNA-binding protein HU-α and POS ribosomal protein L10 in the SE-treated sample compared with the ME-treated sample. The proteins for which the expression was decreased were elongation factor Tu 2 and POS ribosomal protein L10 in the ME-treated sample compared with the control; 305 ribosomal protein S1 and elongation factor Ts in the SE-treated sample compared with the control; and formate acetyltransferase 1 and CTP synthase in the SE-treated sample compared with the ME-treated sample. A complete list of upregulated and downregulated proteins is provided in the

Among the identified proteins, proteins including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase subunit beta, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and outer-membrane protein A were found in more than one spot on gels. These effects could be due to post-translational modifications, cleavage by enzymes, or the presence of different protein species.
