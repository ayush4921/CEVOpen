 <italic>Asphaltum punjabianum</italic> is known as “shilajeet” and is removed from rocks in the Himalayas in India. It is a natural substance formed for centuries by the gradual decomposition of plants by the action of microorganisms. It is a form of mineral that drips from the cracks of rocks during hot weather. Many researchers have noted that shilajeet is most probably of the vegetable origin and dissimilar to “tar seeps”.
