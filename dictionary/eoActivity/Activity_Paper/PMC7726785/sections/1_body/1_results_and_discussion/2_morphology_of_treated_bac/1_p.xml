<p>We tried to identify the possible mechanism of action of plant extracts against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Hence, microbes were subjected to plant extracts, and then, after 2 h, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to ascertain variations in cell morphology. Morphologic differences besides cell elongation were observed for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (

 </xref>). Similar morphologic and membrane changes have been noted by SEM for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> when treated with a 
 <italic>Memecylon candidum</italic> extract.

 </sup> The antibacterial activity of plant extracts is incompletely understood but could be related to cellular oxidation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production because variation in cell morphology was observed. The change as cell enlargement appears from the increase in all dimensions might also be related to the increase in membrane permeability and the accumulation of fluids or influx of the plant extract inside the cell.
