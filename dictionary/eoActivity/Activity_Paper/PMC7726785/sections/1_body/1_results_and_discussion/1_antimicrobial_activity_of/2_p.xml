<p>Commonly used antibiotics had activity against

 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but no activity was noticed for bacteriocin (

 </xref>). Compared with commonly used antibiotics, SE and ME showed 63.9% and 59.9% of ciprofloxacin activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and &gt;100% of tetracycline and cefixime activities against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Double the tetracycline activity was observed for SE and ME against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The efficacy of the extracts and antibiotics was assessed when they were combined. An antagonistic effect was observed against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> when SE was combined with tetracycline, but a clear effect was not observed when SE was combined with bacitracin, ciprofloxacin, or cefixime in relation to activity for the antibiotic alone. No activity of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, or cefixime was observed against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, when SE was combined with ciprofloxacin, high activity was observed (

 </xref>). The combination of ME and tetracycline reduced the activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> compared with that observed with ME alone. However, upon combination with ciprofloxacin, higher activity was observed compared with that for ME, although it was lower than the antibiotic effect. With regard to 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, no activity was observed for ciprofloxacin or bacitracin, but when each was combined with ME, activity was clearly observed, but it was lower than that for ME alone. When tetracycline was combined with ME, the activity was higher than that for the antibiotic alone but lower than the activity of ME alone. No activity for bacitracin before and after combination with ME was noted (

 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> wound isolates.

 </sup> Interestingly, ciprofloxacin and cefixime showed no activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> but when extracts were added to the disks and then examined, a high antibacterial effect was observed.
