<p>The protein extracted (50 μg) from each sample underwent Cy3 labeling or Cy5 labeling. Also, a mixture of an equal amount of all samples was pooled, labeled with Cy2, and used as an internal standard as described previously.

 </sup> During labeling, dye switching was applied to avoid a dye-specific bias (

 </sup> Furthermore, a Typhoon 9410 scanner (GE Healthcare) was used for imaging the 2D-DIGE gels using excitation/emission wavelengths specific for Cy2 (488/520 nm), Cy3 (532/580 nm), and Cy5 (633/670 nm).
