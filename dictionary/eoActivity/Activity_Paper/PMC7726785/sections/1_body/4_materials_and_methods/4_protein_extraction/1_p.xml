<p>Protein extraction was done as described previously with some modifications. Briefly, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 40 °C. The resulting pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after discarding the supernatant. Following centrifugation, the protein pellets were suspended in the lysis buffer (0.5 mL; pH 8.8; 30 mM Tris buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% Chaps, and the protease inhibitor cocktail; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) for 30 min on ice. Sonication was carried out for 30 s with 3–4 pulses to obtain a clear solution. Unbroken or debris cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, solubilized proteins in the supernatant were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined in triplicate using the 2D-Quant Kit according to the manufacturer’s (GE Healthcare) instructions.
