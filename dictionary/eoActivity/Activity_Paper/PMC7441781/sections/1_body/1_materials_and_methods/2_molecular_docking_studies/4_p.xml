<p>The compounds are prepared by LigPrep module of Schrödinger suite and docked in to a catalytic pocket of COVID-19 by using Glide module of Schrödinger suite 2019 in XP (extra precision) mode (Jacobson et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The binding modes with best glide G scores were selected. These scores perceive positive lipophilic, hydrogen-bonding and metal–ligand associations and punish steric conflicts. The XP visualizer of Glide module was used to analyze the results of docking studies (Friesner et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The Glide score of the molecules was compared with the Glide score of the standard compounds ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, hydroxychloroquine and mataquine (Barros et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) which is recommended for COVID-19. The Gide scoring capacity is mainly dependent on docking parameters like lipophilic perseverance in which the ligands are covered in the lipophilic pocket. The electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding with ligands are other parameters to increase the binding affinity. Some negative parameters like XP penalties, rotational penalties etc. will diminish the Glide score.
