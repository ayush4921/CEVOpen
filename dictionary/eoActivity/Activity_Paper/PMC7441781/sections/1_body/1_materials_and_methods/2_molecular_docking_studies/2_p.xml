<p>The 3D crystal structure of COVID-19 protein called SARS-CoV-2 main protease receptor co-crystallized with 6-(ethylamino) pyridine-3-carbonitrile (PDB ID: 5R82, Resolution: 1.31 Å) was retrieved from the protein data bank. The protein was prepared using protein preparation wizard of epic module (Sastry et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) of Schrödinger suite 2019. The protein structure is a monomer, which was prepared by removing similar binding sites, unnecessary water molecules and also refining bond orders. Missing chain atoms are added by using the prime module of Schrödinger suite 2019. Protein minimization was performed using optimized potentials for liquid simulations-3 (OPLS-3) molecular force field with root mean square difference (RMSD) of crystallographic heavy atoms kept at 0.3 Å. A grid box was generated to define the centroid of the active site.
