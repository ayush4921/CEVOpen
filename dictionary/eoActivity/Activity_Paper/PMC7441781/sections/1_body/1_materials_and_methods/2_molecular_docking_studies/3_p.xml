<p>The designed ligands (
 <bold>A1–A48</bold>) were prepared by using LigPrep module of Schrodinger suite 2019-4. 2D structures were converted to 3D structures, as well as energy minimization and optimized for their geometry, desalted and corrected for their chirality. The ionization and tautomeric states were generated between pH 6.8 and 7.2 by using Epik module. The ligands 
 <bold>A1–A48</bold> were minimized using OPLS-3 force field in Schrodinger suit 2019-4 until a RMSD of 2.0 Å was achieved. A single low energy ring confirmation per ligand was generated, and the optimized ligands were used for docking analysis.
