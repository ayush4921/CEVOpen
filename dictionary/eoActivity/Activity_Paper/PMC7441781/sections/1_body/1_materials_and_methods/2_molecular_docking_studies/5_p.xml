<p>The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> ADMET properties of the proposed ligands 
 <bold>A1â€“A48</bold> were determined by QikProp module of Schrodinger suit. The prepared ligands were subjected to the QikProp module to determine the ADMET properties such as molecular weight, dipole moment, number of H-bond donors and acceptors, log P values, violence in rule of five, and oral absorption.
