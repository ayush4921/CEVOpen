<p>The binding free energy of ligand-receptor complex and post docking energy minimization studies were performed using prime molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GB/SA) of Schrödinger 2019. The energy for minimized XP docked pose of ligand receptor complex was calculated using the OPLS3 force field and generalized-born/surface area (GB/SA) continuum VSGB 2.0 solvent model (Li et al.,
