<p>In conclusion, from the oxazine-substituted 9-anilinoacridines 
 <bold>A1–A48</bold>, many compounds have significant binding affinity with SARS CoV-2 main protease. Molecular docking and binding free energy calculation studies were performed to find the possible binding modes of ligands and the influence of favorable and non-favourable interactions within the active pocket of COVID-19 protein. MD simulation for the highly active inhibitor 
 <bold>A38</bold> in complex with protein 5R82 revealed that the stabilization of ligand was achieved due to the formation of uninterrupted hydrophobic interactions. The results demonstrated for further modifications in pharmacophoric features may help in improvement of inhibitory activity. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> structuring strategy embraced in the present investigation helped for recognizing some lead molecules and furthermore may somewhat clarify their useful impact for further determinations like 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assessments. The results from the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study exhibited that compounds 
 <bold>A38</bold>, 
 <bold>A13</bold>, 
 <bold>A23</bold>, 
 <bold>A18</bold> and 
 <bold>A7</bold> may be significantly active against COVID-19 with remedial possibilities and are probably going to be helpful after further refinement.
