<p>The 2D-trajectory interaction diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>) depicts that the hydrogen bond formed by the docking pose with Asn119 is preserved in the MD trajectory pose. The methoxy group in compound A38 donated one hydrogen bond to Asn119 with 24%, the nitrogen of acridine ring accepted one hydrogen bond with Arg188 and Ser144 through water molecule with 21% and 51% of total simulation time, respectively. The nitrogen of the oxazine ring accepted one hydrogen bond from Gly143 and the amino group accepted hydrogen bonds from Gly143 and Ser144 with 58% and 51%, respectively, of total simulation time. The pi-pi stacking of acridine with His41 was 67%. The RMSF (
