<p>A total of 27 ligand contacts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>) were formed with amino acids of protein, from Gln19 to Met49, Asn119, Phe140 to Pro168 and Phe181 to Gln192. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>, it was stated that the ligand is stabilized by forming majority of hydrophobic interactions (5%–90% of simulation time) with residues His41, Met49, Cys145, Met165, Leu167, Pro168 and Phe181. It also formed hydrogen bonds with Gly19, Asn28, His41, Asn119, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144 and Gln189 over the course of 10%–65% of simulation trajectory. The timeline representation of protein-ligand contacts is outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>.
