<p>From the obtained binding modes, it was illustrated that the ligands formed hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and other interactions with different residues GLN19 to GLN189 surrounding the active pocket. Ligand A13 exhibited hydrogen bonding interaction with ASN142 (H-bond length: 3.06 Å) and ASN119 (H-bond length: 1.79 Å) residues and these are shown in
