<p>The ADMET properties for compounds 
 <bold>A1–A48</bold> can be investigated by the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> method by using QikProp module of Schrödinger suite 2019-4. The molecular weight of the compounds is between 380 and 544 g mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. The dipole moment of the compounds is between 1 and 5.7. The estimated number of hydrogen bond donors of the compounds is in the range of 3–4. The estimated number of hydrogen bond acceptors of the compounds is in the range of 4.5–6.75. The number of likely metabolites of the compounds is in the range of 2–6. The number of violations of Lipinski’s rule of five is 0–2. The percentage of human oral absorption for the compounds is between 70% and 100%; Therefore, almost all the ADMET properties of the compounds are within the recommended values. The results of the ADMET properties for compounds 
 <bold>A1–A48</bold> are shown in Table S1 (
