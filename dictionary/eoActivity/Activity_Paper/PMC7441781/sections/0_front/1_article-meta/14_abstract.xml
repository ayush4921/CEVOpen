 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a life-threatening disease, is caused by SARS-CoV-2. The targeted therapeutics of small molecules helps the scientific community to fight against SARS-CoV-2. In this article, some oxazine substituted 9-anilinoacridines (
  <bold>A1–A48</bold>) was designed by docking, MM-GBSA and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies for their COVID-19 inhibitory activity. The docking of ligands 
  <bold>A1–A48</bold> against SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 5R82) are performed by using Glide module, 
  <italic>in silico</italic> ADMET screening by QikProp module, binding energy using Prime MM-GB/SA module, MD simulation by Desmond module and atomic charges were derived by Jaguar module of Schrodinger suit 2019-4. Compound 
  <bold>A38</bold> has the highest G-score (−7.83) when compared to all the standard compounds which are proposed for COVID-19 treatment such as ritonavir (−7.48), lopinavir (−6.94), nelfinavir (−5.93), hydroxychloroquine (−5.47) and mataquine (−5.37). Compounds 
  <bold>A13</bold>, 
  <bold>A23</bold>, 
  <bold>A18</bold>, 
  <bold>A7</bold>, 
  <bold>A48</bold>, 
  <bold>A46</bold>, 
  <bold>A32</bold>, 
  <bold>A20</bold>, 
  <bold>A1</bold> and 
  <bold>A47</bold> are significantly active against SARS-CoV-2 main protease when compared with hydroxychloroquine and mataquine. The residues GLN19, THR24, THR25, THR26, LEU27, HIE41, SER46, MET49, ASN119, ASN142, HIE164, MET165, ASP187, ARG188 and GLN189 of SARS-CoV-2 main protease play a crucial role in binding with ligands. The 
  <italic>in silico</italic> ADMET properties of the molecules are within the recommended values. The binding free energy was calculated using PRIME MM-GB/SA studies. From the ligands 
  <bold>A38</bold>, 
  <bold>A13</bold>, 
  <bold>A23</bold>, 
  <bold>A18</bold>, 
  <bold>A7</bold>, 
  <bold>A48</bold> and 
  <bold>A46</bold> with significant Glide scores may produce significant COVID-19 activity for further development. Compound 
  <bold>A38</bold> was subjected to MD simulation at 100 ns to study the dynamic behaviour of protein–ligand complex.
