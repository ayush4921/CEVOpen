<p id="Par60">In case of Group 1 (CRIRS1–22)
 <italic>,</italic> i.e.
 <italic>,</italic> clinical isolates of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., flavonoids showed a broad spectrum potential against all the 22 strains (14.66–22.66 mm) belonging to this group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), with an average Inhibition Zone (IZ) of 17.05 mm. Cardiac glycosides were active against only 6 organisms (CRIRS 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13) out of 22 strains, with an overall average IZ of 3.72 mm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Hence, the flavonoids were more effective than the cardiac glycosides, since the difference in the average Inhibition Zone (IZ) of the two phytoconstituents against Group 1 (CRIRS1–22) isolates was found to be statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05), as revealed by one way ANOVA followed by Post hoc Tukey’s t-test.
