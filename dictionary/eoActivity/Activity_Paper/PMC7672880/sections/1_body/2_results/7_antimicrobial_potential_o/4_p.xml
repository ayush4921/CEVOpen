<p id="Par62">The 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp. (DSECI 12) was susceptible to both flavonoids and cardiac glycosides, where flavonoids were more active (23.33 mm) than cardiac glycosides (15.66 mm) and this difference was statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Because of their effectiveness, the flavonoids were further tested against the 9 most susceptible strains (CRIRS7, CRIRS8, CRIRS13, CRIRS17, DSECI03, DSECI04, DSECI07, DSECI09 and DSECI10) for their MIC and MBC. The MIC values ranged from 15 to 35 mg/mL, lowest being against CRIRS7, DSECI07 and DSECI10 (15 mg/mL). The corresponding MBC values ranged from 20 to 40 mg/mL (Table T3 in Additional file
