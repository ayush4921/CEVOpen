<p id="Par61">Further, Flavonoids were significantly effective against 10 out of 11 strains of MRSA (DSECI 01–11) (Group 2), with IZ ranging from 20 to 28.33 mm, giving an average IZ of 22.30 mm. Here, DSECI 04 was the most sensitive (28.33 mm), while DSECI 11 was completely resistant. Cardiac glycosides were effective against 8 out of 12 strains, where the IZ ranged from 14 to 18 mm; hence giving an average IZ of 9.96 mm. DSECI04 was the most sensitive (18 mm), whereas the strains DSECI07, DSECI09, DSECI10 and DSECI11 were completely resistant. Hence, flavonoids showed a higher antimicrobial effectiveness than the cardiac glycosides, since the difference in the average Inhibition Zone (IZ) of the two phytoconstituents against DSECI 01–11) (Group 2) isolates was found to be statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05), as revealed by one way ANOVA followed by Post hoc Tukey’s t-test.</p>
