<p id="Par67">In case of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic>, 76.66 mg dry wt. of the flavonoids, when subjected to P-TLC, resulted in the separation of 4 bands (S1-S4) which were obtained with a dry wt. of: S1 (5 mg), S2 (8 mg), S3 (12 mg), S4 (9 mg). These were dissolved in methanol and a 20 μL aliquot was tested for their antimicrobial potential. Band S3 was significantly active against all the five test organisms. Band S1 was weakly effective against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> but was quite active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis.</italic> Band S2 was negligibly active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, but did not show any activity against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>. Band S4 was only active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis.</italic> Since, Band S3 was significantly active against the test organisms; it was taken up further for spectroscopic studies.
