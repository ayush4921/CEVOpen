<p id="Par65">The bioactive compounds, which may be responsible for the antimicrobial efficacy of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic> flavonoids, were detected by separation using Preparative-Thin Layer Chromatography followed by their antimicrobial screening against two Gram positive, two Gram negative and one yeast strain. The most active band was then subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the antimicrobial components present in it.
