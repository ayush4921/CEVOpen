 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic> flavonoids, when subjected to P-TLC analysis revealed the presence of 4 bands, out of which Band 3 (S3) was found to be antimicrobially most active, when screened against various test organisms. Its GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of mixture of a number of compounds at RTs falling within the range of 3.22–34.40 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The library search led to detection of a number of compounds at each RT (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). Based on the abundance in terms of area %, compounds at three RTs were found to be major compounds in this active band, which were identified as Bicyclo [2.2.1]heptan-2-one,1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- at an RT of 11.14; Silane, Dimethyl(dimethyl(dimethyl(2-isopropylphenoxy)silyloxy)silyloxy)(2-isopropylphenoxy)- at an RT of 13.47 and 7,11b-Dihydro-6H-indeno[2,1-c] chromene-3,4,6a,9,10-pentol pentakis (trimethylsilyl)ether at an RT of 34.40.
