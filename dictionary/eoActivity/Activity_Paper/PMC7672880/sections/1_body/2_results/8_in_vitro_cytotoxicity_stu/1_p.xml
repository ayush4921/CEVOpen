<p id="Par63">The Flavonoids were further evaluated for their cytotoxicity against some cancerous cell lines, where a cytotoxic effect was seen with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 361 to 494 μg/mL. The lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> (361 μg/mL) was seen against Hep2 cell line, whereas the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> was observed against RD cell line. IC
 <sub>50</sub> for L20B cell line was 448 μg/mL (Fig. A4 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In case of RD, complete rounding off of the cells was seen upto the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, and thereafter the inhibitory effect gradually reduced down the concentration gradient. For Hep2 and L20B, rounding off of the cells could be seen upto 1.25 μg/mL and 0.625 μg/mL, respectively. The flavonoids showed a negligible effect on the normal cell line, i.e., Vero cell line (only 9.56–15.24%), in comparison to the % inhibition obtained against the three cancerous cell lines at the various tested concentrations (Fig. A4 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), thus exhibiting a very high IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (&gt; 10,000 μg/mL), in comparison to that obtained against cancerous cell lines (361–494 μg/mL).
