<p id="Par55">The most active phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids and cardiac glycosides were assessed for their antibiofilm potential against the test pathogens. The Optical Density cut-off value (ODc) of the negative control was 0.097. All the test organisms were found to be strong biofilm-formers as their average OD values were higher than 4 × ODc (0.388), viz., 0.649 (
