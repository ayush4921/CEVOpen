<p id="Par52">A variable killing time was observed for different test preparations (ethyl acetate extract, flavonoids and cardiac glycosides) against different test pathogens (Fig. A2 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> were killed instantaneously upon incubation with ethyl acetate extract, whereas 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 1 took a maximum of 24 h incubation period to achieve complete killing. In case of 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and MRSA, the killing time (2 h and 6 h, respectively) was similar to that of standard antibiotic gentamicin. Flavonoids were also quite effective against the test organisms, where 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was killed instantaneously. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> were killed completely in 2 h
 <italic>,</italic> whereas 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 1 and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 2 took 6 h for complete killing. Their Killing time was lesser than Gentamicin in case of organisms like 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 2, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 2, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.</italic> Cardiac glycosides had a kill time falling between 2 and 8 h, where 2 h incubation was sufficient to kill 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans.</italic> They were better in case of organisms like 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 2. Flavonoids were more efficient in killing majority of the organisms than the ethyl acetate extract and cardiac glycosides, as evident from their lesser killing time. All the test preparations (ethyl acetate extract, flavonoids and cardiac glycosides) were highly effective against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (2 h), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (0–4 h) and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (0–2 h).
