<p id="Par51">MIC of the ethyl acetate extract, flavonoids and cardiac glycosides was quite variable (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Ethyl acetate extract was found to be highly potent (with MIC range of 0.5–3 mg/mL), in comparison to the phytoconstituents (Flavonoids and Cardiac glycosides), with the MIC values being lowest against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 2 and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Further, the MIC for cardiac glycosides and flavonoids ranged from 0.5–10 mg/mL and 0.7–10 mg/mL, respectively, where 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> were the most sensitive organisms showing the lowest MIC values. For 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and MRSA, cardiac glycosides showed a higher MIC (10 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL, respectively) than the ethyl acetate extract (0.5–0.7 mg/mL) and flavonoids (1 mg/mL). The MIC values obtained for ethyl acetate extract and flavonoids were comparable to that of chloramphenicol against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic>
