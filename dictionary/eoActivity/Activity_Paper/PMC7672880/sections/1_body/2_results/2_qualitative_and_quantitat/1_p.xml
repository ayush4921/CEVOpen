<p id="Par49">Major phytochemical groups such as flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, tannins, triterpenes and phytosterols were detected (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); however, alkaloids, diterpenes and coumarins were absent. Among the isolated phytoconstituents, cardiac glycosides were the most abundant, i.e., 50.25%/g plant powder, followed by flavonoids (10.39% /g), while triterpenes (1.193% /g) were present in least amount (Fig. A1 in Additional file
