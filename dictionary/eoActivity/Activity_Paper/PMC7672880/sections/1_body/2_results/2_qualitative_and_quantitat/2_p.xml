<p id="Par50">Among all the isolated phytoconstituents, flavonoids were the most effective (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) with inhibition zone ranging from 16.6 mm to 25.66 mm, but were ineffective against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. However, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (25.66 mm) and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> (17.3 mm) were quite sensitive to it. Cardiac glycosides showed an inhibition zone ranging from 12.3 mm to 25.66 mm, where 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 showed maximum susceptibility. 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 1, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and yeast 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> were resistant to it. Saponins were effective only against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. However, triterpenes, tannins and phytosterols were completely inactive against all the test microorganisms. The antimicrobial efficacy of flavonoids was comparable to both the antibiotics (gentamicin and chloramphenicol) in case of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis,</italic> whereas it was comparable to chloramphenicol in case of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 2 and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.
