<p id="Par71">To further strengthen the biosafety aspect, acute oral toxicity of its flavonoids was evaluated in mice. Toxicological evaluation is an important aspect of pharmacology for assessing any negative effect of the bioactive substance on living organisms prior to its clinical usage by humans. This aspect is crucially important as toxicity results from animals, especially mice and rats, help in judging the safety of the compounds, since mice and rats have an anatomy close to that of human body and any effect on the animal model would clearly indicate towards its possible toxic effects. Abundant literature is available validating the ethno-medical knowledge on the significance of medicinal plants in prevention and treatment of various diseases. However, the medicinal plants contain a complex mixture of many bioactive phytochemical groups with diverse mode of action, which may possibly show any adverse effects upon interaction with the human/animal cells. Thus, it is of utmost importance to investigate the safety and biological properties of the medicinal plants prior to their usage. The biosafety of the flavonoids was thus confirmed since no signs of abnormality, illness or biochemical and pathological changes were observed in the test group of animals, indicating a normal metabolism and growth. These results are in line with other allied studies reporting the non-toxicity of the medicinal plants/ extracts [
