<p id="Par70">It is a well-known fact that the biofilms-formers are a leading cause of the rising cases of the chronic infectious diseases and recurrent infections. Therefore, bioactive compounds which are able to modulate/ disrupt the biofilm forming ability, have an exceptional importance in the field of drug development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The promising antibiofilm potential of flavonoids and cardiac glycosides highlight the importance of the study, where the former were more effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This could be justified by the fact that the plant metabolites such as flavonoids, phenolic acids etc. reportedly possess antibiofilm activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The potency was also tested against some drug-resistant strains of 
 <italic>E.coli, Salmonella</italic> spp. and MRSA, where flavonoids and cardiac glycosides showed a broad spectrum activity, thus, justifying its candidature as a potential antimicrobial and antibiofilm drug of future. To add up on the bioactive potential of the plant, the most active phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids were screened for their cytotoxicity against three cancerous cell lines and our results are in consonance with those obtained for compounds of 
 <italic>Acanthus hirsutus</italic> Boiss (11.17–700 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Euphorbia hirta</italic> (625 μg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and some naturally occurring quinones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] .
