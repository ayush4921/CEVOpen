<p id="Par44">To work out the best solvent system, the quantitatively isolated flavonoids were subjected to TLC on the pre-coated Silica gel F
 <sub>254</sub> plates using different solvent systems. The developed chromatograms were allowed to air dry and were visualized using natural light, UV light (254 nm, 365 nm) and iodine vapors so as to assess the degree of separation of bands and the Retention factor (R
 <sub>f</sub>) were calculated for the bands resolved in the most suitable solvent system. The best worked out solvent system was taken up for quantitatively separating the bands using Preparative TLC (P-TLC) method.
