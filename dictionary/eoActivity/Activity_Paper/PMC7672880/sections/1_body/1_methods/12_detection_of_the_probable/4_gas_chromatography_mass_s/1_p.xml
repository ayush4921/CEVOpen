<p id="Par46">The GC-MS analysis of the most active band/s was carried out using Thermo Trace 1300GC coupled with Thermo TSQ 800 Triple Quadrupole MS with column BP 5MS (30 m X 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm). The instrument was set to an initial temperature of 60 °C and maintained at this temperature for 3 min. At the end of this period the oven temperature was raised to 280 °C, at an increase rate of 15 °C/ min and maintained for 19 min. Injection port temperature was ensured as 260 °C and Helium flow rate as 1.2 mL /min. The ionization voltage was 70 eV. The injector was used with S (split) mode, with a split ratio of 30:1 and the injection volume of samples was 1 μL (1 mg/mL). Mass spectral scan range was set at 50–650 (m/z). Using computer searches on a NIST Ver. 2.0 MS data library and by comparing the spectrum obtained through GC-MS, compounds probably present in the flavonoids were identified.</p>
