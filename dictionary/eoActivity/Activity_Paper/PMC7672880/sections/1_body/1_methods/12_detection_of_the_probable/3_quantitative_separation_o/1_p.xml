<p id="Par45">The bands were resolved and separated on Silica gel F
 <sub>254</sub> using the selected combination of extraction solvents. Once developed, the separated bands were scrapped off carefully into separate vials, which were eluted overnight in methanol. The solvent containing the eluted band was decanted off carefully, which was evaporated to dryness to obtain a constant weight. The separated bands were dissolved in a minimum known volume of methanol and were screened for their antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (Gram positive); 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (Gram negative) and a yeast 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> using Disc diffusion method, where the filter paper discs were impregnated with 20 μL of this suspension, while methanol alone acted as a negative control. The band/s showing the most significant antimicrobial activity was then subjected to GC-MS analysis.
