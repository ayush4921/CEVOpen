<p id="Par37">Post exposure to the flavonoids, cardiac glycosides and standard antibiotics, the metabolic activity of the treated biofilms was assessed using the modified {2, 3-bis [2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide} (XTT) reduction assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. After incubation of the biofilm with the test preparations for 24 h, menadione–XTT mixture was then added to each well, followed by 2 h incubation at the suitable temperature (under dark conditions). The quantification of color was then done using microtitre plate reader (Bio-Rad 680-XR, Tokyo, Japan) at 490 nm. The mean absorbance of test wells was determined in comparison to that of negative control.
