 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] with slight modifications. One hundred microliter aliquot of each of the 4 h activated cultures were dispensed into a 96-well microtitre plate and were incubated at 37 °C/24 h to allow biofilm formation and was treated with equal volume of the phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids (54.75 mg/mL) and cardiac glycosides (59.5 mg/mL). The plates were further incubated at suitable temperature and biomass content was estimated after 24 h by the crystal violet assay.
