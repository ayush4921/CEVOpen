 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with slight modifications, which has been detailed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Total 24 healthy Swiss albino mice (males and females) (25–35 g body weight and 8–10 weeks old), were procured through proper channel from the Animal Breeding Facility of the Animal house of Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India. The mice were randomly divided into 2 test groups (6- male; 6- female) and 2 control groups (6- male; 6- female), where the test groups were exposed to a single dose (5000 mg/kg) of the flavonoids by oral route. This study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Basel Declaration and recommendations of Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 420. The study was carried out at Central Research Institute, Kasauli and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of Central Research Institute (C.R.I), Kasauli (H.P.), India; working under the guidance of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), New Delhi, India (No. CPCSEA/IAEC/CRI/14–114-2016). On the 15th day, the final weight of mice was noted and were anesthetized in the laboratory using a mixture of xylaxine and ketamine (at a concentration of 5 mg/kg b.wt. and 2.5 mg/kg b.wt., respectively). The blood samples were collected and the separated serum was used to determine the Liver functioning (Bilirubin content, ALT, AST, ALP) as well as Kidney functioning parameters (Creatinine, Urea). All the unconscious animals were then subjected to euthanasia by an overdose of anesthesia (mixture of xylaxine and ketamine at a concentration of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg b.wt., respectively), as anesthetic overdose is the most commonly used method for euthanasia of mice because of being a simple, aesthetic and least painful method, with a lower blood loss associated with euthanasia [
