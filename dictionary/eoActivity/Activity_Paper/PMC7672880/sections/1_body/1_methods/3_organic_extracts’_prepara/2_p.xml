 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The organic extract (0.1 mL of Ethyl acetate extract: 30.5 mg/mL; Butanol extract: 35.42 mg/mL; Hexane extract: 27.98 mg/mL; Chloroform extract: 26.44 mg/mL) was added to the wells and the plates were incubated in an upright position at 37 °C (bacterial cultures) and 25 °C (yeast strains) for 18–24 h. The antimicrobial activity could be observed as a clear zone of inhibition around the wells. Any organism with inhibition zone &lt; 12 mm was considered as resistant to the extract. Here, 30% DMSO served as a negative control and the experiment was performed in duplicate.
