<p id="Par27">The PAE for the above mentioned test preparations were worked out according to Raja et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The 4 h activated test organism was diluted 1:1000 times using suitable broth. The diluted suspension of different organisms was mixed with the test preparations [as mentioned above] in an equal ratio in a test tube and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C (bacterial cultures) and 25 °C (yeast strains) under shaking condition. Simultaneously, a control containing the diluent (without test preparation) and the respective microorganism was also set up. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was serially diluted to 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> using the suitable broth, whose 100 μL aliquot was withdrawn at every 2 h interval upto 24 h and plated onto the medium plates. After incubation of 24 h, the number of colonies was counted in the respective plates. The PAE was deduced using a formula, i.e., PAE = T – C (T = time taken for number of colonies in the test to increase by 1 log
 <sub>10</sub>CFU/mL; C = the time required in case of untreated control).
