<p id="Par25">The test preparations (ethyl acetate extract, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides) were studied for their MIC against the reference microbial strains (sensitive to the respective preparations in ADA) by Agar dilution method, as per the protocol followed in Arora and Sood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using various concentrations (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) prepared from their respective stock solutions [i.e., Ethyl acetate extract: 30.5 mg/mL; Flavonoids: 54.75 mg/mL; Cardiac glycosides: 59.5 mg/mL]. Hundred microliters (100 μL) of the activated test organism (adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards) was swabbed onto the solidified plates (containing different concentrations of a test preparation) and incubated at 37 °C (bacterial cultures) and 25 °C (yeast strains) for 18–24 h. The lowest concentration of the test preparations which inhibited the microbial growth were taken as their MIC. The values were compared with that of the standard antibiotics.
