<p>Coumarins are privileged structures for biological applications. Their conjugated double ring system allows different spots for chemical modifications, and a large number of derivatives can be obtained. Therefore, structure/activity studies appear to be the hottest emerging topic. During the year 2020, more than a thousand research articles and reviews related to coumarins could be found. This highlights the great potential that these molecules can have in different fields of research. For simplicity, our overview focused on the potential of coumarins in medicinal chemistry. The most relevant studies were included. The range of applications described in this document, and some others outside the scope of this general description (i.e., optoelectronic applications [
