<p>The role played by coumarin derivatives as agents that exhibit biological activities associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, is very important. Throughout this year, a large number of manuscripts related to this field have been found. Due to the multidirectional nature of these diseases, there are also many works on hybrid coumarins directed at different pharmacological targets, such as monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amyloid aggregation, or oxidative stress, among others. Hybrids of general structure 
 <bold>XXVIII</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f007">Figure 7</xref>) have been described, in which the rasagiline fragment with MAO-B inhibitory activity and neuroprotection properties is incorporated into the coumarin scaffold also with demonstrated MAO-B inhibitory activity, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties [

 <bold>XXIX</bold>) is another case of hybrid structures as selective MAO-B inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The incorporation of isoxazole-type heterocycles in carboxamide–coumarins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f007">Figure 7</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>XXX</bold>) allowed obtaining derivatives with significant inhibitory activities of AChE/BuChE and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In other cases, taking into account the importance of metals in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, a pyridinone fragment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f007">Figure 7</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>XXXI</bold>) with iron-chelating properties was incorporated [
