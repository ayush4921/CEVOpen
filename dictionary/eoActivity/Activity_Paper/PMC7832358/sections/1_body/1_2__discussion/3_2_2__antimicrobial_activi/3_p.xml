<p>In addition to the antibacterial activity, in a recent and comprehensive review on coumarins, activity against protozoa of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> was described [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most promising compounds are prenylated, glycosylated, furan/pyranocoumarins, or simple hydroxy- or methoxy-substituted coumarins, along with the natural coumarin mammea A/BB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f003">Figure 3</xref>, structure 
 <bold>XII</bold>). Derivatives of this natural product have been prepared and substitutions at positions 6 and 8, as well as the phenyl ring at position 4, turned out to be mandatory for the studied activity. This structureâ€“activity relationship (SAR) study led to the synthesis of the simplest and most lipophilic analogue 
 <bold>XIII</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f003">Figure 3</xref>), the most promising member of the group as an antileishmanial agent. Similar structures, some also derived of the 
 <italic>Mammea</italic> genus, have been evaluated against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, an activity that also shows simpler synthetic analogues derived from 4-hydroxycoumarin (
