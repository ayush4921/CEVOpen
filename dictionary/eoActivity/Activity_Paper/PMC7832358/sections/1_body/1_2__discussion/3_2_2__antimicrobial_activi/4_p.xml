<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning two articles reported this year on the design and preparation of coumarin derivatives with potential antiviral activity. This is the case of the dual hybrid inhibitors inspired by the antiviral activity of calanolide, known as reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor. With this in mind, dual inhibitors of HIV-1 RT and protease (PR) have been designed, in which the coumarin fragment responsible for RT activity is linked to the fragment of the antiretroviral darunavir, active against PR of the HIV, through different amide, carbamate, or amine linkers (

The second case described the introduction of a piperidine ring through a linker in position 7 of the coumarin scaffold, originating compounds with outstanding activity against certain filoviruses such as Marburg virus (MARV) or Ebolavirus (EBOV). From the SAR studied, it is interesting to highlight the role of substitution in
