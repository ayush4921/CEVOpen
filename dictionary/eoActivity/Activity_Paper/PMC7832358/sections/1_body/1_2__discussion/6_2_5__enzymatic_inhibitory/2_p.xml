<p>Closely related to these structures, works have been published on coumarin derivatives with inhibitory activity on carbonic anhydrase 
 <bold>IX</bold> and 
 <bold>XII</bold>. These are coumarins that incorporate arylacrylamide substituents at position 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f006">Figure 6</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>XXIV</bold>) that showed inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range [
