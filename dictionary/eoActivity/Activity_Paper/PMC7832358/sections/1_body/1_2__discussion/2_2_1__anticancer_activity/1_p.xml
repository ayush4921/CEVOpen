 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f002">Figure 2</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>II</bold>) has allowed the preparation of new multitarget mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors and nitric oxide (NO) donors, both with antiproliferative properties [

Such is the case of new inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, specifically CDK9, designing hybrids that incorporate an aminopyrimidine fragment to coumarin, both pharmacophores of known activity on these therapeutic targets [

 <bold>III</bold> (
