<p>Within the group of compounds with anticancer activity, coumarins exhibiting an antiglioma profile may be highlighted. Simple coumarins such as osthole, umbelliferone, esculin, and 4-hydroxycoumarin, combined with sorafenib (a kinase inhibitor drug approved for the treatment of primary kidney cancer, advanced primary liver cancer, FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and radioactive iodine-resistant advanced thyroid carcinoma) were studied [
