<p id="par0115">The effects of the ethyl acetate extract of the leave of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> on the haematological parameters of rats is shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The MCV increased with increase in dose. Other parameters like the RBC count, the MCH and the MCHC had no regular pattern of change and were not different across all the groups, including the control. In the cases of lymphocyte and monocyte counts, statistically (P &lt; 0.05) lower value was observed in the control group compared with the highest dosed treatment group (750 mg/kg). However, there was no difference between the control group and the low dosed (250 mg/kg) and the mid dosed (500 mg/kg) treatment groups. Other parameters, including MCHC, had irregular change patterns, although not statistically (P &gt; 0.05) different compared to the control group (distilled water, 5 mL/kg) and the highest treatment group (750 mg/kg).
