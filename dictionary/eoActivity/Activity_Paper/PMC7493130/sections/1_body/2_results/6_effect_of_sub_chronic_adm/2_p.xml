 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Although albumin fluctuated with increase in dose rate, there was no difference among all the groups, including the control. A similar observation was made in cases of TC, K+, urea and creatinine. On the other hand, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference between the highest dose treatment group was observed when compared with the control group in respect to AST, ALT, and N
