 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> on the biochemical parameters of rats is shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Although both the AST and the albumin increased with increase in dose, there was no difference between the highest dose group and the control group. In both cases on the other hand, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference between the highest dose group of 750 mg/kg and control in the case of AST.
