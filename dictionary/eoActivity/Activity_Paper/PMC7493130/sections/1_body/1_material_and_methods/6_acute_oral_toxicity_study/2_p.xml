<p id="par0070">The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) as an indication of acute toxicity of the methanol extracts of the leaves and bark of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> (DM) were determined using Limit Dose Test of the Revised “Up and Down” Procedure (UDP) according to OECD guideline [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, single limit dose of 5 g/kg each of the extracts was administered individually to 5 female nulliparous rats within 48 h interim depending on whether the earlier dosed rat survived or not. Each animal was observed for instantaneous death and then monitored for the first 48 h for the short-term effect and daily thereafter for the next 14 days for any delayed toxic effects.
