<p id="par0075">Sub-chronic toxicity studies were carried out on forty rats divided at random into eight groups of 5 rats each using simple random sampling technique by balloting. The animals were first numbered and then randomly assigned into groups. Example: group A (1–5); group B (6–10) etc. Rats in groups A, B and C were orally administered ethyl acetate fraction of leaf of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> at 250 (5% LD
 <sub>50</sub>), 500 (10 % LD
 <sub>50</sub>) and 750 (15 % LD
 <sub>50</sub>) mg/kg via gavage respectively while distilled water (5 mL/kg) was administered to rats in group D (untreated control) for 28 days. Similarly, the ethyl acetate fraction of bark of DM was orally administered to groups E, F and G (250, 500 and 750 mg/kg) respectively using gavage while group H serves as untreated control and was administered distilled water for 28 days. The choice of ethyl acetate fraction of the crude methanol extract was based on earlier preliminary pharmacological experiment conducted on wound healing. That's why we decided to further evaluate its toxicity for usage. All the treated rats were monitored for toxicity and weighed weekly for four weeks. The experiment was terminated at the end of the 28 day period. Following the last treatment (24 h later), the rats were euthanatized using a chloroform chamber. 2 mL of blood was collected from each experimental rat, by cardiac puncture; in sample bottles containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for haematological evaluation. Additional 2 mL of blood (serum) was also obtained from individual rats for measurement of biochemical parameters.
