<p id="par0065">The crude methanolic extract was subjected to fractionation using solvents with increasing polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol). For fractionation purpose, known volume of the crude extract was suspended in a separatory funnel using known volume of distilled water and the suspension was shaken with known volume of hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) successively to obtain the different fractions. All the fractions were kept separately in an amber glass bottle and maintained in a −20 °C refrigerator</p>
