<p id="par0060">Powdered form (500 g) of each plant part of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> (DM) was mixed with two litres of methanol (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), allowed to stand for 24 h with frequent shaking. Following 24 h the extracts were separately filtered using Whatman filter paper size 1 (Whatman No. 1, Fitchburg, WL, USA). The residues were again subjected to same treatment with methanol for complete extraction process. Thereafter the crude methanol extracts were combined for each plant parts and evaporated at room temperature under a fast stream of moving air [
