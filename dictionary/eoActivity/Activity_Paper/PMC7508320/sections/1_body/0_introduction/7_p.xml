<p>In Bangladesh, diarrhea is liable to the death of one third of the children (Galheigo et al., 2016; Patzi-Vargas et al., 2015). It has been reported that medicinal plants are efficiently used for the treatment of diarrhea (Dooley et al., 2015). Various antidiarrheal compounds increase its toxicity problems due to the mismanagement or development of resistance (Bulbul et al., 2013). Researchers are highly interested in development of synthetic anthelmintic agents from medicinal plants to minimize all the problems caused by antihelminthic drugs (Bulbul et al., 2013; Bulbul et al., 2013). </p>
