<p>Phytochemical analysis of the methanolic extract confirmed the presence of phenols, tannins, saponins that show anthelmintic property. According to a previous study, by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, the phenolic compounds can interfere with the helminthic parasites (Athanasiadou et al., 2001) and phenolic compounds additionally bind to the loose proteins in the gastrointestinal tract of host animal and glycoprotein on the cuticle of the parasite which ultimately lead to the parasite on dying (Tiwari et al., 2011). </p>
