<p>In the central nervous system, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter (Ripa et al., 2015) and it is evidence that many anxiolytic, muscle relaxants and sedative-hypnotic drugs exert their actions via GABA (Angad et al., 2010). Some previous researchers in this area showed that phytoconstituents like flavonoids, act as ligands for the GABAA receptors in the central nervous system, which led us to a major hypothesis that these flavonoids may act as benzodiazepine-like molecule (Ripa et al., 2015). Therefore, it may be suggested that the plant extract may exert its neuro-pharmacolo</p>
