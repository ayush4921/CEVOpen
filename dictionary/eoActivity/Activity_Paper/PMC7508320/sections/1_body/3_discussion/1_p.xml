<p>Medicinal plant materials have become an interesting source for both conventional and contemporary medicines, and herbal medicines has been shown to have genuine utility in the field of medicine (WHO, 1978; Hussain et al., 2018). The aim of our present study was to investigate general 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> bioactivities of seeds of MC. In preliminary phytochemical screening, crude methanolic extract of MC showed positive (+) response for the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, proteins and amino acids. In the course of antioxidant assay, the DPPH radical activity of the methanolic extract was found to be increased with the increasing concentration. Agents which are used for the management of cancer show toxicity on normal cells in particular rapidly growing cells (Terrence, 2008). To investigate the cytotoxic activity, brine shrimp lethality assay is one of the most convenient, accessible and inexpensive bioassay and this method correlates in most cases reasonably well with cytotoxic and antitumor properties (Sonibare et al., 1995). From the result of the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, it was observed that the % of the morbidity is proportional to the concentration i.e. % of the morbidity was increased with the increasing concentration of the extract.
