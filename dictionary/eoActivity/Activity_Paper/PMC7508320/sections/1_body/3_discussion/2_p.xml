<p>Thrombolytic agents commonly lyse clot via disrupting the fibrin and fibrinogen (Das et al., 2013; Abedin et al., 2018; Hussain et al., 2016). In our study we assessed whether the crude methanolic extract possesses any clot lysis potential or not. We found that thrombolytic activity of methanolic extract of MC was concentration-dependent, lowest at the concentration of 2 mg/ml (14.88%) and remarkable at the concentration of 10 mg/ml (46.12%). Phytochemicals present in the medicinal plants, like saponins, alkaloids and tannins are responsible for the thrombolytic activity (Das and Dewan, 2013) and as methanolic extract of MC contain considerable amounts of these phytochemicals they can be the probable motive for the thrombolytic activity. </p>
