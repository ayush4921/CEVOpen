<p>Also, it was determined that crude methanolic extract exhibited potentiality of anti-diarrheal action. Loperamide is broadly used for the control of diarrhoeal diseases which efficaciously antagonizes diarrhea precipitated by the castor oil (Al-Taher, 2008). In case of antidiarrheal activity test, aqueous fraction (400 mg/kg body weight) showed considerable percentage of diarrheal inhibition. It was reported that the presence of tannins, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids and triterpenes are responsible for anti-dysenteric and anti-diarrhoeal properties of a plant extract (Kolawole et al., 2010). This can be because of the fact that the extract can increase the reabsorption of water by lowering intestinal motility within the isolated rabbit ileum. Phytochemical screening found out the presence of flavonoids, tannins, saponins, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids. Hence, tannins are well known for their lowering impact on GI motility among the phyto-constituents (Galvez et al., 1993).</p>
