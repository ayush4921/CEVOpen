<p>In this screening work, the crude methanolic extract produced considerable zone of inhibition for Gram positive (+) 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (15 mm in 1000 µg/ml) and Gram negative (-) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (13 mm in 1000 µg/ml) when compared to the standard tetracycline (30 mm and 22 mm, respectively). Surprisingly, it did not produce any kind of antimicrobial properties against Gram positive (+) 
 <italic>B. subtilis </italic>(Table 4).
