<p>With the help of protocol designed by Kupchan and Tsou and modified method of Van-Wagenen et al., solvent-solvent partitioning was accomplished (Van-Wagenen et al., 1993). Here, 5 g of the crude extract was triturated by 98% methanol. The prepared solution was then fractionated successfully using solvents of increasing polarity, such as n-hexane, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform.</p>
