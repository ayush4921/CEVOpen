 <caption>
  <p>Mizaj jittered scatterplots of UNaProd drug monographs in terms of active versus passive quality faceted by origin. (a) Herbal drug monographs; (b) animal drug monographs; (c) mineral drug monographs; (d) compound drug monographs. The two perpendicular lines in each plot indicate balance in either axis. The active quality consists of the main degrees of hotness and coldness, while passive quality includes the main degrees from fourth degree in dryness to fourth degree in wetness. As some Mizaj descriptions do not contain the exact degree, a further factor-DNS (degree not specified) has been defined for each quality.</p>
