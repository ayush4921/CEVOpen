<p>Secondary fields for each tuple include ‘Pronunciation', “Synonym,” “Origin,” “CommonName,” “SciName1,” “SciName2,” “MizajType,” and “MizajDegree.” The “Origin” field of a drug, whether “animal,” “herbal,” “mineral,” “compound,” or “other,” was determined based on the existence of related keywords in the “Identity” field. In most cases, the authors explicitly mentioned the origin in the first sentence of this field. Otherwise, the keywords of each origin type were matched in the remaining parts of the identity of a drug. Eventually, an origin type for each drug was assigned based on the frequency of the keywords for each group, namely herbs, animals, minerals, or compounds. In other words, the origin type with the most keywords in the ‘Identity' field was assigned to the drug. Fields of “CommonName,” “SciName1,” and “SciName2” for plants were determined by text mining “MakhzanCE,” “SciResource1,” and “SciResource2,” respectively. Animal and mineral scientific and common names were manually curated. Plants with scientific names were linked to the CMAUP database.</p>
