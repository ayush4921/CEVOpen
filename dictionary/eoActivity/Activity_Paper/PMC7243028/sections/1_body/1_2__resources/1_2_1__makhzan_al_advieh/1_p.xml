<p>Among the resources available in ITM concerning documentations of medicinal substances, 
 <italic>Makhzan al-Advieh</italic> written by Mohammad Hosein Aghili in 1769 A.D. is the most recent encyclopedia of 
 <italic>materia medica</italic> and contains the greatest number of drug monographs; thus, it was selected as the resource for the raw data of our database. The 
 <italic>Makhzan al-Advieh</italic> manuscript consists of an introduction describing the contents of the book and thirteen chapters and an appendix providing synonyms and translations. Twelve chapters are on preliminary topics including term definitions, estimation of drug 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic>, units of weight, instructions on drug preparations, and astronomical considerations. The main chapter of the book is comprised of drug monograph documentation in alphabetical order. Drug monographs are described in terms of synonyms, identity, 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic>, actions and medicinal uses, dosage, adverse effects, refinement, and substitute in this semistructured book. Furthermore, Aghili has mentioned viewpoints of other physicians and pharmacologists in the cases where there is no consensus on a certain characteristic or when prominent scholars like 
 <italic>Avicenna</italic>, 
 <italic>Galen</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ibn-e Baitar</italic> have other opinions.
