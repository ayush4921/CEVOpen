<p>Regarding 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> degrees, ITM specifies an active and a passive quality for substances. Active qualities include hotness or coldness, while wetness and dryness constitute passive qualities. The potency of each quality is described in a range from first to fourth. The frequency of drug monographs with 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> types which have both qualities specified, i.e., hot-wet, hot-dry, cold-wet, and cold-dry; balanced; and 
 <italic>Morakkab al-Ghovaa Mizaj</italic> types, have been illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Hot-dry drugs were mostly second or third degree in hotness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>), while for cold-dry and cold-wet drugs, both active and passive qualities were in second degree (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref>), and the hotness and wetness in hot-wet drugs generally did not exceed second degree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The most common qualities in drugs with a balanced 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> inclined towards slight hotness and dryness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(e)</xref>). In drugs with 
 <italic>Morakkab al-Ghovaa Mizaj</italic>, the passive quality of dryness was specified more prominently than wetness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(f)</xref>).
