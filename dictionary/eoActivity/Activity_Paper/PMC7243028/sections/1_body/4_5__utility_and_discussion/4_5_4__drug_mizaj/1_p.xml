<p>The 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type and degree for every drug monograph with a 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> description in 
 <italic>Makhzan al-Advieh</italic> were determined based on IrGO (Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology) and thereafter reviewed manually by the ITM committee. Users can view the attributes of the specified 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type and degree provided for each drug, as these fields were linked to the IrGO database. Moreover, in the instances where Aghili has quoted a different 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> from other physicians and pharmacologists, the name of the scholar together with the 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type they have specified was provided.
