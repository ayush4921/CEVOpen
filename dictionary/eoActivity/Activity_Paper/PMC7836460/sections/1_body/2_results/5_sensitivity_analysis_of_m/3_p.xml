<p id="Par43">Considering trends in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, phenological stages, hill aspects, organic carbon, total nitrogen and altitude are positively correlated to enhance hypericin content. So with the increase in the value of these variables, hypericin content followed a uniform and linear increasing trend. The phenological stages of the plant include the vegetative (1), flowering (2) and seed ripping (3) stage. In fact, the lowest content of hypericin is in the vegetative stage of the plants and increases in the flowering and seed ripping stages, respectively. Based on the results shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the range of changes in the percentage of total soil nitrogen in this study is 0.1 to 0.57. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, we find a linear increase in the amount of hypericin content with increasing the percentage of total soil nitrogen. The range of altitude changes in this study is between 1103 and 3822 m (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The main distribution of the 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> in the study area is in this elevation range and with increasing altitude we see a linear increase in the amount of hypericin content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).
