<p id="Par42">Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, the values of the phenological stages, geographical hill aspects, organic carbon, total nitrogen and altitude were most significant inputs, influencing MLP outputs (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Other variables did not exhibit a significant effect on hypericin content changes in the model sensitivity analysis that could be due to the limited changes in some ecological variables values in the studied area (Table
