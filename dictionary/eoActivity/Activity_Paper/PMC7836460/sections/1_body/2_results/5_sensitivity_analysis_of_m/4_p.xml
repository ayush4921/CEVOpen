<p id="Par44">On the other hand, increasing the other two ecological variables, including the hill geographical aspect and soil organic carbon cause a nonlinear increase in hypericin content of samples. Of course, it should be considered that the changes in the hill aspects are from north (1) to east (2), south (3) and west (4). In fact, the lowest content of hypericin is found in plants grown on the northern slopes and increases on the eastern, southern and western slopes, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Since this relationship is nonlinear, not much difference is detected between the southern and western slopes. Based on the nonlinear relationship between soil organic carbon content and hypericin content in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, the percentage of soil organic carbon, after crossing the 1.5 percent will not change the content of hypericin in samples significantly.
