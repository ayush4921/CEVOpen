<p id="Par41">The MLP model sensitivities for input variables are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. It represents the standard deviations of MLP outputs (the content of hypericin) in response to each variable exhibited change. As we understand, the sensitivity value for each input variable is a value among zero to one which indicating standard deviations of hypericin content in response to input changes. As the changes in hypericin content in response to changes in an input variable increase, that variable is more significant in predicting hypericin content and the sensitivity value is closer to one.
