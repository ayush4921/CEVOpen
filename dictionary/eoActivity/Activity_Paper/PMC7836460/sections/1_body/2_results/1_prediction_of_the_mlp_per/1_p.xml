<p id="Par32">Present study utilized three datasets for optimizing the MLP model. We observed that optimizing hidden layers, the number of neurons, active function and training generate relatively more accurate prediction using MLP. The structure of 13-26-1 has been the most accurate for MLP to predict hypericin content in 
 <italic>H. perforatom</italic> extracts as measured of R
 <sup>2</sup> values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The MLP encompasses 13 variables as inputs, 26 neurons and one variable as the output. Correlation between target and output values are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrating MLP outputs versus targets values of the hypericin for training, validation, test, and total data. The coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) value demonstrate a strong association between MLP outputs and target values (Fig.
