<p id="Par33">In the training process, there were two main factors including the spreads of RBFs and the number of neurons that were optimized. Decreasing the network error with RBFNN factor values was the purpose of the training step. Thus, to obtain the best performance of RBF, the number of neurons was 48, and the spread of RBFs was 50. The best results of RBF in training and test datasets are represented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The values of R
 <sup>2</sup> in training and test datasets have been shown the best structure (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The optimized RBFNN structure is 13-48-1 with 13 variables as inputs, 48 neurons in the hidden layer with Gaussian transfer function, and one neuron.
