<p id="Par50">In this study, we predicted the content of hypericin in 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> using MLP, RBF and SVM models. These models were analyzed precisely with the aim of testing the most suitable model predicting hypericin content more accurately. Based on our observations, the MLP model was confirmed as superior compared to the other models considered in this study. Furthermore, we observed that phenological stages, hill aspects, organic carbon, total nitrogen and altitude have a positive impact on the content of hypericin. MATLAB 2018 software, will aid us to perform the model in the regions where the factors and tested variables in this research are in the range of studied area and also reduce time and costof experimental methods. Moreover, it can provide wider range of applicability to rangeland managers, pharmacognosists, manufacturers and producers of medicinal plants to specify habitats and plant individuals targeting the highest content of hypericin in a robust and repeatable way.
