<p id="Par46">Plant produced secondary metabolites play an important role in plant defense against various environmental stresses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These secondary metabolites are extensively studied for their biomedicinal properties. The extraction of bioactive compounds from plants is vital in retaining its medicinal properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Ecological variables are mainly prominent not only in the growth of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> but also in the content of hypericin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Various biotic and abiotic factors such as soil, developmental stage, ecological conditions, and altitude are correlated in the regulation of their biosynthesis and localization of secondary metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Due to medicinal uses of hypericin, we analyzed the association of different ecological conditions and altitudes with concentration of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum.</italic>
