<p id="Par14">All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Acetonitrile, methanol and phosphoric acid were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). HPLC grade hypericin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The HPLC analysis of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> was conducted on an Agilent Series 1200 system (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a quaternary pump, an online degasser and an Agilent diode array detector which was set on 590 nm. Hypericin separation was performed on a Diazem-phenyl™ (Metachem Technologies, 5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm) column that was connected to a Diazem-phenyl™ guard column cartridge. The mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and phosphoric acid (48:40:10:2) with the flow rate of 1 mL/min was used as a mobile phase. The column temperature, run time and injection volume were set on 30 °C, 15 min and 20 µL, respectively [

The stock solution of hypericin was gravimetrically prepared by dissolving 1 mg hypericin (95% purity) in 10 mL methanol and the calibration standard working solutions were freshly prepared by dilution of the stock solution with methanol. In order to confirm the presence of hypericin in the analyzed samples, retention times and the spectra of the peaks in the chromatogram were compared to those of hypericin standard solution. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the hypericin concentration was expressed as mg/g dry mass.
