<p id="Par10">To cover a variety of ecological conditions in the area, we collected 100 plant samples along with 15 linear transects (the length of each transect equals to 1000 m) at different altitudes. Plant sampling was carried out for every 200 m altitude (from 1000 m) by a linear transect with a length of 1000 m started from the beginning of the altitude class. Each plant (
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>) that touched the transect line was sampled making a total of 100 samples. The aerial parts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> were collected at three stages namely; (1) vegetative, (2) flowering, and (3) seed ripening stages of plants over the period of 6 months in growing season. Since the chemical composition varies in different tissue of the plant, we used composite sample by mixing all tissue at equal proportion for all samples.
