<p id="Par30">In three developed models, each variable influences the outputs of the model with a specific value. To quantify and prioritize the value of variables, influencing the hypericin content prediction of the 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> samples, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the optimal model. In the sensitivity analysis, we created a data set for each variable in which the target variable was changed in the range of standard deviations. Other variables were fixed at the value of the average. Then, the standard deviation of outputs for each variable changes was measured as model sensitivity for that variable.
