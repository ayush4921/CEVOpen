<p id="Par17">We applied the MLP model in a process that includes elements named as neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since we aimed to evaluate the most precise model, the number of transfer functions, neurons and hidden layers, were carefully modified. To optimize the model structure and maximize the accuracy of outputs, the number of hidden layers and neurons were determined by trial and error and recursive testing and comparison [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The transfer function was also selected based on trial and errors to find the most precise model and upgrading the outputs (refer to Demuth and Beale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). Based on the literature review, 13 effective variables were used to predict hypericin content in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>. In this method, input variables (land form, phenological stages and soil characteristics) and output variables (hypericin content) were tested against each sample to train MLP. As input variables, land form variables are: altitude (m), land slope (%) and hill aspect (four geographical hill aspect consist of north, east, south and west); phenological stages are: (1) vegetative, (2) flowering, and (3) seed ripening and soil characteristics include: organic carbon (%), total nitrogen (%), absorbable phosphor (ppm), absorbable potassium (ppm), sand (%), silt (%), clay (%), electrical conductivity (EC) and acidity (pH).
