<p>The guava tree (
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>; Family: Myrtaceae) is cultivated for its nutritive fruit characterized by high contents of minerals and vitamins [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, other parts (the leaves, bark, and root) of the guava tree are used in traditional medicines to treat several diseases. The guava tree produces a large quantity of biomass that results from the continuous pruning process. This biomass—a waste or byproduct—can be considered as an added value where it can be integrated into the production of various bioactive compounds with pharmacological and industrial application [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Different extracts from the guava leaf exhibit potent biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, neuroprotective, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal, anticancer, immune-strengthening, anti-osteo-renal, antimicrobial, antivirus, and antiplatelet aggregation activities [
