<p>The EOs of the RM guava variety showed the presence of D-limonene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, globulol, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, and they are represented by 33.96, 20.58, 14.13, and 11.21%, respectively. In the EQ variety, the main compounds detected were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, globulol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene, recorded at 43.20, 10.57, 9.03, and 6.71%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00119-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The EQ EO results were similar to the figures reported for the Pakistani variety [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to these results, D-limonene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene might be assigned as a chemo-taxonomical fingerprint for the RM guava variety, while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol and 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene can be assigned for the EQ variety.
