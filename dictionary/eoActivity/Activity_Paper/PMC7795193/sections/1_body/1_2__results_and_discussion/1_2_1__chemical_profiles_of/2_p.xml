<p>The GC-MS chromatograms revealed substantial variations among the six different varieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00119-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The GC-MS analysis revealed that the chemical compounds can be categorized under four classes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00119-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The sesquiterpenes of the E variety were classified into sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (62.15%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (37.15%). Meanwhile, the ESEG variety attained 60.95% as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and 26.11% as oxygenated sesquiterpenes (
