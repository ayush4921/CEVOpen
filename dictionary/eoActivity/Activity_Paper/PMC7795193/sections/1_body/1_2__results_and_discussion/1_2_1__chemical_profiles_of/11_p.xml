<p>The biologically active monoterpenes 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and limonene were found in the main compounds of the RM variety. 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene was described as the main component of most EOs derived from the plant kingdom [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This compound is integrated as a basic intermediate in bakery and chilled dairy products [

 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, have various biological potentialities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, antiviral, flavor, fragrance, antiallergy, and fungicidal activities [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As a result, the guava leaves’ high biomass yield could be considered a rich resource for these effective and sustainable bioactive compounds.
