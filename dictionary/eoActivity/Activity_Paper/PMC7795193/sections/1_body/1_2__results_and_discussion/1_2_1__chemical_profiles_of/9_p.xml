<p>The ESEG variety showed a high content of sesquiterpenes, exemplified by 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (38.42%), globulol (10.75%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene (7.00%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol (5.39%). Moreover, the RI variety was characterized by a preponderance of globulol (26.42%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (13.40%), eucalyptol (10.89%), eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol (10.59%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol (10.14%). In our study, the six varieties were cultivated in the same garden with the same cultivation, soil, and climate conditions that directly affect the EO chemical compositions [
