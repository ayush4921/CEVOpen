<p>Powdered air-dried flowers were thoroughly defatted by soaking in hexane at room temperature; successively, the biomass was extracted with MeOH, followed by MeOH/ H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70:30). The yields of the residues B and C resulting from the evaporation of the two extracts were 16.9 and 7.6% (

 <italic>w</italic>), respectively. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed a high content of phenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Two samples of extracts B and C were then filtered through an SPE C-18 cartridge to remove minor amounts of chlorophylls and residual lipophilic components and, successively, through a Sephadex LH-20 column to remove tannins and other polymeric material. The two resulting residues, B’ and C’, were obtained in yields of 95 and 97 %, respectively, from B and C. The total phenolic contents (%,

At the concentration of 600 µg/mL, B’ showed an interesting antiproliferative effects towards the human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells; notably, the growth inhibition activity decreased only slightly, namely from 48.43% to 44.95%, when the sample concentration was reduced by one tenth to 60 µg/mL. Moving from antiproliferative to antioxidant properties evaluation, the free radical scavenging effects (FRS) of B’ and C’ were tested by the DPPH assay, given that reactive oxygen species (ROS), including several oxygen radicals, are involved in inflammation processes [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Significant dose-dependent FRS activities were determined for both B’ and C’, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 38.2 and 34.6 mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, at the dose of 62.5 mg/mL, the two residues quenched over 60% DPPH, compared to 59.5% determined for 60 mg/mL of ascorbic acid.
