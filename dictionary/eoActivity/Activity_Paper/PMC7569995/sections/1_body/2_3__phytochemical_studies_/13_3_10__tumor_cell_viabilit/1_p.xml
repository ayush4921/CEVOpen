<p>The MTS cell proliferation assay protocol is based on the reduction of the MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] yellow tetrazolium compound by NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells to a purple formazan salt, that is soluble in cell culture media [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The formazan salt has a maximum of absorbance in the UV spectrum at 490 nm. The measure of the absorbance can be directly related to the number of viable (living) cells.
