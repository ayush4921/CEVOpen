<p>MCF-7 breast (ATCC No. HTB-22) and A549 lung cancer cells (ATCC No. CLL-185) were grown in flasks for several days in an incubator (Forma Scientific) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere added of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, changing the liquid growth medium (RPMI 1640 (Euroclone, Europe) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, UK), and 0.005% L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy)) whenever needed. When a cell culture reached confluency, a small amount of trypsin was added to the medium in order to separate the cells from the flask; after 3 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1 mL of FBS was added to stop the action of trypsin and avoid cells membrane degradation. The cell-containing medium was then transferred into a cell strainer and centrifuged (ALC 4232 Centrifuge) at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the growth medium (1 mL), and the cells were separated using an automatic pipette and counted using a counting chamber and trypan blue as dye. After a proper dilution, separated cells were plated in a 96-well flat-bottom microplates (Cellstar, Greiner bio-one) at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells in 100 µL of growth medium in each well. After 2 h of incubation, the growth medium was replaced with 100 µL of test medium (RPMI 1640 added with 0.005% L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin) and the microplate was left in the incubator for 24 h. Five test solutions (1 mL each) with concentrations equal to 600, 60, 6, 0.6, and 0.06 µg/mL, respectively, were prepared by diluting a stock solution of sample B’ (60 mg/mL MeOH) with the test medium. The test medium in the wells was replaced with a solution (100 µL) of increasing sample concentration. For each sample tested, five replicates were performed for each dilution. The microplate was then further incubated for 24 h; subsequently, the sample containing medium was replaced with fresh test medium (100 µL) and 20 µL of MTS tetrazolium reagent (CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> – AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, USA). After 2 h of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a plate reader (BioRAD Model 550 Microplaate Reader). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (µM) ± S.D values of cisplatin used as the cytotoxic reference compound were 17 (±4) and 13 (±2) against MCF-7 and A549 cell lines, respectively. The control was the test medium + 1% MeOH.
