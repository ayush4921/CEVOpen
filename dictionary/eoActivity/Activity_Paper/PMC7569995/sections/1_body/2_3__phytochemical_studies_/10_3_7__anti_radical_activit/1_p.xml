<p>The free radical scavenging (FRS) activity of residues B’ and C’ was’ determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl stable radical (DPPH, Sigma-Aldrich) method [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. B’ and C’ were separately dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Stock solutions were then serially diluted with MeOH, giving test solutions at the final concentrations of 7.6, 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, and 0.3 mg/mL for B’ and 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15 mg/mL for C’. Three solutions of ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), used as the reference standard, were prepared with concentrations of 10, 5.0, and 2.5 mg/mL in MeOH. Test mixtures are prepared by adding 100 µL of each extract (or standard) solution to 3.9 mL of DPPH solution, freshly prepared dissolving DPPH in methanol/KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> and NaOH buffer (50/50 v/v) at a concentration of 6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M (pH 7.4). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 25 UV/VIS spectrometer N.3903, Perkin Elmer instruments, Massachusetts, USA). FRS activity was expressed as a percent compared with the control, that consisted of the DPPH solution (3.9 mL) and MeOH (100 µL). The percent inhibition of the DPPH radical by the tested solution was calculated using the following formula FRS% = [(A
 <sub>control</sub> − A
 <sub>ample</sub>)/A
 <sub>control</sub>] × 100. The analyses were carried out in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean ± SD. The concentration of the sample reducing 50% DPPH (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by plotting FRS% against the sample concentration (
