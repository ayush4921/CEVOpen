<p>Residues B and C were preliminary analyzed on analytical thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) plates under two chromatographic conditions: (a) RP-18 plates, eluted with MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1:1); (b) silica-gel 60, eluted with EtOAc/
 <italic>n</italic>-BuOH/HCO
 <sub>2</sub>H/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (5:3:1:1). After drying, the plates were inspected under UV light at 366 nm before and after exposure to NH
 <sub>3</sub> fumes, or under visible light after spraying them with a FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution (2.7 g in 100 mL of 2M HCl), or under visible and UV light after spraying with an AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution (1g in 100 mL of EtOH), or with an ethanolic solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), or with 0.5% vanillin in sulfuric acid/EtOH (4:1), followed by heating at 110 Â°C for about 1 min [
