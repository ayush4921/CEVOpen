<p>The antimycotic activity of samples B’ and C’ were tested using our collection of fungal strains, namely 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (Robin) Berkhout, 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic> E. Bodin ex Guég., 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> Tiegh., and 
 <italic>Bipolaris oryzae</italic> (Breda de Haan) Shoemaker. Fungi were maintained on Sabouraud (SAB) agar medium (1 L of distilled water, 30 g of glucose, 10 g peptone). Suspensions were prepared from a 24-h-old culture in the case of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and one-week-old cultures in the case of the other strains. The antifungal activities were evaluated by means of the microdilution method in 96-well plates [

 <xref rid="B85-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. After proving that the extracts were soluble, serial dilutions of the extracts were prepared directly using the SAB medium inoculated with the tested fungus. The following concentrations were used: 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.06, 0.03, 0.015, 0.007, 0.003 mg/mL. A volume of 50 µL of each dilution was distributed in each well. Three replicates were performed for each test and dilution. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and at 27 °C for the other fungi. The MICs (minimum inhibition concentrations) were determined after 24 h in the case of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>; for the other microorganisms, the MICs were recorded after 5 days. The MIC values are reported in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01066-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Fluconazole (MIC = 1 µg/mL against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) was used as the reference antifungal compound.
