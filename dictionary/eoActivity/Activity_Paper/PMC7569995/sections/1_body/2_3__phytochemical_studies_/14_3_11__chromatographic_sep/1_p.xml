<p>Residue B’(1g) was separated on a medium pressure liquid chromatography using a hand-packed reversed-phase column (LiChroprep RP18, 25–40 mm, 120 g, MerckMillipore). Solvents A and B of the mobile phase were H
 <sub>2</sub>O and MeOH, respectively. A linear gradient was applied from an A/B mixture (80:20) to 100% B, over 4.8 h at room temperature, at a flow rate of 10 mL/min; dual UV detection wavelengths set at 215 and 220 nm. The column was eventually washed with 100% MeOH for 3 min to elute strongly adsorbed compounds. Fifty-three fractions (8 mL each) were collected; the solvent in the tubes was evaporated using a centrifuge under vacuum and a liquid nitrogen trap, and the residues were weighed. The overall recovery of the chromatographed mixture was 95.1%. Then, the content of each fraction was analyzed by TLC on analytical silica gel 60 (GF

Fractions 7 (42.8 mg) and 12 (10.8 mg), obtained as colorless powders, were homogeneous and were directly submitted to spectroscopic analysis. Comparison with literature data indicated their identity with aucubin (
