<p>Several 
 <italic>Verbascum</italic> species are used in the traditional medicine of Kurdistan. In the first part of this paper, we collected (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01066-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) the structures of the main constituents, traditional uses and biological activities reported in the literature for the few 
 <italic>Verbascum</italic> species growing in Kurdistan that have been investigated so far. The most characteristic secondary metabolites are various phenolic derivatives and iridoids and many exhibited interesting bioactivities. Based on these data, we then investigated, for the first time, the contents of polar extracts of 
 <italic>V. calvum</italic> flowers, which are used in Kurdistan for preparing traditional remedies to treat skin burns and inflammations. In standard in vitro assays, a methanol and a hydromethanol extract exhibited weak antimicrobial activities, whereas the methanol extract showed significant antiproliferative effects against an A549 lung cancer cell line. Moreover, both extracts exhibited a significant dose-dependent free radical scavenging action against the DPPH radical, comparable to that of ascorbic acid. In the subsequent MPL separation of the methanol extract, two iridoid glucosides, ajugol (
 <bold>42</bold>) and aucubin (
 <bold>43</bold>), were isolated. It is interesting to note that the estimated content of aucubin in dried flowers of 
 <italic>V. calvum</italic> was quite high. In fact, the yield of isolated aucubin was about 0.72% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>); however, the isolation procedure has not been optimized.
