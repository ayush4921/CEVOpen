<p>We plan to complete in the future the study of the main compounds isolable from the flowers of 
 <italic>V. calvum</italic>, especially the flavonoid derivatives, and to investigate the contents of leaves and roots extracts, that seem to be different from that of the flowers. Moreover, our attention will be focussed on the preparation of standardized plant extracts and proper pharmaceutical formulations for medicinal applications, as well as on developing an efficient procedure for the quantitative isolation of the valuable bioactive iridoid aucubin (
