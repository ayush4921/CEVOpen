<p id="Par5">Local knowledge of health is a treasure for resource development and pharmaceutical drug discovery. Healthy foods, especially healthy vegetables, are important resources for local people in maintaining health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], especially in Asian countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Local people have abundant knowledge of the collection, preparation, cooking, cultivation, edible safety, health function, and resource management of vegetables [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to our previous studies, healthy vegetables have abundant functional compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, healthy vegetables are important sources of micro-nutrients and vitamins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, these vegetables have enormous potential for health-related research and industries such as drug discovery, food nutritional engineering and pharmaceuticals. However, most local knowledge is known only to native people or transmitted in small and limited areas. Therefore, such knowledge can easily disappear over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, global change and biodiversity loss may lead to the disappearance of local knowledge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, it is necessary to scientifically collect, document, analyse and explain local knowledge of healthy vegetables. Many studies about local healthy foods have been published in mainstream ethnobiology, ethnopharmacology and alternative medicine journals. Nevertheless, for some less-developed countries or remote poor regions, there are still few related studies.
