<p id="Par47">Some species are common plants but are used in unique ways by local people, such as the fermented tea leaf mentioned above. 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> is a well-known skin-care herbal plant, but local people cook the leaves of the species for Myanmar-style salads. Similarly, 
 <italic>Caralluma edulis</italic> is an important ingredient of local-style curries in Mandalay, while it is a popular ornamental succulent in many tropical gardens and greenhouses. The leaves of 
 <italic>Ficus carica</italic> were sold as flavour by one informant in Mandalay because of the special “coconut fragrance” of these leaves, and the species is popular as fruit trees that were cultivated widely. Even some well-known “weeds”, such as 
 <italic>Ludwigia adscendens</italic>, 
 <italic>Enydra fluctuans</italic> and 
 <italic>Eclipta prostrata</italic>, are cooked as delicacies by local people.
