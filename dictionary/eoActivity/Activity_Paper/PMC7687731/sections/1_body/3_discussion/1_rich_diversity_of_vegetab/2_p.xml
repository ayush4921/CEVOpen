<p id="Par32">Twenty-six taxa were assessed by The International Union for Conservation of Nature. Only one species (
 <italic>Kaempferia candida</italic>) was designated an endangered species at the vulnerable (VU) level, while others were not endangered. The only endangered species was noted only twice (UR = 2) by two isolated informants. The informants claimed that they cultivated the plant in their home gardens.
