 <italic>Apocynum venetum</italic> L. (Apocynaceae), commonly known as Luobuma, is a traditional Uygur medicine popular in Xinjiang, China (Xie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">201 2</xref>). Various ethnopharmacological researches documented that 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> can successfully lower blood pressure and has antihepatotoxic, cardiotonic, anxiolytic and antioxidant activities (Xie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Luobuma tea has also been commercially recognized as an anti-hypertensive, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-depressant, anti-aging, and sedative nutritional supplement thus gaining its popularity in China, Japan and American health food markets (Xie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). But despite its widely held medicinal value, genomic information about this plant is still lacking. Closely related herb 
 <italic>Apocynum pictum</italic> Schrenk is morphologically similar and easily confused for 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic>, which can possibly cause misconception and problems in medicine and health product markets (Xie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Hence, this report presents the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> to provide basic genetic resource that can be used in authenticating this highly medicinal plant species.
