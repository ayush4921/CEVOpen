<p>Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using RAxML 8.2.11 with the GTRI + G nucleotide substitution model (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Protein coding regions of 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> cp genome and 19 other reported Apocynaceae cp genome sequences were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. Analysis reveals that 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> is closely-related to 
 <italic>Aganosma cymosa</italic> and both belong to tribe Apocyneae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). However, some relative positions did not support the traditional classification of Apocynaceae at the subfamily level. Most placements are consistent to the published phylogenetic tree presented by Rao et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
