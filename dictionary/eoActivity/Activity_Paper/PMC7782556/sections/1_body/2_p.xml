<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> (GenBank accession number: MT313688) exhibits a quadripartite structure with a length of 150,897 bp, including a large single copy (LSC) region (81,957 bp), a small single copy (SSC) region (17,256 bp) and two inverted repeats (IR) regions (25,842 bp). Overall GC content is 38.3%. A total of 131 genes were determined, including 86 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA genes, and 37 tRNA genes. This accounts for the 61% of the whole 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> cp genome. Similar to other angiosperm cp genomes, 
 <italic>A. venetum</italic> cp genome contains genes with introns. The genes 
 <italic>trnK-UUU, rps16, trnG-UCC, atpF, rpoC1, trnL-UAA, trnV-UAC, petB, petD, rpl16, rpl2, ndhB, trnI-GAU, trnA-UGC, ndhA</italic> have one intron each while 
 <italic>clpP, ycf3</italic> contain two introns. Trans-splicing event was also observed in 
 <italic>rps12</italic> gene.
