 <italic>Cimicifuga foetida</italic> (
 <italic>C. foetida</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Ranunculaceae</italic> and it is also known as Shengma. It is abundantly distributed in Asian region [
 <xref rid="B225-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. It is basically used to treat various ailments, such as fever, headache, sore throat, toothache, uterine prolapse and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B224-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. It contains several bioactive compounds extracted from rhizomes, including cycloartane triterpenoids and glycosides with antiviral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B225-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. Wang et al., 2012 investigated the role of 
 <italic>C. foetida</italic>, especially the cimicifugin component of it, against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and found that the plant has a strong potential to inhibit viral attachment and internalization [

 <italic>C. foetida</italic> in inhibiting the hepatitis B virus transcription and replication by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B222-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Due to the capacity of producing strong pro-inflammatory cytokines and immunomodulatory properties, 
 <italic>C. foetida</italic> can be used to treat COVID-19 disease.
