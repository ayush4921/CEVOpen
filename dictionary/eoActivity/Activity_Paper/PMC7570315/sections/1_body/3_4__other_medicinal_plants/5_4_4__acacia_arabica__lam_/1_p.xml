 <xref rid="B167-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. It is basically used for the treatment of various diseases, such as Newcastle disease, vaccinia virus, bursal disease virus, H9N2 influenza disease, skin diseases, and possesses many biological properties including antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant effects. The mechanism of action of 
 <italic>A. arabica</italic> is known. It specifically inhibits the stage of viral intracellular multiplication [

 <italic>A. arabica</italic> contains several bioactive components extracted from the leaves of the plant which are responsible for its bioactivity, such as flavonoids, methyl 3,4,5 tri hydroxyl benzoate, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl glucoside, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroylquinic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, epicatechin-3-gallate, ascorbic acid, quercetin 3-O-(4â€²-O-acetyl)-rhamnopyranoside, oleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and steroidal sapogenin aglycone [
