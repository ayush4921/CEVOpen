 <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> (
 <italic>T. cacao</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Sterculiaceae</italic>. The seeds of this cocoa plant are commonly used in food industries [
 <xref rid="B277-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. It contains several types of bioactive compounds, such as polyphenol, theobromine and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B278-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>], which are responsible for its antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and many other biological activities [

 <xref rid="B188-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>,
 <xref rid="B189-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. However, some studies reported the anti-influenza activity of 
 <italic>T. cacao</italic>, due to presence of flavonoids, theobromine, lignin, dietary fiber, free fatty acid, and minerals (zinc, copper, iron) [

 <xref rid="B188-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Kamei et al., 2014 investigated the effect of 
 <italic>T. cacao</italic> against the influenza virus and found that it enhances the antibody response due to stimulatory effect [

 <italic>T. cacao</italic> helps in developing acquired immunity and activates the NK cells against the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B187-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Further investigation may lead to the use of 
 <italic>T. cacao</italic> against SARS-CoV-2, and can help in boosting immunity.
