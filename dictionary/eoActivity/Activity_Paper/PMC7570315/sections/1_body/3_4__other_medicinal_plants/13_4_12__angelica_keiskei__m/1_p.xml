 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> (
 <italic>A. keiskei</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Umbelliferae,</italic> and its leaves are basically used for remedial purposes [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Its bioactive components include chalcones, flavanones and coumarins, coumarins phenolic, acetylenes, sesquiterpene, diterpene, and triterpenes [

 <xref rid="B146-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. keiskei</italic> is known and considered to be antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-oxidative, anti-coagulant, anti-tumor, anti-mutagenic, anti-diabetic, antibacterial and hepato-protective [

 <xref rid="B145-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Park et al., 2016 extracted bioactive components (9 alkylated chalcones and 4 coumarins) from 
 <italic>A. keiskei</italic> plant [
 <xref rid="B146-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and revealed that the extracted chalcones were able to significantly block the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) by inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like protease (75% inhibition using 30 µg/mL dose) and a papain-like protease (88% inhibition using 30 µg/mL dose) [
 <xref rid="B146-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. In addition, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of this chalcone and chalcone 6 are 11.4 and 1.2 µM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B146-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Therefore, due to this very specific inhibition property of 
 <italic>A. keiskei</italic> deserves further investigation for the development of potent antiviral agents against COVID-19.
