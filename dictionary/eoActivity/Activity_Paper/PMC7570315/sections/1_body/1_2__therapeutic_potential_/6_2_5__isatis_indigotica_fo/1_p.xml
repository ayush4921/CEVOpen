 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> (
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic>) is a very old Chinese herbal plant belonging to the 
 <italic>Cruciferae</italic> family. It is mostly found in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other regions of Asia [

 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> has the potential to inhibit/block SARS-CoV-1 entry and replication in its host [

 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> (dried root) of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> for extracting potent compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-1-infected patients. Furthermore, its root contains indirubin, indican, indigo, sinigrin, Î²-sitosterol, hesperetin, aloe-emodin and many more bioactive compounds [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. According to one in vitro study, all these extracted compounds were used against SARS-CoV-1 infection, and it was found that indigo, sinigrin, aloe-emodin and hesperetin were able to inhibit the virus entry and replication by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-1 3CLpro [

 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> can also be considered as a potential therapeutic choice against SARS-CoV-2.
