<p>There are various medicinal plants which are known to have an inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV, HCoV-22E9, MERS-CoV and other viral infections (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01244-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). They were chosen specifically due to their mode of action and potency, and have been used and researched with ethnobotanical evidence against coronaviruses or other viruses (HIV, Influenza, etc.). Coronaviruses belong to positive sense RNA viruses and mostly use the ACE-2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) receptor, 3CLpro (3 Chymotrypsin-like protease), PLpro (Papain-like protease), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) enzyme and other known factors to gain entry into the human cell and complete the life cycle. Thereby, all these selected plants have been tested by various researchers globally to act on these specific target proteins and receptors, and, moreover, inhibit RNA replication in the other viruses too. This was the chief rationale in selecting these plants, which are described in detail below with their mode of action, which may also possibly be considered as a therapeutic choice against SARS-CoV-2. This presentation is designed in order to open new pathways towards the management of highly contagious diseases with the help of natural compounds.
