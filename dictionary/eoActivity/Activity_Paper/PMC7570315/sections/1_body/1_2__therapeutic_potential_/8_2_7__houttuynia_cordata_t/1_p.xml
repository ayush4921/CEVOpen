The bioactive compounds present in HCT are comprised of rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercetin, afzelin, reyoutrin, kalium sulfuricum, cordarine, decanoyl acetaldehyde, lauric aldehyde, myrcene, Î±-pinene, methyl nonyl ketone, d-limonene, linoleic acid, aspartic acid, palmitic acid, water-soluble polysaccharides, amino acids, vitamins, manganese, potassium, zinc, iron and copper [

 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Lau et al. conducted one experiment using HCT against SARS-CoV-1. Results showed that HCT can inhibit SARS-CoV-1 activity including an immunomodulatory effect [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, the mode of action of HCT is to inhibit the 3CLpro activity of SARS-CoV-1 and obstruct the activity of RdRp [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Hence, it can block the entry of the virus and impede viral replication [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This inhibitory mechanism makes HCT a good choice to be used against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
