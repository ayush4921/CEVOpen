 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> (
 <italic>L. radiata</italic>) belongs to the 
 <italic>Amaryllidaceae</italic> family and originally it was found in China, Korea, Japan and Nepal [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and induction of nausea and emesis [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, and most importantly, 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> has been known to have antiviral effects on SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Its potent bioactive compound is lycorine, which is extracted from the flower and stem cortex of 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> plants. Currently, this plant is in use for the treatment of various diseases due to its broad-spectrum biological activities. It has also been recommended as a promising medicinal plant for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV infection [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The antiviral mechanism of action of this plant is by inhibiting virus replication in the cells through inhibiting autophagy [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, JNK/MAPK signaling pathway is closely connected to autophagy, and through this signaling pathway, the plant extract inhibits the process of autophagy due to reduced JNK phosphorylation induced by viral replication [
