<p>It is strongly believed that natural compounds or drugs have good potential to effectively treat virus-related diseases. Though the process of drug development from the natural product is time-consuming, their efficacy is known to produce long-term effectiveness. Recent developments in advance instrumentations and novel techniques helped in identifying various novel and effective plant-based natural drugs, leading to the development of potent antiviral compounds. Moreover, they can also be referred as supplementary foods or nutraceuticals due to their therapeutic potential, which can ultimately aid in promoting good health. Therefore, in vivo model studies, safety certifications, and mandatory clinical trial implementations of natural compounds should fulfill the emergency demands against serious diseases. This will also directly or indirectly contribute to controlling the pandemic situation.</p>
