<p>Medicinal plants and their natural bioactive compounds provide significant and powerful resources, displaying diverse antiviral properties. Their biodiversity serves as an excellent source of new antiviral drugs, revealing new chemical structures that can act on various biochemical pathways, leading to the development of novel and effective therapeutic drugs against viral diseases. Some medicinal plants and their natural products are identified to possess robust antiviral activities, mainly against coronaviruses, HIV and influenza. It is necessary that their identification/discovery should go for further investigations to provide the population with therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 with increased efficiency and compliance. Most of the studies in this field are still in the initial stages of research, with a few being in in vivo experiments and clinical trials. Therefore, it is very important to not ignore the potency of medicinal plants that should be further investigated and explored in characterizing specific bioactive agents, as well as their mechanism, efficacy, and application through in vivo studies. This will lead us to natural therapeutic approaches against various infectious diseases including COVID-19. In addition, these plants can also be used in combinational therapy, due to the presence of natural compounds which can act as immunomodulators and might be helpful in combatting the diseases in a natural way, or can work as adjuvants to create a good drug therapy. We strongly believe that phytomedicines will play an imperative role and continue to support in developing potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
