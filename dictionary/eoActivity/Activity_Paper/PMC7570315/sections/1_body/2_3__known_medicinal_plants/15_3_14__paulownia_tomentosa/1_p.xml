 <italic>Paulownia tomentosa</italic> (
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic>) is an old Chinese medicinal plant belonging to the 
 <italic>Scrophulariaceae</italic> family. It is mostly found in central and western China, Taiwan and Korea. 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> has wide-ranging biological activities comprising antiviral, antioxidant and antibacterial effects [

 <xref rid="B138-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. It is mostly used for the treatment of various diseases, such as inflammatory bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, asthma, tonsillitis, gonorrhea, traumatic bleeding, enteritis, bacteriological diarrhea, erysipelas, swelling, bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, and hemorrhoids [

 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> has been known to have an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV PLpro. 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> fruit contains many bioactive components such as tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E, geranylated flavonones and others [

 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> fruit-extracted bioactive components against SARS-CoV. An in vitro study showed that 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> is able to inhibit SARS-CoV PLpro activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 5.0 to 14.4 µM [
 <xref rid="B137-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Out of all those studied, Tomentin E showed the most promising and highest inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV, with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.0 ± 0.06 µM [
