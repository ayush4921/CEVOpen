 <xref rid="B81-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is effectively used as a laxative or astringent for the treatment of stomachache, hemorrhoids, liver bile disease or gastroenteritis [
 <xref rid="B243-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. It contains some potent bioactive compounds including emodin, physcion, chrysophanol, rhein and aloe-emodin [

 <xref rid="B244-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. It was also used against SARS-CoV-1 infection, due to its potential efficacy for acting on the ACE-2 receptor, leading to blockage of viral entry into cells and replication of the CoVs [

 <xref rid="B80-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. An in vitro study conducted by Ho et al. 2007 showed the potential of Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (root tubers of 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> L.) in blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-1 to inhibition sites such as the ACE-2 receptor [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Furthermore, the major active component of this plant is emodin, which is responsible for blocking the binding of SARS-CoV-1 S protein to ACE-2 receptor [
