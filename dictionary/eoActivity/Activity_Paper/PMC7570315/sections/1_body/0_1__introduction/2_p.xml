<p>Under the current, difficult context, almost 27,236,916 people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, and approximately 891,031 deaths has been reported as of 7 September 2020 due to COVID-19 infection globally [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The question raised here is “why researchers and global scientific community have also not taken in consideration the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through natural plant-based compounds or usage of ethnomedicinal medicinal plants?”. Though we cannot bring about an instant cure, considering the urgency of eradicating the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper will open new perspectives about plant molecules in developing various strategies against infectious diseases [

Medicinal plants are known to produce innumerable bioactive metabolites with different pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-malarial, anti-hypertension, anti-ageing, anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-osteoporotic, hepato-protective, immunomodulator, etc. [

In this review, we have focused on specific medicinal plants and their bioactive compounds, which are known to use/can be used against coronaviruses, HIV, and other viruses to prevent the replication of viruses and reduce the viral load. In addition, how these medicinal plants and their derived biomolecules will be beneficial for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is also discussed; a repository of possible and effective antiviral plant candidates has also been made (
