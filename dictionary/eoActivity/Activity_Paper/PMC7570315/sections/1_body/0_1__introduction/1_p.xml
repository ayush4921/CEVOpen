<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses under the family of 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>; first reported in 1960 [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CoVs can infect humans and a wide range of animals including camels, cattle, cats, and bats, causing respiratory, hepatic, neurological and gastrointestinal diseases [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CoVs are further divided into subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae,</italic> and classified into four genera; alpha, beta, gamma and delta-CoVs [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, to date, only seven types of human-CoVs (HCoVs) exist that can infect humans. They are Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and novel SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In early December 2019, novel SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in the city of Wuhan, China with symptoms of severe viral pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The disease, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, has been given the name COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a short period of time, WHO issued guidelines for patients monitoring, sample collection, and various other detailed pieces of information on this pandemic disease [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many reports confirmed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by human to human transmission [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there are no specific drugs or vaccines currently available to cure COVID-19 infection. Thus, this scenario reflects the urgency and need to develop new drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 infection [
