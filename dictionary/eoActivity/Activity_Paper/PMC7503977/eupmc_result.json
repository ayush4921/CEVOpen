    "The plant <i>Chloranthus japonicus</i> Sieb is known for its anticancer properties and mainly distributed in China, Japan, and Korea. In this study, we firstly investigated the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the culturable endophytic fungi from <i>C. japonicus</i>. A total of 332 fungal colonies were successfully isolated from 555 tissue segments of the medicinal plant <i>C. japonicus</i> collected from Qinling Mountains, China. One hundred and thirty representative morphotype strains were identified according to ITS rDNA sequence analyses and were grouped into three phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota), five classes (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Mucoromycetes), and at least 30 genera. <i>Colletotrichum</i> (RA, 60.54%) was the most abundant genus, followed by <i>Aspergillus</i> (RA, 11.75%) and <i>Diaporthe</i> (RA, 9.34%). The Species Richness Index (<i>S</i>, 56) and the Shannon-Wiener Index (<i>H</i>', 2.7076) indicated that <i>C. japonicus</i> harbored abundant fungal resources. Thirteen out of 130 endophytic fungal ethyl acetate extracts exhibited inhibitory activities against at least one pathogenic bacterium or fungus. Among of these, F8158, which was identified as <i>Trichoderma</i> cf. <i>harzianum</i>, exhibited good antagonistic capacities (the percent inhibition of mycelial growth ranged from 47.72~88.18) for different pathogens and has a potential application in biological control. In addition, it is noteworthy that the strain F8157 (<i>Thanatephorus cucumeris</i>, an opportunistic pathogen) showed antibacterial and antifungal activity, which is reported firstly in this study, and should be investigated further. Taken together, these results indicated that the endophytic fungi from <i>C. japonicus</i> may be of potential interest in screening bio-control agents and discovering of new bioactive compounds."
