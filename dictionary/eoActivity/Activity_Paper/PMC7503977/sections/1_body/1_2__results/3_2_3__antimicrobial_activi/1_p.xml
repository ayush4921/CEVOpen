<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-05958-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 13 out of 130 endophytic fungal ethyl acetate extracts showed inhibitory activity against at least one pathogenic bacterium or fungus (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-05958">Supplementary Information Files (3)</xref>). The other 117 extracts did not show inhibitory activities. These 13 strains belonged to genera of 
 <italic>Diaporthe</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Leptospora</italic>, 
 <italic>Thanatephorus</italic>, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>, 
 <italic>Septoria,</italic> respectively (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-05958-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among these strains, F8158 (
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> cf. 
 <italic>harzianum</italic> (GenBank Accession number: MN429210), commonly used as biocontrol agents in the agricultural production process), also exhibited a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and has potential application in the biological control. Further experiments showed that the strain F8158 exhibited a plant promoting effect by producing siderophore (data not shown). In addition, it is noteworthy that the strain F8157 (
 <italic>Thanatephorus cucumeris</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen), showed antibacterial and antifungal activity, which is reported firstly in this study, and has the potential research value.
