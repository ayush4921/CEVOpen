<p>In this study, a total of 332 fungal colonies were successfully isolated from 555 tissue segments of 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> with a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. The 332 isolates initially were assigned to 130 representative morphotypes according to their culture characteristics on PDA. ITS rDNA sequences subsequently were generated for a representative of each morphotype (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-05958">Supplementary Information Files (1)</xref>). Based on the sequence similarity threshold (SSA, 97%~100%) 124 isolates were categorized at the genus level while the other six isolates remained unidentified. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the maximum likelihood method (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-05958">Supplementary Information Files (2)</xref>). Some species were still not well categorized. For example, although the isolates F8210, F8235, F8210, F8176, F8170, F8135, F8110, F8115, and 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. SL10 (KP689235) were in the same branch, the support rating was only 60%. These isolates may be different taxa though we classified them into one taxon (
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. SL10) in this study. In total, these isolates were grouped into at least 56 taxa (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-05958-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) based on the results of sequence BLAST and phylogenetic trees analysis. The isolate F4146 was only assigned to the phylum Ascomycota, and the isolates F8184, F8209, F8233, F8241, and F8245 were only categorized as the class Sordariomycetes. Ultimately, the Species Richness Index (S) and Shannon-Wiener Index (
 <italic>H</italic>â€²), which are two important parameters for diversity analysis, were at least 56 and 2.7076 for 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic>, respectively. As presented in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-05958-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, these isolates have been further grouped into three phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota), five classes (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Mucoromycetes), 12 orders, 21 families, and at least 30 fungal genera.
