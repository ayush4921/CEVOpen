<p>Due to the increase in antibiotic resistance among pathogens, discovering novel antimicrobials is urgent [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Endophytic fungi represent abundant species resources and secondary metabolites diversity [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, the resources of endophytic fungi remain underexplored. In this study, our main purpose is to investigate the diversity of these endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> and to obtain endophytic fungi resources with antibacterial activities, so as to provide a basis for further screening for biocontrol agents or mining natural products with new structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic>.
