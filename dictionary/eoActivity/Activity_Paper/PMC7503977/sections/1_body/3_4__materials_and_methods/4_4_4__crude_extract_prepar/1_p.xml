<p>Each isolate was cultured on the PDA for seven days, after which the plugs of each fungus were used to inoculate liquid cultures containing a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a 50 mL potato dextrose broth (PDB) culture medium (house-made) containing (g/L): 200 potato (peel potatoes, cut into 1 cm pieces, boiled for 20 min, filtered to obtain filtrate), 20 dextrose, pH 6.0. All isolates were incubated on a rotary shaker at 28 °C and 230 rpm for 14 days. The fermentation broth was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min. Fifty mL of fermentation filtrate was extracted with 50 mL ethyl acetate (three extractions total) and the organic phase was concentrated using a rotary evaporator on 50 °C water bath to remove organic solvent as described by Xing et al. with minor modifications [
