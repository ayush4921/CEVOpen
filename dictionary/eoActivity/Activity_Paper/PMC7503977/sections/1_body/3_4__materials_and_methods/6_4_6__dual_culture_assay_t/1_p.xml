<p>The dual culture technique was used to conduct the antagonistic test. The endophytic fungi and pathogen species to be tested were cultured separately on the PDA for seven days. After seven days, 5 mm mycelial plugs (taken from the edge of fungal colonies) of each species were transferred to PDA plates using a borer. The mycelial plugs of endophytic fungi and pathogens were placed on opposite sides to each other on a PDA surface. PDA plates inoculated with the pathogens were included as negative controls. The antagonistic tests were conducted in duplicate. The controls consisted of pure

 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (Fries) Keissler cultures. All culture plates were incubated at 28 °C and observations were made after five days of incubations. The percent inhibition of mycelia growth over the control was calculated by the following equation:
 <disp-formula>I = (C − T)/C × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where I is the percent inhibition of mycelial growth, C is the radius of pathogens mycelium with the growth in control, and T is the radius of pathogens mycelia in the treatment.
