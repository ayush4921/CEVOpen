<p>In April 2018, a total of thirty wild plants of 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> were collected from Yingpan town, Shaanxi province of China (33°49′30′′ N, 109°6′15′′ E, elevation, 1340 m). The land we accessed was publicly owned and undeveloped. These plants were carefully dug up, placed in a sterile sampling bag, labeled, immediately transported to the laboratory, and then placed into a refrigerator (4 °C), as described previously [
