<p>The isolation frequency (IF) represented the frequency of the occurrence of certain endophytic fungi in total isolates based on the number of isolates (N). The relative abundance (RA) was calculated based on the number of all isolates number (N). The diversity of fungal species from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> was evaluated using the Species Richness Index (S) and Shannon-Weiner Index (
 <italic>H</italic>â€²) with the procedure described by Fedor and Spellerberg. [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The Species Richness Index (S) was obtained by counting the number of endophytic fungal species in the corresponding plant tissues. A total of 130 isolates were participated in the antimicrobial activities assessment in this study.
