<p>Using the agar diffusion method described by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we screened the ethyl acetate crude extracts from fermentation filtrates of 130 fungal strains for antimicrobial activities against seven pathogens, including 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>oryzae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The detailed operation procedure were as follows: 10 mL culture of the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> grown two days in a Sabouraud liquid medium at 28 °C was added to the 200 mL of the Sabouraud agar medium, while 10 mL cultures of pathogenic bacteria grown 12 h in the Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium (containing (g/L): 5 Yeast extracts, 10 peptone, 10 NaCl, pH 7.0) at 28 °C was added to the 100 mL of the LB agar medium, mixed gently, and then poured slowly on the petri dish (90 mm) used as the test plate. Six mm sterilized straws were used for perforating the plate, and the agar blocks were removed with a sterilized toothpick. The 100 μL fermentation filtrate EtOAc extracts (10 mg/mL) were added to the hole of the test plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for the pathogenic bacteria or at 28 °C for 48 h for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Ampicillin sodium (1 mg/mL) and Actidione (1 mg/mL) were prepared using deionized water and used as a positive antimicrobial control and pure methanol was used as a negative control. Antimicrobial activities were evaluated by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zones. All experiments were replicated three times.
