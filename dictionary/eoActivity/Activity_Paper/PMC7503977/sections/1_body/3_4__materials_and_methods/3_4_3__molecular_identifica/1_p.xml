<p>To obtain fungal mycelia, each pure isolate was cultivated on plates containing the PDA medium at 28 °C for seven days. Mycelia were removed from media using sterile pipette tips and then ground in liquid nitrogen for DNA extraction using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Bacteria Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Dalian, China). Genomic DNA was then used as the template for PCR amplification of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) using the universal primers ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) according to the description by White et al. with minor modifications [

The final reaction volume was 50 μL, containing 5.0 μL of 10×Taq buffers, 4.0 μL of 200 mmol/L dNTPs, 2.0 μL of each primer at 10 μM, 0.5 μL of Ex Taq enzyme (TaKaRa, Dalian), and 5.0 μL of genomic DNA. PCR amplification was performed using TProfessional Standard 96 Gradient (Biometra, Jena, Germany) using the following cycling parameters: 1 min 95 °C; followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and a final 10 m extension at 72 °C. Five μL of each PCR product was analyzed electrophoretically in 1% (

The raw obtained sequences were aligned using MEGA 5.05 (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA), edited manually, and then BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (NCBI, Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to search for the best match in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (

Sequences with similarity over 97% belonged to the same genus. The sequences obtained in this study were submitted to the GenBank database with accession numbers from MK367469 to MK367568. The evolutionary history was inferred as described by Wei et al. and Felsenstein [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All sequences were aligned by MEGA 5.05 using the alignment prepared with Clustal W (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA) and all positions containing gaps and missing date were deleted. Finally, the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for each of the families using MEGA software 5.05 [
