<p>Endophytic fungi have a high level of taxonomic diversity [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These fungi exist in nearly every tissue type studied and are promising as biological control agents against phytopathogens and bioactive substances [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite these characteristics, endophytic fungi remain poorly studied. The Qinling Mountains are rich in medicinal plant resources, many of which have been used as traditional Chinese medicines by the local people. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on biodiversity and pharmacological properties of medicinal plants of the Qinling Mountains; however, as far as we know, few studies have attempted to evaluate the diversity of endophytes associated with these valuable plants [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the diversity of the culturable endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> (one of the most popular medicinal plants in Qinling Mountains) and obtained abundant endophytic fungal isolates, which was conducive for screening the active strains and laying a foundation for their application.
