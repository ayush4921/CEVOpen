<p>The normal hemostatic process is meant to stop a cut or wound on blood vessels through platelet thrombus formation; subsequently, there is an eventual elimination of the plug when healing is complete. It is a delicate multiphase mechanism that requires the interaction of platelets and the coagulation factors with blood vessels. A defect in any of these phases can result in thrombosis or hemorrhage [

 <italic>Alpinia officinarum</italic>, 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) is approved for the management of external hemorrhage and post-surgery dental bleedings in Turkey to attenuate blood clotting time effectively [

 <italic>Fagonia cretica</italic> (74.6%), 
 <italic>Hedera nepalensis</italic> (73.8%)
 <italic>,</italic> and 
 <italic>Phytolacca latbenia</italic> (67.3%) revealed promising anticoagulant effect by delaying blood clotting time to 86.9 s, 84.3 s, and 67.5 s, respectively [

In this study, saline and aspirin showed a clear line of difference between the coagulation and anticoagulation by depicting blood clotting time of 38.33 s and 108.5 s, respectively. The most significant anticoagulant effect was reported by SEE with a coagulation time of 101.66 s followed by PEE (86.5 s), respectively. LEE showed a blood clotting time of 66.83 s, representing a moderate inhibitory effect on coagulation activity. CEE was least effective in anticoagulation property and showed an almost equal response to saline, indicating a neutral effect of the selected extract, which can be used in the treatment of blood clotting disorders such as hemophilia. It is said that the corms of 
 <italic>C. sativus</italic> Cartwrightianus have a protein factor involved in human platelet aggregation [

Saffron stigma tablets (200 and 400 mg/day) assessed for short-term safety and tolerability in a limited number of volunteers showed that only 200 mg of saffron tablets reduced International Normalize Ratio, platelets, and coagulation time [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Later, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with a large sample size, saffron tablets (200 and 400 mg/day) administration failed to show any major effect on coagulant and anticoagulant system after one month. The authors suggested that the case reports of hemorrhagic complications might be due to the high saffron dose, high period of consumption, or idiosyncrasy activities [
