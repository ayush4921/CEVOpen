Saffron stigma contains more than 150 phytochemical ingredients, belonging to various divisions of secondary metabolites such as carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and anthocyanin. Amongst the 50 constituents identified so far, apocarotenoids, including crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal, emerge as the major constituents of saffron stigma, primarily responsible for imparting a distinct colorant, flavor, and aroma to the spice [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These compounds are derived from lipophilic carotenoid, zeaxanthin by oxidative cleavage. Moreover, a series of flavonoids (all glycosidic derivatives of kaempferol) have also been characterized in the stigma and petals of saffron, which, together with picrocrocin, give the characteristic bitter feature to this spice [
