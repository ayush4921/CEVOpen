<p>The test is based on the use of thermal stimuli to determine the effect of analgesics. For this purpose, an easy and cost-effective method, the hot plate analgesic test, was performed. Results of saffron ethanolic extracts presented in the form of latency time indicated that all the extracts showed significant (

Among all the extracts of saffron tested, stigma ethanolic extract (SEE) showed the highest latency activity (7.80 ± 0.16, 11.30 ± 0.21, 12.80 ± 0.33, and 13.50 ± 0.28) at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively. On the other hand, leaf ethanolic extract (LEE) exhibited no significant difference at 0 h when compared with negative control (saline) but showed the least activity of 5.92 ± 0.14, 6.22 ± 0.15, and 6.65 ± 0.19 at 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively. Based on the percent inhibition (

Furthermore, corm ethanolic extract (CEE) and LEE responded poorly and showed weak analgesic activity of 22.40% and 29.07% at 2 h, respectively.
