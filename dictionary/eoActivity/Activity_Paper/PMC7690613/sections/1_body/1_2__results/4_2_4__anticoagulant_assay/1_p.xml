<p>The blood clotting activity of saffron extracts was investigated using the capillary tube method. The results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01414-f004">Figure 4</xref> show the effects of oral administration of saffron extracts and aspirin on coagulation time in mice. As a reference drug, the anticoagulant aspirin (10 mg/kg) significantly increased blood clotting time (108.5 ± 8.59 s) compared to the control group, saline (38.33 ± 4.92 s). SEE was the major identified anticoagulant extract showing prominent and significant anticoagulant effect with coagulation time of 101.66 ± 7.20 s followed by PCC (86.50 ± 6.89 s), respectively. LEE, however, had a moderate inhibitory effect on coagulation activity with a clotting time of 66.83 ± 6.17 s. CEE, on the other hand, was unable to prolong the blood clotting time (42.83 ± 6.27 s) and showed an almost equal response to saline, representing the neutral effect of the selected extract.
