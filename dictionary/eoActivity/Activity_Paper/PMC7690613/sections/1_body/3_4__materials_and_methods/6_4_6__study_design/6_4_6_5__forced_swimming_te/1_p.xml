<p>The forced swim test (FST) described by Porsolt et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] was used to screen the extracts of saffron for their antidepressant activity. On day first, mice were forced to swim individually in a glass tank of 40 cm height and 18 cm diameter containing water up to 30 cm under natural light. The water temperature was adjusted to 25 ± 1 °C. The water level was adjusted in such a way that mice could only touch the bottom of the tank with the tip of the tail. After 15 min exposure in the tank, mice were evacuated, dried off with a paper towel, and shifted to their home cage. The next day, saline (1 mL/kg) and fluoxetine HCl (10 mg/kg) served as a negative and positive control, respectively, along with saffron extracts (800 mg/kg) were administered 30 min before the experiment. Mice were allowed to swim freely for 6 min in the tank, and swimming behaviors were recorded with a video camera. Before each test, freshwater was introduced. Animals were placed one by one, and after every 2 min, immobility time was calculated in the last 4 min of swimming practice using a stopwatch. Immobility time is the time when the mouse stopped all additional movements other than those required for survival or balancing of their body.
