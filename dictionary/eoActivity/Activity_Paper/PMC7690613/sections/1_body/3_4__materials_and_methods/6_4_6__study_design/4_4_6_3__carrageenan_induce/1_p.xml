 <italic>C. sativus</italic> ethanolic extracts were examined for their anti-inflammatory activities using the carrageenan-induced paw edema test as described by Winter et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The test is based on the principle to assess acute anti-inflammatory activity in the hind paws of mice by developing inflammatory models with carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide agent that triggers inflammation. In this test, diclofenac potassium (10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control, and saline (1 mL/kg) served as a negative control to compare the anti-inflammatory effects. Before experimentation, mice were fasted for 24 h but had access to water. For edema induction, 1% λ-carrageenan (0.1 mL), prepared in 1% saline was injected into the sub planter tissue of mice left hind paw 1 h after administration of the drug. The basal volume of the paw was recorded just before and after injection of λ-carrageenan at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h by digital plethysmometer (UGO Basile, 7140). For every interval, all the data were recorded in triplicate. The degree of swelling was calculated by the delta volume (A−B), where “A” shows the mean volume of the left hind paw after and “B” before the treatment of 
 <italic>λ</italic>-carrageenan. The percentage edema inhibition (PEI) was measured using the equation:
