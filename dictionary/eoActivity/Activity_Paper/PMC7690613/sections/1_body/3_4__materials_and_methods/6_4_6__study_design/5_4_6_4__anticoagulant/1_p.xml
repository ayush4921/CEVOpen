<p>Blood clotting activity of saffron extracts was evaluated by the capillary tube method reported by Ismail and Mirza [
 <xref rid="B84-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. One hour after oral administration of the dose, the mouse tail was disinfected with spirit and prickled using a lancet. The tail was pressed firmly to get a bigger drop of blood and collected in capillary tubes. The time of appearance of the blood drop on the cut tail was recorded. The tubes were wrapped and maintained at 37 ± 1 °C in a water bath. Small portions of each tube were broken at regular intervals of 10 s, until fibrin thread appeared. The blood coagulation time was measured by considering the appearance of a blood drop as a starting point and thread formation as an endpoint.
