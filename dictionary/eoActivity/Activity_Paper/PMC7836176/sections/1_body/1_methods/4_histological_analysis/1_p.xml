<p id="Par44">Liver tissues extracted from each mouse were fixed in 10% formalin solution and then embedded in paraffin to form paraffin blocks. These blocks were then cut into thin sections, some of which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The sections were also subjected to Sirius Red staining to observe collagen in the liver. To observe hepatic lipids, frozen optimum cutting temperature-embedded liver tissue specimens were prepared. The tissues were then sectioned with a cryostat and fixed in 4% formalin solution before staining with Oil Red O. Histological scoring of images after H&amp;E staining was conducted as described by Kleiner et al. [
