 <italic>Lysimachia vulgaris</italic> var. 
 <italic>davurica</italic> (LV), also known as the yellow loosestrife, is a medicinal plant that is well known for treating ulcers, fever, inflammation, and diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent findings have revealed that LV also has antifungal, antibacterial, antitumor, and antioxidative activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, LV is a non-toxic, edible plant that grows in Europe, North America, and Asian countries and is registered as a food ingredient in the Korean Food Standards Codex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a previous study, our research team found that LV is effective in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, where it induced positive changes in lipid metabolism-related proteins and genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, we found some studies showing that 
 <italic>Lysimachia christinae</italic> (which belongs to the same genus as LV) increased the detoxification mechanisms in liver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LV could alleviate NASH by regulating lipid metabolism, and may mitigate oxidative stresses in the liver as well. Because of the lack of a proper therapeutic agent for NASH, we wanted to verify whether LV could be a novel therapeutic agent for treating NASH. Hence, in this study, we determined the efficacy of LV for the treatment of NASH, a disease with multiple symptoms and complex developmental mechanisms.
