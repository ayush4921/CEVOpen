<p id="Par58">In summary, we administered an LV extract to mice with MCD diet-induced NASH. The histopathological grades of NASH (based on the morphologies of liver sections) were ameliorated by LV supplementation, and lipid accumulation in the liver tissue also decreased. Moreover, treatment with the LV extract upregulated Nrf2, which may have improved the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities in the liver. Additionally, the LV extract strongly alleviated liver fibrosis by downregulating

 <italic>COL3A1</italic>. Mice fed the LV extract also showed decreased levels of proteins related to TGFβ and Smad signaling, which act upstream of fibrotic gene expression. Therefore, the potency of the LV extract in relieving liver fibrosis may result from blocking TGFβ and Smad signaling. In conclusion, the LV extract ameliorated NASH by alleviating lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and LV extract successfully relieved liver fibrosis. In particular, LV extract ameliorated liver fibrosis effectually in comparison with a dual PPARα/δ agonist (GFT 505). These findings indicate many advantages for using the LV extract as a therapeutic agent against NASH.
