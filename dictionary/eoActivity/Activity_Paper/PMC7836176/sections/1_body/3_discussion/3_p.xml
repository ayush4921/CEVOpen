<p id="Par56">Liver fibrosis, which results from the replacement of hepatocytes with fibrotic cells during NASH pathogenesis, causes irreparable damage to the liver and loss of liver function. During liver cirrhosis, fibrous scars form along with the generation of myofibroblasts, the main sources of which are hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the normal liver, the major role of HSCs is in storing retinyl esters, a stored form of vitamin A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, HSCs are activated and transformed into myofibroblasts upon liver injury, and the expression levels of the related genes 
 <italic>α-SMA</italic>, 
 <italic>COL1A1</italic>, and 
 <italic>COL3A1</italic> can increase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In particular, the expression level of 
 <italic>α-SMA</italic> is a reliable marker of activated HSCs, and is also strongly correlated with myofibroblast formation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The mRNA-expression level of 
 <italic>α-SMA</italic> was the highest in the GFT group, indicating that although GFT505 could attenuate lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions in NASH, its recovery of damaged hepatocytes was not very effective. In contrast, the LYS group showed decreased levels of fibrosis-related genes. Meanwhile, as one of the key activator of HSCs in NASH pathogenesis, the inflammatory responses induced by Kupffer cells (KCs) are highly associated with NASH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. KCs are the resident macrophages in hepatic tissues, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines when NASH occurs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus, KC activation is linked with the exacerbation of liver fibrosis in NASH pathogenesis. Although specific markers that can prove KC activation have not been determined in this study, we found that the contents of crucial chemokines (MCP-1 and ICAM-1) are decreased when LV and GFT are administered. Furthermore, we noted TGFβ as a mediator of inflammation and liver fibrosis mechanisms [
