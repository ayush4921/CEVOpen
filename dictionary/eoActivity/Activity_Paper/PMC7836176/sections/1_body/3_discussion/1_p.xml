<p id="Par54">The MCD diet is a well-established experimental model for inducing severe NAFLD and NASH in animals. The liver is the major organ of lipogenesis in the body, being the site for both fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis. After hepatic lipogenesis, the liver secretes lipids into the portal vein, mostly in the form of VLDL, which consists mainly of apolipoprotein B and phosphatidyl choline (PC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Choline and methionine are precursors of PC; hence, the MCD diet causes a lack of PC in mice and consequently blocks the secretion of synthesized TGs from the liver to the blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, mice fed the MCD diet accumulate excess lipids in the liver, which causes severe NAFLD. Moreover, the accumulated lipids undergo beta-oxidation; with ensuing excessive oxidative stress, this causes inflammation of hepatocytes and ultimately NASH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there are drawbacks to mimicking human NAFLD in a mouse model with only the MCD diet. Most human patients with NASH and NAFLD have underlying obesity, whereas mice with MCD diet-induced NASH show a loss in body weight. Thus, genetically modified mice should be used to mimic the human disease. For example, the

 <italic>db</italic> mouse is a genetically modified animal that is used to study obesity and diabetes, and upon MCD diet administration, their pathogenic progression from obesity to NAFLD and NASH is similar to that of humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>db</italic>/
 <italic>db</italic> mice fed an MCD diet were used as the NASH model in this study. The severity of NASH in mice was evaluated with NAS scoring. The results revealed that ballooning significantly reduced in GFT and LYS groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the values of other NAS factors (steatosis and inflammation) decreased, albeit without statistical difference. Therefore, we thought that LV could relieve NASH pathogenesis; however, the GFT group showed high efficacy in NASH treatment. Notably, GFT505 (a dual PPARα/δ agonist) has been demonstrated to improve lipid and glucose homeostasis in patients with abdominal obesity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, PPARs are nuclear receptors that play key roles in regulating lipid metabolism; these are also related to inflammation, cellular growth, and cell differentiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. GFT505 caused downregulation of mRNA levels of 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> and 
 <italic>PPARγ</italic> in liver tissues, and the LYS group also showed decreased 
 <italic>PPARγ</italic> gene expressions. As a result, the GFT and LYS group showed significant mitigation of lipid accumulation in the liver compared to the MCD group.
