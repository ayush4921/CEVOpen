<p id="Par55">Excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver causes inflammatory reactions, where oxidative stress may result from lipid oxidation. The Nrf2 and antioxidant-response element (ARE) pathway is one of the major detoxification pathways that enhances antioxidative responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nrf2 belongs to the cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) family of basic-region leucine zipper (b-Zip) motifs, and Nrf2 and ARE regulate the phase II family of enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Among the CNC family members, Nrf2 is considered a key regulator that induces antioxidant-responsive genes by interacting with ARE [

 <italic>HO-1</italic>, which is an antioxidant-responsive gene regulated by Nrf2, degrades heme to generate ferrous ion, CO, and biliverdin, all of which are related to the reduction of ROS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, few studies have reported the antioxidative activity of LV extract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we found that liver Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels in LYS group were significantly increased, indicating that the extract regulates the Nrf2 activator within the cellular system. In addition, many lines of evidence indicate that Nrf2 and HO-1 can prevent lipid oxidation in vivo and that Nrf2 activation is sufficient to attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation in mice with alcohol-induced fatty liver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, attenuation of lipid accumulation by the LV extract could be related to Nrf2 activation; however, further studies are needed to verify this possibility.
