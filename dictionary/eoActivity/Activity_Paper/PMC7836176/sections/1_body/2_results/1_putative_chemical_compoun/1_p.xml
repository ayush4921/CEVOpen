<p id="Par49">Over 20 peaks were observed in the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatogram of an LV extract at 254 nm, with the largest peak detected at 28.15 min [see additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>]. Ten putative chemical compounds were identified by comparing tandem mass spectrometry signals and HPLC retention times against those of mass spectral libraries. The profile of chemical compounds in the LV extract differed slightly from that reported previously, although chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, and rutin were found as the major compounds in common between this study and the previous study [
