 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a shows changes in the liver morphology, as determined by H&amp;E staining. The unstained white round spots in the image, which are supposed to be lipid droplets, were larger in the liver tissues of MCD mice than the MCS mice. However, lipid droplets seemed to be highly diminished in liver tissues from mice in the GFT group. Histological scoring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) was conducted using images of H&amp;E staining, and the GFT group showed significantly reduced lipid accumulation in their liver tissues. The LYS group did not show significant alleviation of lipid accumulation; however, anomalous ballooning of hepatocytes was significantly reduced similar to that in the GFT group. Oil Red O staining was performed to clearly visualize lipid accumulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Similar to H&amp;E staining, Oil Red O staining demonstrated that the MCD group had larger lipid droplets over a larger area compared to the MCS group. Administering the LV extract seemed to have reduced the number of lipid droplets, and the GFT group seemed to highly reduce lipid accumulation, compared to the MCS group. The TG levels in liver tissues from the LYS and GFT groups decreased significantly as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. However, no changes were observed in the liver TC levels, similar to the serum TC levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of PPAR a and PPARr were determined as a key mediator of lipid homeostasis. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). PPARα level was significantly increased in the MCD group; however, this level was significantly lowered by GFT treatment (
