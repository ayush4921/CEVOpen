  <p>LV extract alleviated liver fibrosis in NASH mice model. The mouse liver tissues were sectioned and stained with Sirius Red (
   <bold>a</bold>). The liver hydroxyproline content was measured with a commercial kit (
   <bold>b</bold>). The expression levels of genes related to liver fibrosis were determined by qPCR, including alpha smooth muscle actin (
   <italic>α-SMA</italic>), collagen, type-1, alpha 1 (
   <italic>COL1A1</italic>), and collagen, type-3, alpha 1 (
   <italic>COL3A1</italic>) (
   <bold>c</bold>). All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple range test were conducted. Different superscripts within groups indicate significant differences at
