  <p>LV extract downregulated the TGFβ and Smad-dependent pathway in NASH mice. Protein-expression levels of TGFβ and transcriptional factors of fibrotic proteins were detected in liver tissues from mice with diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (
   <bold>a</bold>). The relative protein-expression levels of TGFβ, Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3, Smad4, MMP2, and α-SMA (
   <bold>b</bold>) were determined. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple range test were conducted. Different superscripts within groups indicate significant differences at
