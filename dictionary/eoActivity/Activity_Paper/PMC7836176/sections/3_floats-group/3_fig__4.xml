  <p>LV extract elevated expression levels of anti-oxidative related proteins and inflammatory related mRNAs. The malonaldehyde (MDA) contents of liver tissues were analyzed (
   <bold>a</bold>). The bands were imaged after western blot analysis (
   <bold>b</bold>). The expression levels of the nuclear factor-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) (
   <bold>c</bold>) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (
   <bold>d</bold>) proteins were quantified by comparing their relative band densities to that of β-actin, using ImageJ software. The relative mRNA-expression levels of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (
   <italic>MCP-1</italic>) (
   <bold>e</bold>) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (
   <italic>ICAM-1</italic>) genes (
   <bold>f</bold>) were quantified by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple range test were conducted. Different superscripts within groups indicate significant differences at
