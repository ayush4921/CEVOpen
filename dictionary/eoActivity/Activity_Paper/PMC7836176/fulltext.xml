Owing to the complexity of its pathogenic mechanisms, there are no therapeutic agents for this disease yet. The ideal drug for NASH needs to concurrently decrease hepatic lipid accumulation and exert anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antioxidative effects in the liver. Because of their multipurpose therapeutic effects, we considered that medicinal herbs are suitable for treating patients with NASH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We determined the efficacy of the alcoholic extract of <italic>Lysimachia vulgaris</italic> var. <italic>davurica</italic> (LV), an edible medicinal herb, for NASH treatment. For inducing NASH, C57BLKS/J lar-Lepr<sup>db</sup>/Lepr<sup>db</sup> (<italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic>) male mice were fed with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet ad libitum. After 3&#x02009;weeks, the LV extract and a positive control (GFT505) were administered to mice by oral gavage for 3&#x02009;weeks with a continued MCD diet as needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In mice with diet-induced NASH, the LV extract could relieve the disease symptoms; that is, the extract ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and also showed antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The LV extract also activated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, leading to the upregulation of antioxidants and detoxification signaling. Moreover, the extract presented remarkable efficacy in alleviating liver fibrosis compared with GFT505. This difference was caused by significant LV extract-mediated reduction in the mRNA expression of fibrotic genes like the alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen type 3 alpha 1. Reduction of fibrotic genes may thus relate with the downregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;)/Smad signaling by LV extract administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in the liver were alleviated by feeding LV extract to NASH-induced mice. Moreover, the LV extract strongly prevented liver fibrosis by blocking TGF&#x003b2;/Smad signaling. Hence, LV showed sufficient potency for use as a therapeutic agent against NASH.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12906-021-03212-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Yellow loosestrife</kwd><kwd><italic>Lysimachia vulgaris</italic> var. <italic>davurica</italic></kwd><kwd>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis</kwd><kwd>Liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>TGF&#x003b2;/Smad signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Korea Institute of Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>2Z05630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nho</surname><given-names>Chu Won</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></funding-source><award-id>2008-00592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nho</surname><given-names>Chu Won</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par38">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly becoming a worldwide health issue owing to the burgeoning cases of obesity in the global population. In developed countries, almost one third of adults have NAFLD, and its incidence among adolescents is also increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. NAFLD is an umbrella term that represents diseases ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where the disorder can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NAFLD onset is caused by lipid droplet accumulation in the liver, which is mainly attributed to excess food consumption because the liver is a primary organ of de novo lipid synthesis. Hepatocytes produce triglycerides (TGs) and release lipids to the portal vein in the form of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although NASH development has been associated with inflammation caused by oxidative stress from excess lipids stored in the liver, the underlying mechanisms of fatty liver remain to be solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. NASH can be distinguished from fatty liver based on the signs of inflammation, which can be accompanied with mild fibrosis. Continuous inflammatory reactions cause the loss of severely damaged hepatocytes, which are then superseded with fibrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients with cirrhosis, a form of NASH characterized by liver deterioration, experience irreversible liver dysfunction.</p><p id="Par39">Development of efficacious therapies for NASH is still faced with unresolved challenges, owing to the multiple potential pathogenic pathways involved in the disease and their equivocal associations. Although the ultimate remedy for most patients is regulation of their body weight and diet, pharmacological therapies are still needed. The ideal drug for treating NASH should possess an assortment of characteristics, in that it should be able to reduce the hepatic fat content and also exert anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, patients with NASH usually need to be prescribed several drugs for anti-obesity, anti-fatty liver, insulin receptor-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, taking a cocktail of drugs inevitably has latent side effects that limit its use. Therefore, herbal medicines, which mainly comprise crude extracts of medicinal plants, are used as conventional remedies globally. Although their overall chemical profiles are unknown and their mechanisms are unclear, the therapeutic effects and safety of medicinal plants in humans have been verified through their long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Through their cocktail effects from a mixture of innate herbal compounds, the multipurpose therapeutic effects of herbal medicine on human diseases have been well documented. Considering their complex potencies, we hypothesized that the efficacy of herbal medicines in NASH may be evaluated suitably.</p><p id="Par40"><italic>Lysimachia vulgaris</italic> var. <italic>davurica</italic> (LV), also known as the yellow loosestrife, is a medicinal plant that is well known for treating ulcers, fever, inflammation, and diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent findings have revealed that LV also has antifungal, antibacterial, antitumor, and antioxidative activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, LV is a non-toxic, edible plant that grows in Europe, North America, and Asian countries and is registered as a food ingredient in the Korean Food Standards Codex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a previous study, our research team found that LV is effective in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, where it induced positive changes in lipid metabolism-related proteins and genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, we found some studies showing that <italic>Lysimachia christinae</italic> (which belongs to the same genus as LV) increased the detoxification mechanisms in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LV could alleviate NASH by regulating lipid metabolism, and may mitigate oxidative stresses in the liver as well. Because of the lack of a proper therapeutic agent for NASH, we wanted to verify whether LV could be a novel therapeutic agent for treating NASH. Hence, in this study, we determined the efficacy of LV for the treatment of NASH, a disease with multiple symptoms and complex developmental mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of an LV plant extract</title><p id="Par41">An LV plant was collected from Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do, Korea in May of 2015.

However, no changes were observed in the liver TC levels, similar to the serum TC levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of PPAR a and PPARr were determined as a key mediator of lipid homeostasis. (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). PPAR&#x003b1; level was significantly increased in the MCD group; however, this level was significantly lowered by GFT treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

In contrast, treatment with GFT505 and the LV extract increased the protein-expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1. Oxidative stress in cell systems can lead to inflammatory responses.

Liver fibrosis decreased in the LYS group; however, interestingly, GFT505 did not ameliorate liver fibrosis. The GFT group presented high levels of hydroxyproline and in amounts similar to those in the MCD group. In contrast, the LYS group showed significantly reduced hydroxyproline levels. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of fibrogenesis-related genes decreased after treatment with LV extract (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).

The liver is the major organ of lipogenesis in the body, being the site for both fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis. After hepatic lipogenesis, the liver secretes lipids into the portal vein, mostly in the form of VLDL, which consists mainly of apolipoprotein B and phosphatidyl choline (PC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Choline and methionine are precursors of PC; hence, the MCD diet causes a lack of PC in mice and consequently blocks the secretion of synthesized TGs from the liver to the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, mice fed the MCD diet accumulate excess lipids in the liver, which causes severe NAFLD. Moreover, the accumulated lipids undergo beta-oxidation; with ensuing excessive oxidative stress, this causes inflammation of hepatocytes and ultimately NASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there are drawbacks to mimicking human NAFLD in a mouse model with only the MCD diet. Most human patients with NASH and NAFLD have underlying obesity, whereas mice with MCD diet-induced NASH show a loss in body weight. Thus, genetically modified mice should be used to mimic the human disease. For example, the <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mouse is a genetically modified animal that is used to study obesity and diabetes, and upon MCD diet administration, their pathogenic progression from obesity to NAFLD and NASH is similar to that of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice fed an MCD diet were used as the NASH model in this study. The severity of NASH in mice was evaluated with NAS scoring. The results revealed that ballooning significantly reduced in GFT and LYS groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Moreover, the values of other NAS factors (steatosis and inflammation) decreased, albeit without statistical difference. Therefore, we thought that LV could relieve NASH pathogenesis; however, the GFT group showed high efficacy in NASH treatment. Notably, GFT505 (a dual PPAR&#x003b1;/&#x003b4; agonist) has been demonstrated to improve lipid and glucose homeostasis in patients with abdominal obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, PPARs are nuclear receptors that play key roles in regulating lipid metabolism; these are also related to inflammation, cellular growth, and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. GFT505 caused downregulation of mRNA levels of <italic>PPAR&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;</italic> in liver tissues, and the LYS group also showed decreased <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;</italic> gene expressions. As a result, the GFT and LYS group showed significant mitigation of lipid accumulation in the liver compared to the MCD group.</p><p id="Par55">Excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver causes inflammatory reactions, where oxidative stress may result from lipid oxidation. The Nrf2 and antioxidant-response element (ARE) pathway is one of the major detoxification pathways that enhances antioxidative responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nrf2 belongs to the cap &#x02018;n&#x02019; collar (CNC) family of basic-region leucine zipper (b-Zip) motifs, and Nrf2 and ARE regulate the phase II family of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Among the CNC family members, Nrf2 is considered a key regulator that induces antioxidant-responsive genes by interacting with ARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. <italic>HO-1</italic>, which is an antioxidant-responsive gene regulated by Nrf2, degrades heme to generate ferrous ion, CO, and biliverdin, all of which are related to the reduction of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, few studies have reported the antioxidative activity of LV extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we found that liver Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels in LYS group were significantly increased, indicating that the extract regulates the Nrf2 activator within the cellular system. In addition, many lines of evidence indicate that Nrf2 and HO-1 can prevent lipid oxidation in vivo and that Nrf2 activation is sufficient to attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation in mice with alcohol-induced fatty liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, attenuation of lipid accumulation by the LV extract could be related to Nrf2 activation; however, further studies are needed to verify this possibility.</p><p id="Par56">Liver fibrosis, which results from the replacement of hepatocytes with fibrotic cells during NASH pathogenesis, causes irreparable damage to the liver and loss of liver function. During liver cirrhosis, fibrous scars form along with the generation of myofibroblasts, the main sources of which are hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the normal liver, the major role of HSCs is in storing retinyl esters, a stored form of vitamin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, HSCs are activated and transformed into myofibroblasts upon liver injury, and the expression levels of the related genes <italic>&#x003b1;-SMA</italic>, <italic>COL1A1</italic>, and <italic>COL3A1</italic> can increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In particular, the expression level of <italic>&#x003b1;-SMA</italic> is a reliable marker of activated HSCs, and is also strongly correlated with myofibroblast formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The mRNA-expression level of <italic>&#x003b1;-SMA</italic> was the highest in the GFT group, indicating that although GFT505 could attenuate lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions in NASH, its recovery of damaged hepatocytes was not very effective. In contrast, the LYS group showed decreased levels of fibrosis-related genes. Meanwhile, as one of the key activator of HSCs in NASH pathogenesis, the inflammatory responses induced by Kupffer cells (KCs) are highly associated with NASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. KCs are the resident macrophages in hepatic tissues, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines when NASH occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus, KC activation is linked with the exacerbation of liver fibrosis in NASH pathogenesis. Although specific markers that can prove KC activation have not been determined in this study, we found that the contents of crucial chemokines (MCP-1 and ICAM-1) are decreased when LV and GFT are administered. Furthermore, we noted TGF&#x003b2; as a mediator of inflammation and liver fibrosis mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Substantial evidence indicates that TGF&#x003b2; and Smad-dependent downstream signaling are key regulatory factors in liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2; receptor activation causes Smad2/3 phosphorylation and binding with Smad4, and this oligomer induces the transcription of fibrogenesis-related genes after it translocates to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2; represents a predominant and central mediator of fibrosis in many organs in addition to the liver; therefore, it has been the target of therapeutic agents against fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These protein-expression changes resulted in diminished &#x003b1;-SMA expression, a final product. In addition, the LV extract also significantly decreased (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) the expression of MMP-2. The inactive form of TGF&#x003b2; complexes with the latency TGF-binding protein (LTBP), and after dissociating from MMP-2, the active form of TGF&#x003b2; can be released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Hence, it is surmised that the LV extract can ameliorate liver fibrosis by regulating an MMP-2-related pathway, although further studies are needed to verify this mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">In summary, we administered an LV extract to mice with MCD diet-induced NASH. The histopathological grades of NASH (based on the morphologies of liver sections) were ameliorated by LV supplementation, and lipid accumulation in the liver tissue also decreased. Moreover, treatment with the LV extract upregulated Nrf2, which may have improved the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities in the liver. Additionally, the LV extract strongly alleviated liver fibrosis by downregulating <italic>&#x003b1;-SMA</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic>. Mice fed the LV extract also showed decreased levels of proteins related to TGF&#x003b2; and Smad signaling, which act upstream of fibrotic gene expression. Therefore, the potency of the LV extract in relieving liver fibrosis may result from blocking TGF&#x003b2; and Smad signaling. In conclusion, the LV extract ameliorated NASH by alleviating lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and LV extract successfully relieved liver fibrosis. In particular, LV extract ameliorated liver fibrosis effectually in comparison with a dual PPAR&#x003b1;/&#x003b4; agonist (GFT 505). These findings indicate many advantages for using the LV extract as a therapeutic agent against NASH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
