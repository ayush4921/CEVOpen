Gita, Ambarish, Peter: Please see the errors/updates that will need to be reflected in the EssoilDb’s CAIDs. Many records were associated to multiple activities. Once the activity names are normalized, these records will need to be associated separately to each relevant activity.	This column was meant to store the new CAIDs for the ones with multiple relations	Original EssoilDB caid	Original EssoilDb data	Search status as unique or synonym. First uniquely found activity is marked as `F` and `S` stands for synonym.	Found status of unique activities. `F` stands for uniquely found into Original EssoilDB data.	Unique activities after normalization. (it is alphabatically ordered ).	Ambarish: Please search for synonyms in this column too. Hopefully, you can widen the scope by changing the suffixes of the words (eg. Carcinogen, Carcinogenic, Carcinogenicity). Also, try with and without hyphens (eg. Anti-Viral and antiviral)	Note that I had to create an Activity Class which in some cases is distinct from the Phytomedicinal Activity ActionType. Some good examples of where the Activity Class and Action need to be distinguished is everything in the “Immune | Anti-allergic” or “Immune | Anti-inflammatory” classes. It’s important to define the activities by their specific mode or target of action, so that when formulating we can pinpoint what we want, or hit the problem from multiple angles simultaneously. 	Ambarish/Peter: Please note that there is some repetition here because in some cases, I have separate entries for different “Specific ActivityTarget” values for the same 	Ambarish: Wherever possible, please pull Activity descriptions (like the ones below) into a separate column/field so I can cross-reference against my own. Also, it is very important to me (if possible) that we keep alignment with my table so I can make adjustments to the Activity names in my formulation creation database.

It can result from toxicant exposure to either parent before conception or to the mother and her developing embryo or fetus. The three basic types of developmental toxicity are: 1) Embryolethality — failure to conceive, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. 2) Embryotoxicity — growth retardation or delayed growth of specific organ systems. 3) Teratogenicity — irreversible conditions that leave permanent birth defects in live offspring, such as cleft palette or missing limbs.  Chemicals cause developmental toxicity in two ways:   1) They act directly on cells of the embryo, causing cell death or cell damage, leading to abnormal organ development. 2)  They induce a mutation in a parent's germ cell, which is transmitted to the fertilized ovum. Some mutated fertilized ova develop into abnormal embryos.					CAUTION	Bad		Teratogenic

Epigenetics is an emerging area in toxicology. In the field of genetics, epigenetics involves studying how external or environmental factors can switch genes on and off and change the programming of cells. More specifically, epigenetics refers to stable changes in the programming of gene expression which can alter the phenotype without changing the DNA sequence (genotype). Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histone tails, and regulation by non-coding RNAs, among others. Toxicants are examples of factors that can alter genetic programming.					CAUTION	Bad		Epigenetic

An acute exposure is usually a single dose or a series of doses received within a 24-hour period. Death can be a major concern in cases of acute exposures. For example: A) In 1989, 5,000 people died and 30,000 were permanently disabled due to exposure to methyl isocyanate from an industrial accident in India. B) Many people die each year from inhaling carbon monoxide from faulty heaters.					CAUTION	Bad		
		90	Carcinogenic	F	F	Hepatotoxic	Carcinogenicity	CAUTION! - Systemic toxin	Carcinogenic (Generic term)	Carcinogenic: Carcinogenicity is a complex multistage process of abnormal cell growth and differentiation that can lead to cancer. The two stages of carcinogenicity are:  1) Initiation — a normal cell undergoes irreversible changes.  2) Promotion — initiated cells are stimulated to progress to cancer.  Chemicals can act as initiators or promoters. The initial transformation that causes normal cells to undergo irreversible changes results from the mutation of the cellular genes that control normal cell functions. The mutation may lead to abnormal cell growth. It may involve a loss of suppresser genes that usually restrict abnormal cell growth. Many other factors are involved, such as growth factors, immune suppression, and hormones.  A tumor (neoplasm) is simply an uncontrolled growth of cells: A) Benign tumors grow at the site of origin; do not invade adjacent tissues or metastasize; and generally are treatable. B) Malignant tumors (cancer) invade adjacent tissues or migrate to distant sites (metastasis). They are more difficult to treat and often cause death. 					CAUTION	Bad		Carcinogenic

					F	Histaminic		CAUTION! - Systemic toxin	Chronic toxicity	Chronic toxicity represents cumulative damage to specific organ systems and takes many months or years to become a recognizable clinical disease. Damage due to subclinical individual exposures may go unnoticed. With repeated exposures or long-term continual exposure, the damage from this type of exposure slowly builds up (cumulative damage) until the damage exceeds the threshold for chronic toxicity. Ultimately, the damage becomes so severe that the organ can no longer function normally and a variety of chronic toxic effects may result.  Examples of chronic toxic effects include:  A) Cirrhosis in alcoholics who have ingested ethanol for several years. B) Chronic kidney disease in workmen with several years of exposure to lead. C) Chronic bronchitis in long-term cigarette smokers. D) Pulmonary fibrosis in coal miners (black lung disease).  					CAUTION	Bad

					F	Hypocholesterolemic		CAUTION! - Systemic toxin	Genetic toxicity	Genetic toxicity results from damage to DNA and altered genetic expression. This process is known as mutagenesis. The genetic change is referred to as a mutation and the agent causing the change is called a mutagen. There are three types of genetic changes:  1) Gene mutation — change in DNA sequence within a gene.2) Chromosome aberration — changes in the chromosome structure. 3) Aneuploidy or polyploidy — increase or decrease in number of chromosomes.   If the mutation occurs in a germ cell, the effect is heritable. This means there is no effect on the exposed person; rather, the effect is passed on to future generations.   If the mutation occurs in a somatic cell, it can cause altered cell growth (for example, cancer) or cell death (for example, teratogenesis) in the exposed person.					CAUTION	Bad		
					F	Hypoglycemic		CAUTION! - Systemic toxin	Subchronic toxicity	Subchronic toxicity results from repeated exposure for several weeks or months. This is a common human exposure pattern for some pharmaceuticals and environmental agents. For example: A) Ingestion of warfarin (Coumadin®) tablets (blood thinners) for several weeks as a treatment for venous thrombosis can cause internal bleeding. B) Workplace exposure to lead over a period of several weeks can result in anemia. 					CAUTION	Bad
