  <p>Effect of Compound 
   <bold>7c</bold> and 
   <bold>7g</bold> on the cell viability. Different concentrations of compound 
   <bold>7c</bold> and 
   <bold>7g</bold> have been used to study its effect on cell viability by MTT assay. Results of percent viability vs concentration were plotted and the IC
   <sub>50</sub> was calculated for each cell line using Graph Pad prism 8. (A) HT-29 with compound 
   <bold>7c</bold>, (B) SW-620 with compound 
   <bold>7c</bold>, (C) HT-29 with compound 
   <bold>7g</bold>, and (D) SW-620 with compound 
   <bold>7g</bold>.
