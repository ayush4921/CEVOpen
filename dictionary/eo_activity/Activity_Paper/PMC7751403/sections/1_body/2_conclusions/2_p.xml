<p>In the present work, a series of novel isatin-indole conjugates (
 <bold>7a-j</bold> and 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>) was designed and synthesised as potential antiproliferative agents towards colon cancer cells with promising inhibitory activity against the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and BclxL proteins. The cell growth of two examined colorectal cancer (HT-29 and SW-620) cell lines was significantly inhibited by all of the prepared compounds with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranges 132–611 nM against HT-29 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranges 37–468 nM against SW-620 as compared to IC
 <sub>50</sub>=4.6 and 1.5 µM for 
 <bold>5FU</bold>, respectively. For further mechanistic and selective cytotoxicity studies, compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> were examined and proved to exhibit selective cytotoxicity against both cancer cell lines with high safety profile to normal fibroblast (HFF-1). In addition, towards SW-620 cell line, both candidates inducted apoptosis and inhibited anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and BclxL proteins in a dose dependent manner. Collectively, the high potency and selective cytotoxicity suggested that conjugates 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> could serve as lead compounds for further optimisation to develop novel antitumor agents and Bcl2/BclxL inhibitors.
