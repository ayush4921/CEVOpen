<p>Regarding the activity towards HT-29 cell line, all compounds showed superior activity to the reference drug (
 <bold>5FU</bold>) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 132-611 nM compared to IC
 <sub>50</sub>=4.6 µM for 
 <bold>5FU</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>7h</bold> was the most active against HT-29 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=132 nM that is approximately 35-fold more than 
 <bold>5FU</bold>. Also, the results revealed that the 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation of isatin moiety (series 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>) resulted in diversified effect on the potency according to the alkyl group added and/or the substitution on indole moiety. For the unsubstituted indole (
 <bold>7a</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=408 nM), while 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation with CH
 <sub>3</sub>- group significantly increase the potency (
 <bold>9a</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=176 nM) and 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation with benzyl- group slightly increase the potency (
 <bold>9c</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=405 nM), the 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation with propyl group dramatically decrease the potency (
 <bold>9b</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=525 nM). Furthermore, 
 <italic>N</italic>-propylation of both chloro- (
 <bold>7c</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=206 nM) and bromo- (
 <bold>7d</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=320 nM) derivatives significantly increase the potency (
 <bold>9d</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=166 nM) and (
 <bold>9e</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=290 nM), respectively. Similarly, the activity towards SW-620 cell line of all compounds was more that 
 <bold>5FU</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 37–468 nM compared to IC
 <sub>50</sub>=1.5 µM for 
 <bold>5FU</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>7f</bold> was the most active against SW-620 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=37 nM that is approximately 32 folds more than 
 <bold>5FU</bold>. However, 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation of isatin moiety resulted in reduction of potency for all series except for compounds 
 <bold>9b</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=105 nM) compared to compound 
 <bold>7a</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=145 nM) (
