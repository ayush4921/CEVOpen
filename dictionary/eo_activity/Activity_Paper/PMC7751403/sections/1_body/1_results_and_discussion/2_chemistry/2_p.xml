<p>The synthetic strategies deliberate for the development of the final compounds (
 <bold>7a-j</bold> and 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>) were illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001 s0002">Schemes 1â€“2</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001">Scheme 1</xref>, indole 
 <bold>1</bold> was subjugated to formylation 
 <italic>via</italic> Vilsmeier haack reaction to produce 1
 <italic>H</italic>-indole-3-carbaldehyde 
 <bold>2</bold>, in which the CHO functionality was oxidised by KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> in acetone to furnish 1
 <italic>H</italic>-indole-3-carboxylic acid 
 <bold>3</bold>. Then, the acid analogue 
 <bold>3</bold> was subjected to esterification through refluxing in dry methanol to get the carboxylate analogue 
 <bold>4</bold>, where the ester group reacted with hydrazine hydrate in methyl alcohol to produce the key intermediate 1
 <italic>H</italic>-indole-3-carbohydrazide 
 <bold>5</bold>. Finally, the key intermediate 
 <bold>5</bold> was condensed with different isatin derivatives 
 <bold>6a-j</bold> in glacial acetic acid to give the final targeted compounds 
 <bold>7a-j</bold>.
