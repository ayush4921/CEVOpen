<p>The cytotoxicity effect of compounds on the colorectal cancer cell lines, HT29 and SW620 in addition to the normal human fibroblasts was measured by MTT (3–(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described

 </xref>. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96 well culture plates at 5000/well for HT29 and 10,000/well for SW620 for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with different compounds from WAG1 series (1–15) 24 h at 37 °C and humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Freshly prepared 10 µl of 3–(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT 5 mM) solution were added to the cells and further incubated for 2 h. Thereafter, 100 µl of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were added in each well and the crystals were dissolved through careful pipetting. In certain experiment, cells were treated different concentration of 5FU for 72 h. The absorbance of the product was measured at 540 nm using a Synergy™ 2 multi-mode microplate reader (Biotech, VA, USA). The experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition.
