<p>As 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> showed the best performance in protecting the liver from CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced injury among the tested herbs, the identification and quantification of phytochemical compounds in its decoction was conducted. Nine main compounds were identified, and (+)-catechin and gallic acid were also quantified. According to the Chinese Pharmacopeia, the gallic acid content was a crucial criterion to evaluate the quality of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, and it should be no less than 0.60%[
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The gallic acid content quantified in our study was in this desirable range. The phytochemical compounds identified in our study, such as gallic acid and catechin, have been regarded as strong antioxidants that can confer health benefits and may contribute to the hepatoprotective activity[
