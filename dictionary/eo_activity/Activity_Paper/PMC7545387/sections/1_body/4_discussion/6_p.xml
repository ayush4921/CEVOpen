<p>The FRAP and TEAC values of the ten medicinal foods and herbs ranged with a nearly 40-fold difference, both of which 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> ranked first, and 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root were the second or the third. Similar results were found for TPC and TFC. Because bioactive components, especially phenols and flavonoids, are the main contributors to the antioxidant activities of natural products[
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], our results revealed that 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> showed the strongest 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities, which was possibly because it contained the highest contents of phenols and flavonoids. The correlations between FRAP, TEAC, TPC, and TFC values indicated that the antioxidants in the tested medicinal herbs possessed both oxidant-reducing and free radical-scavenging capability, mainly according to their TPC. Moreover, relationship between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity, effects on liver injury, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity revealed that 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root, 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> performed better hepatoprotection with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity; meanwhile, they also showed stronger 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities containing higher TPC and TFC.
