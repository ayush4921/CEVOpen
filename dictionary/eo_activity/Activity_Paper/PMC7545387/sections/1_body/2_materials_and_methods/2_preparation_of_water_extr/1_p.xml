 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but with minor modifications. The finely ground powder of each sample was filtered through a 100-mesh sieve. Then, 10.00 g of filtered powder was mixed with 100 mL of water (room temperature, 30 min) before the mixture was decocted in a water bath (98 Â°C, 30 min). The cooled mixtures were then centrifuged (4200
