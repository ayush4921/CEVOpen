<p>The decoction of the herb with the strongest hepatoprotective effect (
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L.) was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Shim-pack GIS C18 column (5 µm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm; Shimadzu) maintained at 30 °C and a gradient elution (solvent A: H
 <sub>2</sub>O containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid; solvent B, methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid). The phytochemical compounds were separated using a 70-min linear gradient from 20% to 70% solvent B at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and detected at 280 nm. The injection volumes were 20 µL (sample without dilution) for HPLC analysis and 50 µL (sample with 10-fold dilution) for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.
