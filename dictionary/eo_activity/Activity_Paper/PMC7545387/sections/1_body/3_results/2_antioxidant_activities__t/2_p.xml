 <bold>TPC and TFC of herbs:</bold> The TPC and TFC of the ten materials were determined (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The TPC values ranged from 2.05 ± 0.16 to 91.59 ± 0.00 mg GAE/g DW, which was a difference of more than 40-fold. The three highest TPC values were found for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> (91.59 ± 0.00 mg GAE/g DW), 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (50.15 ± 1.14 mg GAE/g DW), and 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root (45.06 ± 0.07 mg GAE/g DW). The lowest TPC values were found for 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. senticosus</italic>; both were below 10 mg GAE/g DW. The highest three TFC values were found for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> (14.93 ± 0.24 mg QE/g DW), 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (7.39 ± 0.39 mg QE/g DW), and 
 <italic>P. lobata root</italic> (6.84 ± 0.08 mg QE/g DW); in contrast, the lowest three TFC values were found in 
 <italic>A. senticosus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. heracleifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. kravanh</italic>, all of which were below 1 mg QE/g DW. Our results revealed that 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> showed the strongest 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities, possibly because it contained the highest contents of phenols and flavonoids.
