 </bold> To investigate the relationship between 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity of the tested herbs, their effects on liver injury, and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity, systematic cluster analyses were performed (range of solutions, 2â€“6 cluster numbers) for clinical indicators of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury and the values of FRAP, TEAC, and TPC (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Then, a cluster number of 3 was used for online analytical processing and analysis of variance. With the exception of seven herbs in Cluster 1, Cluster 2 included 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root and 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, and Cluster 3 contained 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>. Herbs in Clusters 2 and 3 (
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root, 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>) showed stronger hepatoprotective effects and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity, and they exhibited stronger 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities, together with higher TPC and TFC.
