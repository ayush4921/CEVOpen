 <bold>Histopathological analysis:</bold> No visible histological abnormalities were found in the control group (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The liver pathology of the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> model showed necrosis and ballooning degeneration in the perivenular zone as a result of severe cell injury, obvious massive inflammatory cells, and the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These findings indicated the occurrence of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury. Meanwhile, bifendate and the ten tested materials ameliorated the morphological changes by mitigating necrosis, attenuating inflammatory cell infiltration, and resulting in lower lipid droplet accumulation, as shown below, for 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic> root, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D-F</xref>).
