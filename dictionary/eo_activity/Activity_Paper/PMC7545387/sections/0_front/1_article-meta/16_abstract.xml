  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Many natural products confer health benefits against diverse diseases through their antioxidant activities. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl
   <sub>4</sub>) is often used in animal experiments to study the effects of substances on liver injury and the related mechanisms of action, among which oxidative stress is a major pathogenic factor.

  <title>AIM</title>
  <p>To compare antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities of ten herbs and identify and quantify phytochemicals for the one with strongest hepatoprotection.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>The antioxidant activity of ten medicinal herbs was determined by both ferric-reducing antioxidant power and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assays. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by Folin–Ciocalteu method and aluminum chloride colorimetry, respectively. Their effects on CCl
   <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury were evaluated and compared in a mouse model by administrating each water extract (0.15 g/mL, 10 mL/kg) once per day for seven consecutive days and a dose of CCl
   <sub>4</sub> solution in olive oil (8%, v/v, 10 mL/kg). The herb with the strongest hepatoprotective performance was analyzed for the detailed bioactive components by using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization source-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>The results revealed that all tested herbs attenuated CCl
   <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury; each resulted in significant decreases in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and triacylglycerols. In addition, most herbs restored hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, glutathione levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels. 
   <italic>Sanguisorba officinalis</italic> (
   <italic>S. officinalis</italic>) L., 
   <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> Franch., and 
   <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> (Willd.) Ohwi root were the three most effective herbs, and 
   <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. exhibited the strongest hepatoprotective effect. Nine active components were identified in 
   <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. Gallic acid and (+)-catechin were quantified (7.86 ± 0.45 mg/g and 8.19 ± 0.57 mg/g dried weight, respectively). Furthermore, the tested herbs displayed a range of 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities proportional to their phenolic content; the strongest activities were also found for 
   <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L.

  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
  <p>This study is of value to assist the selection of more effective natural products for direct consumption and the development of nutraceuticals or therapeutics to manage oxidative stress-related diseases.</p>
