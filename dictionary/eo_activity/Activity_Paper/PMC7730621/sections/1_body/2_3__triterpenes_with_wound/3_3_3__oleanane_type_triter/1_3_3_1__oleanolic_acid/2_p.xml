<p>Oleanolic acid also enhanced wound closure through the stimulation of the migratory activity of mice fibroblasts [

The stimulating effect of oleanolic acid on cell migration could also be noted on two epithelial cell lines (Mv1Lu and MDA-MB-231) subjected to scratch assays; the underlying mechanism involves the stimulation of pathways involving mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [
