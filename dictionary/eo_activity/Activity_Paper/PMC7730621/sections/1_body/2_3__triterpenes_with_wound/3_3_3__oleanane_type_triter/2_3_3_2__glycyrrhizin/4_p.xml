<p>As stated, there is a wide variety of pentacyclic triterpenes with wound healing properties. The structural differences regarding the basic scaffold of the above-mentioned molecules represent key elements that can lead to a better, structure-activity relationships, in developing/testing new compounds with wound healing potential. Different structural features present in pentacyclic triterpene structures with wound healing properties, are depicted in
