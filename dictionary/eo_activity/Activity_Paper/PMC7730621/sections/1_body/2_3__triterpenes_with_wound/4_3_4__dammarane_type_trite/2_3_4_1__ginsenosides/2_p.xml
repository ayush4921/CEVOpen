<p>In a more in-depth study of the mechanism of action of ginsenosides by Shin et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] it has been reported that the healing effect of ginsenosides is related to their property of increasing the migration of human keratinocytes through a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) dependent mechanism. The data obtained by Shin et al. support the hypothesis that ginsenosides act through the S1P pathway, noting that they increase S1P production by regulating the activity of enzymes associated with the generation and degradation of S1P [sphingosine kinase 1 and S1P lyase). Another possible mechanism of action associated with ginsenosides was explained by Kimura et al. in an in vivo study on burn wound healing in mice. The repairing effect of Red Ginseng root extract has been associated with increased neovascularization around the wound and the production of vascular endothelial growth factor and inteleukin-1Î² [

Hence, the repair effect of ginsenosides has been tested on various in vitro and in vivo models, but the mechanism of action is not yet fully elucidated; in addition, the possible side effects associated with their use are not well-known. For these reasons, more studies are needed, also performed on human subjects, in order to fully demonstrate the effect of ginsenosides in wound healing.
