 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic>, was used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine for its hepatoprotective, immunostimulatory, diuretic, antihypertensive, and antiaging properties [

In a study by Shih-Yu et al. on the effects of cycloastragenol on wound healing, its effects on human keratinocyte cell lines, human dermal fibroblasts and murine wound healing models were studied. In vitro, cycloastragenol stimulates the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor; in addition, cycloastragenol stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, thus stimulating cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, the beneficial effect on wound healing was observed on both sterile and infected wound model; the mechanism of action underlying the in vivo therapeutic effects has been associated with the stimulation of angiogenesis in damaged tissues [

 <italic>Astragali Radix</italic>, with saponin structure, was reported to stimulate telomerase activity as well as cell proliferation in human neonatal keratinocytes [

Based on these observations, Cao et al. conducted an extensive in vitro study to observe the mechanism of action of cycloastragenol associated with wound healing; the main results can be summarized as follows: (i) cycloastragenol stimulates human epidermal stem cell proliferation and migration—EpSCs; (ii) there is an increase in reverse transcriptase telomerase expression which is involved in different types of lesions, by activating specific signals, such as NF-kappa B and autophagy; (iii) the Wnt/β-catenin signal activation, with well-known implications for organ development, stem cell growth, maintaining epithelial turnover during homeostasis and in response to injury [
