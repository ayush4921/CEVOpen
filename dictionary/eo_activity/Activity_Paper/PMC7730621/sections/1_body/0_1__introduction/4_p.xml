<p>This review summarizes the biological activities of triterpenic phytocompounds with pentacyclic and tetracyclic structure, such as lupane, ursane, oleanane, dammarane, lanostane and cycloartane derivatives in wound healing, demonstrated in extensive in vitro and in vivo studies by highlighting their molecular mechanisms of action; in addition, data collected from clinical trials conducted on these classes of purified phytocompounds or on complex vegetal extracts were reviewed in order to support their evidence-based therapeutic effect in wound healing. Also, another important aspect is an overview of the main innovative nano-formulations containing triterpenes that were demonstrated to enhance their bioavailability and effectiveness in wound management, thus being promising candidates for a new class of medicinal products of dermatological use.</p>
