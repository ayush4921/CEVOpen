<p>This review is focused on pentacyclic and tetracyclic triterpene derivatives with lupane, ursane, oleanane, dammarane, lanostane and cycloartan skeleton, summarizing both their pre-clinical evaluation by in vitro and in vivo assays (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05557-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) combined with their clinical assessement. Among these derivatives, the following phytocompounds were outlined: betulinic acid, betulin, lupeol, asiaticoside, asiatic acid, madecassoside, madecassic acid, oleanolic acid, glycyrrhizin, camellioside B, perennisosides, asterbatanoside D, bernardioside B2, bellissaponins, ginsenosides, bacosides, cycloastragenol, astragaloside IV, cyclocephaloside I and cyclocanthoside E. The main biological activities in wound healing, demonstrated in the pre-clinical assays, included accelerated healing process by antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity, promotion of angiogenesis and type I collagen synthesis, reduction of tissue edema and formation of the skin barrier. Furthermore, some of these phytocompounds induced accelerated wound contraction and closure, shortening of the re-epithelization process and finally, yet importantly, prevention of keloid formation. Many of these biological activities were validated through several clinical trials, which in addition have demonstrated their potential in improving microcirculation and vascular permeability or reducing edema. Moreover, some of these types of triterpenes show potential in dermato-cosmetology due to their ability to reduce stretch marks development, liposclerosis improvement or anti-aging effects. Nonetheless, some of the compounds showed great healing potential in more severe types of wounds, such as diabetic ulcerations, necrotic ulcerative lesions, necrotizing herpes zoster, atopic dermatitis, epidermolysis bullosa or gastro-intestinal bleedings.
