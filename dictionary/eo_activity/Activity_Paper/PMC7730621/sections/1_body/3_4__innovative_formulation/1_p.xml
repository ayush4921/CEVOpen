<p>The wound healing properties of natural products are exerted through celullar and molecular mechanisms that induce antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory effects, neovascularisation and angiogenesis, ultimately resulting in re-epithelialization and wound regeneration [

Traditionally, natural compounds are delivered to the wound site as topical applications of ointments with various lipophilic/hydrophilic compositions. However in the last decade, numerous innovative topical formulations occurred, enabling their improved efficacy and bioavailability; in addition, through specific technological interventions, such as nanoformulation, phytochemicals can be included in controlled delivery systems with enhanced permeability to more profound skin layers, thus speeding up the healing process [

 <xref rid="B150-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]; oleogels with birch bark extract are stable and can incorporate water up to 60%, thus resulting in stable w/o emulsions [

 <xref rid="B152-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Compared to oleogels, oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions with birch bark triterpenes do not induce a significant effect towards wound healing thus indicating that the oil used as vehicle has a dual effect: modulates the release of active compounds and directly influences the skin healing process [
