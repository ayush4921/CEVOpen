<p>The different regulatory approaches taken by different MS for the approval of similar NBCDs may derive from the lack of an established classification criteria for these products (i.e., describing iron oxide nanoparticles as “aqueous solutions of iron”), which would need to be harmonized accordingly to modern evaluation methodologies and standards. While the hypothesis of the creation of a “complex hybrid” concept to harmonize with the FDA has been discussed within the EU/EMA, a legal framework for those products remains to be created. Therefore, assessment differences may emerge from the individual interpretation at the national level when product approval follows non-centralized procedures.</p>
