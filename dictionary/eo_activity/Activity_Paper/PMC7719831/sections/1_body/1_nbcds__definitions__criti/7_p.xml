<p>The regulatory uncertainty related to NBCDs is a consequence of inadequately perceiving, identifying, and addressing the different layers of complexity associated with this category of medicinal products. In fact, even after regulatory approval of a different product using diverse regulatory pathways, several important issues are left open, pertaining to the major impact on decisions within their routine clinical use. Even after marketing authorization, most of these products were never assessed in an adequate comparative clinical assessment format, i.e., in complete absence of comparative clinical data on relative safety and efficacy. In most cases, no comparability studies were performed, and clinical decisions on prescription switching for patients under chronic or sub-chronic treatments are often based on biased therapeutic decisions that are not appropriately supported by clinical data. This is due to the implementation of national prescription guidelines or rulings that often inappropriately consider NBCDs as small molecule-based medicinal products, referring to INN prescription rules only. In such cases, the clinical staff, specialized MDs, and pharmacists are frequently forced to make decisions based on local constraints, not related to the availability of comparative clinical data that could otherwise shed light on safety and efficacy.</p>
