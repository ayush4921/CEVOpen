<p>Data on follow up assessments are shown in FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG4">4</xref>. Thirty-two trials had follow-up assessments. Of the 32 trials, 21 trials (66%) had telephone follow-ups. 19/32 trials (59%) had face-to-face follow-ups at a hospital, clinical or research centre. Three trials (9%) had face-to-face visits at home, and 7/32 trials (22%) were paper-based assessment (e.g. questionnaires). One trial reported using video-conferencing for follow-up assessments. Half of the trials reported that they were planning to continue to follow up activity with modified procedures (17/32 trials, 53%), whilst 4/32 trials (13%) planned to continue to follow up as planned and 4/32 trials (13%) planned to continue to follow up as without modification to the procedure, but with delayed timelines. Three trials (9%) reported a temporary halt to the follow-up activity. The remaining trials had no change to the follow-up activity either because the trial was in set up or the follow up had been completed.
