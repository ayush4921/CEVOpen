<p>To further understand and quantify this broader impact, we surveyed clinical trial teams and sought data from supporting CTUs and sponsors. We identified &gt;2000 potentially eligible trials. The response rates from clinical trials and sponsors were low and we anticipate that this may have been a different function of the pandemic.Â The majority of those that responded paused recruitment during COVID-19, but follow-up activity and IMP regimes continued mostly unchanged. This suggests that whilst recruitment activity was heavily affected, trials were mostly able to proceed or accommodate changes which allowed them to continue the trial activity for those participants enrolled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes included modification to the follow -up procedures, adjusting time scales for follow-ups and in some cases changing the logistics of the IMP to allow for home delivery to participants. Participant safety or potential benefit was the primary driver that determined the course of action taken during the pandemic.</p>
