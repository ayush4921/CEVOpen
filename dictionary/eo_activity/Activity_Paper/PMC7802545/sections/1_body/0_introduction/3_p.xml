<p>Usually, tyrosinase inhibitors are purified from plant tissues using a combined procedure consisting of solvent extraction and chromatography separation, followed by structure identification by high‐performance chromatography, mass spectrum, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The inhibition of manners could be elucidated by kinetics studies (Saeed et al.,
