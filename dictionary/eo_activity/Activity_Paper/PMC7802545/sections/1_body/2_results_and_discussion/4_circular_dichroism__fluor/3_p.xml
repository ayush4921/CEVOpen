<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> shows the fluorescence spectrum of tyrosinase presented a strong emission with maximum wavelength at 340 nm. With the addition of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE to the tyrosinase solution, the fluorescence intensity reduced progressively. According to a previous study, the microenvironment of tryptophan influences the fluorescence intensity at fluorescence emission maximum wavelength (340 nm) (Yousefi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32004-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Therefore, our result indicates that 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE reduced the fluorescence intensity without changing the microenvironment of tyrosinase.
