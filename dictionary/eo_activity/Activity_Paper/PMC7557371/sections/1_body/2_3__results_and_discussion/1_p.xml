<p>Results show that the haemoglobin levels, red blood cell (RBC) number, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) content, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), monocytes, eosinophil and platelet counts was not affected (

While MCHC estimates the amount of haemoglobin per unit volume in a single red blood cell by taking into account the volume or size of the red blood cell, MCH estimates the proportion of haemoglobin to red blood cells in a given volume of blood. White blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte count were affected by medicinal extract supplementation (
