<p>Due to their wide biological activity, medicinal plants are widely used in curative therapy involving human and animal subjects. Plant secondary metabolites were reported to regulate immune cells related to adaptive and innate immunity in challenged or non-challenged cows [

 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, a methanolic extract of Jatropha leaf at 33.62 mg/mL significantly inhibited influenza A (H1N1) virus replication without any toxicity effect on kidney cells in vitro [

While elevated WBC or lymphocyte count may be indicative of viral, fungal or bacterial infection, decreased lymphocyte levels may also indicate a state of compromised immunity such as with reduced T-helper and CD4+ T cell numbers associated with immune suppression in animals [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lymphocytes are a component of the WBC, responsible for both humoral and cellular immunity. In the study by Amirghofran et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], extracts of 
 <italic>Linum persicum</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte proliferation in humans. Contrary to the response observed for MO extract in the study by Jiwuba et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Moringa supplementation resulted in increased WBC count but had no effect on lymphocyte count in West African Dwarf goats. Equally, goats receiving 10 mL of 4% 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract solution showed a decline in WBC count but not in lymphocyte count [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, the values across the lambs were within the range of 2.1–10.2 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L in lymphocytes and 5.1–15.9 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L in WBC count, normal ranges reported by Lepherd in the literature [
