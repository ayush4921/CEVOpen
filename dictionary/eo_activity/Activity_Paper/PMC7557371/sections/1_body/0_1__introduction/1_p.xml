<p>The use of medicinal plants as dietary additives is gaining increasing research interest due to the wide biological diversity and potential beneficial effects for sustainable livestock production [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) (also called phytonutrients) inherent in these medicinal plants have been found to exhibit strong antibacterial and antifungal properties, resulting in strong antimethanogenic properties in ruminant animals among other benefits reported in different studies [

 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Equally, some medicinal plants and their extracts tend to improve nutrient digestibility in ruminant livestock [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Previous studies showed that extracts of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> (MO), 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> (JC) and 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (AV) significantly reduced in vitro methane production when supplemented to a typical ruminant diet [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moringa is reported to contain a moderate concentration of flavonoids, alkaloid and only negligible concentration of tannins [
