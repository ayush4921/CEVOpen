<p>The leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> and 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> tested as anti-methanogenic additives at 50 mg/ kg DM intake did not elicit any negative effect on the blood profile of the lambs, parameters that are indicative of the health status of the lambs. This means that their use as a dietary anti-methanogenic additive is justified.
