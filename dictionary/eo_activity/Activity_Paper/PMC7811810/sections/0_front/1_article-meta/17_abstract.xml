  <title>Objective(s):</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Ferula ovina</italic> is an Iranian medicinal plant. Tschimgine and stylosin are two of its major monoterpene derivatives. In this study, we proceeded to investigate some fungal endophytes from 
   <italic>F. ovina</italic> that can produce plant secondary metabolites.
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>The isolated endophytic fungi were fermented in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and their extracts were screened for the presence of the plant compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Endophytes identification was performed by morphological and molecular methods. Three markers (ITS, LSU, and TEF1) were used for accurate molecular identification. </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>Forty isolates from 9 different genera of endophytic fungi were identified, of which two recently reported species of 
   <italic>O. ferulica</italic> and 
   <italic>Pithoascus persicus</italic> were able to produce tschimgine and stylosin.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>These fungi can be used as a substitute for the production of plantâ€™s medicinal compounds independent of wild populations of the source plant. </p>
