<p>For field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs, briefly, small pieces of fungal isolates, including mycelia, conidiophores, and conidia, were placed on PELCO image tabs
 <sup>â„¢</sup> double-sided carbon adhesive discs (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), and coated with gold in a Q150R ES sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd, East Sussex, United Kingdom) as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Samples were analyzed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) (TESCAN BRNO-Mira3 LMU, 2014, Brno, Czech Republic) in the secondary electron imaging (SE) mode. The microscope was operated at 10 kV acceleration voltage, 1.8 kV extraction voltage, and a working distance of 4.45 mm.
