<p>The genus 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> comprises about 170 species (38), of which only endophytic fungi of three species have as yet been studied. Two recently reported endophytic fungi, namely, 
 <italic>O. ferulica</italic> and 
 <italic>P.</italic>
 <italic>persicus</italic>, have been isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>F. ovina</italic>. The results of the LCâ€“MS spectra analysis confirm that these two new species of 
 <italic>Ochroconis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pithoascus</italic> are able to produce two main plant chemical compounds. The results of the present and past research indicate the high capacity of species of this genus to identify and introduce new endophytic fungi and new metabolites.
