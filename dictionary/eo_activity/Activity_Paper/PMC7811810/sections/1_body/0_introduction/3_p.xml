<p>Some endophytes could be reliable sources of materials of the agricultural and/or pharmaceutical potential such as taxol (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), subglutinol A and B (8), and peptide leucinostatin A (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) (all of these could be produced by both endophytes and the hosts). Recently, several studies have led to the discovery of important plant secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi, thus, raising the prospect of using such organisms as alternative sources of these metabolites (
