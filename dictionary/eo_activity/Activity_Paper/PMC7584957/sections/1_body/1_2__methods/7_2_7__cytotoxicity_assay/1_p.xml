<p>The cytotoxicity assay was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MDCK cells in 96-well assay plates were treated with serial diluted extracts (two-fold diluted from 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 1.56 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 8 dilution series) and incubated at 37°C for 36 hrs. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 (MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
