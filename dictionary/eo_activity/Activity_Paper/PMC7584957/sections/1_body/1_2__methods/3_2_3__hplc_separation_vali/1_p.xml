<p>To illustrate the stability of extraction method, several active prefractionations were selected for analysis by HPLC using a SunFire-C18 TM column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>m, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) by a Waters 2695 system coupled with a Waters 2998 PDA detector. The mobile phase consisted of 0.5% formic acid water solution and acetonitrile. The flow rate was maintained at 0.8 mL·min
