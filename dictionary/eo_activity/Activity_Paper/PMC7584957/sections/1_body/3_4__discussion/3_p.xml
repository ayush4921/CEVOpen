<p>By using a HTS approach based on recombinant reporter influenza PR8-PB2-Gluc virus, the antiviral activity of each fraction against IAV was evaluated, and 10 simplified extracts were identified as anti-influenza actives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All SIs of the hits exceed 10, except with ethyl acetate fraction of Glycyrrhizic, of which the SI is 7.52 (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It could be proposed that these TCM extracts might contain bioactive components responsible for anti-influenza virus activity at nontoxic concentration, providing a promising source of natural influenza inhibitors.
