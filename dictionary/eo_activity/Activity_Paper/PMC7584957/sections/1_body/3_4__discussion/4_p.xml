<p>Interestingly, it was elucidated previously that the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic> is associated with active compounds such as resveratrol and emodin, which inhibit the replication of influenza H1N1 virus directly by inducing IFN-

 <italic>Magnolia officinalis</italic> contains polyphenolic compounds that play a protective role in influenza virus-infected mice [

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamon</italic>, 
 <italic>Areca catechu L</italic>, and 
 <italic>Spatholobus suberectus</italic> have a wide range of pharmacological activities in clinic, including influenza virus infections [

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These data on the other hand suggested the accuracy and robustness of our antiviral screening results, and the hit fractions deserve further analysis for antiviral discovery.
