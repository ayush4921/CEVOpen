<p id="Par10">Different research investigations were already carried out to establish antidiabetic potential of the plant extracts, formulated from various parts of the herb. Presence of natural compounds like flavonoids, secoiridoids makes the plant extract highly effective to prevent hyperglycemic complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To investigate antidiabetic properties, insulin secretion from monolayers of BRIN-BD11 clonal pancreatic cells was investigated by Thomson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in the influence of aquatic bark extract of 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic>. Stimulated concentration dependent insulin secretion and its enhanced action ware observed from such cell line in the presence of the extract. It was also attributed from their study that inhibition of protein glycation might help to prevent diabetic complications. Swerchirin, the most powerful xanthone isolated from the same plant extract having excellent blood sugar lowering activity and it was proved through experimental trials, being applied by different experimental models. The effects of structurally different hypoglycemic agents like tolbutamide, centpiperalone and swerchirin containing fraction (SW1), present in the same plant extract were identified using normal and diabetic rats, induced by streptozotocin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Compared to tolbutamide, SW1 exhibited improved blood glucose lowering effect in all rats except those having severe pancreatic damage. In another study, hexane extract of whole plant was evaluated for blood sugar lowering abilities by implementing CF male albino rats as experimental animal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Swerchirin, one of the most important xanthone present in the plant extract was identified to make maximum influence in insulin release and maximum reduction of blood sugar level up to 41%. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is often responsible for formation of type 2 diabetes. S
 <italic>. chirayita</italic> plant extract was specifically analysed for glucuronidase inhibitory activities to establish its hepatoprotective potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Methanolic extract was prepared from the plant leafy shoots and it was identified with glucuronidase inhibition activity with IC50 value 162.84 ± 3.72 g/ml for swerchirin along with other influencer xanthone like mangiferin. Phoboo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] clearly identified the presence of mangiferin along with two other phytochemicals swertiamarin, amarogentin and their derivatives in crude plant extract. Among those components, mangiferin exhibited glucosidase and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical inhibition activity which mainly represents anti-hyperglycemic potential of the compound. Even oral administration of mangiferin with proper combination of standard hypoglycemic drugs, metformin and gliclazide was identified to cure symptoms of renal injury due to diabetic nephropathy (DN) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. During such experimental observation, type II diabetes induced male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with 28 days medication with such specific combination of drugs and significant decline in serum biochemical markers like glucose, urea and creatinine were clearly observed. In an experimental investigation, Kshirsagar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] extracted maximum amount of important secoiridoid glycoside swertiamarin and xanthone mangiferin from the plant species by adapting different extraction methods. Among various extraction techniques like static extraction, continuous shaking extraction and ultrasonic extraction, 24 h static extraction ensured maximum recovery of swertiamarin (256.98 mg/g) and mangiferin (155.76 ± 7.78 mg/g). Presence of most valuable bioactive compound gentianine, which is also known as active metabolite of swertiamarin was clearly identified in 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> plant extract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Vaidya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] tried to investigate the role of gentianine behind anti-diabetic properties of swertiamarin. Significant improvement in adipogenesis linked expression of PPAR‐γ, GLUT‐4 and adiponectin upon gentianine treatment clearly revealed that the compound is responsible for anti‐diabetic activities of swertiamarin. Amarogentin, another important phytochemical present in all forms of the plant extract is also responsible for hypoglycemic activity. Amarogentin, which is mostly used in different forms of commercially available drugs was reported to be present 0.15% in S. 
 <italic>chirayita</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Knowing the potential of the compound, Keil et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] developed root culture of the plant species in 2-L propeller stirred tank bioreactor system and a 15-fold improvement in amarogentin content was observed in the media when Tween 20 was implemented at 1.3% (v/v) during root permeabilisation treatment. How 
 <italic>S. chirayita</italic> plant extract, containing such important phytochemicals is effective for regulated production of insulin from pancreatic β-cells of experimental model like mice is schematically represented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In an experimental trial with albino Wistar rats, Kavitha and Dattatri [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], evaluated the antidiabetic activity of S. 
 <italic>chirayita</italic> plant extract with comparison to standard oral drug glibenclamide. It was concluded that existence of mangiferin in plant stem part is mainly responsible for plants antidiabetic activity. Both crude aqueous extract and 12% ethanolic extracts of S. 
 <italic>chirayita</italic> were clinically analysed to prove hypoglycemic potential of the plant species by performing in vitro biochemical tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The study clearly revealed the existence of mostly three phytochemicals which are mangiferin, swertiamarin, amarogentin as well as their derivatives in such plant crude extract. Wan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]evaluated hypoglycemic potential of another similar 
 <italic>Swertia</italic> spp. plant extract i.e. 
 <italic>Swertia kouitchensis</italic> in different conditions. Inhibitory action of the plant extract was first tested on α-amylase and α- glucosidase activities. Streptozotocin induced (60 mg/kg) diabetic mice were used to identify the acute effect of the extract and even the analysis was also performed to identify long term effect of the extract for 4 weeks. Inhibitory activities of α-amylase, α- glucosidase were well exhibited by the plant extract and similarly, anti-hyperglycemic activities, antioxidant capacity in improved level were also expressed by the plant extract. Zheng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] clearly informed that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in improvement of obesity based insulin resistance as well as second type of diabetes. They identified strong antioxidant activity of xanthones which was extracted from 
 <italic>Swertia mussotii</italic>, another species of 
 <italic>Swertia</italic>. In order to understand the hypoglycemic potential of ethanolic extract of S. 
 <italic>chirayita</italic>, streptozotocin- nicotinamide influenced wistar albino mice (30–35 gm b/w) model was implemented by Renu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and excellent serum sugar, cholesterol as well as triglyceride reducing activity was observed during implementation of such extract. In a similar type of research investigation by Sekar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], 95% ethanolic extract and four hexane fraction extractions of 
 <italic>Swertiu chirayita</italic> were tested using albino rats for blood sugar level lowering ability. The hexane fraction showed important properties of reducing blood sugar in both fed and tolbutamide influenced models relative to the appropriate controls. In another case study, Chandrasekar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] demonstrated that hexane fractions of plant (250 mg/kg, orally administrated during 28 days) had an positive impact in lowering blood sugar level in albino rats and better insulin secretion from β-cells of pancreas. Alam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] investigated antidiabetic potential of the plant leaf ethanolic extract and different other forms of the plant extracts like petether, dichloromethane and methanoloc extracts on 
 <italic>Swiss albino</italic> mice in fasting condition. Improved hypoglycemic properties through reduction of blood glucose levels about 32% and 47.2% were respectively achieved by applying ethanolic leaf extract and pet-ether fraction. Mild to moderate hypoglycemic effect of the plant extract was identified when reductions in blood glucose level were achieved 14.1% and 15.9% respectively by applying dichloromethane and methanol fractions after 3 h of drug administration.
