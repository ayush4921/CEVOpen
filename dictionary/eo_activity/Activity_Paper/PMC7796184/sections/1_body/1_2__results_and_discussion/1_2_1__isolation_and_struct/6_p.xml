 <sup>+</sup> indicating a molecular formula C
 <sub>29</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub>O. Its IR spectrum showed a characteristic absorption band for a hydroxyl group at 3433 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and olefinic bonds at 1645 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited the signals of six methyls between δ 0.69 and 1.02, an oxymethine at δ 3.60 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 5.1, 11.0 Hz, H-3α) and olefinic protons at δ 5.02 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 9.3, 15.3 Hz, H-23), 5.15 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 9.3, 15.3 Hz, H-22) and 5.35 (m, H-6) that are characteristic for Δ
 <sup>5,22</sup>-3β-hydroxy sterols. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> displayed 29 carbon signals of which 6 signals (δ 12.06, 12.27, 18.99, 19.41, 21.08, 21.10) were assigned to 6 methyls, one signal (δ 71.83) for an oxymethine carbon and four signals (δ 121.73, 129.28, 138.34, 140.76) for the four olefinic carbons. Comparison of all these data with those described in the literature confirmed the identity of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> to be a stigmasterol [
