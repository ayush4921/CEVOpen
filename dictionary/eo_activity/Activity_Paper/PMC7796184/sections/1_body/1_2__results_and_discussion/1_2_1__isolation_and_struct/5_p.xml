<p>Compound (
 <bold>4</bold>) was obtained as white amorphous powder and its molecular formula was determined to be C
 <sub>46</sub>H
 <sub>80</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> as indicated from the molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 680 in the EIMS spectrum and from 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1730 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for ester carbonyl, 1640 and 883 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for exocyclic di-substituted double bond and 725 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for long aliphatic chain [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>4</bold> showed the characteristic signals for seven tertiary methyl groups, which are reminiscent of a lupeol-type triterpene at δ 0.79 (s, Me-28), 0.83 (s, Me-23), 0.84 (s, Me-24), 0.85 (s, Me-25), 0.98 (s, Me-27), 1.03 (s, Me-26), 1.68 (s, Me-30), together with the two geminal vinylic protons of the exocyclic methylene group at δ 4.59 (s, H-29b) and 4.70 (s, H-29a), one oxymethine proton at δ 3.60 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 11.0, 4.2 Hz), which was assigned to be H-16 and the proton of the C-3 esterified oxymethine group at δ 4.47 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 11.9, 5.1 Hz, H-3). The large coupling constants of H-3 (11.0 Hz) and H-16 (11.9 Hz) were indicative of their axial orientations. These data supported the 3β,16β-dihydroxylupeol (calenduladiol) substructure [

 <italic>J.</italic>= 6.8 Hz, H-16`) for one terminal methyl of MeCH
 <sub>2</sub>-, the broad intensive signal around δ 1.25 ppm for the (CH
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <italic>n</italic>, and the doublet triplet at δ 2.28 (
 <italic>J.</italic>= 7.6, 2.5 Hz, H-2`) for the methylene protons attached to a carbonyl function. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>4</bold> exhibiting features characteristic of the lup-20(29)-ene skeleton; two oxygenated methine carbons at δ 77.09 (C-16) and δ 80.55 (C-3), one sp
 <sup>2</sup> methylene carbon at δ 109.85 (C-29) and one olefinic quaternary carbon at δ 149.98 (C-20). These 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR data confirmed the calenduladiol substructure of 
 <bold>4</bold> [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The presence of a fatty acid was supported by the appearance of 
 <sup>13</sup>C-signals due to an ester carbonyl group at δ 173.76 (C-1`), a long chain of methylene groups at δ 29.18-29.71, and a terminal methyl at δ 14.14 (C-16`). The downfield shift of H-3 (δ 4.47) and C-3 (δ 80.55) signals in 
 <bold>4</bold> compared to the corresponding signals in calenduladiol (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 3.17, δ
 <sub>C</sub> 79.3) revealed the attachment of the fatty acid at C-3. On the basis of the above spectral data, the structure of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was identified as calenduladiol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-palmitate on the basis of the comparison of its physical and spectroscopic data to those described in the literature [
