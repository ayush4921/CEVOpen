<p>UV spectra measurements were obtained with a Shimadzu UV-1650PC spectrophotometer; IR spectra were determined with a Shimadzu Infrared-400 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR measurements were carried out on Bruker Avance DRX-850 MHz (for 
 <sup>1</sup>H) and 212.5 MHz (for 
 <sup>13</sup>C) (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA, USA) in

 </italic> solution, and chemical shifts were expressed in Î´ (ppm) with reference to TMS, and coupling constant (
 <italic>J.</italic>) in Hertz. ESIMS was carried out on Advion compact mass spectrometer (CMS, Ithaca, NY, USA). EIMS was carried on Scan EIMS-TIC, VG-ZAB-HF, X-mass (158.64, 800.00) mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, Inc. Manchester, UK). Open column chromatography was performed on normal-phase Si gel (Si gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Normal-phase and reversed-phase (SPE-C
 <sub>18</sub>) cartridges (Strata columns) was used for solid phase extraction. TLC was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) plates. Developed chromatograms were visualized by spraying with 1% vanillin-H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, followed by heating at 100 for 5 min.
