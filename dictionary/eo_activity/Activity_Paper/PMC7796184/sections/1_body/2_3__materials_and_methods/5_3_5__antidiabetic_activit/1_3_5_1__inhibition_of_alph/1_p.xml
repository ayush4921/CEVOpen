<p>According to the reported method [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], mixtures consists of 1 mL of phosphate buffer (0.20 mM, pH 6.9) containing 0.5 mg/mL of α-amylase and 1 mL of the total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts or standard acarbose in a concentration range of 7.81–1000 μg/mL were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. One percent of starch solution (1 mL) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) was added to the mixtures and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (2 mL) was added and the mixtures were then incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After cooling, 10 mL of distilled water was added to the mixtures. A control test was conducted in a similar manner without test samples. The absorbance was then recorded at 565 nm and the percentage inhibition of amylase was calculated from equation: 
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = (1−A1/A2) × 100
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where, A1 = Absorbance of test, A2 = absorbance of control [
