<p>α-Glucosidase inhibitory activity of the alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts was determined by the method of Shai et al. with minor modification [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In 96-well microtitre plates 20 μL of varying concentrations of test samples or acarbose (7.81–1000 μg/mL) were mixed with of phosphate buffer (5 μL of 100 mM, pH 6.8) and α-glucosidase (10 μL of 1 U/mL) (
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Sigma Aldrich, Bangalore, India) and preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Then, 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (20 μL of 5.0 mM) was added to the mixtures and incubated further for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (50 μL of 1 M). Absorbance was recorded at 405 nm to determine the 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol amount released from the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture without test samples was used as a control where alpha glucosidase enzyme percentage inhibition was calculated from using following equation: 
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = (1−A1/A2) × 100
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where, A1 = Absorbance of test, A2 = absorbance of control [
