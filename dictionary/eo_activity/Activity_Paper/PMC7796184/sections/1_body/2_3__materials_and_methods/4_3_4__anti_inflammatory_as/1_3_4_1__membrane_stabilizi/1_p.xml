<p>The method was conducted according to the literature [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Erythrocyte suspension was prepared by withdrawing blood samples from rats with heparinized syringes through cardiac puncture. Then, phosphate buffer was used to wash blood samples three times with centrifugation after each washing at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts in concentrations of 7.81–1000 µg/mL or standard indomethacin were mixed with 0.5 mL of the stock red blood cells (RBCs) suspension and 5 mL of the hypotonic solution consists of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM) and NaCl (50 mM) adjusted to pH 7.4. Control samples were prepared by similar manner without extracts or indomethacin. Afterward, previous mixtures were withstanding for 10 min in room condition and subjected to 10 min centrifugation at 3000 rpm. Then absorbance was measured for the supernatant at 540 nm and the hemolysis percentage inhibition was calculated from the following equation: 
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition of hemolysis = {A1-A2/A1} × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A1 = Absorbance obtained from blank sample, A2 = Absorbance obtained from blank sample test sample.
