<p>Histamine release effect of total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts was measured on U937 human monocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). In accordance with literature [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], extracts or standard diclofenac (7.81–1000 μg/mL) were added to U937 cells seeded in a 96-well plate in a concentration of 50,000 in presence or absence of 20 nM Phorbol Myristate Acetate. After 1 h, the treated and untreated cell cultures supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Then the samples were evaluated for released histamine by a commercially available EIA kit (SPI-Bio, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). The inhibition in the histamine release was calculated from the following equation:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = (1 − A1/A2) ×100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where, A1 = Absorbance of test, A2 = absorbance of control.
