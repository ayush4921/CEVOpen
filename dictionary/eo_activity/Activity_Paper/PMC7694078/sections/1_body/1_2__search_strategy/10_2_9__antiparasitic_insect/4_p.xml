<p>Mānuka seed oil appears to be effective against house dust (
 <italic>D. farina</italic> and 
 <italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic>) and stored product mites (
 <italic>Tyrophagus putrescentiae</italic>), with a LD
 <sub>50</sub> (dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration) values of 0.54, 0.67 and 1.21 µg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively, against the stated parasites; these values are 11.5–68.7 times more effective than DEET (
 <italic>N,N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), a common chemical treatment to control these mites [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further analysis of the major components of mānuka seed oil indicated the main triketone, leptospermone, to be the most active component of mānuka oil in this study, with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.07–0.15 ug/cm
 <sup>2</sup> against 
 <italic>D. farina, D. pteronyssinus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. putrescentiae</italic>; these values represent 92.6–530.3 times the toxicity of DEET against the same organisms [
