<p>Experiments to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of mānuka oil found that THP-1 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and co-treated with 0.1–10% mānuka oil had significantly reduced release of TNF-α but there was no significant effect on the release of IL-4 [

This study found no cellular toxicity at an oil concentration of 10%, which contrasts with the results discussed in the toxicity section earlier. The diluent used in the study by Chen et al. was not specified and this discrepancy could be a result of diluting the lipophilic mānuka oil in aqueous cell culture media. Lis-Balchin et al. (2000) also showed the antioxidant effects of mānuka oil from the North- and South-islands of New Zealand were more consistent in comparison to kanuka oil [
