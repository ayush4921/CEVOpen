<p>The efficacy of mānuka oil is both dose- and time-dependent. Treatment with a 10% solution of mānuka oil in DMSO was equally effective as the same concentration of kanuka oil against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sobrinus and Staphylococcus mutans</italic> (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) = 0.048% (480 µg/mL); the highest dilution at which no growth was observed) [

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00343-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A time to kill assay against the same strains showed 100% inhibition on treatment with either 10% mānuka oil or kanuka oil required as low as 5 s and as high as 900 s [

 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> strains and 0.25% against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> [
