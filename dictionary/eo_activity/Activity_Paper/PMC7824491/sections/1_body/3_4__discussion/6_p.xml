<p>Nitrogenous products such as urea, uric acid and creatinine are useful indicators for evaluating the state of the kidney and gills of fish. Among all of these, creatinine is most important as it represents more than 50% of nitrogenous waste excreted through the fish kidney [

 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) supplemented diets has decreased serum urea and creatinine levels in 
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic> juveniles for 45 days [

The hepatic-nephric beneficial effects of black seed were further confirmed by regular liver and kidney histoarchitecture of rohu fed supplemented diets in similar with un-supplemented ones. The bioactive ingredients (carvacrol, Î±-tocopherol, thymoquinone and nigellicine) abundantly found in black seed are ascribed to scavenge ROS, thereby maintaining normal histoarchitecture and metabolic enzymes levels [
