<p>The effects of black seed supplemented diets on the growth performance of rohu fingerlings are presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00048-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results indicated that dietary inclusion of different levels of black seed has positive effects on the growth rate of rohu throughout the study period. A significant increase in %WG and SGR was found for rohu fed black seed supplemented diets in comparison with un-supplemented ones at each sampling day. The results also indicated that group-3 rohu (fed with 2.5% black seed supplemented diet) has statistically higher % ADWG and PER when compared with other groups throughout the study period. The CF and HSI index of black seed fed rohu was found in similar with un-supplemented ones. The fish survival rate was 100% for all the studied groups (
