<p>The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was estimated by recording the change in absorbance of reaction mixture (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mM EDTA, sodium azide, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 2 mM NADPH, 0.09 M H

 <sub>2</sub>, 1 IU/mL glutathione reductase and 10% PMS) at 340 nm and values were expressed as nmoles of NADPH oxidized/minute/mg of protein. The reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were determined by recording absorbance of reaction mixture (0.1 M phosphate buffer (1 mL), 10 Mm DTNB (1 mL) and 1 mL of PMS) at 412 nm and values were expressed as nmol GSH/gram of tissue. The protein contents were estimated using Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard [
