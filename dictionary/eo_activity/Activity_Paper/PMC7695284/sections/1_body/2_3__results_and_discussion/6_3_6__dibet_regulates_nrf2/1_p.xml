<p>MAPKs act as a downstream effector in antioxidant responses. The activation of MAPKs can manifest the activation of Nrf2. In-vitro and in-vivo studies have revealed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38 MAPK positively regulate ARE-containing reporter or detoxifying genes via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, ERK1/2 was phosphorylated from 15 to 180 min and peaked at 30 min after DIBEt exposure, whereas p38 and JNK phosphorylation was absent in DIBEt-treated cells. Furthermore, to confirm the role of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus and induction of HO-1 expression, U0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2, was used in DIBEt-treated cells. As expected, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f005">Figure 5</xref>B, Nrf2 nuclear translocation and subsequently HO-1 expression were successfully enhanced in DIBEt-treated cells, which were strongly mitigated in U0126-treated cells, suggesting that ERK activation plays a critical role in DIBEt-induced Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus and subsequent boost of HO-1 expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, according to previous reports, dietary antioxidants can cause MAPK activation accountable for cell protection against oxidative stress [
