<p>Three phenolic acids (3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid, 2-caffeoylisocitric acid, and 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylhydroxycitric acid) and seven flavonoids (naringenin, kaempferol, 5,7-dimethoxyapigenin, 6,7,3′-trihydroxy-2′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan (bryaflavan), formononetin 7-glucoronide, amoradinin, and mallotus B (isoallorottlerin), along with the Na and K adducts of glucose) were identified. Twelve nitrogen compounds [γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 
 <italic>N</italic>-isopropylhydrazinecarboxamide, hydroxymethylserine, triethanolamine, 5-acetyl-2,4-dimethylthiazole, dialanine, 4-methylthiazole-5-propionic acid, L-α-aminosuberic acid, 1,3-bis(carbamoylcarbamoyl)urea (carbonyldibiuret), linamarin, 2-(glucosyloxy)isobutyraldoxime, and 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-3,5,11,18-tetrahydroxyoctadecyl-2-amine] were also confirmed. One fatty acid (11-dodecenoic acid) and one triterpenoid (nutriacholic acid) were confirmed for the first time in this genus (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01099">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Seven flavonoids [naringenin (17), kaempferol (18), 5,7-dimethoxyapigenin (19), 6,7,3′-trihydroxy-2′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan (20), formononetin 7-glucoronide (25), amoradinin (26), and mallotus B (27)] were also confirmed. Naringenin and kaempferol yielded a major fragment ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 153.01 and 119.05 and/or 121.02 due to 
 <sup>1,3</sup>A and 
 <sup>0,2</sup>B fragmentation, respectively. Polyphenolics also produced at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> (M + H-44 u) and (M + H-18 u) by losing CO
 <sub>2</sub> and water molecules, respectively, in positive-ion mode due to the abundance of carboxyl or hydroxyl groups. The detailed fragmentation patterns are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01099">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. Furthermore, peaks 9, 21, and 22 were confirmed as 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, 2-caffeoylisocitric acid, and 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylhydroxycitric acid with the parent ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 185.0445, 355.0697, and 371.0754, respectively (fragmentation patterns in
