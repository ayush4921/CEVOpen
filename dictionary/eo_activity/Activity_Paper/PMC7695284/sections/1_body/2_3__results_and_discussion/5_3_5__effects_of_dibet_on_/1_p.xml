<p>An important transcription factor, Nrf2, binds to the ARE in the promoter regions of cytoprotective genes and acts as a master regulator of antioxidative responses [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, immunoblotting was performed to evaluate the role of DIBEt on Nrf2 regulation. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f004">Figure 4</xref>E, the nuclear Nrf2 content was markedly increased in association with decreased cyto-Nrf2 levels after DIBEt treatment. Furthermore, brusatol, a pharmacological inhibitor of Nrf2, was used to confirm the role of DIBEt on the activation of phase II detoxifying enzymes through Nrf2 regulation. Nrf2 protein levels were greatly diminished by brusatol treatment, which was not reestablished despite the application of DIBEt and naringenin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). Furthermore, DIBEt and naringenin treatment was also unable to restore the basal HO-1 protein levels in brusatol-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). This observation conferred that DIBEt might disrupt the proteasomal degradation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm by Keap1 and facilitate Nrf2 nuclear translocation, resulting in the up-regulation of HO-1 expression. Studies revealed that extracts from various medicinal plants or foods, such as 
 <italic>Nymphaea nouchali</italic> flowers, 
 <italic>Lannea coromandelica</italic> bark, and 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> bark, can activate Nrf2-mediated phase II enzyme expression in RAW 264.7, Hepa-1c1c7, and Hep G2 cells [

 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, naringenin, kaempferol, apigenin, and formononetin aglycone and their glycosidic form can modulate the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 signaling cascade, leading to the attenuation of oxidative stress-mediated melanocytes and kidney and neuronal death [
