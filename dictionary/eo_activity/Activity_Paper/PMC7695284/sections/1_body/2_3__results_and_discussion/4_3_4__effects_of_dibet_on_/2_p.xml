<p>Studies revealed that medicinal plants or foods possess abundant polyphenolic compounds that boost SOD1, CAT, and GPx activities, decreasing oxidative stress [

Evidence showed that polyphenolic acids, such as naringenin, kaempferol, apigenin, and formononetin aglycone, and their glycosidic form and caffeoylisocitric acid have a potential to boost first-line antioxidant proteins, leading to cell protection against oxidative stress [

Therefore, the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids in DIBEt may play a major role in boosting the expression of first-line antioxidant enzymes/proteins as the principal mechanism accounting for protecting DIBEt against oxidative stress.
