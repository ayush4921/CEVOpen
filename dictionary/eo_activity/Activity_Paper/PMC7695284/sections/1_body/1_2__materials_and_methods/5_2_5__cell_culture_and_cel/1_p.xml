<p>RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and streptomycin-penicillin (100 µg/mL each; Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) for 24 h and subsequently treated with DIBEt (1–100 µg/mL) for the next 24 h. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as described previously [
