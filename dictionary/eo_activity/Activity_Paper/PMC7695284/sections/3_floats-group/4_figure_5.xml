   <bold>DIBEt facilitates Nrf2 translocation by activating ERK1/2.</bold> RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with DIBEt (10 µg/mL) at the indicated times. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate kinase activity (
   <bold>A</bold>). Cells were treated with DIBEt in the presence and absence of the specific inhibitor U0126. The protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were analyzed by Western blot (
   <bold>B</bold>). Mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). #
