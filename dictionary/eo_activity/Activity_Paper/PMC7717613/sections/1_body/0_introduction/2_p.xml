<p>Phytochemical analysis has been conducted to analyse chemical constituents of

 </xref>. However, there is little or no information about the content of xanthones such as α-mangostin in other parts of mangosteen tree. The variation in xanthone content in extracts prepared using different extraction solvents (organic or aqueous) also remained unknown. Therefore, developing more powerful analytical tools and methods for the simultaneous and systematic quantification of xanthones in different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> is of great interest. Liquid chromatography-quadrupole of flight tandem mass spectrometric (LC-QTOF-MS) allows the generation of mass information with greater accuracy and precision and has been used to determine the molecular formula at low part per million concentrations.
