<p>In the present study, we sought to delineate xanthone content in the different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> with their cholinesterase activities. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed that the total xanthone content was significantly correlated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> for AChE (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.780, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and BChE (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.585, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Specifically, a stronger correlation was detected between xanthone content and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AChE than IC
 <sub>50</sub> of BChE (
