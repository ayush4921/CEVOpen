<p>The relative distribution of the xanthones in the methanol extracts showed that α-mangostin was abundant in the pericarp (403.9 mg/g extract), calyx (221.0 mg/g extract), bark (209.7 mg/g extract) and stalk (56.9 mg/g extract). On the other hand, 8-deoxygartanin was abundant in the stalk (19.5 mg/g extract) and leaves (5.4 mg/g extract), whereas, 3-isomangostin was abundant in the aril (3.4 mg/g extract). The distribution of garcinone C was relatively smaller compared with other xanthones. On the contrary, the relative distribution of the xanthones in aqueous extract showed that 3-isomangostin was abundant among the xanthones in all parts of the plant.</p>
