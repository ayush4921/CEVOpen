<p>In contrast to the methanol extract, the aqueous extract displayed moderate to poor inhibitory activities against both AChE and BChE. Aqueous extracts of the pericarp and stalk showed moderate inhibitory potency towards AChE, while aqueous extracts of the pericarp and leaves extract demonstrated moderate inhibitory activities against BChE. Our results show that the preicarp extracts from two different extraction solvents exhibit inhibitory activities against both AChE and BChE. In line with the vast differences in cholinesterase inhibitory activities between the extracts from two extraction solvent systems, further analyses were carried out to determine the relationship between xanthone content with the cholinesterase inhibitory activities.</p>
