    "Bioactive compounds derived from plants and microbial sources are required for the survival of the human race and groundbreaking research must continue in this line. Plants and microbes are the major sources of naturally occurring bioactive compounds for numerous biotechnological applications. Recent progress in the fields of bioactive compounds and soil chemistry in agriculture has since given man a lead to the discovery of potent drugs that combat both human and plant diseases. The soil provides the medium for the growth of medicinal plants, but its contamination greatly affects the quality of drugs, food crops, and other essential elements present in the plants which give strength to the body. This area has attracted the attention of scientists and the drug industry toward developing more potent drugs from medicinal plants grown in different soil. The studies of the effect of various parameters and the properties of soil such as; effect of heavy metals, pH, soil organic matter, and phytoremediation process have given a measure of some quality dependence of the soil producing secondary metabolites and soil containing microbes. The information provided will be useful in determine the action of microbes and their interaction with the soil and all true plants producing drugs. Some active compounds in plants and microbes, their properties, and applications have been described in this review. The soil microbes, activities and their interactions, effects of soil particle size, dispersibility and stability of microbes in the soil, and the future outlook for the development of novel active compounds have been reported."
