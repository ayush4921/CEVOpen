<p id="Par31">Determination of the free-radical-scavenging activity, total reducing power, and total antioxidant capacity, and phytochemical (total phenolics and flavonoids) analyses of methanol and chloroform extracts of leaves and stems of 
 <italic>Monotheca buxifolia</italic> were performed. Phytochemical analysis was also extended using UHPLC–MS and HPLC–PDA for untargeted and targeted metabolites. Clinically important enzyme-inhibitory assays were also performed. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that the methanol and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> leaves and stems contained a significant amount of phenolics and flavonoids. The amount of total phenolic content was higher in the methanol extract of leaves (69.84 mg GAE/g extract) and stems (91.00 mg GAE/g extract) as compared to the chloroform extract. The leaves had a significant amount of flavonoids in both methanol (40.11 mg RE/g) and chloroform (48.86 mg RE/g) extracts.
