<p>Phylogenetic analysis suggested that 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> was closely clustered with 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus gracilistylus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), which was generated based on the 18 complete chloroplast genomes using maximum likelihood method by RaxML software (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) using the GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model. The chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> will provide useful genetic information for further study on molecular breeding and genetic engineering.
