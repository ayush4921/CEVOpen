<p>For each of the 4 taxa examined, a minimum quantity of 1000 g of basal rosettes was collected and, afterwards, in the laboratory, a cleaning and separation of the edible leaves was performed manually to obtain a minimum quantity of 200 g of leaves. These were washed several times with distilled water in order to ensure the elimination of any type of residue. Finally, they were placed on absorbent paper and gently dabbed several times, so as to eliminate as much water as possible and thus avoid problems of contamination.</p>
