<p>For the carotenoid determination, the spectrophotometric analysis was carried out after extraction [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The analyses were carried out in darkness to prevent carotenoid degradation and isomerisation. Before chemical extraction, leaves were homogenised in a blender and an aliquot of 5 g of the sample was weighed into a 50 mL amber coloured flask wrapped with aluminium foil. Then, 100 mL of the solvent mix (hexane/acetone/methanol 2:1:1
