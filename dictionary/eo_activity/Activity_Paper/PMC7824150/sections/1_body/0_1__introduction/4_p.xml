<p>The consumption of wild plants represents a key part of the Mediterranean diet, recently recognized by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO (UNESCO) as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (UNESCO). Although several plants of 
 <italic>Hyoseris</italic> and 
 <italic>Hypochaeris</italic> species have been consumed daily for centuries, there is still no in-depth study on their micronutrient content and health properties after preparation prior to consumption. In the food industry and at a domestic level, blanching is a pretreatment largely used to inactivate enzyme activity, which can affect micronutrient content and preserve vegetables [
