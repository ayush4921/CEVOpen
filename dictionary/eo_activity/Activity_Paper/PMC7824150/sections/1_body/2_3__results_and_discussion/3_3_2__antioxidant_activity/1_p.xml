 <italic>H. radiata</italic> (HRA), and 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic> (HT) fresh and blanched leaves were assessed employing in vitro methods: Î²-carotene bleaching, FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH tests. The resulting blanching water was also screened. To our knowledge this is the first report to evaluate the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>H. laevigata</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic> leaves, both fresh and processed. Generally, the following antioxidant trend was observed fresh samples &gt; blanching water &gt; blanched samples (
