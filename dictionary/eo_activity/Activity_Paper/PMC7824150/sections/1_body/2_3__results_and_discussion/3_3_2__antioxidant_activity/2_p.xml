<p>A great variability of results was observed in the β-carotene bleaching test. In this assay, the presence of antioxidant compounds minimized the oxidation of β-carotene by hydro-peroxides, which were counteracted by bioactive compounds in the extract. In the present study, both 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> and 
 <italic>H. laevigata</italic> fresh leaves exerted a greater activity than the other investigated species (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = of 46.7 and 54.6 μg/mL after 30 min of incubation, respectively). Blanched samples were less active with a percentage of inhibition of 39.6% and 48.1% at maximum concentration tested (100 μg/mL). A low activity was observed, also with HT1 sample (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 84.7 and 99.1 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively).
