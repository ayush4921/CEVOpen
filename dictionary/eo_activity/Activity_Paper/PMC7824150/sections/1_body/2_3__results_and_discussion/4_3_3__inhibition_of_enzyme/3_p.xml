<p>Among our investigated samples, only 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> had been previously investigated for its hypoglycaemic activity. However, our data disagree with Ko et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], who did not find α-glucosidase inhibitory activity at the maximum concentration tested of 1000 μg/mL. Probably, this lack of activity was due the relatively low content of TPC and TFC found by the authors.
