<p>The concentration of total polyphenols and flavonoids was shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00032-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Phenolic compounds are known to be responsible for the antioxidant activity of the food matrix. All fresh samples were characterized by a high TPC content. Leaves of

 <italic>radicata</italic>) and 
 <italic>hyoseris</italic> (
 <italic>radiata</italic> e

 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The aqueous extract of fresh 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> showed the highest TPC value of 1103.6 mg GAE/100 g FW followed by 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic> (997.6 mg GAE/100 g FW) (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00032-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Fresh 
 <italic>H. radiata</italic> leaves (HRA1) showed the highest TFC with a value of 855.6 mg QE/100 g FW. It is interesting to note that the blanching process significantly affects both TPC and TFC and that the water in which the leaves are cooked retained a great amount of these bioactive phytochemicals.
