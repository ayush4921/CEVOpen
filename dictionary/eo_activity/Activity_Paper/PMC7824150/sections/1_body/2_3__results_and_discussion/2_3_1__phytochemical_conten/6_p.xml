<p>Medina et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] compared infusions obtained from samples at various degrees of fragmentation. Levels of oleuropein were found to be 103 mg/kg in an infusion from a whole sample used as control, and 466 mg/kg in another sample passed through a blender and subsequently an Ultra-Turrax. The greater the degree of leaf fragmentation, the greater the quantities of phenols in the infusions. The total flavonoid content dropped significantly (

This may be due to the fact that after boiling there was a greater availability of flavonoids, and a more efficient extraction from the softened cell walls [
