<p>The TPC of the callus was determined by a method described by Osman et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] with minor modification. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus (1 mg/mL) as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot4-plants-09-01772">Section 4.4</xref> was used for the analysis. The 0.5 mL of the sample was mixed with 2.5 mL of 10% Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent and 2.5 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate (NaCO
 <sub>3</sub>). The sample was incubated at room temperature for 90 min. The absorbance of the sample was determined using a spectrophotometer at 765 nm. The sample was prepared in triplicate, and the mean value of absorbance was obtained. The same procedure was repeated for the standard solution of gallic acid. The TPC was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent per gram fresh weight (mg GAE/g FW).
