 <italic>P. bullata</italic> plants were obtained from Herbal Nursery located at Pahang, Malaysia. The plants were then acclimatized in a greenhouse located at Universiti Putra Malaysia under ambient temperature for a month prior to analysis. The verification of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> plants was done by Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). The plant identification number was given as PID 170820-13. The young 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> leaf with midrib, aged 2 months, was surface sterilized and aseptically cut into small pieces approximately 0.5 Ã— 0.5 cm (leaf) and 0.3 cm (midrib). Both were cultured on MS [
