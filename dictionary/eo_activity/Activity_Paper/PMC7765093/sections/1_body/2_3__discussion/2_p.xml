<p>In the present study, auxin herbicide picloram was the best auxin to induce callus due to toxicity effects of other auxins towards the plant cell. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Moura et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported similar studies, in which picloram showed a better callus induction in 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus grandis</italic> x 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic>. In contrast, a study by Binte Mostafiz and Wagiran [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that picloram displayed the lowest callus induction percentage compared to dicamba and 2,4-D in Indica rice MR219. A study by Akram and Aftab [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that the addition of picloram into the culture medium failed to induce callus from 
 <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> L.
