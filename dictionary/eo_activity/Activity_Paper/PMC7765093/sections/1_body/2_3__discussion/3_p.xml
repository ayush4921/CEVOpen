<p>All explants cultured on MSO and WPMO failed to induce callus both in light and dark conditions. This finding further strengthens the positive effects of auxins towards callus induction of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>. The present study showed wounding followed by incubation of explants on high concentrations of auxin helped in the formation of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus suggesting the involvement of regulatory cascades and pathways from the auxin-based route and the wound-induced route. The results obtained from this study were in accordance with the earlier reports by Osman et al. [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], where no callus was induced from 
 <italic>Barringtonia racemosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Genipa</italic> sp. explants cultured on MSO and WPMO media. In addition, the MSO medium failed to induce callus from 
 <italic>Sargassum polycystum</italic> explants [
