<p>Between the different media tested, WPM medium was found to be the best basal medium to induce callus of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>. The differences in the content of macronutrients and micronutrients presented in the MS and WPM media might influence the induction of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus. A study by Osman et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that the nutrient compositions in the culture medium might affect the responses of explants towards the formation of callus. There are certain nutrients present in WPM medium but not in the MS medium such as potassium sulfate, ferrous sulphate heptahydrate, and calcium nitrate that might be directly involved in callus induction of woody plants like 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>. Moreover, there is also a great difference in the amount of nutrients available in MS medium such as ammonium nitrate and calcium chloride (1650 mg/L and 440 mg/L, respectively) compared to that of WPM medium (400 mg/L and 72.5 mg/L, respectively). The high concentration of ammonium salts in the MS medium might influence the formation of callus in 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic>. This has been proved by Behbahani et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] where they found that the high concentration of ammonium salt could slow the callus formation since the ammonium salt can act as a growth inhibitor for plant tissue.
