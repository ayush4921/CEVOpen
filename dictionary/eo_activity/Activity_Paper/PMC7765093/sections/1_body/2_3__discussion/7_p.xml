<p>The callus growth curve provides quantitative data to identify the stages or phases of callus growth. The curve is important to determine the best time to subculture the callus into a new medium [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. There are several stages of plant development which are lag, exponential, linear, stationary, and decreasing phases [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The lag phase indicates the starting of metabolite and protein mobilization. Meanwhile, the exponential phase shows the maximum cellular division. The callus needs to be transferred into a new medium due to the depletion of nutrients, agar dryness, as well as accumulation of toxic substances. Meanwhile, at the stationary phase, no weight increase of culture occurs, but the maximum accumulation of secondary metabolites occurs. Cellular death happens during the decline phase [
