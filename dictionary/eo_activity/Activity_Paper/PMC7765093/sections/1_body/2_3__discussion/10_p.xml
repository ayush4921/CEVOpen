<p>The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value was defined as the antioxidant concentration required in obtaining a 50% radical inhibition [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In this study, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained for callus extract was at 85.59 ± 6.09 µg/mL, which is significantly higher as compared to ascorbic acid (32.16 ± 0.29 µg/mL). According to Olugbami et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the lower the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the higher the antioxidant activity of the extract. The higher EC
 <sub>50</sub> was also found in methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. pratense</italic> callus (128.42 ± 2.40 µg/mL) as compared to a standard ascorbic acid (21.17 ± 0.76 µg/mL) [

 <sub>50</sub> value in callus extract of 
 <italic>Asystasia gangetica</italic> (65.775 ± 2.302 µg/mL) as compared to ascorbic acid (4.2096 ±.0891µg/mL).
