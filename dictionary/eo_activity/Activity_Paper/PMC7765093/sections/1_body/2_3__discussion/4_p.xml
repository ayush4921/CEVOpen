<p>Explants from 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> midrib were better at inducing callus compared to the leaf explants cultured at abaxial and adaxial positions. It suggests different cellular dedifferentiation capability between the two explants in producing callus [

 <italic>Argania spinosa</italic> midribs in callus induction, respectively.
