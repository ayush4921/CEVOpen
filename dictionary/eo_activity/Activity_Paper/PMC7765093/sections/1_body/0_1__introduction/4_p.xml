<p>Auxins play a vital role in plant growth, cell expansion, cell division, and cell differentiation [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Auxins exist either as natural or synthetic analogs, which are frequently used in agriculture for plant development and improvement. Natural auxins like indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), phenyl acetic acid (PAA), and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) are synthesized from plants or bacteria [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (dicamba), and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) are synthetic auxins that have an ability to act as natural auxins [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 2,4-D has been recognized as an auxinic compound, and it has been reported to successfully induce callus formation in various plant species due to its ability to activate the cell division process in plants. Other auxins like picloram can activate the stress response that promotes cell dedifferentiation and induces callus formation when applied at high concentration [
