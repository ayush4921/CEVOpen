<p>The morphology of callus cultured on MS and WPM medium supplemented with auxins is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Compact callus was produced from callus grown on MSO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) and WPMO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>h). Friable callus was produced from MS + 50 µM IBA- (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>f), and MS + 30 µM dicamba-treated callus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>g). Meanwhile, MS + 40 µM NAA- (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), MS + 20 µM IAA- (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>d), and MS + 30 µM 2,4-D-treated callus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01772-f003">Figure 3</xref>e) produced mixed callus (friable and compact callus). The production of mixed callus was also observed from callus grown on WPM + auxins (
