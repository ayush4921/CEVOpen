<p>Different morphological types of callus were obtained from leaf and midrib explants cultured on MS and WPM media supplemented with different types and concentrations of auxins. In terms of callus morphology, the callus induced from explants cultured on media supplemented with picloram and NAA produced friable callus while explants cultured on media supplemented with 2,4-D showed compact callus.</p>
