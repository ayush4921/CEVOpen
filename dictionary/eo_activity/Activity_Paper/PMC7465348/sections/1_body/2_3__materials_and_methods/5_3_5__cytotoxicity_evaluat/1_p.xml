<p>Human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured as recommended. Cell growth inhibition was determined by an MTS assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates containing the growth medium. After 24 h of culture, samples were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, France), and added to the cells (at 1 and 10 μM final concentrations). After 72 h of incubation, the reagent was added, and the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a plate reader. Cell viability was evaluated in comparison with untreated control cultures. Docetaxel (Taxotère) was used as positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.5 nM). All assays were conducted in triplicate.
