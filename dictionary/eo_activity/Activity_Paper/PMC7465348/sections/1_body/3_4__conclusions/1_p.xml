<p>Chemical investigation of the ethyl acetate extraction of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> leaves led to the first report of the known compounds Aspidin BB (
 <bold>1</bold>), ursolic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>) and oleanic acid (
 <bold>4</bold>) in this plant. We also reported the presence of Aspidin VB (
 <bold>2</bold>), an acylphloroglucinol derivative never before described. The structure of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was determined by X-ray and NMR analyses. Aspidin VB (
 <bold>2</bold>) exhibited very strong activity against bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MRSA and showed no toxicity at 10
 <sup>âˆ’5</sup> M in an MRC5 cell line. The two acylphloroglucinols compounds, 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, seem to be responsible for the antibacterial activity identified in the crude extract. Due to the biological activities of Aspidin VB, the antibacterial potency of 
 <bold>2</bold> will be evaluated against different resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains and additional pathogenic bacteria. This study further demonstrates the importance of phytochemical studies on medicinal plants from Reunion Island, which are largely unexplored.
