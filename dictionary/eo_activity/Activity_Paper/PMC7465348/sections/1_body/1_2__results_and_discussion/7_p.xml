<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> exhibited antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MRSA higher than the positive control, with MICs of 0.25 μg/mL for 
 <bold>2</bold> and 2 and 1 μg/mL for 
 <bold>1</bold>, respectively, against these two pathogens. Our results indicated that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> has the same MIC as oxacillin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and was 16-fold more potent than the standard antibiotic vancomycin against MRSA. Interestingly, Aspidin VB (
 <bold>2</bold>) showed higher activity than compound 
 <bold>1</bold> against both bacteria. Furthermore, no cytotoxicity was observed for compound 
 <bold>2</bold> at concentrations up to 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03565-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In our assays, Aspidin VB (
 <bold>2</bold>) was more active against MRSA and slightly less toxic than 
 <bold>1</bold>, which is known to exhibit no toxicity when 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was killed [
