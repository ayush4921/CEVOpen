 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> Baill. is a dioecious glabrous flowering plant classified as a member of the Myrtaceae family and is a unique species of the genus 
 <italic>Psiloxylon</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> is endemic to Reunion Island and Mauritius and used there as a medicinal plant for the treatment of common infectious and inflammatory diseases, hypercholesterolemia, gout, dysentery and to alleviate symptoms of amenorrhea [

 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> were listed in the French pharmacopoeia and constitute one of the best-selling medicinal plants on Reunion Island. Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> have also demonstrated antiviral activity against strains of Zika and Dengue viruses in vitro, without exhibiting genotoxic effects, in several mammalian cell types [

 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> was found to harbor antioxidant activity and showed antimicrobial activity, with an MIC of 51 Î¼g/mL recorded against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Through bioassay guided fractionation, this anti-staphylococcal activity was linked to the presence of corosolic and asiatic acids [

Despite its promising biological activities and a large consumption of the leaf infusions by Reunionese people, very few phytochemical studies were found in the literature, and to date, only the two pentacyclic triterpenes mentioned above have been isolated from
