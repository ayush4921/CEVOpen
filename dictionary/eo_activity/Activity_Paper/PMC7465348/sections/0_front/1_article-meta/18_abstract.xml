 <p>With the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains, identification of new anti-staphylococcal drugs has become a necessity. It has long been demonstrated that plants are a large and diverse source of antibacterial compounds. 
  <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic>, an endemic medicinal plant from Reunion Island, was chemically investigated for its reported biological activity against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Aspidin VB, a phloroglucinol derivative never before described, together with Aspidin BB, were first isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of 
  <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> leaves. Their structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Aspidin VB exhibited strong antibacterial activity against standard and methicillin-resistant 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, with a minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 0.25 μg/mL, and no cytotoxicity was observed at 10
  <sup>−5</sup> M in MRC5 cells. Due to its biological activities, Aspidin VB appears to be a good natural lead in the fight against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
