<p>MIC ranges of hexane, ethanol, and water extracts in 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> were 0.012–0.32 mg/mL, 0.019–2.4 mg/mL, and 0.019–0.48 mg/mL, respectively. Respective MIC ranges of hexane and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> were 0.003–0.032 mg/mL and 0.019–2.4 mg/mL. The hexane extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> inhibited 75% of the selected MRSA strains at relatively low MIC values ranging from 0.003 to 0.064 mg/mL. The hexane extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> inhibited 75% of MRSA strains at MIC values ranging from 0.012 mg/mL to 0.064 mg/mL. Ethanol extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> inhibited 70% of MRSA strains at the MIC values ranging from 0.019 mg/mL to 0.096 mg/mL, whereas ethanol and water extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata,</italic> respectively, inhibited 45% and 80% of MRSA strains at the same MIC range. Relatively high MIC values of ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> ranging from 0.48 to 2.4 mg/mL were needed to inhibit 55% and 30% of selected MRSA strains, respectively. Similarly, 0.48 mg/mL concentration of the water extract of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> was needed to inhibit 20% of selected MRSA strains (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and
