<p id="p0180">Subsequently, physico-chemical analysis of twenty pooled honey samples revealed no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) among the districts for all the measured values (moisture content, electrical conductivity, pH, ash, total acidity, HMF, and insoluble materials) except for the proline (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Proline content was higher in the honey sampled from Jeldu district (293 ± 14), while the lower value was recorded from Wolmera district (171 ± 13). The value of moisture content, electrical conductivity, pH, FA, and HMF were compared against standard values of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honeys, and parameters like moisture content, HMF and TA were significantly varied (
