<p id="p0220">The proline content in honey is measured as a criterion for estimating the quality (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Iglesias et al., 2004</xref>). It may also be used for characterization of honey based on its botanical origin. The value of proline in the present study significantly different between the localities, where the highest mean value was recorded in the honey sample from Jeldu district (293 ± 14 mgkg
 <sup>-1</sup>), while the lowest mean was recorded in the honey sample from Wolmera district (171 ± 13 mgkg
 <sup>-1</sup>). These differences could be correlated with the degree of nectar processing by the bees themselves making the honey proline amount which is a criterion for ripeness of honey in combination with other factors such as saccharide and glucose oxidase activities (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Truzzi et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the difference between origin of honey (nectar source) among the two locations (Wolemra and Jeldu districts) might has revealed the difference in the proline value in the honey samples. Similar investigation by 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kečkeš et al. (2013)</xref> also demonstrated that proline content of honey was significantly associated with its floral and geographical origins.
