 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanov (2009)</xref>. For the measure of pH value, a solution of 10 g stingless bee honey was dissolved in 75 mL of distilled water, then homogenized and subjected to reading in a pH meter (3100 Janeway, England) that was calibrated at pH 4.0 and 7.0. Furthermore, the honey solution was titrated with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the value of pH 8.30 at a steady reading after 2 min of the starting of titration. The readings were then recorded to the closest 0.2 mL employing a 10 mL burette to obtain precision value.
