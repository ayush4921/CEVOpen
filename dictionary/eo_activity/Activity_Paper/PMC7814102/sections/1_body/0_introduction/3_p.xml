<p id="p0015">Based on its entomological derivation, honey may be from the species 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, which is the most broadly known and commercially accessible around the world, or from meliponines, which are commonly known as stingless bees without sting, or native bees (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Temaru et al., 2007</xref>). In Ethiopia, both the honey types are produced all over the country. Several studies have been conducted to characterize Ethiopian 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> honey depending on its botanical and topographical origins (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tesfaye et al., 2016</xref>), so that its quality parameters have been standardized both at national and international levels (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">QSAE, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alimentarius, 2001</xref>). Exclusively, the stingless bee, 
 <italic>Meliponula beccarii</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gribodo, 1879</xref>) honey commonly known as “
 <italic>Damuu</italic>” or “
 <italic>Tazma</italic>” honey is a valuable bee product with long consumption tradition, to which several medicinal uses are attributed. According to 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Vit et al. (2013)</xref> stingless bees construct their nests as spherical pots made of cerumen, that is a mixture of propolis and wax to store their honey and the honey produced in such a way is called pot honey. In Ethiopia, the way stingless bee honey (“
 <italic>damma damuu</italic>”) harvested from feral colonies is absolutely traditional and destructive. The process is not only reducing quality of honey but also endangered the existing local species because of total nest destruction.
