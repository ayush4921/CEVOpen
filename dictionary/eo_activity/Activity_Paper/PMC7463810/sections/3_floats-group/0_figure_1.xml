   <bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of tricin. (
   <bold>B</bold>) UPLC chromatogram showing the peak of tricin detected at UV350 nm. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Photos of Hordei Fructus Germinatu, Oryzae Fructus Germinatus and Setariae Fructus Germinatus. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Effects of tricin on viability of HT29 and Colon26-Luc cells by MTT assay. Data were expressed as the mean percentage of the control (4 independent experiments with 4 replicates each, mean Â± S.D.). (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) Effects of tricin on motility of (
   <bold>E</bold>) HT29 cells and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Colon26-Luc cells by scratch wound assay. Data were expressed as the mean percentage of untreated control (4 independent experiments with duplicate each, mean + S.D.). Statistical differences were determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test, with *
