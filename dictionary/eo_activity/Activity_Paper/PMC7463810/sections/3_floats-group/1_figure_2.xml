  <p>Effects of tricin on protein expressions in HT29 cells. Proteins were extracted from cells incubated with tricin for 24 h and subjected to western blot analysis. (

   <bold>D</bold>) total Akt, Erk1/2, NF-κB and (

Histograms show the quantitative target proteins expression results normalized with the corresponding β-actin expressions and expressed as relative expression levels. Data were expressed as the mean + S.D. (n = 4). Differences among treatment groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *
