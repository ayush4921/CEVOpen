<p>On the other hand, population changes of MDSC and Treg cells induced by tricin treatment were also revealed in the present study. The tumor microenvironment is composed of tumor cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune cells including T cells, B cells, macrophages, MDSC, dendritic cells, NK cells as well as specific cytokine, chemokines, extracellular matrix milieu, etc. [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The multifunctional activities of tricin were now illustrated clearly as the reduction of MDSC and Treg populations and the augmented CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T tumor infiltrating lymphocytes population, which is responsible for the anti-tumor effects [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], have been observed in tricin-treated mice. Furthermore, tricin also reduced the number of macrophages in tumors and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production by spleen lymphocytes, such changes were consistent with the previous reports on the anti-inflammatory activity of tricin [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the important role of tricin on modulating tumor microenvironment was further validated in the immune-competent tumor-bearing mouse model.
