<p>Stock solution of tricin was prepared in methanol at 1 mg/mL and was stored at −20 °C until use. For preparation of standard curve solution, the stock standard solution was serially diluted into 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.563, 0.7813, 0.391, 0.195, 0.098 µL/mL. For sample preparation, 10 mL methanol was added to 1 g of dry sample powder and was ultrasonicated under 40 °C for 1 h. The supernatant (5 mL) was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, followed by 0.5 mL of methanol added to the residue. The mixture was then filtered using a 0.2 µm PTFE filter as the sample solution. The analysis was conducted using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) The column used was a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm, with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 VanGuard 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 5 mm as guard column. The chromatographic separation was conducted at 40 °C under isocratic elution of 0.1% acetic acid in deionized water: acetonitrile (75:25) at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The column was flushed with 100% acetonitrile for 2 min and re-equilibrium for another 2 min after each injection. UV 350 nm was used for the detection of tricin (
