<p>To isolate cells from spleens, lymph nodes and tumors, organs were homogenized by a plunger of a syringe and then passing through a 200-mesh sieve. Isolated cells were blocked twice in PBS with 5% FBS and stained with PE-anti-mouse CD 11b and FITC-anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr-1) obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA) for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC); or with FITC-anti-mouse CD11b, APC anti-mouse F4/80 obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA) for macrophages; or with FITC-anti-mouse CD11b, APC-anti-mouse-CD25 and PE-anti-mouse Foxp3 obtained from eBioscience (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for regulatory T (Treg) cells or IgG isotype for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Then cells were washed twice with blocking buffer, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Data from 10,000 cells were collected and analyzed. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens were counted, seeded in 96-well plate at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/well, activated with PHA (10 μg/mL) and cell supernatant was collected after 24 h incubation at 37 °C. Enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays (ELISA) kits of mouse IL-2, 6, TNF-α and IFN-γ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
