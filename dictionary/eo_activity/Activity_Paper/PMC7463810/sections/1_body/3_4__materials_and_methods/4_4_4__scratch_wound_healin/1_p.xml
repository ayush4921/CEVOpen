<p>Cell motility of HT-29 and Colon26-Luc cells were assessed using scratch wound healing assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were seeded in 24-well plate with full medium and incubated overnight, then starved with medium with 1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) FBS for additional 24 h. The cells were scraped using a pipet tip and the scratch wounds in each well were photographed at 0 h. Cell culture medium was changed to fresh full medium with 12.5, 25 or 50 μM of tricin. After 18 h (for Colon26-Luc cells) or 24 h (for HT-29 cells) incubation, medium was discarded and the wounds were photographed again under an IX-71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The open wound area was measured and analyzed by Tscratch software [
