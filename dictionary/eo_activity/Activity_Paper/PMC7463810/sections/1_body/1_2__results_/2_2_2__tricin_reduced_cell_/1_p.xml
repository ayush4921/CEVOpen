<p>Cell viability of colon cancer cells after 24 or 48 h tricin treatment was assessed by an MTT assay. Tricin reduced the cell viability of both human and mouse colon cancer cells after 48 h incubation, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 107.9 µM and 34 µM in HT-29 and Colon26-Luc cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>D), while tricin (up to 400 µM) did not affect the viability of HT-29 cells and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for Colon26-Luc cells was greater than 500 μM after 24 h incubation. Tricin was shown to inhibit colon cancer cell motility in scratch wound healing assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>E, the closed wound areas in tricin-treated groups (25 or 50 μM) were fewer than that in untreated group after 24 h in HT-29 cells or 18 h in Colon26-Luc cells. The migration phenotype of Colon26-Luc cells was more obvious than that of HT-29 cells. Nevertheless, the closed wound area (as a percentage of control) was shown to be significantly lower in cells treated with 25 or 50 μM tricin when compared to control (
