<p>On the other hand, since Colon26-Luc cells were shown to be more sensitive to tricin treatment when compared to HT-29 cells in the migration assay, and previous studies also reported the immunomodulatory activities of tricin in vitro [

In particular, the potential inhibitory effect of tricin on metastasis was evaluated in mice, which were orthotopically injected with Colon26-Luc cells and were under real-time monitoring of tumor growth by IVIS during treatment. Tricin was orally gavaged daily at 19 or 37.5 mg/kg, the latter dosage was previously reported to be effective in controlling carcinogenesis in
