<p>As tricin was shown to alter the cell motility of HT-29 cells, its effects on proliferation- and metastasis-related protein expressions were further explored. HT-29 cells were treated with tricin at 100, 200 and 400 μM for 24 h, at which time the viability of HT-29 cells was not affected as mentioned above. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f002">Figure 2</xref>, tricin significantly reduced the expressions of phosphorylated protein kinase B (or Akt), phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and phosphorylated NF-κB in dose-dependent manner (
