<p id="Par53">The concentration-dependent effect (R
 <sup>2</sup>) values were calculated for each bacterial species accordingly, R
 <sup>2</sup> of 80% methanolic extract was 0.873, 0.890, 0.930 and 0.987, for ATCC strain of 
 <italic>S. typhi, E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> respectively. The maximum average zone of inhibition was recorded at 800 mg/mL concentration of test extract as 22.0, 20.7, 19.3 and 18.3 mm for ATCC strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> respectively. On the contrary, no bacterial growth inhibition was observed in all concentrations of 80% methanolic extract against clinical isolates of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> species.
