<p id="Par51">The other parameter recorded in this model was percentage inhibition in the average weight of intestinal contents. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, significant inhibition were recorded in 200 and 400 mg/kg dose of test extract with percentage inhibition of 27.82% (
