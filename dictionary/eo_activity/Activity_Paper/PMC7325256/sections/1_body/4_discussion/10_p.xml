<p id="Par69">The other activity done in this study was the determination of antibacterial activity for selected diarrhoea causing bacteria. Based on the results obtained the highest antibacterial activity was observed in the highest concentration (800 mg/mL) of crude extract. The maximum zone of inhibition was recorded for ATCC strain of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Although the test extract has a smaller zone of inhibition as compared with the positive control in the case of 
 <italic>S. flexneri, S. typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> it has better zone of inhibition for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This finding was inline with a study done on the leaf extract of 
 <italic>B. antidysenterica</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> According to Fentahun et al, the chloroform leaf extract of 
 <italic>B. antidysenterica</italic> has showed highest (11 mm) zone of inhibition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Other results done on different plants against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed that the zone of inhibition was ranging between 9 and 21 mm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This may indicate that the root extract of 
 <italic>B. antidysenterica</italic> has been promising activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and important to tackle diarrhoea secondary to chronic diseases.
