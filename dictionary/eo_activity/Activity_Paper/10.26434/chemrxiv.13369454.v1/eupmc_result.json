    "<p>We performed a chemoinformatic screening with 100 compounds isolated from Mexican natural products to seek active molecules with the potential to be implemented in the pharmacological treatment of such disease (either as a drug itself or as an inspiring molecule to developed active compounds against SARS-CoV-2). We found ten compounds with leadlikeness and Lipinski's potential. However, after the docking and toxicoinformatic analysis, only Cichoriin was safe and docked with high affinity to the main targets of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally we performed a PBPK simulation which showed that this compound might reach acceptable levels in plasma and highest concentration in the lung when administered IV at 100 mg/Kg. Our work suggests that Cichoriin may be a potential candidate in treating severe COVID-19.</p>"
