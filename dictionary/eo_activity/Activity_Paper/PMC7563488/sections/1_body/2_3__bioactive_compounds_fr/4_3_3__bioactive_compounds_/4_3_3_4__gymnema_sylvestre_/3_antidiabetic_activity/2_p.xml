<p>In the investigation of S. Sathya et al., the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> leaf informed hypoglycemic activity in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats [

 <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> extracts suggested that this extract could stimulate the release of insulin in vitro by permeabilizing the Î²-cell [

According to these literature, the action of Gymnemic acids in diabetic treatment was reported to be able to stimulate pancreatic cell production, thereby increasing insulin production, increase insulin sensitivity and insulin activity, help to control and stabilize blood glucose concentration in the body. Gymnemic acids were also reported to be able to inhibit the absorption of glucose in the small intestine and inhibit the conversion glycogen in live to glucose molecules in blood [
