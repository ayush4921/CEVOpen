<p>Onion has large numbers of biologically active compounds. These phytoconstituents have been successfully isolated and identified, including phenolics, flavonoids, thiosulfinates, amino acids, essential oils, and vitamins, etc. onion extracts exhibited various bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant activity, and antidiabetic activity, etc. The major biochemical constituents of onion extraction were identified as quercetin, allicin (S-oxodiallyl disulfide), alliin (S-allyl L-cysteine S-oxide), diallyl disulfide (allyl disulfide), S-methyl L-cysteine S-oxide (3-(methyl sulfinyl alanine), propanethial S-oxide (thiopropanal S-oxide) and 3-mercapto-2-methypentan-1-ol [
