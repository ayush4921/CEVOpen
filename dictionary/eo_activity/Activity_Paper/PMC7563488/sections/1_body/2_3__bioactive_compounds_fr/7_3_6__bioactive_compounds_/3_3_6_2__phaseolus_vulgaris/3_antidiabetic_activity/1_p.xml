<p>Various previous studies have shown that seeds of kidney bean have α-amylase inhibitors inhibiting α-amylase activities in animals and insects, related to control type-2 diabetes mellitus by inhibition of DPP-IV, and a lectin called phytohaemoagglutinin could adjust the activity of glucagon-like peptides GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) [

 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> have three isoforms of α-amylase inhibitor including α-AI1 (known as phaseolamin), α-AI2, and α-AIL, which has been identified and tested in numerous clinical studies against α-amylase action [

 <xref rid="B155-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. The mechanism of action of these enzyme inhibitors indicated that they could reduce the carbohydrate absorption by inhibiting the activity of α-amylases of mammals and insects [

The reduction of the glycemic index may also limit the risks of insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus, thereby control the serious consequences of the disease. Recently, another investigation continues to determine α-amylase inhibition of 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B157-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. The present study also indicated that α-amylase inhibitor inhibited the α-amylase activity significantly, and prolonged treatment with 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> extract could reduce several problems related to diabetes mellitus.
