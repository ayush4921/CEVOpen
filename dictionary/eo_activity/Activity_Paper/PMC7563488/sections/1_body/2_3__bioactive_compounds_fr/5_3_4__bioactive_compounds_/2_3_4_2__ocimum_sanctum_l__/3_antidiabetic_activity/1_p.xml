<p>In Hannanâ€™s study, there are four fractions of 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> including the ethanol, aqueous, butanol, and ethyl acetate fractions prepared to elucidate the mechanism of antihyperglycemic activity of this plant showed in literature [
 <xref rid="B127-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. This result proved that these fractions could stimulate insulin secretion. This study also indicates that the ethanol extract could decrease blood glucose concentration and increase insulin secretion, thereby this plant is a potential herb in diabetic treatment. Moreover, by in vivo experiment, the 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> extract was showed to be able to improve oral glucose tolerance, decrease serum glucose, increase glycogen synthesis in the liver [
