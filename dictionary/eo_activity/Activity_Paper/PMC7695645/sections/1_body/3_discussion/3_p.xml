<p id="Par32">Chlorhexidine is a broadband antimicrobial agent with a bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The antibacterial effect of CHX is concentration dependent, whereas high concentrations of CHX might negatively affect the physical and mechanical properties of GIC [
