<p id="Par31">In the present study, 
 <italic>Salvadora persica, Ficus carcia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> were extracted using alcohol to prepare extract mixtures of the three plants. This extract mixture was used to modify a conventional freeze-dried GIC by adding it to the water used for the final mixture at three different volume ratios of extract to water (1:1 PE, 1:2 PE, 2:1 PE). The extract-modified materials were evaluated and compared with a conventional GIC (Control) and 0.5% CHX-modified GIC (CHX-GIC) with regard to the antimicrobial and compressive strength properties.
