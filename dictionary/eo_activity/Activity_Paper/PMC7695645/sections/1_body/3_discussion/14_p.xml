<p id="Par43">The clinical success of a material is defined by its ability to withstand the stresses and strains induced during mastication and function. The most commonly used strength value to characterize dental cements is the compressive strength. The minimum compressive strength required according to ISO 9917 (2007) is 50 MPa for base/lining and 100 MPa for restorations. Therefore, it was important to evaluate the compressive strength when modifying the GIC [
