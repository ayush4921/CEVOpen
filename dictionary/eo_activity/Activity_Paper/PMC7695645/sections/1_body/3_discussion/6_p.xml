<p id="Par35">Results of agar diffusion assays against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> showed that PEs with the different concentrations had a significant effect on inhibition of bacterial growth compared to the control group. Such an effect was more pronounced with increasing the concentration of the extract as in group 2:1 PE that showed the statistically highest inhibition zones compared to groups 1:1 PE and 1:2 PE; see Fig.
