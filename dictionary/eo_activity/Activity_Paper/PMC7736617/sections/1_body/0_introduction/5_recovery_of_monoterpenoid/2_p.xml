<p>There are several metabolic rate-limiting enzymes in MVA and MEP pathways. In MVA pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is a rate-limiting enzyme, which catalyzes HMG-CoA to form MVA (

IPP and DMAPP are generated by the MEP pathway or MVA pathway, then they are catalyzed by GPPS (geranyl diphosphate synthase) to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP) with C10 backbone. Diverse terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the production of different monoterpenoids using the acyclic monoterpene precursor of GPP (
