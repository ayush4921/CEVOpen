<p>Some monoterpenoids exhibit significant toxicity to bacteria by interfering with bacterial cell membranes. Besides, the accumulation of terpenoids precursors (such as IPP) has a negative impact on bacterial growth (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paramasivan and Muttur, 2017</xref>). Production of monoterpenoids often needs to express cytochrome P450 genes, which is not easy to achieve in bacteria. In view of these, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is becoming an attractive host for monoterpenoid bio-production, due to its robustness, well-studied genetic background, applicability to industrial bioprocesses, and the possibility for terpene scaffold decoration by the functional expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is classified as generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nevoigt, 2008</xref>). However, compared with plant cells, 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacks monoterpene synthetase, so it has no ability to synthesize monoterpenoids directly.
