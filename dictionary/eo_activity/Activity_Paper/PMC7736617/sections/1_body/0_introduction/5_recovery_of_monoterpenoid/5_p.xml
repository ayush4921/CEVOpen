<p>Recently, transcriptomic analyses of the mint adenoids successfully identified the key enzymes of menthol biosynthetic pathway, further cloning and expression verified the biological functions of these key enzymes in the GPP to (−)-menthol pathway (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hajagos-Tóth et al., 2015</xref>), and the key enzymes involved in different terpenoid biosynthetic pathway need to be identified. Therefore, global omics analyses of different monoterpenoid producing plants will give insights into key enzymes for diverse monoterpenoid biosynthesis using engineered microbial cell factories (
