<p>Terpenoids are the largest and most structurally diverse class of natural products widely distributed in plants, microorganisms, and insects. More than 55,000 terpenoids have been identified so far (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 2008</xref>). Terpenoids have diverse biological activities, and they can function as chemical defense agents against predation and anti-pathogenic agents (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mahizan et al., 2019</xref>). Many terpenoids play critical roles in the interactions of plant-plant and plant-environment (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2017</xref>). Among them, monoterpenoids are a kind of terpenoids composed with two isoprene units, which are widely distributed in plant and used in both pharmacy and medicine (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wojtunik-Kulesza et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, sabinene, one kind of monoterpene, has the great potential to be used as advanced biofuel (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Nowadays, monoterpenoids are mainly extracted from plants using chemical methods. The monoterpenoid contents in natural or engineered plants are low, and the extraction processes are high-cost. Moreover, many medicinal plants grow slowly, and the planting area is limited due to the climate and other environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang J. et al., 2015</xref>). The structure of most monoterpenoids is complex, thus, chemical synthesis is difficult and high-cost (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, other sustainable supply of monoterpenoids is of great interest.
