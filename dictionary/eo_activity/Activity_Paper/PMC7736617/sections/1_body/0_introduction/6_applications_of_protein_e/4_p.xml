<p>The committed step in monoterpenoid biosynthesis involves the conversion of the acyclic isoprenoid diphosphate precursor to cyclic hydrocarbon product catalyzed by limonene synthase (LS) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Limonene is well known for its olfactory characteristics and antibacterial activity, which is often added to soaps or detergents (

 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> and a (+)-limonene synthase from 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> resulted in the production of 0.028 mg/l (+)-limonene and 0.060 mg/l (−)-limonene in the engineered yeast cell factory (

 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> was determined at 2.7 Å resolution. The structural and biochemical results show that (−)-LS shares many hallmark features and catalytic characteristic with plant monoterpene synthases, including an all-α-helical domain secondary structure, a two-domain architecture with a catalytic C-terminal domain, an N-terminal domain of unknown function, and conserved divalent metal ion binding residues in the active site (
