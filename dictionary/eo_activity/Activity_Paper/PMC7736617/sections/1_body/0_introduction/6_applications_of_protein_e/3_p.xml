<p>Isoprene pyrophosphate isomerase (IDI1) controls the first step of the monoterpenoid biosynthesis in the conversion process from IPP to DMAPP, which can adjust the proportion of IPP/DMAPP (

 <italic>IDI1</italic> successfully increased the yield of monoterpenoid. Further overexpression of 
 <italic>IDI1</italic> gene in engineered 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> increased sabinene production by 300% (

 <italic>IDI1</italic> in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> could increase the production of desirable monoterpenoid.
