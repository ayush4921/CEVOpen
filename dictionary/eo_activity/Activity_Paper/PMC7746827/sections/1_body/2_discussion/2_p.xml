<p>However, there are still many problems to be solved before coumarins can be used clinically. First, the current studies of coumarins as new antitumor drugs still in a primary stage, many of the studies on the anti-tumor mechanisms of coumarins have not been studied deeply, and stopped at a relatively simple mechanism. Second, most studies are limited in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, lack of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence to support, so the antitumor potential and security of coumarins 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is not clear, which needs further research. Third, coumarin compounds are fat-soluble, and have poor solubility in water, in order to enhance their bioavailability, may need to improve the concentration or the use of cosolvent, carrier system to increase their solubility and bioavailability, or through the structure modification or the introduction of new functional groups, can give coumarin compounds new performance. However, these measures may affect the antitumor activity and safety of coumarin compounds 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.
