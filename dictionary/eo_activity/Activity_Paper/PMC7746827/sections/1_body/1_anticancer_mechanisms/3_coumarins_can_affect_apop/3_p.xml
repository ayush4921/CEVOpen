 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The experiments showed that some compounds had moderate anti-tumor activities to these cell lines. The results of Western blot analysis showed that under the action of xanthyoxylin (compound 2) and 6, 7, 8-trimethoxyl-coumarin (compound 5), the levels of lysed caspase-7 and PARP increased, and the levels of pro-caspase-7 decreased.
