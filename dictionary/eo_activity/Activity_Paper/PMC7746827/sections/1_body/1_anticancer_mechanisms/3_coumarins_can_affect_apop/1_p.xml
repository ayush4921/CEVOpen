<p>Caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 are the key mediators of apoptosis in caspases family. Caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10 are the initiators of apoptosis. After receiving the apoptosis signal, caspase-2 can be self-catalyzed to activate itself, and initiate apoptosis. Caspase-3, -6, and -7 are executers of apoptosis, activated by upstream promoters, can hydrolyze many of the structural and functional proteins, such as poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) (

PARP is an important DNA repair enzyme activated by the damaged DNA, identify and bind to the damaged DNA and poly ADP glycosylated DNA repair-related proteins and get involved in the DNA repair process, maintaining the survival and stability of cells. However, when DNA is severely damaged, over-activated PARP will lead to cell death because of the energy exhaustion in the repair process. In addition, poly(ADP-ribose) generated by PARP activation can destroy mitochondria and release the apoptosis-inducing factor. During apoptosis, caspase-3 is activated and PARP is lysed to avoid unnecessary repair of dying cells. Therefore, lysed PARP is considered as an important indicator of caspase-3 activation (

The Bcl-2 family includes pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. Bad, Bax, and PUMA are pro-apoptotic proteins in the Bcl-2 family, which are mainly located in the cytoplasm. Once induced by apoptotic factors, they converge to the outer membrane of mitochondria to form transmembrane channels, which enable mitochondria to release cytochrom C, and activate caspases, thereby promoting apoptosis. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family, which is mainly located on the outer membrane of mitochondria and inhibits cell apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome C (
