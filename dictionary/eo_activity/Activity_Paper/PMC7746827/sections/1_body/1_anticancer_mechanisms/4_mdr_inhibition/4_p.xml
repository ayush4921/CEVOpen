<p>Kasaian isolated and purified 14 sesquiterpene coumarins from the roots of 4 species of Feruar plants, and evaluated the MDR reversal properties of these sesquiterpene coumarins in A2780/RCIS cells (cisplatinum-resistant derivatives of human ovarian cancer cell line A2780P). Some compounds had obvious MDR reversal effects. The combination of nontoxic concentrations of sesquiterpene coumadin (20 ÂµM) with cisplatin significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin on A2780/RCIS cells. The results showed that conferdione and samarcand had the highest inhibitory effects on pump efflux of multidrug resistance-related protein 2 (
