<p>PI3K is an intracellular phosphatidylinositol kinase. PI3K can activate a series of protein kinase (PKA, PKC, and PKB) and plays an important role in the cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation. AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, also known as PKB, is one of the key downstream target sites for PI3K, and it is closely related to the cell proliferation and apoptosis. AKT can activate CDK4 and CDK2, regulate cycle-dependent protein inhibitor P27, and enable cells to complete the cell cycle successfully. AKT can also show its antiapoptotic effect through various channels, such as inactivating Bax and caspases family, inhibiting the activity of GSK3, which can accelerate cell apoptosis by degrading cytoskeleton protein β-catenin and inhibiting cell adhesion, activating transcription factor NF-κB and promoting the repair of cellular DNA damage, inhibiting the expression of pro-apoptotic gene FasL, inhibiting the release of cytochrome C and apoptotic factors from mitochondria, and so on. mTOR is also a serine/threonine kinase and is a downstream target site for AKT. Activated mTOR can activate translation inhibition molecule (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein p70S6K. When 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated, its binding ability to eIF-4E is weakened, and eIF-4E binds to other translation initiation factors to initiate protein translation. Activated p70S6K can also promote protein synthesis. PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a very important signaling pathway in cell survival, growth, metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, metastasis, and cell cycle regulation (

Abnormal activation of this pathway plays an important role in tumor development, progression, and drug resistance, thus this pathway is an important target for tumor therapy (
