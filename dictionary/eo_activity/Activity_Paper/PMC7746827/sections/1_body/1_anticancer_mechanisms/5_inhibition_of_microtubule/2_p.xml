<p>Cao (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) synthesized a series of new 4-substituted coumarins and tested their anti-proliferation ability against a variety of tumor cells. Among them, 5-chloro-n-(2-methoxy-5-(Methyl (2-oxo-2H-Chromen-4-yl)amino) pentanamide (compound 65) showed strong anti-tumor proliferation ability (IC50 value was 3.5-31.9 nM). Compound 65 disrupted microtubule networks in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a pattern similar to colchicine, and also induce human ovarian cancer cells to stagnate in the G2/M phase and promote their apoptosis. More importantly, compound 65 showed significant antiproliferative activity to P-gp overexpressed tumor cells, class III Î²-tubulin overexpressed tumor cells, and multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Through exploring its mechanism, it was found that compound 65 could target colchicine binding sites, inhibit microtubules polymerization and spindle formation, and was more active than colchicine, and could overcome P-gp pump-mediated multi-drug resistance.
