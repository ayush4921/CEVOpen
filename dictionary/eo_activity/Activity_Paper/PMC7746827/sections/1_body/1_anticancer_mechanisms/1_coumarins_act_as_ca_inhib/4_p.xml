<p>Yu (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) synthesized a series of new dihydroartemisinin-coumarin hybrids. These hybrids showed moderate cytotoxicity to human colon and breast cancer cells. The mechanism included targeting CA IX, resulting in the intracellular accumulation of hydrogen ions, arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and a sharp decline in mitochondrial membrane potential, promoting apoptosis and inducing ferroptosis.
