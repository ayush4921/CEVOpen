<p>Naipeng tested the effects of three triphenylethylene-coumarin hybrids (TCHs) on endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis induced by breast cancer cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Among them, TCH-5C (5 and 10 μM) showed high anti-proliferative activity and low cytotoxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, TCH-5C (2.5 μM) can inhibit the formation of microtubules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, destroy cytoskeleton, and inhibit the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. TCH-5C (5 μM) also increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21 and decreased the level of cyclin B1, which induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, TCH-5C (5 μM) reduced the production and secretion of VEGF in breast cancer cells and directly inhibited the formation and migration of endothelial cell tubes induced by breast cancer cells. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, tumors in the nude mouse model treated with TCH-5C were significantly smaller in size and weight than those in the untreated control group. In the nude mouse model, TCH-5C also reduced serum VEGF levels, suggesting that TCH-5C inhibits tumor progression by reducing VEGF-induced angiogenesis (
