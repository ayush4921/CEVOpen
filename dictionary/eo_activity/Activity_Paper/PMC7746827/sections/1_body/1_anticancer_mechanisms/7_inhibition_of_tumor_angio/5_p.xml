<p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) gene is an oncogene and is overexpressed in many tumor types. STAT3 expression and phosphorylation increased with malignant progression of laryngeal cancer. STAT3 mediates angiogenesis in laryngeal cancer, and inhibition of the JAK-2/Stat-3 signaling pathway significantly inhibits invasion

Esculetin inhibits migration and invasion of laryngeal cancer by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and preventing STAT3 transport into the nucleus. In addition, Colivelin can reverse the anticancer effect of Esculetin on laryngeal cancer by activating STAT3, further proving that Esculetin functions by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation (
