<p>HIF-1 is a major activated transcription factor under hypoxia conditions. Its activity is mainly determined by HIF-1α. Members of the HIF-1α family are key regulators of glycolysis. HIF-1α is widely overexpressed in human cancers to prevent tumor apoptosis due to oxygen depletion. Activation and stabilization of the HIF-1α signaling pathway induce the expression of many target genes involved in tumor cell growth, metabolism, and invasion. The shikonin derivative PMMB232 synthesized by Han et al. can bind to HIF-1α, thereby promoting HIF-1α degradation, impairing glycolysis in cancer cells and promoting apoptosis. PMMB232 can also up-regulate the expression of E-cadherin, enhance cell adhesion, and inhibit the migration and metastasis of tumor cells (
