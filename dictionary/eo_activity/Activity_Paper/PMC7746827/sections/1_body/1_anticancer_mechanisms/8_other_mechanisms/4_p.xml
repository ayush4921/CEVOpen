<p>Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) transports pyruvate and lactic acid accumulated during glycolysis from tumor cells to avoid cytoplasmic acidification, which may lead to apoptosis. There are 14 known isoforms of MCTs, and MCT1-4 is responsible for transporting these carboxylate. They are also associated with the influx and outflow of lactate, which can produce energy in cancer-related stromal fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells. Elevated MCT1 expression has been identified in a large number of cancers, so this transporter may be a target for broad-spectrum cancer therapy. Gurrapu (
