<p>NQO1 is a very important enzyme in human cells, whose functions include xenogenic detoxification, superoxide removal, regulation of p53 proteasome, degradation and maintenance of endogenous antioxidants (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). NQO1 is highly expressed in many tumors and play an important role for tumor growth and migration. Studies have shown that NQO1 may be a target for cancer therapy, and inhibition of NQO1 may improve the efficacy of antitumor chemotherapy. By means of NQO1 activity assay, Khunluck studied the inhibitory effects of 21 natural compounds on NQO1 and found that coumarin compounds (coumarin, aesculetin, umbelliferone, and scopoletin) had the stronger inhibitory effect on NQO1, so these componuds could be used as non-competitive inhibitors of NQO1. The inhibitory rate of scopolamine on NQO1 (77.38%) was the highest. In cholangiocarcinoma cells, scopoletin and umbelliferone showed a strong inhibitory effect on NQO1, and scopoletin also showed strong cytotoxicity on cholangiocarcinoma cells. In order to explore whether NQO1 was involved in the cytotoxicity of scopoletin to cholangiocarcinoma cells, Khunluck also tested the cytotoxicity of scopoletin to cholangiocarcinoma cells that had been introduced with NQO1 siRNA and found that the cytotoxicity was reduced. Scopoletin can also inhibit the migration of bile duct cancer cells by reducing the mRNA ratio of the migration-related gene MMP9/TIMP1 (
