<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde and other aliphatic aldehydes, is a key enzyme in the ethanol metabolic pathway and an important molecule of antioxidant stress. It is also one of the common markers of normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. In breast cancer cells, highly active ALDH leads to breast cancer stem cell characterization by upregulating Notch-1 and epithelial-mesenchymal markers. Activation of the Notch-1 signal plays an important role in the self-renewal, proliferation, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Abnormal activation of Notch1 is relatively common in many tumor types. Deeksha examined the functional and clinical significance of ALDH expression by immunohistochemical measurements in breast cancer tissue. ALDH expression is significantly higher in higher grade breast tumors tissues (grade II and III) than in normal breast tissue. Injection of breast cancer stem cell (ALDH+ and CD44+/CD22−) cells resulted in invasive tumor growth in athymic mice compared with ALDH− cells. ALDH+ and CD44+/CD22− tumors grow rapidly and are larger than the slow-growing and smaller ALDH− tumors. On the molecular level, the ALDH+ tumor has higher expression of Notch-1 and EMT markers than ALDH− tumor. Oral administration of the naturally occurring Psoralidin (25mg/kg of body weight) highly inhibited the growth of ALDH+ and ALDH− tumors on xenograft models. In addition, Psoralidin inhibited Notch-1 mediated EMT activation in ALDH+ and ALDH− tumors. Therefore, Psoralidin may prevent the incidence and metastasis of breast cancer by significantly inhibiting Notch-1 in breast cancer cells (
