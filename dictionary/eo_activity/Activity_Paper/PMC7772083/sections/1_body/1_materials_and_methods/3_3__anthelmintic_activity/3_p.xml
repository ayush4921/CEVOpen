<p>Earthworms (
 <italic>Eisenia foetida</italic>) were kept under close observation, the paralysis time (PT) and death time (DT) for individual worms were recorded. Paralysis was said to occur when no movement of earthworms at any sort could be observed except when the worms were shaken vigorously [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Death of worms was ascertained by the absence of motility when dipped in warm water (50℃) followed by the fading of the body colors. The mean paralysis time and mean lethal time for each sample was expressed as a Mean ± Standard error of the mean [
