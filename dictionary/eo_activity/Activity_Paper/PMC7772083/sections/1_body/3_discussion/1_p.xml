<p>Both aqueous and ethanolic extract of the plant were evaluated for anthelmintic activity and the effective dose-dependent response was observed on death rate and paralysis tested warms. It was also noticed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. khasianum</italic> H. Wolff shows more potent action than the aqueous extracts. Further, as compared to standard drug albendazole at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, significant anthelmintic activity was observed at a concentration of 40 mg/ml for both ethanolic extract and aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. khasianum</italic> H. Wolff (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The anthelmintic activity of aqueous and ethanol extracts was found to be concentration-dependent. The anthelmintic activity shown by 
 <italic>T. khasianum</italic> H. Wolff extracts may be due to the presence of phytoconstituents available in form of alkaloids, tannins, phenols, and flavonoids, etc [
