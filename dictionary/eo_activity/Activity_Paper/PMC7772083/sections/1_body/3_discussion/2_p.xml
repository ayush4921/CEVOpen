<p>The hot plate method is the most commonly used thermal nociception model to assess the complex response of narcotic analgesia. The result of the hot plate test revealed a significant therapeutic effect at a dose of 200 mg/kg for water and ethanolic extracts at 13.5 ± 0.202 sec and 14.2 ± 0.336 sec respectively. Therefore, the extracts of this plant showed antinociceptive effects in this test since the reaction time of test groups has increased to a significant level. The plant extracts at a dose of 200 mg/kg show the potent analgesic effect in a dose-dependent manner. However, considering the fact that narcotic analgesics drugs inhibit both peripheral and central mechanisms of pain, while NSAIDs inhibit only peripheral pain. It may be stated that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant might possess anti-nociceptive activity mediated via a central mechanism. The analgesic effect of this plant suggests that it might have been acting through the central or peripheral mechanism or both central and peripheral mechanisms [
