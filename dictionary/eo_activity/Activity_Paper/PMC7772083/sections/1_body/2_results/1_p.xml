<p>In this study, the anthelmintic activity of the entire plant extract of 
 <italic>T. khasianum</italic> H. Wolff was carried out on adult earthworm (
 <italic>Einesia foetida</italic>) as shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Different concentrations (10, 20, and 40) mg/ml of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts were studied and paralysis and death time was found to be reported as 23, 20, 14, and 12, 10, 6 minutes respectively. The results also exhibit more significant activity (p &lt; 0.05) at a concentration (40 mg/ml) against 
 <italic>Einesia foetida</italic> (earthworm). The time taken for paralysis and death of earthworms were recorded in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and shown graphically in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.
