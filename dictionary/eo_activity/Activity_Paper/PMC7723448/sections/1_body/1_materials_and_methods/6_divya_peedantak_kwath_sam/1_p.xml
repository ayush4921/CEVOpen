<p>The animal equivalent doses of DPK for mice study was estimated based on the body surface area. The human recommended therapeutic dose of the DPK is 5 g powder boiled in 400 ml of water until ∼100 ml decoction remains, twice a day. Accordingly, total human dose is 10 g/70 kg/day. For DPK sample preparation, 500 g of DPK was boiled in 20 L distilled water and was reduced to 1.8 L of decoction, which was concentrated, filtered, and dried to yield 58.1 g of dry powder. Based on a decoction yield of 11.6%, the calculated human dose is 1.16 g/70 kg/day (16.6 mg/kg/day). Animal equivalent doses (mg/kg) for mouse were calculated by multiplying human equivalent dose (HED) (mg/kg) by a factor of 12.3 (

Therefore, 205 mg/kg (round off) has been taken as mouse mid-doses (HED). The low dose (69 mg/kg body weight) is one-third of the HED, and the high dose (615 mg/kg body weight) is three times the HED for mice.
