 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Balkrishna et al., 2019b</xref>). The slides were examined under a microscope by a veterinary pathologist for histopathological lesions. The severity of the observed lesions was scored as 1 = minimal (&lt;1%), 2 = mild (1–25%), 3 = moderate (26–50%), 4 = marked (51–75%), and 5 = severe (76–100%). The distribution of the lesions was recorded as focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Images of the histological slides (H&amp;E) were captured at low (×10) and high (×40) magnifications using an Olympus Magnus microscope camera and processed by Olympus MagVision image analysis software.
