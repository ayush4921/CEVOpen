<p>The Randall–Selitto pressure test was performed to measure static hyperalgesia in animals according to the modified protocol described previously (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Balkrishna et al., 2019b</xref>). The pain response as paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to the mechanical stimulus was determined with a Randall and Selitto device on different days, after 1 h of drug treatment. PWT is defined as the force, applied to the dorsal surface of the left hind paw, that causes the mouse to vocalize or withdraw the paw. A limit of 25 g was set to avoid tissue damage. The average of three readings with a gap of 5 min in between was recorded in a blinded manner, by a researcher unaware of the treatment conditions.
