<p>Water-extracted DPK powder was dissolved in incomplete RPMI-1640 culture medium. THP-1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well and differentiated to macrophages with 20 ng/ml PMA. Following a 24-h exposure, the differentiation medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640, and cells were allowed to rest for 24 h. Then, 500 ng/ml of LPS was used to induce inflammation in these macrophages. The cells were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of DPK (1, 10, 100, 300, and 1,000 μg/ml) diluted in media. Cells were pretreated with DPK extract for 24 h before inducing inflammation with LPS. Cell supernatants were collected in a 96-well plate for measuring the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. Cytokine levels were measured using ELISA kits (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was recorded at 450 nm using an EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, United States). After washing the cells with PBS, 100 µl alamarBlue (15 μg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Subsequently, fluorescence was measured using the EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, United States) at 530 (excitation) and 590 (emission) nm, and cell viability percentage was calculated.</p>
