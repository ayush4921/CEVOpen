<p>DPK is a herbal decoction consisting of 28 medicinally important plants (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Naturally, it is expected to be enriched with several active compounds. In fact, the herbs present in DPK are meticulously chosen to target the causative elements of CIPN, namely, oxidative stress, inflammation, and subsequent immune reactions. Therefore, it was imperative to check the active ingredients present in DPK that can target oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and modulate immunological reactions, besides subduing the nociception and pain associated with CIPN. Employing the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique, the major compounds identified in DPK are gallic acid (1.009 μg/mg) and neochlorogenic acid (1.067 μg/mg). Besides, cryptochlorogenic acid (0.804 μg/mg), ellagic acid (0.243 μg/mg), corilagin (0.124 μg/mg), vanillic acid (0.078 μg/mg), and rutin (0.069 μg/mg) were also detected (
