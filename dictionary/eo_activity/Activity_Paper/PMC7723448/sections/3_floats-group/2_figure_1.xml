  <p>Chemical composition of Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (DPK). Overlap chromatographs of standard mix (in black) and Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (in blue) showing the peaks obtained pertaining to the active compounds present DPK. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> shows the chromatograph for samples eluted at 270Â nm, that is, gallic acid, vanillic acid, corilagin, rutin, and ellagic acid, whereas 
   <bold>(B)</bold> shows those eluted at 325 nm, namely, neochlorogenic acid and cryptochlorogenic acid. Chemicals structures of the active compounds are provided along with the respective identified peaks (sourced from PubChem database). Quantification of these phytometabolites is shown in
