  <p>DPK alleviates CIPN-induced oxidative stress and inflammation 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. Effect of DPK treatments on the oxidative stress status of the nerve tissue was evaluated through MDA level 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, GSSG level 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and GSH:GSSG ratio 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. Observations are represented through individual graphs for each parameter. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Anti-inflammatory effect of DPK treatment was evaluated through serum levels of TNF-α. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 in all groups, except GABA, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 5. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test and observation represented as 
   <sup>#</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, when significantly different in comparison to NC; *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, when significantly different in comparison to DC.
