  <p>Alterations in nociceptive behavior in response to DPK treatment. Modulations of various pain response behaviors by DPK treatments were evaluated by using the hot plate 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, tail flick latency 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, Von Frey 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, and Randall–Selitto 
   <bold>(D)</bold> tests and observation represented through individual graphs for each test. qdX2W is to be read as on prescription recommended dose of X drug (in this case DPK or gabapentin) for 2 weeks (2W). Data are represented as mean ± SEM, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 in all groups, except GABA, where 
   <italic>N</italic> = 5. Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test and observation represented as 
   <sup>#</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, when significantly different in comparison to NC; *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, when significantly different in comparison to DC.
