 <p>Medicinal plants of the 
  <italic>Plectranthus</italic> genus (Lamiaceae) are well known for their ethnomedicinal applications. 
  <italic>Plectranthus madagascariensis</italic>, which is native to South Africa, is traditionally used in the treatment of respiratory conditions, scabies, and cutaneous wounds. The phytochemical studies of 
  <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> led to the isolation of five known royleanone abietanes, namely, 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone (
  <bold>1</bold>), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (
  <bold>2</bold>), horminone (
  <bold>3</bold>), coleon U quinone (
  <bold>4</bold>), and carnosolon (
  <bold>5</bold>). The relative configuration of compound 
  <bold>2</bold> was established by X-ray analysis. Compounds 
  <bold>1</bold>–
  <bold>4</bold> showed antimycobacterial activity (Minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% inhibition, MIC
  <sub>90</sub> = 5.61–179.60 μM) against 
  <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H
  <sub>37</sub>Rv. Compound 
  <bold>4</bold> and 
  <bold>5</bold> showed comparable toxicity (Concentration for 50% inhibition, IC
  <sub>50</sub> 98.49 μM and 79.77 μM) to tamoxifen (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 22.00 μg/mL) against HaCaT cells. Compounds 
  <bold>1</bold>–
  <bold>5</bold> showed antioxidant activity through single-electron transfer (SET) and/or hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) with compound 
  <bold>5</bold> being the most active antioxidant agent. Compounds 
  <bold>3</bold> and 
  <bold>5</bold> were isolated for the first time from 
  <italic>P. madagascariensis.</italic> The observed results suggest 
  <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> as an important ethnomedicinal plant and as a promising source of diterpenoids with potential use in the treatment of tuberculosis and psoriasis.
