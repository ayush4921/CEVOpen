The fact that the two protons at C-6β and C-7α have negligible coupling between them is directly reflected by the distortion chair form of ring B, which results from the direct effect of the planar structure of ring C and, thus, directly affects the stereochemistry of all ring B protons. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed 20 signals which were classified according to Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT-135) as five methyl groups, three methylene groups, four methine groups, and eight quaternary carbons, with six of them forming a quinonoidal structure (ring C), at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 140.9 (C-8), 147.6 (C-9), 183.5 (C-11), 151.2 (C-12), 124.3 (C-13), and 189.1 (C-14), in addition to the two oxygenated carbons at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 69.3 (C-6) and 69.1 (C-7) [
