<p>The cytotoxic and antioxidant study experiments were done in triplicate, and data were expressed as the mean ± SD. The MIC
 <sub>90</sub> values in antimicrobial experiments were determined using the dose–response curve (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00175">Table S1</xref>). The dose–response curve was obtained by normalizing data to the minimum and maximum inhibition controls using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, from which the MIC
 <sub>90</sub> was calculated. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the tested compounds were determined using Graph-Pad Prism 8 software (San Jose, CA, USA).
