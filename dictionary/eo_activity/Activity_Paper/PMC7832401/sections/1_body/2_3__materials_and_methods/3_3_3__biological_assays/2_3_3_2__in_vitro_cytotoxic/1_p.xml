<p>The cytotoxicity of the isolates was tested using MTT assay reported by Mossmann [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] against the immortalized human skin epithelial keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells. The HaCaT cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution. The HaCaT cells were grown for 4–5 days at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. The cells were removed from the culture using the trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution and transferred into a 96-well plate. The tested samples were applied to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Thiazolyl blue (MTT, SIGMA), dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/mL, was added to the cells that were exposed to the isolated compounds before incubation at 37 °C in the dark for 4 h. After observing the MTT change in color (blue to purple), the media were separated and washed with PBS. The produced formazan salts were dissolved with DMSO, and their concentrations were obtained by measuring their absorbance at 570 nm in a spectrophotometer. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the tested compounds and the positive control tamoxifen were determined using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
