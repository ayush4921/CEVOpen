<p>The in vitro antimycobacterial activities of 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> isolates against the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Mtb H
 <sub>37</sub>Rv pMSp12::GFP bioreporter strain were tested according to the standard broth microdilution method developed by Collins and Franzblau [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Collins et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this assay, the mycobacterial strain H
 <sub>37</sub>Rv was cultured in the Middlebrook 7H9 broth medium supplemented with either albumin–dextrose complex, 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and Tween-80 (7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw) or casitone, 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and tyloxapol (7H9/CAS/Glu/Tx). The minimum inhibition concentration to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC
 <sub>90</sub>) for the tested samples was scored visually at 1 week and 2 weeks post inoculation using the microplate Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and expressed in µg/mL. The fluorescence was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. The media (7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw and 7H9/CAS/ Glu/Tx), as well as 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were used as a negative control, whereas rifampicin was used as a positive control.
