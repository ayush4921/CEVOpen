<p>The main fraction VIII (97 mg) was purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column (5% aqueous MeOH) to give 
 <bold>1</bold> (25.7 mg). Fraction VI (200 mg) was chromatographed on Silica gel using a Hex/EtOAc gradient (98:2) to yield 
 <bold>2</bold> (61.9 mg). Fractions III (9.08 mg) and IV (19.82 mg) were merged (III and IV) and chromatographed on Silica gel using a Hex/EtOAc gradient (90:10) to produce 
 <bold>3</bold> (13.5 mg). Fraction XI (62.21 g) was subjected to sequential chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (5% aqueous MeOH) and then semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using acetonitrile/deionized water (60% to 80% in 30 min, then 100% acetonitrile for 15 min) to produce 
 <bold>4</bold> (R
 <sub>t</sub> 39.5 min, 6 mg). Fractions XIII and XIV (400 mg) were combined and chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH/deionized water (95:5) to produce 
 <bold>5</bold> (26.7 mg). The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated using NMR (
