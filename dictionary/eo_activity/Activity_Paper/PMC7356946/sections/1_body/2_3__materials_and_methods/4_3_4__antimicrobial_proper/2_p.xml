<p>The EOs were individually mounted on sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) at a concentration of 10 μL/disc. Thiophenicol and treflucan were used as positive controls for antibacterial and antifungal activities at a concentration of 100 μg/disc. All discs were placed on plates inoculated with 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores
 <sup>−mL</sup> of fungi (potato dextrose agar medium) and 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> spores
 <sup>−mL</sup> of bacteria (nutrient agar medium). Inoculated agar plates were left for 30 min at 4 °C for oil diffusion; after that, the plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C for bacteria and 72 h at 28 °C for fungi. The diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in millimeters, at three different points, and the average values were reported.
