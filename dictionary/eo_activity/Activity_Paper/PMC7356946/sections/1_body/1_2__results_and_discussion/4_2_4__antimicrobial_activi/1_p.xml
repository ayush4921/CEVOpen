<p>The extracted EOs using HD and MAE methods showed variable antimicrobial activities (

 <xref rid="plants-09-00716-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The EOs of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>, extracted by HD and MAE methods, showed only antibacterial activity against the tested strains (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). However, the EOs of 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> revealed a higher activity, as they showed both antibacterial and antifungal activities. 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> EOs extracted using two different extraction methods exhibited a potent inhibitory effect against all bacterial strains, with an inhibition zone of 34–39 mm, and very strong antifungal activity, especially against the filamentous fungi, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, with an inhibition zone of 40–48 mm.
