<p>The results showed that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.48%) were found as the main identified compounds of the 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> EO extracted using the MAE method, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (23.52%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (22.0%). In the case of the MAE method, delta-cadinene (25.13%) was found to be the main compound of the identified sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, alongside 
 <italic>α</italic>-muurolene (7.64%), germacrene-D (7.25%), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-muurolene (5.55%). τ-cadinol (7.61%), alloaromadendrene oxide (6.09%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol (5.49%) were identified as the main oxygenated sesquiterpene compounds, while 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (11.58%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (8.20%) were found as the main constituents of the identified monoterpene hydrocarbons, with a complete absence of oxygenated monoterpenes.
