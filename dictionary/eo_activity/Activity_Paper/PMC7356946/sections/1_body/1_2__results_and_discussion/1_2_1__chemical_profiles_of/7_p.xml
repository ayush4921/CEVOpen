<p>On the other hand, the EOs extracted from 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> by HD and MAE were colorless or faint yellow with a yield of 0.023% and 0.031% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), respectively. This variation could also be ascribed to the method of extraction used [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Significant variations of the chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities were described among the extracted EOs of 
 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> by HD, simultaneous distillation, and subcritical extraction techniques [

 <italic>Carum carvi</italic>, 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> were varied according to the method of extraction used [
