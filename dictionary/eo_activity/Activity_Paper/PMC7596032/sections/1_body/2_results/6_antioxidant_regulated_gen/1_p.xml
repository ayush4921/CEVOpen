 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the effects of RC supplementation on the antioxidant-regulated genes of the hens at 12 weeks. The expression levels of 
 <italic>GST, GCLC, HO-1, SOD1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SOD2</italic> were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0024, 0.0367, 0.0044, &lt;0.0001, and &lt;0.0001, respectively) higher in hens supplemented with 2% RC, whereas the 1% RC treatment group demonstrated significantly higher expression of 
 <italic>GCLC, HO-1</italic>, 
 <italic>SOD1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SOD2</italic>, compared to the control. Additionally, the 0.5% RC group expressed significantly increased levels of 
 <italic>SOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>SOD2</italic> compared to the control.
