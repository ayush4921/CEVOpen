<p>The free radical scavenging ability of the RCE was investigated according to the method of 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Blois (1958)</xref>. Briefly, DPPH ethanol solution (1 mM) was prepared and added to the RCE at different concentrations (0â€“1.0 mg/mL). After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm with a spectrophotometer. Decreased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher scavenging ability. The percentage of DPPH radical scavenging was obtained from the following equation:
