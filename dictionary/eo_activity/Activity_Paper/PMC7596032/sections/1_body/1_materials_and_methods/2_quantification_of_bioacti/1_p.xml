<p>The total phenolic content was determined using a Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, according to the methods described by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)
 </xref>. Briefly, 0.5 mL of 1 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was mixed with 0.05 mL RCE and 1 mL 7.5% sodium-carbonate and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature (RT, between 25 to 30°C). By comparison with a gallic acid (GA) standard, an equation was obtained from the standard curve of GA and used to determine the phenolic compounds in the RCE (milligram of the GA equivalent, mg GAE). The flavonoid content of the RCE was determined through the colorimetric method (

 </xref>). Briefly, 0.5 mL of the RCE was mixed with methanol, 10% aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>), and 1 M potassium acetate and left at RT for 30 min. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 415 nm with a spectrophotometer and a calibration curve of quercetin solution. The flavonoid content is presented as micrograms of quercetin equivalent (QE) (
