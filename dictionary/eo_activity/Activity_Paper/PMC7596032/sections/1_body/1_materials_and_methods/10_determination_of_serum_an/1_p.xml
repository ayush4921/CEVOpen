<p>Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity were measured calorimetrically using a spectrophotometer. The procedures were conducted using an assay kit purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Briefly, SOD activity was detected by adding 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L radical detector and 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L serum to each well of a 96-well plate, before the reaction was started by adding 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L xanthine oxidase. After incubation on a shaker for 30 min at RT, the absorbance at 440 nmwas measured using a plate reader. SOD activity was calculated using the manual provided with the assay kit. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. A CAT assay was performed by adding 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L diluted potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0), 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>L methanol, and 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L serum to each well of a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L hydrogen peroxide (0.03 M) to all wells, followed by incubation on a shaker for 20 min at RT. The reaction was terminated by adding 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>L CAT Purpald. After 10 min of incubation on a shaker at RT, 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L CAT potassium periodate was added and the samples were incubated a further 5 min. Once the reaction was complete, the absorbance of the mixture was measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm using a plate reader. Formaldehyde content was obtained using the standard curve and CAT activity was calculated using the manual provided with the assay kit. One unit of CAT was defined as the amount of enzyme that would cause the formation of 1.0 nmol formaldehyde per minute at 25°C. The entire reagent was provided and adjusted to the finest concentration using the assay kit. Antioxidant enzyme activity was expressed as units (U) per milliliter of serum.
