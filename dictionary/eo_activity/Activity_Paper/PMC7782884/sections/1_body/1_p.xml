 <italic>Epimedium</italic> is one of the most taxonomically and phylogenetically intractable genus, since interspecific hybridization and gene introgression complicated the interspecific relationship. In recent years, the complete chloroplast genome has shown many great advantages in plant phylogenetic research, such as mass storage of information, relatively conserved gene content and genome structure, moderate nucleotide substitution rate and so on (Zhang and Li 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Considering how large and complex this genus is, there is still more species need to be sequenced and assembled to clarify the phylogenetic question.
