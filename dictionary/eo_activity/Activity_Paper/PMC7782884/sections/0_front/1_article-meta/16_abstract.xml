  <italic>Epimedium</italic> L. is the largest herbaceous genus of Berberidaceae which comprises more than 60 species. 
  <italic>Epimedium pudingense</italic> is a rare plant species only narrowly inhabited in the Puding County in the Guizhou Province of China. Here, we first report the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>E. pudingense</italic> assembled from Illumina short-read sequencing data. The chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>E. pudingense</italic> was 157,325â€‰bp in length, with a total GC content of 36.11%. A total of 112 unique genes were identified, among which are 78 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
  <italic>E. pudingense</italic> closely related to 
  <italic>E. elachyphyllum</italic>. Our study will provide useful fundamental data for further phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of the 
  <italic>Epimedium</italic> genus.
