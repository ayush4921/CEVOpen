<p>A few antioxidant tests have been carried out using the whole plant and the aerial parts of TI. Alcoholic and ethyl acetate extracts were used for the tests. Most of the studies were in vitro studies using methods such as the free radical scavenging activity (IC 50), ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging methods, Griess reagent method, Phosphomolybdenum method, superoxide dismutase by nitroblue tetrazolium method, and superoxide radical scavenging method. Alcoholic and ethyl acetate extracts of TI showed potent antioxidant activities [
