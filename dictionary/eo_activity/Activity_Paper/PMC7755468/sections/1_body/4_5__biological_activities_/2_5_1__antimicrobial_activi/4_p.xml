<p>Also the wound healing activity, which can be explained by antimicrobial activity, was investigated using the methanolic root extract [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and Shellsol [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] isolated from fresh TI leaves. The test was carried out on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced excision wounds, and the extracts were topically applied. Both the extract and compound were active and showed complete healing of the wound. Furthermore, antibacterial studies with fractionated TI leaf extracts have identified vinyl hexyl ether, Shellsol, and 2-methylnonane as the active compounds possessing antibacterial properties [

 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Moreover, Shellsol isolated from TI leaves seems to be very potent against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Another mechanism of action for the antibacterial activity of TI could be through quorum quenching. Bacteria depend on quorum sensing, which is a communication process of bacteria, to regulate gene expression for important cellular processes that are essential for surveillance, survival, and adaptation to their changing environments [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Quorum quenching is the inhibition of this quorum sensing. A study has shown that the aqueous leaf extract of TI possess quorum quenching activity [
