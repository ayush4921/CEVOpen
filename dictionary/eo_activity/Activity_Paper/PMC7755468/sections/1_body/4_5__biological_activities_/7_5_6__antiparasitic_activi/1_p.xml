<p>Different types of parasites have been used to investigate the antiparasitic activity of TI. Anthelmintic activity was investigated using earthworms and aquarium worms, and the extracts caused paralysis and death of the worms at the tested dose [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Larvicidal activity of root and leaf extracts of TI checked using mosquito larvae showed positive results [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Also, phagodeterrence, oviposition deterrence, and mosquito repellant activities were also checked in adult female and gravid female mosquitos which showed positive results [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].
