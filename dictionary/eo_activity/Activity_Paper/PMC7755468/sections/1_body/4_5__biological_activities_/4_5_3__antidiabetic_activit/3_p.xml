<p>An in vitro antidiabetic study [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] was carried out with the leaf extract of TI using 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition assay. The study showed that the extract restrained effective 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme inhibitory activity. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Amylase is a protein enzyme which hydrolyses alpha bonds of large, alpha-linked polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, yielding glucose and maltose. By inhibiting 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme, the breakdown of polysaccharides is hindered, and thereby, the digestion of starch and glycogen is obstructed, and the release of glucose into the blood is inhibited [
