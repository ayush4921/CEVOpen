<p>Some of the ethnomedicinal uses, such as for diabetes, can be directly correlated to scientifically proven biological activities. The antidiabetic activity [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] of TI has been scientifically validated through in vitro and in vivo studies [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the oral administration of the aqueous ethanolic extract of TI whole plant showed potent antidiabetic activity on streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats, at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg. Similarly, in the ethnomedicinal use, 60 g of the dried and pulverized TI whole plant was prepared into a decoction of 240 ml [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and used at 120 ml each twice a day. The therapeutic human dose of TI in this decoction, calculated by measuring its extractable matter, was 110 mg/kg [
