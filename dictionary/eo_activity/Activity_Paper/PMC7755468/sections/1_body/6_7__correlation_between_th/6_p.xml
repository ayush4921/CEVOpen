<p>Other therapeutic indications, such as the wound healing action, have been carried out by Samy et al. [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], which showed that 50 µg/kg of Shellsol, isolated from TI, exhibited complete healing after 24 days on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>-induced excision wound in albino rats. In ethnomedicinal use, the aerial parts of TI and two other plants are ground together into a paste and applied on wounds for wound healing [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Furthermore, TI is included in a group of drugs called “welpasmul,” meaning the roots of five climbers, which is used for all types of kidney diseases. These herbs are used at a weight of 12 g each, and decoction is made at 240 ml for daily consumption [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In agreement, the ethanol leaf extract of TI at dose 250 and 500 mg/kg showed potent nephroprotective activity against acetaminophen-induced toxicity in male albino rats on a study performed by Palani et al. [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Its diuretic action was also studied by Pallie et al. [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], which showed dose-dependent diuretic activity of the TI decoction on healthy rats at 550, 1100, 1650, and 2200 mg/kg. The therapeutic rat dose of this TI decoction was 550 mg/kg.
