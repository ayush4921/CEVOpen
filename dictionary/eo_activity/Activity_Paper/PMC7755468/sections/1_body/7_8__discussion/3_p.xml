<p>Furthermore, no studies were found which evaluated the activities of TI in human since all of the studies were either in vitro studies in animals or in vivo studies. Therefore, it should be cautioned when generalizing the conclusions of those studies to the human population, despite the fact that TI has been in use for centuries in traditional medical systems. The way to bridge this gap is through extending those studies to the clinical level to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of the plant on humans as well as to gain knowledge on its common side effects and drug interactions. Randomized clinical trials are required to be performed as future studies in order to scientifically prove the safety and efficacy of TI to be used as a phytomedicine. It will strengthen the validation of the therapeutic efficacy of this medicinal plant.</p>
