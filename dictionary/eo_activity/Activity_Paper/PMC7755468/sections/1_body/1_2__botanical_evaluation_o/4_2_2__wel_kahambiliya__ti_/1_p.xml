<p>As mentioned in Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia, Wel Kahambiliya is used as a substitute for Dhanwayasa, Duralabha, and Yawasa in Sri Lanka [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to most Ayurvedic texts, however, Dhanwayasa and Duralabha are considered one plant, having the botanical name as 
 <italic>Fagonia cretica</italic> Linn. belonging to family Zygophyllaceae [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the texts mention that they are synonyms for each other. In Ayurveda authentic text Bhavaprakasha [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it is mentioned that Duralabha and Yawasa are two different plants. The botanical name of Yawasa is 
 <italic>Alhagi camelorum</italic> Fisch and belongs to family Fabaceae. According to the book, “Medicinal Plants (Indigenous and Exotic) Used in Ceylon [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]” by D.M.A. Jayaweera, the vernacular name of 
 <italic>Alhagi camelorum</italic> is mentioned as Wel Kahambiliya, which further notes that 
 <italic>Alhagi camelorum</italic> is not found in Sri Lanka. Dhanwayasa or Duralabha and Yawasa could be having the same ethnopharmacological properties as 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic>, and thus, the latter is used as a substitute in Sri Lanka due to its availability in the region. The same reason could have led to the use of the vernacular name “Wel Kahambiliya” for those other plants as well.
