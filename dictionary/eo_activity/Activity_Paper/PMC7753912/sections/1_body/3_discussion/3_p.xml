<p id="p0145">Exposure of experimental animals to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively resulted in multiple oxidative damages to kidney and liver cells. Biochemical and histopathological observations confirmed the oxidative damage. Biomarkers of liver injury including AST, ALT and ALP were markedly increased in the serum of albino rats following exposure to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin. This indicates that both CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin triggered an increased production of ROS in excess of the endogenous antioxidant capacity to mop –up, thereby eliciting organ damage. However, treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaves extract caused a dose-dependent restoration of ALT, ALP and AST in fashion similar to the negative control animals and those treated with silymarin. This agrees with the report of 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Surya et al. (2011)</xref>. Phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> has shown that it is rich in flavonoids, alkaloids, major lignans, hydrolysable tannins and polyphenols (

 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaves is responsible for attenuation of liver toxicity (

 <italic>P. amarus</italic> leaf extract used in the present study is attributable to phyllanthin. Noteworthy is the fact, that there was no significant difference in therapeutic efficiency between 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract at 100 mg/kg bw and silymarin at the same dose. This finding is in line with 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Igwe et al. (2007)</xref> who reported the restorative potential of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> (whole plant) in chemically induced hepatotoxicity.
