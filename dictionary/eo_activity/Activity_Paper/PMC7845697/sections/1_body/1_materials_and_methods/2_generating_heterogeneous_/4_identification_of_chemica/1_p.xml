<p>Chemical property features were generated by considering physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility, pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry friendless information (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Physicochemical properties include molecular weight, number of heavy atoms, fraction Csp3, rotatable bonds, hydrogen-bond acceptors, hydrogen-bond donors, and molar refractivity. For all physicochemical properties, we performed feature scaling by applying Z-score normalization. The scale of input variables used to train the model is an important factor because unscaled inputs can result in a slow or unstable learning process, which causes exploding gradients in the learning process. Therefore, we performed Z-score normalization, which can standardize the values having zero-mean and unit variance. Lipophilicity contains the results of five different methods for the prediction of the partition coefficient between 
 <italic>n</italic>-octanol and water (log P
 <sub>o/w</sub>), containing XLOGP3, WLOGP, MLOGP, SILICOS-IT, and iLOGP (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Daina et al., 2017</xref>). The consensus log P
 <sub>o/w</sub> is the arithmetic mean of the values predicted by the above five methods. Water solubility includes the results of three different methods for the prediction of water solubility, containing the ESOL, Ali, and SILICOS-IT methods (

 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>). Pharmacokinetics includes human intestinal absorption, blood-brain barrier permeability, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, five major isoforms of cytochrome P450 (i.e., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4), and the logarithm of skin permeability coefficient (log 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>p</sub>). Drug-likeness contains Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five, Ghose, Veber, Egan, Muegge, and bioavailability score (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2005</xref>). We used lipophilicity, water solubility, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness values without feature scaling because the data are log scale or the data type was categorical. All categorical data were transformed into binary variables by applying one-hot encoding. Lastly, medicinal chemistry friendless contains the pan assay interference compounds (PAINS) filter (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baell and Holloway, 2010</xref>), the Brenk filter (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brenk et al., 2008</xref>), lead-likeness (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Teague et al., 1999</xref>), and synthetic accessibility (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ertl and Schuffenhauer, 2009</xref>). All the properties were calculated using SwissADME (
