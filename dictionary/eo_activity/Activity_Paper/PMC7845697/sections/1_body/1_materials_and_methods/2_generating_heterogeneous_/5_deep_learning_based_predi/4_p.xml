<p>We used a total of 2,882 approved and investigational drugs to train the model and 4,507 natural compounds for testing. To train the model, the output layer needed data indicating the effects of the drugs. As the indication information in DrugBank is described using free text, named entity recognition (NER) was applied to extract disease terms with standard identifiers. We used a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based NER tool, known as BERN, to extract the disease terms from the drug indications (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). The extracted disease terms were mapped to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) IDs and then converted into class labels (
