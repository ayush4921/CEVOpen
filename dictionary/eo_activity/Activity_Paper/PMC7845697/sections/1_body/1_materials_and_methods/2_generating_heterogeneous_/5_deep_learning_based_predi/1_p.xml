<p>In this study, we used a deep learning model to predict the potential medicinal effects of natural compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For all natural compounds and drugs, the algorithm works in four steps: 1) collecting various types of natural compound and drug information from public databases; 2) generating latent knowledge, molecular interaction, and chemical property features from the collected information via text mining, network analysis, and chemical property analysis; 3) training the deep learning model based on the features of the approved and investigational drugs as inputs and their indication information as outputs; and 4) predicting the medicinal uses of natural compounds based on the trained deep learning model.
