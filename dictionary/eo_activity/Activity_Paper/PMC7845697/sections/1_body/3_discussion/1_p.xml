<p>In recent years, natural compounds have received considerable attention as an important resource for the development of drugs and dietary supplements owing to the increasing evidence of their health-promoting effects. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to determine the medicinal properties of natural compounds through scientific analysis. Most previous studies have focused on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, but these approaches have limitations in terms of cost and time. As an alternative, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis has been proposed, but another bottleneck effect may occur owing to the heterogeneous and incomplete nature of the information on natural compounds.
