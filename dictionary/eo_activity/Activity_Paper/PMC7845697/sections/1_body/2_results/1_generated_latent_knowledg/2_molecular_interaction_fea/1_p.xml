<p>We confirmed whether the molecular interaction features can be used to predict the potential medicinal effects of compounds. To this end, we mapped the sum of the protein values of the molecular interaction features to diseases based on the therapeutic target and biomarker information of diseases. Target diseases include 3,832 diseases defined by MeSH and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (

We then compared our predictions with the results of the network-based efficacy screening methods, including closest, shortest, kernel, center, and separation methods (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Guney et al., 2016</xref>). The closest method predicts effects by calculating the mean shortest distance between compound targets and the nearest disease gene. The shortest method calculates the mean shortest distance between all compound targets and disease-related proteins. The kernel method calculates the distance by downweighting long paths exponentially. The center method calculates distance with considering the largest closeness centrality among the disease-related proteins. Lastly, the separation method calculates the sum of the mean distance between compound targets and disease-related proteins using the closest method and subtracts it from the mean shortest distance between compound targets and disease-related proteins. The results indicated that our predictions, which used the molecular interaction features, exhibited better performance (the area under the receiver operating characteristic, AUROC = 0.776 ± 0.094) than the closest (AUROC = 0.721 ± 0.076), shortest (AUROC = 0.697 ± 0.102), kernel (AUROC = 0.713 ± 0.084), center (AUROC = 0.707 ± 0.088), and separation (AUROC = 0.710 ± 0.078) in terms of medicinal effects prediction. These results indicated the effectiveness of the molecular interaction features in predicting the effects of compounds by analyzing propagated effects compared with the conventional approach.
