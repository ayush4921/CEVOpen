<p>We first performed 10-fold cross-validation using only drug information. The drugs were divided in a ratio of 6:2:2 to train, validate, and test the model, respectively. As a result, AUROC values for 15 diseases were obtained (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the partially connected model using all features (avg. AUROC = 0.900 ± 0.040) exhibited better performance than the method using only single information (avg. AUROC = 0.781 ± 0.077–0.858 ± 0.042) (

AUROC = 0.850 ± 0.054) was worse performance than the fully connected model using the latent knowledge feature only. This is because the number of training samples is insufficient compared to the number of weights to be learned in fully connected model using all features. We further compared the method using the partially connected model with the fully connected model. The result indicated that the proposed partially connected model performed better than the fully connected model. This is because the partially connected neural network can be trained by a relatively smaller data set compared to a fully connected model. Lastly, we compared our method with other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, SVM, and bootstrapping (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the average accuracy of the proposed model for 15 diseases was 0.971 ± 0.011. These results indicated that the proposed model was well built by reflecting the characteristics of the heterogeneous information. Next, we confirmed whether the model could be used to predict the medicinal effect of natural compounds (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We trained the model based on drug information and tested it using the verified medicinal effect information of natural compounds. Furthermore, an additional experiment was conducted using the inferred effects of the natural compounds as a test set because the verified medicinal effect information of natural compounds was limited. We found that the proposed deep learning model, which was trained using drug information, successfully predicted the verified (avg. AUROC = 0.832 ± 0.032) and inferred medicinal effects (avg. AUROC = 0.883 ± 0.033) of natural compounds. All predicted results, including a list of the effects of natural compounds with scores, are provided in
