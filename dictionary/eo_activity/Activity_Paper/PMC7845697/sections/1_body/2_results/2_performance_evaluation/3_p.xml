<p>We additionally performed the statistical analysis based on literature reporting the predicted medicinal effects of natural compounds (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We made three independent sets by selecting top-ranked 10%, bottom-ranked 10%, and randomly selected prediction results. Then, we confirmed whether the high-scored predictions have more evidence than the low-scored and randomly selected predictions. To do this, co-occurrences (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>) of natural compound and disease terms in PubMed abstracts were counted. The average co-occurrence frequency of the high-scored set (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.87 ± 0.18) was 9.6 and 3.8 times larger than the low-scored set (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.09 ± 0.03) and random set (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.23 ± 0.11). Next, the co-occurrence was normalized as the Jaccard index (
 <italic>JI</italic>) by dividing the frequency of co-occurrence by the frequency of the union of individual terms to reduce the size influence associated with the term frequency (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Eck and Waltman, 2009</xref>). The average Jaccard index of the high-scored set (
 <italic>JI</italic> = 1.07 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) was higher than those of the low-scored (
 <italic>JI</italic> = 2.17 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>) and random set (4.31 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>). Furthermore, we performed Fisher’s exact test to examine the significance of the predictions. Fisher’s exact test assess the null hypothesis (e.g., there is no difference in the proportions of predictions between natural compound and disease) of independence based on the hypergeometric distribution of the numbers in a contingency table (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agresti, 1992</xref>). To obtain the contingency table of each prediction, the number of PubMed abstracts was counted based on whether they included the natural compound and whether they included the target disease. The number of significant predictions of the high-scored set (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub> = 58.53 ± 14.01) was markedly larger than those of the low-scored (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub> = 13.46 ± 7.42) and random sets (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub> = 27.86 ± 9.98). Lastly, we performed the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test to confirm the statistical difference of above analysis among the high-scored, low-scored, and random sets was significant. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The result indicated that all statistical analysis results were significantly different among the high-scored, low-scored, and random sets.
