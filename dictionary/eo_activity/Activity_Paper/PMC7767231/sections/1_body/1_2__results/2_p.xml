<p>Significant increases were observed in the activity of these enzymes in the rat model of LPS induced inflammation compared to the normal control group. These biomarkers have been normalized by pretreatment of RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. The determination of oxidative stress markers was measured as SOD, CAT, and MDA in different tissues like plasma, liver, and brain (

In the balance of oxidation and the anti-oxidation mechanism, SOD plays an important role by removing superoxide anions and protecting cells against injury. Hydroxylated radical ion is the most active ROS that has strong harmful properties but can simultaneously be decomposed by CAT, MDA, and SOD. LPS injection reduces the level of SOD and CAT, while the level of MDA increases with the LPS. MDA level echoes the severity of the free radical attack. The treatment with RAP has shown a significant (
