<p>Wistar rats (Male: 195–205 g) six-week-old were acquired from the animal house and were housed in plastic cages. At a room temperature of 25 °C, 10% of humidity, and 12/12 light-dark cycle. The rats have been given free access to water and food. The study protocol (UAEU-EC-11-2020-FP) was approved by ethics committee. The rats were divided into four groups with (

Animals in Group III and IV were given RAP 100 and 200 mg/kg p.o., respectively, for seven days, and LPS was given 2 h after the last doses of RAP. The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia after 6 h of LPS treatment, and blood samples were placed in sterile heparin tubes for plasma separation. For biochemical and inflammatory marker analysis, the plasma samples were kept in −80 °C. The liver and brain were also collected to study the histopathological alterations.
