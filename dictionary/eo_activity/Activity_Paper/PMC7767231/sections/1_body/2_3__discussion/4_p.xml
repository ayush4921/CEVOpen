<p>VEGF, which is the most potent angiogenic growth factor and pro-inflammatory cytokine in endothelial cells, stimulates migration, proliferation, and tube formation [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In fact, VEGF increases leucocyte infiltration through adhesion protein ICAM-1, which is necessary to induce or increase inflammation by the interaction of leukocytes [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Various factors are involved in the regulation of VEGF, and consequently, they influence angiogenesis. Many inflammatory mediators, especially PGE2, NO, TNF-α, and IL-1, can stimulate both the VEGF mRNA and protein levels [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. VEGF circulating levels are considerably increased in the rat plasma and have been observed in the current results. Similar findings have been reported in human studies where VEGF levels have been shown to be increased in the plasma with sepsis [

Inhibition of VEGF with RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) pretreatment also attenuates TNF-α and IL-1β during inflammation. This data proposes a role for VEGF in regulating inflammatory cytokine production in LPS induced inflammation. The outcome of augmented levels of VEGF in the present study of animal inflammation proposes a potentially essential role in the host inflammatory response. The study shows that RAP improves systemic inflammation of LPS by restoring biochemical and antioxidant indices. The histopathological findings are consistent with the current results that pretreatment with RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) protects the hepatic and brain architecture in LPS-treated animals.
