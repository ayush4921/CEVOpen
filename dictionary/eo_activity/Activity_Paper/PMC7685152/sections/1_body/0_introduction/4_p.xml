 </xref> This paper describes a collection of 1870 NPs from 302 species belonging to 58 families (some having usage in traditional medicine), with data coverage from 1962 to 2019, as well as a pharmacoinformatic analysis of the compound data. This novel electronic dataset, called East African Natural Products Database (EANPDB) provides interesting information regarding the original literature sources and currently stands out as the largest collection of NPs from Eastern Africa. The molecular structures and metadata of EANPDB are accessible as supplementary files to this article. Furthermore, EANPDB was combined to the previously published Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB),

 </xref> to form a merger called the African Natural Products Database (ANPDB), which is freely available at http://african‐compounds.org. The combined dataset resulted in ∼6500 unique molecules.
