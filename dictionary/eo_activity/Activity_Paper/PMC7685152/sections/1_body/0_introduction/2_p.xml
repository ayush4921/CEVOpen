<p>Historically, natural products (NPs), i. e. compounds derived from natural sources (bacterial, fungi, plants or animal species) possessing biological activities; have been the primary provenance of medicine globally.

 </xref>] Thus, seeing the remarkable contribution of NPs as drugs, huge amounts of NPs are being isolated and characterized daily. Also, the biological evaluations of the isolated molecules are carried out in order to confirm the therapeutic claims. Further studies on the establishment of the mechanisms of actions of the isolated biologically interesting NPs are being carried out with the hope of getting the next generation lead compounds for drug discovery.
