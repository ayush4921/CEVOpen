<p>Nitidine (
 <bold>1</bold>) was isolated by Rashid et al., from 
 <italic>Toddalia asiatica</italic> (Rutaceae); a plant used traditionally in several communities in Kenya for the treatment of malaria and other ailments.

 </xref> Reports have it that all parts of the plant are claimed to have medicinal values, but the roots, in particular, are believed to be more potent.

 </xref> This plant is administered traditionally as decoction or infusion of the roots for patients to drink for the treatment of malaria, fever and to cure stomach ache. For toothache, the root is chewed whereas for the treatment of coughs the fruits are chewed. In the study, Rashid et al. evaluated and reported that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> is an anti‐HIV‐1 molecule capable of inhibiting HIV‐1 reverse transcriptase. Although this molecule showed interesting anti‐HIV activity, it was also cytotoxic to the host cells at approximately 15 μg/ml.

 </xref> Thus, just like many other reported NPs, further optimization of nitidine (
 <bold>1</bold>) could serve as a good starting point in the development of novel and potent anti‐HIV drugs.[

 </xref> Although the evaluated activities and proposed modes of action of the compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> deviated from the local traditional usage of this plant species, this buttresses the point that NPs from medicinal plants have a broad spectrum/range of activities and can be chemically modified to suit our target of interest.[
