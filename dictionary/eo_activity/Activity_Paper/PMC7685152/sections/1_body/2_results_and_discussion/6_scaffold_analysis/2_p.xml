<p>Molecules with ring system(s) were used in this analysis while those that do not have any rings were ignored. However, we observed that molecules without a ring system represented a very small minority of the complete datasets and therefore should not bias the overall scaffold analysis. The output file downloaded from the Scaffold (CSR curves) tap in PUMA shows that there is little scaffold diversity within the NANPDB and EANPDB (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). A highly diverse dataset is considered to have a CSR area under the curve (AUC) of about 0.5; an indication that there is almost one scaffold for each compound. The downloaded summary statistics (Tables S1; downloaded from “Download unique scaffolds”) confirmed that most of the compounds are cyclic (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Both datasets have similar diversity in terms of scaffolds with AUCs of 0.86 and 0.87 and SSE30 of 0.90 and 0.91 for EANPDB and NANPDB respectively (Tables SI_2–4 and Figures SI_1, 2).
