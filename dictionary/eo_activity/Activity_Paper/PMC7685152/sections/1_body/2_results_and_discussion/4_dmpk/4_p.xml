<p>Furthermore, analysis of the count of donor/accptHB (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) content for each of the utilized datasets showed that about 80 % of the molecules in each dataset had respected the conditions of 
 <italic>donor/accptHB</italic> in the rule of 5. From the obtained 
 <italic>donor/accptHB</italic> data, we could observe a similar distribution for the EANPDB, NANPDB and DrugBank. It was remarkable that approximately 42 % of molecules in the NuBBE dataset had no 
 <italic>donorHB</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A) while the StreptomeDB dataset, on the other hand, had about 40 % of its molecules fulfilling the required criterion for the accptHB filter (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000163-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). However, this difference in the observed distribution of 
 <italic>donor/accptHB</italic> stands to confirm the fact that the composition and diversity of molecules from StreptomeDB (containing NPs from 
 <italic>Streptomyces sp</italic>.) has not been studied systematically and quantitatively and may vary otherwise from NPs from plant sources.
