<p id="p0030">The mysteries behind many medicinal plants were ultimately resolved in the last two centuries when modern science took off. Quinine was isolated from Cinchona tree bark by the French chemists Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaimé Caventou in 1820 with its chemical structure fully resolved a century later (

Vitamin C, chemically named as L-ascorbic acid in honor of its activity against scurvy, was discovered collectively by the Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Györgyi and the British chemist Norman Haworth in the 1920s and 1930s. Inspired by an antimalarial remedy documented in the ancient TCM text 
 <italic>Prescriptions for Emergencies</italic> authored by Ge Hong (AD 284–346), Chinese phytochemist Tu Youyou identified artemisinin from sweet wormwood in the 1970s, which led to the development of a new antimalarial medicine that saved millions of lives. Using a modern chemical biology approach, the action mechanism of artemisinin was recently elucidated, which entails activation of the signature endoperoxide bridge of artemisinin by heme iron enriched in the

Medicinal plants have not only guarded human health against infectious diseases over millennia but also played an important role in the modernization and globalization of human society in recent centuries. As our scientific knowledge about plants grows, there is no doubt that we will continue to discover new plant-derived medicines.
