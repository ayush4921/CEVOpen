<p id="p0045">The chemical composition of LCDD is complex; control of consistent quality of a herbal remedy is challenging; and its action mechanism in treating COVID-19 is unknown. Previous research on individual ingredients and their principal bioactive compounds has shed some light. For instance, sesquiterpene atractylon and its analogs isolated from 
 <italic>Atractylodes macrocephala</italic> show antiviral activities against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in cell-based assays, whereas 
 <italic>Atractylodes</italic> root extract attenuated influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pulmonary injury in mice (

 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic>, are clinically approved decongestants and bronchodilators (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abourashed et al., 2003</xref>). 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> produces baicalein and several related flavonoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents acting upon the NF-κB pathway (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh et al., 2007</xref>). In a recent preprint, baicalein was found to be a potent inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease, which could suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells (

 <italic>Aster tataricus</italic> was recently found to specifically inhibit the innate immune cytosolic DNA sensor STING and thus modulates the STING-mediated immune response (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Licorice, 
 <italic>Dioscorea polystachya</italic>, 
 <italic>Wolfiporia extensa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Polyporus umbellatus</italic> are rich sources of triterpenes, many of which harbor antiviral activities and/or act as steroidal hormone mimetics to modulate the mammalian immune system (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ríos, 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Khwaza et al., 2018</xref>). The combination of these activities likely counter COVID-19 by simultaneously inhibiting viral propagation, easing the symptoms of pneumonia, and suppressing the viral infection-induced cytokine storm. Unfortunately, the success of LCDD in China cannot be easily transferred to other countries for several reasons. First, the entire TCM infrastructure and the general cultural acceptance of TCM in China are lacking outside China. Hence, there is no mechanism for herbal remedies like LCDD to quickly enter clinics for treating COVID-19 as an investigational therapy or complementary medicine in the United States for example. Second, although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a route for botanical drugs to obtain approval through clinical trials, due to practical challenges such as patent protection, drug sourcing, and market acceptance, few sponsors have taken herbal remedies through FDA-guided clinical trials. Third, herbal remedies in their current form with largely unknown chemical composition and action mechanism fall below the high standard required for modern medicines. This results in low patient and physician acceptance, even though the safety and effectiveness of a given herbal remedy could be established clinically.
