  <p>Two Examples of Plant-Derived Medicines Currently under Investigation for COVID-19 Treatment.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Quinine was discovered as the principal bioactive compound from 
   <italic>Cinchona officinalis</italic>, a South American antimalarial medicinal plant. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are synthetic analogs of quinine and have been approved for treating malaria, HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>(B)</bold> The lung cleansing and detoxifying decoction (LCDD) widely used in treating COVID-19 patients in China was developed based on four formulae described in the classic TCM text 
   <italic>Treatise on Cold Pathogenic and Miscellaneous Diseases</italic> by Zhang Zhongjing (AD 150–219).
