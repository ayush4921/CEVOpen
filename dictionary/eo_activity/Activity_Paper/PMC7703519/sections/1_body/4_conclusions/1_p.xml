<p id="p0255">The use of agile regulatory approaches during the pandemic has helped to ensure that medical products have remained available, and that new ones could be effectively researched to address patients' needs. Nonetheless, many of these approaches have been introduced temporarily to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on patients and society. A number of learnings can be leveraged to further improve the regulatory environment. Proposals include: (1) embedding regulatory agility and lessons learned; (2) accelerating the development of innovative medical products; (3) addressing manufacturing and supply-chain bottlenecks using flexible labeling requirements or digital approaches such as remote inspections to facilitate site transfers or use of multiple sites; (4) strengthening international cooperation, notably in clinical trials and vaccines development; and (5) committing to easing regulatory burden and adopting digital tools. The use of these agile regulatory approaches that add value and have the potential to create opportunities to progress innovative research and development of medical products will be crucial for the future benefit of patients and society.</p>
