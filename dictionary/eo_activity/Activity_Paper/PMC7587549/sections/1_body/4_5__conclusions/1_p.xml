<p>To the best of our knowledge, we reported, for the first time, that an extract of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> stem bark, SPP, effectively inhibited LDL oxidation. This plant suppressed the growth of human leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cancer cells, significantly inhibiting cell proliferation and increasing the activation of caspases 3 and 9. Treatment with SPP upregulated Bax protein expression and downregulated Bcl-2 protein expression in both HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells. These results indicated that the stem bark of Vietnamese 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> might represent a useful anti-oxidant of LDL and induce apoptosis in a human leukemia cancer cell line. Further experiments to identify active constituents and investigate the potential chemotherapeutic agents associated with leukemia cancer and atherosclerosis will be conducted.
