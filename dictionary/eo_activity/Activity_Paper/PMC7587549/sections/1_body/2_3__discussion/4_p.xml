<p>Since 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> was found to contain many phenolic compounds, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, these secondary metabolites may be largely responsible for the anticancer activity of this plant. The isolation of potent active components and leukemia cell-based assays to identify the detailed mechanisms will be further explored. In addition, in vivo experiments will be performed to confirm the functionalities of these extracts will contribute to the development of 
 <italic>P. pterocarpum</italic> and its phytochemicals as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of human leukemia cancer.
