<p>Human cancer cell lines, i.e., leukemia CCRF-SBA and HL-60, and lung cancer A549, ovarian cancer VCAR8, and pancreatic cancer MIA PACA2, PANC-1 obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained in RPMI and EMDM 1640 (GibcoBRL, NY, USA) containing L-glutamine with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cell proliferation activity was measured using Dojindo kit assay according to manual guidance. Viable cells were seeded in the growth medium (95 μL) into 96-well microtiter plates (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with the growth medium with a range concentration of 5–50 μg/mL. The final DMSO concentration was adjusted to &lt;0.1%. After standing for 4 h, 10 μL of the test sample was added to each well. The same volume of medium with &lt;0.5% DMSO was added to the control wells. Each sample was prepared in triplicate. After 48 h of the test samples treatment, 10 μL solution of Dojindo kit was added to the each well. After 4 h in the incubator, the optical density was measured at 540 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was defined as the concentration of sample which reduced absorbance by 50% relative to the vehicle-treated control [
