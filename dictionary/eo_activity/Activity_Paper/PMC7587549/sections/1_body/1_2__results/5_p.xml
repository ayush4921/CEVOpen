<p>To determine the cell apoptosis signaling pathway that is triggered by SPP, we investigated alterations in mitochondria-associated signal proteins, such as caspases 3, 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Caspase 3 is a known member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, which exists as an inactive, pre-enzymatic precursor form of 32 kDa in size. When activated, caspase 3 cleaves multiple structural and regulatory proteins, leading to death by triggering the apoptosis pathway via the cleavage of proteins into heterozygous substances [

In our experiment, SPP was added to HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells and incubated for 48 h, after which the levels of the apoptotic proteins caspase 3 and caspase 9 were detected in HL-60 and KG cells by western blotting analysis. SPP (0–500 µg/mL) cleaved and activated caspase 3 and caspase 9 into their cleaved forms. The results showed that SPP significantly inhibited the expression of these caspase enzyme proteins in a dose-dependent manner (

To further evaluate whether SPP could induce apoptosis in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells, the levels of cleaved PARP were measured after treatment with SPP (0–500 µg/mL) using western blot analysis. PARP represents a protein family that plays a vital role in many cellular processes, such as DNA repair, genomic stability, and programmed cell death [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f003">Figure 3</xref>, SPP (0–500 µg/mL) induced HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, associated with PARP cleavage.
