<p>We further investigated the effects of SPP (0–500 µg/mL) on the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and the mitochondrial-damage associated protein cytochrome c (Cyt-c) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cyt-c is discharged from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, triggering the apoptotic progression in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cancer cells. The pro-apoptotic Bax and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins belong to the Bcl-2 protein family, which controls the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04800" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we observed that SPP (0–500 µg/mL) treatment increased Bax protein expression levels and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression levels in both HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results were also confirmed by western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the protein expression level of Cyt-c in the mitochondria was dose-dependently decreased (
