<p id="Par110">It is not appropriate for the pharmaceutical industry to provide direction on NRAsâ€™ inspection strategies and conduct. However, the IPVG would like to provide some high-level suggestions and areas for consideration aimed at NRAs which are planning pharmacovigilance inspection programmes:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par111">Publication of inspection guidance may aid MAHs to prepare better for pharmacovigilance inspections.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par112">Use of common grading criteria and sharing of grading examples amongst NRA inspectorates may support consistency of inspection findings.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par113">Inspectorates may offer pharmacovigilance inspector trainings and shadowing of pharmacovigilance inspections to other NRAs to gain experience.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par114">Risk-based inspection planning and sharing of inspection planning amongst NRA inspectorates may be advantageous to optimise inspection resource. Such planning may also avoid situations where some MAHs or service providers are rarely inspected while others are inspected multiple times in a similar time period by different inspectorates.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par115">NRAs may consider providing MAHs with guidance on pharmacovigilance inspection expectations and presenting anonymised inspection findings at NRA-hosted conferences or through the publication of anonymised individual findings.</p>
  </list-item>
