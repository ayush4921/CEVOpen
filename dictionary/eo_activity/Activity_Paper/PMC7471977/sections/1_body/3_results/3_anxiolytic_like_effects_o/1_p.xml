<p>Anxiolytic-like effects of 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> were preliminary explored by administrating crude extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate or methanol) at a dosage of 300 mg/kg, p.o. The hexane and ethyl acetate extracts produced an equivalent significative anxiolytic-like response to that obtained with the reference drug clonazepam at 0.5 mg/kg, p.o. in the plus-maze test as compared to the vehicle group (
