<p>Three organic extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol) of 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> aerial parts were obtained by a maceration process using 1466 g of the dry and ground plant material. For this, powder was kept in a container immersed in each solvent for 48 h at room temperature (22 °C). Each filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to eliminate solvents by evaporation in a rotary evaporator RII (Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). A final yield of the extracts was obtained as follows: hexane (1.11%), ethyl acetate (5.52%) and methanol (2.13%) (
