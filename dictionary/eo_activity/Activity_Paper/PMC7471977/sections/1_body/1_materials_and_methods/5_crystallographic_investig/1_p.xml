<p>Crystallographic data for 
 <bold>1</bold> were collected on a Bruker APEX II CCD Diffractometer (Billerica, MA) at 150 K using Cu-Kα radiation (
 <italic>k</italic> = 1.54178 Å) from an Incoatec IµS source and Helios optic monochromator. Suitable crystals were coated with hydrocarbon oil (Parabar), picked up with a nylon loop, and mounted in the cold nitrogen stream of the diffractometer. The structure was solved using intrinsic phasing (SHELXT) (Sheldrick 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the shelXle GUI (Hübschle et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The hydrogen atoms of the C–H bonds were placed in idealized positions. Crystallographic data were deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) with the number 1953351.
