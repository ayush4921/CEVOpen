<p>This test consisted of an i.p. administration of 1% acetic acid (0.1 mL/10 g body weight) to cause irritation in the peritoneal cavity, which in turn produced stereotyped behaviour in mice, where stretching of the hind limbs and abdominal contractions were characteristic. The number of stretches (writhes) was counted every 5 min for a total period of 30 min after injection of the nociceptive agent (Collier et al.
