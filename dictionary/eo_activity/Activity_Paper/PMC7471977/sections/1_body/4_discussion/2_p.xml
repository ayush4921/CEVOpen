<p>Although there are several studies reporting the antinociceptive effects of different extracts and species of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, there is not enough research on the main responsible active metabolites. In the case of 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane terpenes, there is also scarce information about its potential to relieve pain. An exception is 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic>, which is well known because of the presence of salvinorin A, a 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane terpene widely studied for its depressant activity on the CNS (Casselman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The dose-dependent antinociceptive effects of salvinorin A have been explored using the tail-flick and the hot plate tests (Tlacomulco-Flores et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), formalin (Guida et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and writhing tests (McCurdy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) in mice. In the present study, it should be noted that 
 <bold>1</bold> tested at 10 mg/kg, p.o. produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect that remained until the end of the experiment (30 min) in the writhing test in mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). Our data agree to that reported for tilifolidione (1–100 mg/kg, p.o.), a clerodane diterpene isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia tiliifolia</italic> Vahl, which produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the writhing and formalin tests in mice (González-Chávez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Whereas, amarisolide (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), a 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. circinata</italic>, produced significant but non-dose-dependent antinociceptive effects in the writhing test in mice (Moreno-Pérez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These data together reinforce the participation of 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane diterpenes as responsible for the depressant CNS activity of sage and their potential as alternative for pain treatment.
