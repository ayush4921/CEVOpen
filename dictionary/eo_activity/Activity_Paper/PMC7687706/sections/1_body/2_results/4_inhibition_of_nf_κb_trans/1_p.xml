<p id="Par27">In our experiment, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, was used to activate the NF-κB pathway and induce translocation of p65/NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. If NF-κB is blocked by an inhibitor, there will be no nuclear translocation of p65/NF-κB after TNF-α treatment. In control, less than 3% of the nuclei were positive for p65/NF-κB and the number of positive nuclei increased to 99% after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). When the cells were treated with the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> (0.87 μg/mL), only 11% of the nuclei were NF-κB positive, a significant reduction compared to TNF-α treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Treatment with the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> (52 μg/mL) also reduced the number of NF-κB positive nuclei but to a lower extent than the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Treatment with the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> at 80 μg/mL did not reduce the TNF-α-induced p65/NF-κB translocation (Fig.
