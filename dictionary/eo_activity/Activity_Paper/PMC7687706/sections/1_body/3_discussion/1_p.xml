<p id="Par28">Breast cancer is a complicated disease showing a high degree of heterogeneity associated with different clinical outcomes and treatment regimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The treatments range from only surgery, when the tumor is local, to combinations of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy depending on tumor size, metastasis, and molecular signatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Except for surgery, almost any breast cancer treatment can result in resistance and a growing body of evidence points to CSCs as the source of resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Breast CSCs are tumorigenic multi-potential cells with deregulated self-renewal properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Characteristically, these cells share many features in common with normal stem cells, such as a slow-division rate, self-renewal, and differentiation, together with other fundamental properties that increase their survival potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, great effort is spent identifying the CSCs in a tumor and screening compounds that specifically target these cells. Natural products are a source of new compounds that should be investigated for their CSC-inhibiting activities.
