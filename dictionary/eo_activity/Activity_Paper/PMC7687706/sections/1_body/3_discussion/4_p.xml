<p id="Par31">Besides inhibiting CSCs specifically, as seen by the ALDH and CFE assays, treatment with the fractions at low concentrations also inhibited cell migration evaluated in a wound healing assay. In agreement with the present finding, various studies reported plant extracts with similar effects in various cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This finding is consistent with the report that an extract from 
 <italic>Galenia africana</italic> inhibited the cell migration by downregulating the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and Î²-catenin, and upregulating E-cadherin, a well characterized epithelial marker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since cell migration involves the transition of epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and thus promotes CSC migration, contributing to the reconstitution of metastatic cancer at distant sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the present finding implicates that the bioactive fractions may contribute to reducing the metastatic burden of breast cancer.
