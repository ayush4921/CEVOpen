<p id="Par29">One of the phenotypic markers for breast CSCs is expression of ALDH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For instance, ALDH
 <sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells were reported to be more tumorigenic, metastatic, invasive, and migratory compared to ALDH
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> breast cancer cells and were associated with poor clinical outcomes and decreased patient survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The significant reduction of ALDH
 <sup>+</sup> CSC subpopulation following treatment with the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi,</italic> the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic>, or the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> is in agreement with the earlier report based on flow cytometry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which showed the retention of fluorescent BODIPY-aminoacetate produced upon oxidation within the cells expressing high ALDH activity. This may imply that these plants used in TM can reduce the metastatic burden of cancer by specifically targeting the CSC subpopulation [
