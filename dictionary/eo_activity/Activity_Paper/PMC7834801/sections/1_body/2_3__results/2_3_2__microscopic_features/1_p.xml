<p>Microscopic features of apoptosis were observed adopting AO/EB staining and are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>. In general, dead cells are permeable to EB and fluoresce red, whereas live cells are permeable to AO only and therefore fluoresce green. The viability and membrane integrity of the cells were determined based on the fluorescence pattern. The morphological changes observed in the treated cells were classified based on the fluorescence emission as follows: (i) viable cells having highly organized nuclei fluoresced green; (ii) early apoptotic cells which showed nuclear condensation fluoresced orange green; (iii) late apoptotic cells with the highly condensed chromatin or fragmented chromatin fluoresced orange to red; and (iv) necrotic cells fluoresced orange to red without chromatin fragmentation. Data on cells indicating apoptotic and necrotic morphologies, induced on treatment with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration and no toxicity concentrations of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> for 24â€‰h, and collected from manual counting are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>, which revealed that 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> at IC
 <sub>50</sub> is efficient in bringing about early apoptosis (less than 50%), but little necrosis was produced. However, 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> at no toxicity concentration did not induce any remarkable apoptosis or necrosis (less than 10%) for the cell lines tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
