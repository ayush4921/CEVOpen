<p>However, Primahana et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that trans-methyl cinnamate found in 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> produces moderate toxicity to brine shrimp at 120.47

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that fruit of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> induces cytotoxicity in A549 and HepG2 cell lines at 4.8 and 5.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL doses, respectively. It was suggested that the inconsistency of the chemical composition may be due to the differences in the plant parts used, age, variety, edaphic factors, and geographical regions where cultivated [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, Chan et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that the rhizome accumulates more secondary chemicals than the other plant parts. Therefore, evaluation of toxicological aspects of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> rhizome will be a rewarding area of research.
