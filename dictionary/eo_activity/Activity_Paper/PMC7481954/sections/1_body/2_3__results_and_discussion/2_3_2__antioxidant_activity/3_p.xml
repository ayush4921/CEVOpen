<p>On the contrary, the antioxidant activity of samples using the ABTS method is deduced from their ability to inhibit the radical cation ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>. The ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radical is in contact with a donor of H
 <sup>•</sup> leads, at 734 nm, to ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and to the fading of the solution [

 <sup>•+</sup> radical has been illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The percentage inhibition of both extracts increases with increasing concentrations. Indeed, at the concentration of 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, FVLE and FVRE showed significant inhibition of 96.27 ± 0.33% and 27.72 ± 0.80%, respectively. The results show that the FVLE also possesses the most powerful antioxidant activity (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) against the ABTS radical (
