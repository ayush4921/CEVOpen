<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the extracts was estimated using 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (
 <italic>p</italic>-NPG) as substrate [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extracts at different concentrations were mixed with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzyme solution (0.1 U/ml) prepared in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 6.7) and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, a portion (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of 1 mM substrate 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPG was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 1 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (1 M), and the absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. The percentage inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzyme of different concentrations of extracts was also measured using formula (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq2">2</xref>) described above, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated.
