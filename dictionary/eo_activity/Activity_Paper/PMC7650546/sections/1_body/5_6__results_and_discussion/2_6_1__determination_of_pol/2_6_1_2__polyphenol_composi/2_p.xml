<p>Polyphenol composition was different depending on the plant considered. 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> contained almost exclusively mangiferin and its derivatives as reported by Dantu et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This polyphenol, widely contained in mangos, is known to exert antioxidant activity and to inhibit both glucose uptake and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes such as α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The presence of this polyphenol supports the use of 
 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> for its antidiabetic properties in traditional medicine. 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> contains a majority of quercetin glycosides but also specific polyphenols such as ayapin, ayapanin and thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether, as previously described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. High concentrations of catechin, procyanidin, quercetin, isorhamnetin and coumaroyl quinic acid were found in 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>. These polyphenols are mostly flavonoids, recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid, quercetin hexoses and di-caffeoyl quinic acid derivatives were detected in 
 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic>. Hydroxybenzoic acids contained in 
 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic> also have an antioxidant and healing potential [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two major types of polyphenols were identified in 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic>: phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid and di-caffeoyl quinic acid and two types of flavonoid represented by quercetin hexoses and procyanidin isomers. For 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic>, polyphenols such as caffeoyl glucarate, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol hexoses were identified. Similarly, most of the identified polyphenols in 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> belong to the flavonoid family. 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> seed powder extracts exhibited the higher polyphenol content mainly represented by ellagitannins; vescalagin, castalagin, galloyl-hexoses, HHDP-hexose, galloyl tannin and ellagic acid were detected. This result highlights differences in polyphenol composition between fruit seeds, skin and pulp; indeed, Tavares et.al showed that 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> skin and pulp mainly contain anthocyanins, flavonols and flavanonols [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Finally, 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extracts contained quercetin hexoses, kaempferol derivatives and also asiatic acid. Interestingly, corosolic acid identified by Rangasamy et al. was not detected in our experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This difference may be due to different environmental conditions (temperature, altitude, biotope).
