<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f005">Figure 5</xref>, PRE, infusions and decoctions did not have any significant impact on cell necrosis at physiological (10 µM) and supraphysiological (25–50 µM) concentrations. The percentage of viable cells relative to controls assessed by neutral red assay did not show any impact of plant preparations on mortality or cell proliferation. At the doses tested (10–50 µM), our results showed that PRE, infusions and decoctions were not cytotoxic and did not induce proliferation (
