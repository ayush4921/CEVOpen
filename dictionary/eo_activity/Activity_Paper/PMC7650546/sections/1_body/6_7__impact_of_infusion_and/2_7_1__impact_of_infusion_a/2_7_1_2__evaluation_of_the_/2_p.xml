<p>Several reports emphasize on the use of medicinal plants and polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress damage notably in red blood cells [

 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To reproduce the conditions of an oxidative stress, AAPH was added to purified human red blood cells. Interactions between red blood cell membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids and AAPH-derived free radicals leads to membrane rupture and eventually hemolysis (detectable through a progressive decrease in optical density at 450 nm) [
