<p>Data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>B show that polyphenol concentrations ranged from 25 to 143 mg acid gallic equivalent (GAE)/L for infusions and 35â€“219 mg GAE/L for decoctions. Interestingly, polyphenol contents of infusions and decoctions (1 g/L) are comparable to that of a chocolate beverage with milk, soy milk or pure pomelo juice [

This result suggests that significant amounts of polyphenols can be extracted with water despite a low quantity of plant matrix (1 g/L). Indeed, plant infusions such as tea or medicinal plants can be prepared with more than 2 g of plant mash/L [

 <italic>A. theiformis, H. lanceolatum, S. cumini</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum,</italic> the decoction process yielded higher polyphenol contents. The difference of plant matrix immersion time and exposition at high temperature between the two modes of preparation can explain this result. Decoction process may allow the extraction of polyphenols from rigid tissues such as lignified tissues by promoting cell lysis.
