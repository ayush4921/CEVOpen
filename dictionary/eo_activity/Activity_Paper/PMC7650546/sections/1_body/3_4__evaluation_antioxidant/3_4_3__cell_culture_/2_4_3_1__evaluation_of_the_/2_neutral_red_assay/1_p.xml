<p>Cell viability was assessed by measuring the intake of the neutral red as described by Repetto and colleagues with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This test is based on the capacity of viable cell lysosomes to incorporate neutral red dye. After 24 h of incubation with medicinal plant PRE, infusions and decoctions, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. A Total of 100 µL of neutral red medium solution (40 µg/mL) was added and the plate was incubated for 2 h at RT. The medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Finally, neutral red destain solution (49.5% water, 49.5% ethanol, 1% glacial acetic acid) was added and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Results are expressed as % of control.
