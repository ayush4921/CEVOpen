<p>With regards to surface glycoproteins, neuraminidase of the virus plays an essential role in the release of virus from the infected cells by cleaving the terminal sialic acid residue from the host receptor and helps to release the newly synthesized progeny viruses. This protein has a highly conserved active site in both type A and type B of influenza viruses and is the target of neuraminidase inhibitors. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, which is accompanied by mutations in hemagglutinin, could affect the antigenicity of influenza viruses [
