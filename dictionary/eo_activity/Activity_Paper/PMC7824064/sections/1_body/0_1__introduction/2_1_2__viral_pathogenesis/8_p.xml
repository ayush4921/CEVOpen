<p>It has been reported that influenza virus is propagated in the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. The virus-infected cells are lysed by the cytocidal action of CTLs and NK cells in the local mucosal membrane. One of the mechanisms by which CTL exerts cytolytic activity is via perforin, a pore-forming protein, which is a main constituent of cytotoxic proteins involved in the granule exocytosis pathway. It plays a crucial role in the host defense mechanism against influenza virus infection, especially in its early stage, as the local respiratory defense by inducing apoptosis of virus-infected cells [
