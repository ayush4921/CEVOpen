<p>The effect of different models of oxidative stress, such as immobilization, cold and cold-restraint stress, was investigated on liver monooxygenase activity and lipid peroxidation in influenza virus-infected mice. These models, in combination with influenza virus infection, were associated with graduated oxidative disturbances in the livers of mice, which might be related to the production of hepatotoxic mediators outside of liver and their transportation and diffusion to the liver. In addition, these models were accompanied with a significant increase in lipid peroxidation products, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a decrease in natural antioxidants (including vitamin E, glutathione) and cytochrome P-450, a cytochrome c reductase, and liver monooxygenases [

At a later stage, following influenza A virus (A/Aichi/2/68/H3N2) infection, several disorganizations were recorded in lung and blood: Increase in total MDA in lung, progressive damage of the alveolar cells, acute inflammatory reactions, development of bronchitis and pneumonia, lung disorder associated with release of cytokines and massive infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the alveolar space, conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase, decrease in PaO
 <sub>2</sub> and development of hypoxia, increase in PaCO
 <sub>2</sub> and development of metabolic acidosis, eicosanoids and prostaglandin E2 and enhanced immune response, oxidative stress in lung tissue and blood, accumulation of methemoglobin in blood and nitric oxide in lung, free radicals production, increase in conjugated dienes, decrease in blood vitamin E, as well as intensive generation of free radicals mostly in the early stage of influenza virus infection in blood and lung. The promising effect of vitamin E supplementation was dose dependent in blood, but dose independent in lung [
