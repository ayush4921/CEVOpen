<p>Savov et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] examined the effects of rutin and quercetin on oxidative stress in healthy and the experimental influenza virus (A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2))-infected mice. These flavonoids were injected intraperitoneally 3 days before and 2 days after the viral inoculation. Flu infection caused ROS and free radical generation in the 5th day after the viral inoculation. Viral infection increased the concentration of TBARS, suppressed cytochrome P-450, inhibited the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, slightly induced the activity of amidopyrine-N-demethylase (APND), and decreased analgin-N-demethylase (ANND) enzyme and monooxygenase activities. Although flavonoids are known for their antioxidant activities, rutin and quercetin exhibited pro-oxidant effect and caused oxidative damage in healthy mice, but still showed antioxidant activity in infected animals. Antioxidant effect of quercetin was stronger than rutin on the content of TBARS in the lungs, liver, brain, and blood plasma of influenza-infected mice. This biphasic effect might be due to several factors such as metabolic and physiological activities, as well as chemical structure. Thus, both were recommended for the treatment after infection, but not for prophylaxis and protection [
