<p>It has been shown previously that exercise stress can increase the risk of and susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections [

Short-term quercetin feeding was suggested as an effective strategy to reduce susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infection following stressful exercise in the controlled experimental study. The researchers subjected 4-week-old male ICR mice to running on a treadmill for 3 consecutive days to the point of fatigue (140 min). Quercetin (12.5 mg/kg) was given via gavage for 7 days before viral challenge. At 30 min, after the last set of exercise or rest, mice were inoculated intranasally with a standardized dose (0.04 hemagglutinating units) of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and monitored daily for 21 days. The exercise was associated with increased susceptibility to infection, based on morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity on days 5â€“7 (
