<p>Regarding structural variations, the reaction of quercetin with bromine was also evaluated under various conditions like glacial acetic acid at 35–40 °C and absolute ethanol at 0–5 °C and 20–22 °C, which yielded with more than 90% of purity compounds. The compound QR 6,8-dibromide (52–54% yields, 96–98% purity by HPLC) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1/pdm09 in MDCK cells (EC50 6.0 µg/mL, CC
 <sub>50</sub> 97.7 µg/mL, selectivity index: 16) [
