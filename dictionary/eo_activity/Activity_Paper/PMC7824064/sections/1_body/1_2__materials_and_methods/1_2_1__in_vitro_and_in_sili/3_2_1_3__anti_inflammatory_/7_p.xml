<p>Further research focused on the specific mechanism of virus–host interactions. MDCK cells were exposed to various combinations of quercetin-3-

 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside and H1N1. Other cytokines (IL-6 and CCL-2, both pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IFN-β as anti-inflammatory cytokine) were evaluated at RNA and protein levels. The expression of IL-6 and CCL-2 at genome and protein levels were significantly affected by quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside, especially upon copenetration treatment. Regarding IFN-β, no significant difference was observed at the protein level between H1N1 inoculation and combined treatments. It can be due to intracellular viral NS1 protein that prevents the induction of beta interferon [

 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside did not act through IFNs [
