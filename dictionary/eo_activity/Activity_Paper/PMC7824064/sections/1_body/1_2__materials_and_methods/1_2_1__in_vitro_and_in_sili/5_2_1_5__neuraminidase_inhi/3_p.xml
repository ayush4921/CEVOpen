<p>Six flavonoids (quercetin-3-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-sambubioside, kaempferol-3-neohesperidoside, kaempferol-3-glucoside, and luteolin) and one alkaloid (chelianthifoline) were isolated from bee pollen methanol extract of Korean 
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> plant and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry [

 <xref rid="B134-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. It is rich in vitamins, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, and various organic compounds. Some biological activities such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, antifungal, anticancer, antiallergy, chemopreventive, and antimutagenic activities have also been reported. All these compounds showed NA inhibitory activity against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 and reduced the cytopathic effects of these viruses in MDCK cells. The inhibition of NA by quercetin-3-sophoroside had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 88.3 ± 3.0, 75.1 ± 8.7, and 112.8 ± 8.2 µM for H1N1, H5N1, and H3N2, respectively. The selectivity index obtained was about 8. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B133-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] suggested that a bulky sugar moiety on quercetin-3-sophoroside and other flavonoids decreased their NA inhibitory activity compared to the aglycone compounds.
