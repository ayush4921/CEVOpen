<p>Quercetin, baicalein, chlorogenic acid, and oleanolic acid were tested in molecular docking to explore their binding ability to NA of H7N9. They showed high binding potential with NA, which even exceeds that of oseltamivir. The mutation R294K caused conformational changes in NA structure and induced oseltamivir resistance, while other compounds showed stable binding with mutated NA, which renders them potential agents to overcome the drug resistance of the mutant virus [
