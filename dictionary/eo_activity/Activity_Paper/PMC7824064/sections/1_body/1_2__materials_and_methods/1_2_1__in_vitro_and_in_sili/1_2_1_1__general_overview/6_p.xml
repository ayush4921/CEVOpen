<p>To investigate the effect of structural changes on the quercetin activity, various C3, C3â€², and C5 hydroxyl group substituted quercetin derivatives were synthesized with various phenolic ester, alkoxy, and aminoalkoxy moieties and their anti-H1N1 activities were investigated against A/swine/OH/511445/2007 (H1N1), Oh7. The synthesized C3-analog, quercetin-3-gallate, which was structurally related to EGCG, showed favorable antiviral activity against influenza virus in MDCK cell culture comparable to that of EGCG, reducing cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cells with higher in vitro therapeutic index. The results imply that further modification at C3 functional group may play an essential role in improving the compound efficacy [
