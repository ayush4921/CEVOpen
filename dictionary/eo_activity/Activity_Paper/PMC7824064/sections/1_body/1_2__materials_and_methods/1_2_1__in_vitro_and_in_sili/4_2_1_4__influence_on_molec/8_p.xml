<p>Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] investigated the antiviral activity of Aloe vera ethanolic extract and its components quercetin, catechin hydrate, and kaempferol, all identified by UPLC-MS/MS, against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains in vitro [
 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. A variety of pharmacological properties have been reported for Aloe vera, including antibacterial [

 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] showed in their study that this extract inhibited autophagy, which was otherwise induced by influenza A virus in MDCK cells, while treatment with individual extract components (including quercetin) inhibited M2 mRNA and protein expression.
