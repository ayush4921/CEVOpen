<p>The structure–activity relationship (SAR) of quercetin was analyzed in the Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] to investigate the antiviral activity of polyphenol-rich extracts containing quercetin against influenza A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/1940 viruses. Two mechanisms were assumed for the antiviral activity of compounds on both influenza A and B viruses, i.e., one is at the early stage by blocking the viral binding to the cell receptors, whereas the other is after the entry by attenuation of viral replication. It has been shown for in vitro NA inhibition assay that rigid flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin) have stronger inhibitory effects than flexible ones (catechin and epicatechin) [

One hydroxyl at C-4′ position in the B ring, a double bond at C-2–C-3, and a ketone at the C-4 position is essential for inhibiting influenza virus as NA inhibitor. However, the presence of more hydroxyl in the B ring, such as quercetin and myricetin, causes steric interference and disfavors the anti-influenza effect [
