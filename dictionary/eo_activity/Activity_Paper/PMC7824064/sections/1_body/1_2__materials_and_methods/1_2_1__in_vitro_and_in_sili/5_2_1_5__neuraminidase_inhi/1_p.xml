<p>The inhibitory potency of several flavonoid derivatives has been evaluated on neuraminidase activity (NA) of different types of influenza virus. In a study by Rakers et al., 2014, the neuraminidase inhibitory activity of flavonoids was investigated against NA of A/California/7/09 (A/H1N1/pdm09), A/Perth/16/09 (A(H3N2))) and B/Brisbane/60/08 compared to the oseltamivir. The experimental findings and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed moderate inhibition of the flavonoids on NA activity. The extent and sites of glycosylation of the flavonoids showed no significant influence on their inhibitory potency [
