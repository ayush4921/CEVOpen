<p>Vaidya et al., 2016, evaluated the antiviral potential of biochemical components present in Kimchi, with particular focus on quercetin. Kimchi is a traditional fermented food commonly consumed in Korea. Its primary ingredients are onion, garlic, ginger, salt, and red pepper. It contains various antimicrobial compounds such as capsaicin, allicin, and quercetin [

The authors investigated the effect of periodic quercetin treatments against influenza A virus H1N1 (low pathogenic human IAV H1N1 strain A/PR/8/34) in MDCK cells by evaluating the protein expression modulation. Significantly higher cell viability, lower expression of the influenza PA gene, reduced apoptosis, and reduced cell death were observed in cells subjected to periodic treatment compared with cells at the pretreatment stage. A comparative proteomics analysis approach was used to examine 220 proteins so as to elucidate the complex interactions between the virus and the host. The levels of 56 proteins were differentially modulated by quercetin treatment in influenza-infected cells, and post-translational modifications were identified in a total of 68 proteins. The periodic treatment of quercetin was influential in the regulation of key protein expression. The major regulatory proteins identified in this study included FN1, HSPs, PHB, TUBA1C, and TUBA4A, all of which are associated with cell and IAV interaction network. Moreover, post-translational modification of CCT4, EIF3A, HSPA2, and TUBB2B could also be involved in controlling IAV replication [
