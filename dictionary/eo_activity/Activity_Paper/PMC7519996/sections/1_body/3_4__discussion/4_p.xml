<p>The mitigation of decreases in releases of endothelial NO observed following treatment with 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> in this study suggests that the extract mediated its antihypertensive activity at least partly by improving NO bioavailability [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, in this study, 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract prevented hypertension-like impairment of antioxidant defenses indicated by marked decreases in nitrite levels, reduced glutathione levels, and catalase activity, and increases in levels of lipid peroxidation indicator malondialdehyde in the heart, aorta, and kidneys in hypertensive control rats [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These observations suggest that 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract has antioxidant properties. Such properties may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of the extract, considering the pivotal role of oxidative stress in the development of hypertension in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats [
