 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> also shows the effects of concomitant treatment with L-NAME and either the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> or captopril on the relative weight of the heart, the left ventricle, and kidneys. The relative weights of the heart and of left ventricle were increased significantly (27.67 %, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and 48.07%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively) in hypertensive control animals (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Treatment with captopril and plant extract doses 100 and 200 mg/kg mitigated this increase (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Relative weight of kidneys was also increased significantly in the hypertensive control group (0.79 ± 0.05 vs. 0.59 ± 0.05 g/100 g BW in the normotensive control group, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This detrimental change was prevented in groups receiving the extract at doses 100 or 200 mg/kg, or captopril (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
