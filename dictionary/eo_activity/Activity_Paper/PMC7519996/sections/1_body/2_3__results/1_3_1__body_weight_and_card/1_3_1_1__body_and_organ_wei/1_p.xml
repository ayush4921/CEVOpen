 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the changes in body weight before and after 3 weeks of concomitant treatment with L-NAME and either the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> or captopril. A marked decrease in body weight growth was observed in the hypertensive control group (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The aqueous extract at all doses tested and captopril mitigated this decrease. Gains of 23.36% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 94.13% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 27.02% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were observed with doses 100 and 200â€‰mg/kg, and captopril, respectively, was compared to the hypertensive control group (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
