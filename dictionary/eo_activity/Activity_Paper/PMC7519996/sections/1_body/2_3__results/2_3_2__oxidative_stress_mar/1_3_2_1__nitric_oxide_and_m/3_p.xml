<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>, hypertensive control animals displayed significant increases in malondialdehyde levels in the aorta (53.48%,

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but not in the heart, as compared to the normotensive control group (

 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract displayed significantly lower levels of malondialdehyde in the heart (37.22%,
