 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the blood lipid profile of animals treated daily and concomitantly with L-NAME and either the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> or captopril for 3 weeks. The hypertensive control animals displayed significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increases in blood total cholesterol (23.31%), triglycerides (53.61%), LDL-cholesterol (61.31%), and decrease in HDL-cholesterol (63.04%) compared to the normotensive control group (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Extract dose 200â€‰mg/kg significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) prevented the increases in total cholesterol (26.34% difference from the hypertensive control group) and in triglycerides (25.64% difference), and decrease in HDL-cholesterol (52.41% difference) (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Captopril mitigated only slightly the increases in triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and decrease in HDL-cholesterol mediated by L-NAME treatment (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
