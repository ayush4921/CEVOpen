 <p>Secondary metabolites isolated from plant endophytic fungi have been getting more and more attention. Some secondary metabolites exhibit high biological activities, hence, they have potential to be used for promising lead compounds in drug discovery. In this review, a total of 134 journal articles (from 2017 to 2019) were reviewed and the chemical structures of 449 new metabolites, including polyketides, terpenoids, steroids and so on, were summarized. Besides, various biological activities and structure-activity relationship of some compounds were aslo described.</p>
