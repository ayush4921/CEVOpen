<p>Because the compounds mentioned above were isolated from endophytic fungi in different parts of different plants in different regions, they have a variety of structures and biological activities. In addition to anti-tumor and anti-microbial activities, some compounds also exhibit unique biological activities. Among them, 7 compounds showed weak to moderate AChE inhibitory activity. Some compounds exhibited moderate to potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity compared with those of positive control. By using adapted 2,2′-diphenyl-b-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, a few of compounds were found to show moderate to remarkable antioxidant activity. Some of them also showed weak to significant inhibitory activity against NO production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. The biological activity properties of 18 compounds were evaluated for inhibitory activity against some enzymes like pancreatic lipase, the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase B (MptpB), the xanthine oxidase (XO) and so on, they showed weak to high inhibition.</p>
