<p>In this review, 449 new secondary metabolites, together with their chemical structures and biological activities were summarized. The structure-activity relationships and absolute configureuration of some compounds have also been described. Among all new compounds, terpenoids account for the largest proportion (75%), followed by polyketones (36%). The proportion of different types of compounds in all new compounds is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>. These new compounds were isolated from various fungi associated with different tissues from different plants. As a result, their structures varied a lot, which leads to their multitudinous biological activities. In addition to common antimicrobial activity and anti-tumor activity, some compounds also showed anti-enzyme activity and inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of phytoplankton growth, and so on.
