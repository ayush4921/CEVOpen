<p>Standard MTT assays employing MDA-MB-435 and A549 cell lines were performed. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined by a 50% reduction of the absorbance in the control assay. Compound 
 <bold>176</bold> exhibited cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-435 and A549 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 16.82 and 20.75 µM, respectively. The positive control was used by Epirubicin (EPI) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.26 and 5.60 µM against MDA-MB-435 and A549 cell lines [
