<p>The anti-tumor activities of compounds 
 <bold>336</bold>–
 <bold>337</bold> were evaluated against Ramos and H1975 cell lines. 
 <bold>337</bold> displayed the most promising anti-tumor activity against both Ramos and H1975 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.018 µM and 0.252 µM, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>337</bold> may be more effective in anti-tumor activity against Ramos and H1975 than stand drug Ibrutinib and afatinib, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 28.7 µM and 1.97 µM. These findings suggest that compound 
 <bold>337</bold> might be promising lead for leukemia and lung cancer treatments. In addition, 
 <bold>336</bold> also displayed anti-tumor activity against both Ramos and H1975 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.98 and 7.3 µM, respectively [
