<p>Compound 
 <bold>119</bold> was evaluated for antibacterial activities in vitro against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (DSM 799), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (DSM 1116), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (DSM 682), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (DSM 1088) and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. (DSM 586)). It was active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with an MIC value of 0.1 μg/mL. Streptomycin and Gentamicin were used as references against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with MIC values of 5.0 μg/mL and 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. Comparison of 
 <bold>119</bold> with 
 <bold>118</bold> (&gt;10.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and confirmed that the substitution at C-11 plays an important role in increasing the antibacterial activity against the selected bacterium [
