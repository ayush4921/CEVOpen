<p>Three fungi (
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) were used in antifungal activity tests by disk diffusion method, the antifungal activity was recorded as clear zones of inhibition surrounding the disc (mm). Compound 
 <bold>362</bold> showed antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (zone of inhibition was 6 mm) and variable activities against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and the yeast 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (zone of inhibition was 5 mm). Nystatin (10 mg/disc) was used as standard antifungal (zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> were 12 mm and 17 mm) [
