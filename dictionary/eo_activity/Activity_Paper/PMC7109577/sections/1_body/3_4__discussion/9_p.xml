<p>Antiproliferative effect of hydroethanolic extract

 <italic>europaea</italic> and its fractions was tested against two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB231 and MCF-7. The tested concentration on the MDA-MB-231 cell line ranged from 15.6 to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The flavonoids fraction reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner after 48 h of treatment, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 43.62 ± 0.006 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Antitumor activity of this extract can be attributed to the identified compounds with the HPLC method, as previously reported, such as hesperetin, quercetin, myricetin, and ferulic acid. With the same range of concentration, saponins fraction seems to be very effective against cell lines; however, mucilage fraction and hydroethanolic extract were ineffective. Antiproliferative effects of saponins and flavonoids fractions were tested again with lower concentrations ranging from 1.562 to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on MCF7 and MDA-MB- 231 cell lines. Saponins clearly exhibited significant antiproliferative activity on both cell lines, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.097 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 4.195 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml against MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively.
