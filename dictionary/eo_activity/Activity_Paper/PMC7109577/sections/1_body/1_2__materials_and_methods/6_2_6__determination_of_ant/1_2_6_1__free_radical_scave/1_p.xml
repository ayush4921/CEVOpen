<p>The test of DPPH was performed using the methods reported in [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with slight modifications. A solution of the DPPH was prepared by dissolving 100 ml of methanol and 2.4 mg DPPH. 980 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of DPPH solution (60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) was mixed with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of an extract with concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g ml
 <sup>−1</sup>. After 2 h of incubation, the absorbance was determined at 517 nm. BHT (10 to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as a positive control. The percentage of inhibition of DPPH was calculated using the formula given as follows:
