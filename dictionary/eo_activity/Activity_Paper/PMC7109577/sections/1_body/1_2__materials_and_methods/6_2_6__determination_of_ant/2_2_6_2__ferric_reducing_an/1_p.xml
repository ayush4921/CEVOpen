<p>The FRAP method determines the capacity of antioxidants to reduce Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup>. 1 ml of extract was dissolved with 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 2.5 ml of potassium ferricyanide (1%). After incubation for 20 min at 50°C, 2.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added. The obtained solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Then, 2.5 ml of the supernatant was combined with 0.5 ml of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1%) and 2.5 ml of distilled water. The absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 700 nm. Ascorbic acid was considered as a reference [
