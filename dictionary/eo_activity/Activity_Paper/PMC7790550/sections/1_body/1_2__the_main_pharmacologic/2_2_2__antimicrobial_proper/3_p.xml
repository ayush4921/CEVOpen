<p>In addition, quercetin can prevent bacterial adhesion, inhibit quorum sensing pathways, destroy or change the plasma membrane, inhibit efflux pumps, and block nucleic acid synthesis. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] confirmed that quercetin inhibits the formation of 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> biofilms. Qayyum et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that quercetin was effective against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729</italic> at the subminimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to elucidate that quercetin inhibited 95% of biofilm formation at 1/2 × MIC (256 g/mL). Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that a quercetin-pivaloxymethyl conjugate (Q-POM) at 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL inhibited 70% of biofilm establishment by a vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolate. Vazquez-Armenta et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] found that quercetin would hinder the abiotic surface colonisation of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> at concentrations below the MIC. In addition, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] obtained that quercetin has an inhibitory effect on genes related to bacterial adhesion. Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that quercetin could significantly inhibit the production of biofilms of a methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain (MSSA) ATCC 6538 after 24 h at concentrations of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
