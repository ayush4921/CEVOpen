<p>Quercetin, the name coming from quercetum (oak forest), named after Quercus, has been applied since 1857. It is widely found in plants in nature, including apples, berries, brassica vegetables, capers, grapes, onions, spring onions, tea, and tomatoes, as well as in many seeds, nuts, flowers, bark, and leaves [

 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>, and elderberry [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and is mainly derived from onions, apples, and tea [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Its molecular formula is C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, and the chemical structural formula is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It is a naturally occurring polar auxin transport inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Quercetin has a ketocarbonyl group in its molecule, and the oxygen atom on the first carbon is basic and can generate salts with strong acids. Its molecular structure contains four active groups, namely, a dihydroxy group between the A ring, o-dihydroxy group B, C ring C2, C3 double bond, and 4-carbonyl. The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and double bonds endows quercetin with a strong antioxidant activity. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are closely related to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In addition, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have found that quercetin also has antibacterial activity and effectively reduces the formation of biofilms by inhibiting the expression of related genes, antitumour activity, antiangiogenic activity, etc. In addition, quercetin plays an important role in reducing mycotoxins, protecting cells from damage. We have selected and analysed the key aspects of the biological functions of quercetin and its potential applications in clinical medicine to reach a unified understanding of its various functions. This review is designed to help with further research, and its nature is to provide some insights and enlightenment, providing a scientific basis for its better clinical application.
