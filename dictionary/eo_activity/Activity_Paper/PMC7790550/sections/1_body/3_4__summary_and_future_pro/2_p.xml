<p>The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of quercetin can be used in the prevention and treatment of various infectious bacterial diseases and can provide treatment options to reduce the use of antibiotics, which has important implications for the safety and sustainable development of human and animal health: however, at present, research into the antibacterial effect of quercetin is mainly focused on the antibacterial activity of quercetin, but there is little research on the antifungal effect. Whether the antibacterial mechanism of quercetin is akin to those of fungi and bacteria or whether it has inhibitory effects on different types of fungi still needs further experimental research.</p>
