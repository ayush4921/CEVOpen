<p>Quercetin pretreatment can inhibit aflatoxin-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, mainly by activating Nrf2 pathway to regulate changes to the antioxidant defence system induced by Aspergillus. In addition, quercetin also shows antigenic toxicity potential by reducing DNA damage and micronucleus (MN) damage induced by the Aspergillus toxin. Ramyaa et al. [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] first found that quercetin pretreatment can inhibit ochratoxin-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Schoneberg et al. [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] found that the contents of NO, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-8 of ochratoxin were significantly reduced in samples pretreated with quercetin, indicating that quercetin had anti-inflammatory effects. It has been proved that quercetin has a cytoprotective effect on ochratoxin-induced oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and lymphocyte inflammation [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Bollina and Kushalappa [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] found that the addition of quercetin at a concentration of 2.95 mM reduced the production of deoxynivalenol (DON) by 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum in vitro</italic>, but no obvious concentration response was found in mycotoxins. The protective effects of quercetin on key mycotoxin toxicities and their mechanism are summarised in
