<p>Quercetin can control dyslipidaemia, and changes in fatty liver functions are essential for controlling serum fat levels. Gnoni et al. investigated the effect of quercetin on rat hepatocyte fat production [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The experiment found that the addition of quercetin to liver cells at a concentration of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, within 30 minutes could inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] found that 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M 7-O-sialic acid (QA) can protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, study showed that quercetin (10 mg/kg) orally administered to rats for seven consecutive days protected them from experimental myocardial infarction [

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] demonstrated that quercetin could downregulate the expression of C-reactive protein and cardiovascular risk factors (SAA, fibrinogen) in mice. These results indicated that quercetin might have cardiovascular protective effects.
