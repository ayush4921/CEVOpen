<p>Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] conducted experiments in different animal models and found that quercetin inhibited the production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and lung A549 cells LPS-induced IL-8 production [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, it has even been shown in glia cells that quercetin can suppress LPS-induced mRNA levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and interleukin- (IL-) 1
 <italic>α</italic>: neuronal cell death is also reduced [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Quercetin can inhibit the enzymes that produce inflammation (cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX)) [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].
