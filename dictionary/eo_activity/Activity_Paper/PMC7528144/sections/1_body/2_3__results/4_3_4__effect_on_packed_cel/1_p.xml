<p>While the mean PCV in the untreated control group continued to decrease until all the animals died due to infection, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of the extract and DA 3.35 mg/kg show an increase in mean PCV values from day 0 to day 12 treatment follow-up. PCV measurement in blood of infected mice treated with 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> at a dose of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg and DA 3.35 mg/kg showed statistically significant (
