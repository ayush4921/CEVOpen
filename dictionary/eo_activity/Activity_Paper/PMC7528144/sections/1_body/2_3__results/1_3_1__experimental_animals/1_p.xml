<p>Parasite load, body temperature, and weight of animals were recorded. When the parasite load increased and confirmed that experimental animals could not survive due to infection, inhalation anesthetic in a transparent euthanasia chamber was used for humane euthanasia of experimental animals. Data set collected from solvent control and low-dose-extract-treated groups were only for few days (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) due to rapid increment of parasite load.
