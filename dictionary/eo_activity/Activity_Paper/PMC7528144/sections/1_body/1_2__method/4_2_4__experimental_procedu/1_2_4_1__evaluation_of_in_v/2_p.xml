<p>Phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.2) and standard trypanocidal drug, diminazene aceturate (DA), were used to serve as untreated control and treated controls, respectively. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for up to 3 h. During the period, motility of the parasites was checked in a 20-min interval under a microscope (×40 objective lens). In brief, about 2
