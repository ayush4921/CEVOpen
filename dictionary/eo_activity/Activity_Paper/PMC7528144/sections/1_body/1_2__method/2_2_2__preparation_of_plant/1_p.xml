<p>Air-dried powder of the plant material was macerated in an Erlenmeyer flask with 80% methanol at room temperature for a period of 72 hours. A total of 500 gm of dried plant material was used for extraction. A total of it was then filtered with gauze followed by Whatman filter paper (No. 1). The residue was remacerated once again to increase the yield. The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator at 40°C to remove methanol. Then, the concentrated filtrate was lyophilized to remove water to get dry power. The yield of hydromethanolic extract of
