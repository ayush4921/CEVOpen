<p>The present study showed that the 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract contains secondary metabolites: saponins, tannins, phenol, terpenes, flavonoids, glycosides, and alkaloids. The responsible active components were yet to be isolated. Previous studies showed that flavonoids are effective antitrypanosomal substances against different trypanosome species [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Phenolics and polyphenols have also been reported to have antitrypanosomal activity by inhibiting the trypanosome alternative oxidase [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Alkaloids affect trypanosomes by DNA intercalation in combination with the inhibition of protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of the 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract in the present study might be contributed by multiple secondary metabolites.
