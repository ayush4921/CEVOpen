<p>All the cells including 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell, L6 muscle cell, and BRIN BD11 pancreatic cells were obtained from Dr. Muhajir Hamid, Animal Cell Culture Laboratory, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia. BRIN BD11 cells were cultured in RPMI growth medium supplemented with 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) foetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco/BRL), 100 µg mL − 1 penicillin and 10 µg mL − 1 streptomycin (Gibco/BRL) at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were passaged every 5–7 days. L6 muscle cell and 3T3 adipose cell is maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% inactivated Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 g/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C until confluent. The passage number of cell used was between 20 to 30.
