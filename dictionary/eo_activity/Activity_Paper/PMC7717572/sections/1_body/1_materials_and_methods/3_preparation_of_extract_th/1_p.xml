<p>Subcritical water extraction (SWE) was carried out using a batch system comprising of a SEPAREX piston pump (P200 LGP50, France), an electrical control panel and an extraction vessel. The total volume of the high-pressure stainless steel vessel was 50 ml, thus, it was filled with about 2 g of the 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root and fruit extract respectively. Similar to what was done in our previous research work, the independent variables were measured at optimum conditions which were set at 180 °C for 30 min of extraction time

 </xref>. All other parameters were held constant, comprising of an extraction pressure of 100 bar, the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and water to the solvent ratio of 1:10 
 <italic>w/v</italic>. After extraction, the extraction vessel was cooled and depressurised. The obtained extracts were then concentrated by drying in a freeze dryer to remove any excess water completely. The pure extract was then stored in a dark place at 4 °C for further analysis.
