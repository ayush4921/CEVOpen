<p>LC-MS analysis was performed using MS-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) coupled to an HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). A C18 column (125 × 2 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) was used. The mobile phase was composed of water (A, 6% acetic acid) in acetonitrile (B, 1% acetic acid), the gradient is as follows: 2–5.00 min; 100% A, 5–10 min 60% A, 10–15 min 50% A, 15–20 min 20%. The sample injection volume was 10 μl and the mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The column of chromatography was kept at 30 °C. Based on the available mass spectra found in the literature libraries, the identified recognised active compounds are significantly identified.</p>
