<p>The inhibitory potential of DPP (IV) by root and fruit of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> that also being compared with marketed synthetic drugs,sitagliptin which was used as a positive control in this assay was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. The test concentration used was in the range from 250 to 3000 μg/ml. From the results, 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root extracts had recorded an inhibitory potential of DPP (IV) from 7.02 ± 0.52% to 66.15 ± 4.09% while fruit extract had inhibitory potential from 2.69 ± 0.25% to 42.79 ± 1.47%. DPP (IV) inhibitory potential of standard drugs, sitagliptin was found to be from 17.94 ± 4.73% to 86.96 ± 1.60%. The maximum inhibition that was achieved for root, fruits, and drugs at the highest concentration, 3 mg/ml were 66.15, 42.79, and 86.96% respectively. The results also showed that as increasing the extract’s concentration, the percentage of inhibition was also increased. There was a significant difference for the sample extracts and drugs, as were observed in all tested concentrations.
