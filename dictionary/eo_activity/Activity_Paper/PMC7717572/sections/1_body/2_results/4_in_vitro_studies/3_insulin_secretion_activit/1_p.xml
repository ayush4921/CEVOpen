<p>The secretion of insulin assay was conducted by using the BRIN-BD11 cell line, which is a clonal insulin-secreting cell that responds to a variety of insulin-secreting pharmacological modulators. This cell line is mainly used to examine the 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> extracts upon the insulin secretion mechanism assay. Insulin release by BRIN-BD11 cells was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner for both extracts as the sample concentration (0.125–1 mg/ml) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). In this mechanism of the assay, glibenclamide (oral antidiabetic drugs) acted as positive control. However, the concentration of glibenclamide was standardises at 0.5 mg/ml. Root extract subsequently increase with 5.02 ± 1.42 μg/ml, 7.32 ± 2.23 μg/ml, 11.48 ± 0.51 μg/ml, 13.74 ± 0.57 μg/ml at concentration 125, 250, 500, 1000 μg/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the secretion of insulin for fruit extract also subsequently increase with 5.16 ± 0.79, 5.96 ± 1.29, 7.91 ± 0.79, 11.06 ± 0.35 μg/ml at concentration 125, 250, 500, 1000 μg/ml, respectively. Even though root extract shows a slightly higher secretion of insulin as compared with glibenclamide that recorded with 12.88 ± 0.79 μg/ml at a concentration (500 μg/ml), but the extract concentration was 2-fold higher than glibenclamide. However, both of the extracts showed a positive result by having an increased insulin release that comparable with glibenclamide results.
