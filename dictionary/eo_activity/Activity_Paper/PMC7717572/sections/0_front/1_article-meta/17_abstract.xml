 <p>The inhibition of α-glucosidase and DPP enzymes capable of effectively reducing blood glucose level in the management of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory potential of α-glucosidase and DPP (IV) activity including with the 
  <italic>2-</italic>NBDG uptake assay and insulin secretion activities through 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The selected of active compounds obtained from the screening of compounds by LC-MS were docked with the targeted enzyme that involved in the mechanism of T2DM. From the results, root extracts displayed a better promising outcome in α-glucosidase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 2.72 ± 0.32) as compared with the fruit extracts (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 3.87 ± 0.32). Besides, root extracts also displayed a better activity in the inhibition of DPP (IV), enhance insulin secretion and glucose uptake activity. Molecular docking results revealing that phlorizin binds strongly with α-glucosidase, DPP (IV) and Insulin receptor (IR) enzymes with achieving the lowest binding energy value. The present work suggests several of the compounds have the potential that contribute towards inhibiting α-glucosidase and DPP (IV) and thus effective in lowering post-prandial hyperglycaemia.
