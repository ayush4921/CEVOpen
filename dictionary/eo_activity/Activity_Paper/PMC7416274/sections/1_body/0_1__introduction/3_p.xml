<p>Recent studies have shown the potential of natural extracts as the basis for new drugs [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Microorganisms and plants have exceptional chemical and structural diversity and represent a valuable source of biologically active molecules with potential as new antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, ursolic acid and hydroquinone, isolated from methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Artemisia capillaris</italic>, inhibit the growth of susceptible and resistant strains of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and have promise as potential chemotherapeutic agents [

Ethnopharmacological research helps to focus screening efforts by identifying groups of plants that are used in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases. Screening performed with extracts of medicinal plants used in India, Mexico, and South Africa [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated that some of these extracts have high activity for inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and other mycobacteria.
