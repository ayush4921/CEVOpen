<p>In Venezuela, many indigenous and local communities continue to use plants for medicinal purposes, but few of these plants have been evaluated for their antituberculosis activity. We were particularly interested in extracts that inhibited the activity of PknB, a serine/threonine kinase that appears to be essential in 
 <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>. However, compounds found to inhibit enzyme activity with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screens can, for a variety of reasons, fail to inhibit the growth of the whole bacteria. Therefore, in this study, we selected 118 extracts from 58 plant species used in traditional Venezuelan medicine and tested their ability to inhibit the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> serine/threonine-protein kinase PknB and also their ability to inhibit the growth of
