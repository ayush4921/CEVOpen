<p>Similarly, the plant parts of 
 <italic>H. dilatata</italic> and 
 <italic>E. parvifolia</italic> whose extracts had the greatest capacity to inhibit kinase activity were not the parts of these plants that were best at inhibiting bacterial growth (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This could suggest that the molecules that inhibit kinase activity are different from those that mediate growth inhibition. Another possibility is that molecules that inhibit kinase activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> have trouble penetrating the bacterial cell wall to inhibit the enzyme in live bacteria. Nevertheless, our study shows that 
 <italic>C. americana, H. dilatata,</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>parvifolia</italic> are promising species for molecules with antituberculosis potential.
