<p>Chlorophylls and their derivatives have been extensively studied with emphasis on their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimutagenic effects against numerous dietary and environmental mutagens [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and were shown to possess anticancer properties and could play significant roles in cancer prevention [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The concentrations of the contents of seaweed pigments (total carotenoids, chlorophylls 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic>) in the present study clearly demonstrated that marine seaweed-derived pigments were important free radical scavengers able to diminish cancer development.
