<p>The major photosynthetic pigments, total carotenoids content, and chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> in seaweed samples studied are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and expressed as 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> dry weight (DW). From the results, the total concentration of carotenoids was comparable and significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the highest in 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> (162.00 ± 0.84 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), followed by 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> (117.36 ± 1.30 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW). Total carotenoid content was detected as significantly the lowest in 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> (45.28 ± 1.77 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) among the seaweed species studied. Present data show that chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic> was the richest in green algae, 
 <italic>U. intestinalis</italic> (292.52 ± 8.84 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), and the lowest chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic> data was measured in brown algae, 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> (111.29 ± 2.28 
 <italic>μ</italic>gg
 <sup>−1</sup> DW).
