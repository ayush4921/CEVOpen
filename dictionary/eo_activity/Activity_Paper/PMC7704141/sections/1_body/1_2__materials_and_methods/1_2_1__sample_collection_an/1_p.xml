<p>All seaweed samples were collected between September 2015 and September 2016 during low tides (&lt;0.09 meters) from three different locations in Malaysia as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. All samples were collected based on the locations where they were most abundant. Collected seaweed samples were cleaned of extraneous materials like epiphytes, sand particles, pebbles, and shells using a soft bristle brush and washed thoroughly with seawater. The samples were divided into two portions. The first portion was taken into the herbarium for taxonomic identification. The taxonomic identification was done by cross-referencing with taxonomic books, monographs, and reference herbaria.
