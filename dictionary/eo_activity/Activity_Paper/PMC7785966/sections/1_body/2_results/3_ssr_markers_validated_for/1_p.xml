<p>We randomly selected 146 pairs of SSR primers for primary screening by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, among which 42 pairs of primers failed to amplify. The remaining primers were further screened using the fluorescent capillary electrophoresis detection method, and 17 pairs of SSR primers with high amplification efficiency, good reproducibility, and high polymorphism were retained for the overall genetic analysis (
