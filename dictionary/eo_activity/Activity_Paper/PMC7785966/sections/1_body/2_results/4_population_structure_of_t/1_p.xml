<p>The genetic correlation coefficients between the 208 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples varied from 0.72 to 0.94, suggesting a similarly genetic background of them. The UPGMA cluster analysis revealed two groups of samples, of which one group included the materials collected from the Puling and Gaofeng locations, while the other group included samples mainly from the Langping (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The PCoA plot showed a similar result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis explained 27.44% of the variation, while the second principal coordinate accounted for 17.27% of the variation. The vast majority of the Puling and Gaofeng germplasms were concentrated together in the PCoA plat, while those from Langping were concentrated in another cluster (

 <italic>K</italic> = 2 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), suggesting two main genetic groups present for the 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples investigated. Similarly, the germplasms from the Puling and Gaofeng populations grouped into one genetic group, while those mainly from the Langping population group in the other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The AMOVA analysis showed that the vast majority of genetic variation was presented within populations, while only 6% of the genetic variation occurred among populations (

 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>st</sub> was 0.083, which appeared between the Gaofeng and Langping populations (
