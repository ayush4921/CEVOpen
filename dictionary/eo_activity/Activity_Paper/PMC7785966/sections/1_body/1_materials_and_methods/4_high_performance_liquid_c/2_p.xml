<p>The chromatographic analysis was performed using an Ultimate XB-C
 <sub>18</sub>column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Shanghai Welch Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) on a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC system equipped with SPD-20A detector and CTO-20A thermostatic column compartment (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The binary gradient elution system consisted of methanol (solvent A) and water (solvent B), and the linear elution procedures were: 0–4 min, 40% A; 4–8 min, 40–50% A; 8–12 min, 50% A; 12–24 min, 50–55% A; 24–28 min, 55% A; 28–32 min, 55–70% A; 32–52 min, 70% A. Column temperature was set to 25°C at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and injection volume was 20 μL. The UV detection wavelength was set to 330 nm. A linear regression analysis was performed with the concentrations of the six coumarin standard solutions as the abscissa (
 <italic>x</italic>) and the peak area as the ordinate (
 <italic>y</italic>). The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were determined at signal-to-noise ratios of 3 and 10, respectively.
