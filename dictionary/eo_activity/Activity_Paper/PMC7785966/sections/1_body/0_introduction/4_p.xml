Phenotypic traits are simple and intuitive but unstable and vulnerable to environmental influences, while molecular markers are stable and reliable and more truly reflect genetic differences between germplasms (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). The metabolic content of medicinal plants is the most important phenotypic trait when constructing a core collection, and therefore is slightly different for that of other traditional crops.
