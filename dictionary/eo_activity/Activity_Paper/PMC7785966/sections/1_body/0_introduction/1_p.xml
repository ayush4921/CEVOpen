 <italic>Angelica biserrata</italic> (R. H. Shan &amp; C. Q. Yuan) C. Q. Yuan &amp; R. H. Shan (Umbelliferae) is a medicinal herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The medicinal properties of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> are mainly derived from its roots, which are known as 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> in Chinese and have special aromatic smell when processed. 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> is broadly applied in TCM to treat inflammation, arthritis, and headache due to its diverse functions of wind-dispelling, dampness-eliminating, cold-dispersing, and pain-relief (

 <italic>Duhuo</italic>. These compounds reveal diverse pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory, sedative, and analgesic effects (

 <italic>Duhuo</italic> has been applied in plant protection and cosmetics. Some traditional Chinese wines and teas are made using 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> as the main raw material (

 <italic>Duhuo</italic> is used to produce plant-based pesticides because its ethanol extract has significant inhibitory effects on some bacteria (
