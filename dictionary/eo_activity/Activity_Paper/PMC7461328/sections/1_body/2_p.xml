<p>Currently, no vaccine exists for the treatment of COVID‐19 and limited therapeutic options are available (Li &amp; De Clercq, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For centuries, traditional medicines have been used to cure several diseases including viral infections (Ahmad et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The phytotherapy‐based approach to find new drugs have contributed as several plant species are a great source of modern medicines (Yaseen et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Similarly, plant‐derived active compounds have been studied as viral inhibitors for many years (Serkedjieva, Manolova, Zgórniak‐Nowosielska, Zawilińska, &amp; Grzybek, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). This study was aimed to briefly describe the potential use of ethno‐medicinal research in searching new therapeutic options against COVID‐19 and other coronaviruses and to provide some important directions to researcher for planning future studies. We have summarized various medicinal plants and their reported antiviral activities in Table 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There is the possibility that studies on plant‐derived compounds listed in Table 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> have been not carried according to more recent scientific qualitative standards for plant‐derived products (Heinrich et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For example, there is the possibility that high concentrations or doses have been used. The antiviral activities of medicinal plants have been mostly derived from laboratory studies (as clinical data are limited) and referred to multicomponent preparation of traditional medicines (Liu, Zhang, He, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Similarly, the qualitative standards for reporting clinical trials in herbal medicine are not as rigorous as in the conventional pharmaceutical field (Williamson, Liu, &amp; Izzo, 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In a study in 2012, it was reported that traditional herbal remedies along with Western medicines could help to improve symptoms, absorptions of pulmonary infiltrations, life‐quality, and decrease corticosteroids uses in SARS patients (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6786-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
