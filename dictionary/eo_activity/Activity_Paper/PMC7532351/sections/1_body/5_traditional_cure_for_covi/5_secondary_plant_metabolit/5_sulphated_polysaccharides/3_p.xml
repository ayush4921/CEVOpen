<p id="para0033">Hundreds of naturally occurring polysaccharides are presently identified and they bestow richest and most traditional pool of structurally and functionally assorted biopolymers. Apart from its earlier application in the industrial field, recent developments have been made in its employment in the pharmaceutical sector and are considered as pharmacologically active polymers. They have long been recognized for their anti-tumor, anti-coagulant, antiviral and immunomodulatory etc. bioactivities (

Synthetic and natural polymers of carbohydrate biomolecules have been affirmed to be selective inhibitors or suppressors of enveloped viruses for example HSV, HIV, human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytical and influenza virus. Moreover, efforts have been made in advancement in development of polysachharide molecules as specific inhibitors of varied classes of viruses (

Various studies on Giloy herbal extract revealed that it could cause imperative enhancement in IgG antibodies in the serum and activation of macrophages (
