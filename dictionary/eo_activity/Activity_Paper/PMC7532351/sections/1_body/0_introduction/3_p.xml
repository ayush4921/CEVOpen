<p id="para0009">Looking into the present scenario, WHO worked really very hard on a plan to battle against this monstrous virus. For instance, they have strategized to minimize physical contact among each other, isolate and screen the infected people during initial stages and recognise and dwindle the spread from the animal sources. Additionally, focus have been made to address the critical mysteries related to virus in order to conduct awareness among citizens (WHO, 2020). In essence, it has been known to transmit through droplets such assaliva or nose or even through air-borne transmission. This has vexed the scientists all around the globe to find out best prevention against this pandemic until the suitable vaccine is discovered. However, manufacturers are progressively working on manufacturing masks and sanitizers to prevent disease incidence, lucrative for both health professionals as well as common people (

It is a gloomy instance that, there is a lack of a verified treatment, however, many drugs are in a pipeline of clinical trials, yet no medically significant results have come out. Till that time, existing antiviral drugs like Lopinavir, Chloroquine, Nitazoxanide, Ritonavir, Hydroxuchloroquine, Tocilizumab and Azithromycin have been practiced that tend to reduce the replication and viral load (

Moreover, envisaging steroids, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, interferons, oligonucleotides, enzyme inhibitors are suggested in curbing the disease (

Having said that, there is an urgency to beat the COVID-19 outbreak, for which natural products, herbal plants and their formulations should be sent to this battlefield. Because of their feasibility, cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, efficacious nature and zilch side-effects, they need to be promoted for this warfare.
