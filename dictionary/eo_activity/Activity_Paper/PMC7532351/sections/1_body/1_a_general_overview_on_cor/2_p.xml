<p id="para0011">SARS-CoV-2, provisionally known as 2019-novel coronavirus, is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, and the family Coronaviridae (

 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>). Subfamily, Orthocoronavirinae, includes four genera, namely alpha-, beta-, delta- and gammacoronavirus. Predominantly, alpha-and beta- CoVs infect mammals, whereas the main targets of delta- and gamma-CoVs are avian species (

With the outbreak of recent SARS-CoV-2 total of seven human-susceptible CoVs strains have been currently identified that can infect human population. Most of these viruses tend to cause mild infections; however, SARS-CoV identified in 2002, MERS-CoV identified in 2012 and ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 have emerged as fatal CoVs capable of causing severe respiratory tract infections (

 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the sites where ACE2 protein is mainly expressed are the potential target sites for SARS-CoV-2 respectively. These regions are belong to type II alveolar cells of the lungs and enterocytes of the small intestine (

 <xref rid="bib0264" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, there are some remarkable biological differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and the other beta-CoVs, which probably make it more infectious. Consequently, the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is different from previous human-CoV outbreaks having striking local and global spread (
