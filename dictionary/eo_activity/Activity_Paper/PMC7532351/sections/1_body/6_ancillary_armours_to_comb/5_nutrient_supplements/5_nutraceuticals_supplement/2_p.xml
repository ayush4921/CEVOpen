<p id="para0050">Nutraceuticals are the products which are argued to provide physiological assistance and protection against varied persistent diseases. Wide range of nutraceutical products have been isolated herbal products, dietary supplements, isolated nutrients, genetically engineered foods and processed cereals, beverages and soups (
 <xref rid="bib0097" ref-type="bibr">Kalra, 2003</xref>). Certain nutraceuticals have been shown earlier to enhance the immune function. 
 <xref rid="bib0149" ref-type="bibr">McCarty and DiNicolantonio (2020)</xref> elucidated that, a few nutraceuticals were able to lower the degree of symptoms and provide respite to the patients infected from coronavirus and influenza. Another significant product is probiotic, they are defined as live micro-organisms which bestow varied health benefits such as improvement in gastrointestinal activity (

 <xref rid="bib0099" ref-type="bibr">Kanauchi et al., 2018</xref>). A report by 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Bunout et al. (2002)</xref> suggested the role of probiotics in the improvement in immune response to vaccination in the elderly people. Antibody production against influenza B was elevated significantly against influenza and there was no effect of probiotics on IL-4 and INF secretion by cultured monocytes. Moreover, an observation made by 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Akatsu et al. (2013)</xref> revealed positive effects of supplementation with 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> on the immunomodulatory responses and intestinal microbiota in elderly people. A significant augmentation in the number of bifidobacteria was recorded in the faecal matter. Furthermore, it was suggested that there was an increase in serum IgA levels. An investigation was carried out to elucidate whether consumption of probiotics such as lactobacilli has an effect on acquired cold symptoms. Reduction in pharyngeal symptoms was significant was observed.
