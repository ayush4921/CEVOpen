   <bold>Conjugation and Reduction of Curcumin:</bold> Curcumin can be conjugated with sulfate moiety by Sulfotransferase and curcumin sulfate can be converted into curcumin by putative enzymes inside the cells. UDP-glucuronosyl transferase can transfer the glucuronol moiety to curcumin and β-glucuronidase can convert curcumin-glucuronide into curcumin. Curcumin can be converted by cellular putative reductase into Di, Tetra, Hexa, and Octahydrocurcumin. These reduced curcumin metabolites can also be conjugated.
