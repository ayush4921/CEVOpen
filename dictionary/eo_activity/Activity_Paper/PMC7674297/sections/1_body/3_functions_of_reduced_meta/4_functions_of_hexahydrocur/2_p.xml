<p id="p0125">HHC, a hydrogenated metabolite of curcumin, has been a less studied molecule. It possesses antioxidant, anticancer and cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-helminths, cardioprotective activities similar to its parent compound curcumin; in some cases, it was found more potent. HHC has shown higher antioxidant activities than curcumin by having more free radical scavenging activities [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Further, in the case of lipid peroxidation and red blood cell hemolysis, it also showed more antioxidant activities than curcumin [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Studies suggested a relation between structural chemistry and oxidation resistance of HHC, a higher number of hydroxyl groups, phenyl moiety might be responsible for its more potent antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Anticancer activity of HHC has been investigated in the HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. It inhibited the growth of HT29 cells by downregulating COX-2 expression [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Further, the Anti-angiogenesis effect of HHC has been evaluated in Corneal neovascularization disease. The HHC, an inhibitor of COX-2, may play a therapeutic role in corneal neovascularization (CorNV) by acting as an anti-VEGF factor [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The role of HHC as a cancer preventive molecule and its effect on cell cycle have been studied in human colon cancer cell SW480. After HHC treatment, the number of viable colon cells decreased, and it also caused an accumulation of cells in the quiescent phase of the cell cycle [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Cytotoxic activity and cell cycle analysis of hexahydrocurcumin was studied on SW 480 human colorectal cancer cells [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) is a characteristic feature in the early phase of colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. HHC suppressed the ACF number by becoming a pro-apoptotic agent and inhibited COX-2 expression, at the same time being neutral to COX-1 expression in the Rat [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The potential of HHC in Alzheimer's disease to improve memory impairments has been studied in mice. HHC inhibited dexamethasone (a key player in Alzheimer's disease) induced neuronal cell injury by suppressing the expression of amyloid precursor protein and Î²-secretase cleavage enzyme.
