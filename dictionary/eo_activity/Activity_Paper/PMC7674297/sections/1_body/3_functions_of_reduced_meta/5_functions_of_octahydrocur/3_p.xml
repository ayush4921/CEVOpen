<p id="p0140">The anti-inflammatory role of OHC has been studied in mice models having acute inflammation. The underlying mechanism was that OHC downregulated the NF-kB pathway and inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation and its interaction with TAB1. Inhibitory action of OHC against COX-2 was more pronounced than curcumin [
