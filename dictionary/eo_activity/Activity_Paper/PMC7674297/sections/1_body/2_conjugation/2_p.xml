<p id="p0065">The higher level of conjugation is one of the reasons responsible for the low bioavailability of curcumin. Hydrogenated metabolites of curcumin and curcumin itself undergo the conjugative metabolism process (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Glucuronidation and sulfation are the two-phase II metabolism pathways that have been reported so far, in which glucuronidation is primarily followed. Sulfation involves enzymes like human phenol sulfotransferase isoenzymes SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 latter being more efficient [

 <italic>et al.</italic>, studied the biotransformation of curcumin in breast cancer cells and the impact of sulfation on cytotoxicity. Curcumin sulfate was found as a main biotransformed product in human breast cancer cell lines. Curcumin sulfate did not stay inside the cell but was excreted quickly into the cellular medium. The sulfonation of curcumin reduces the intracellular concentration of curcumin and thus reduces its growth inhibitory effects [
