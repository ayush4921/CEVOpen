<p id="p0030">The first time in 1978, Holder 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, published information on the chemical structures of curcumin metabolites, which were isolated from tritium-labeling fate studies in rats. When intraperitoneal and intravenous doses were given to rat, Holder 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, found bile as the main route of elimination of curcumin. The eliminated products consisted of glucuronide conjugates of THC (Tetrahydrocurcumin) and HHC (Hexahydrocurcumin) as primary biliary metabolites and ferulic acid and dihydroferulic acid as minor metabolites [

The retention and absorption in the lower part of the gut may lead to a transformation of curcumin. Instead of curcumin, mainly its glucuronide and sulfate derivatives were detected in urinary excretion, while approximately 40% of the dose was excreted in the unchanged form through faeces over five days. In above mentioned 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, curcumin was not detected in heart blood; however, a very less amount was found in the Liver, Kidney, and portal blood [
