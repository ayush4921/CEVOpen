<p id="p0055">Till now, two phases of curcumin metabolism have been reported. Phase-I metabolism involves the reduction of double bonds by which curcumin converted into di, tetra, hexa and octahydrocurcumin. In phase-II metabolism glucuronide or sulfate is conjugated to the curcumin and to its hydrogenated metabolites [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Double bond of curcumin is reduced into di, tetra, hexa and finally into octahydrocurcumin by the reductases. Curcumin and its reduced metabolites can be conjugated on any of its phenol-OH site. During conjugation glucuronic acid or sulphate moiety are added by glucuronidases or sulfotransfersaes [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> converts curcumin into di and tetrahydrocurcumin [

 <italic>vibrio vulnificus</italic> also got highlighted [
