<p>Similar to cinnamon EO, antimycotoxigenic properties, specifically, the antiaflatoxigenic activities of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> EO (commercially available as caraway EO) are also at promising levels. Its ability of inhibiting aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> has been reported by Lasram et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] and Razzaghi-Abyaneh et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Indeed, 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> EO was also able to inhibit aflatoxin G
 <sub>1</sub>, and 94.6% inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Similarly, in another work, aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> and aflatoxin G
 <sub>1</sub> production were inhibited with the treatment of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Although the most abundant component of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. EO was carvone with the reported percentages of 50–65% [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], 67.6% [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>], and 78.85% [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], in certain cases, the relative ratio of limonene (69.93%) was observed to be much higher than that of carvone (14.65%) [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. On the other hand, in another study, the main components of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. EO were reported as cuminaldehyde (22.08%), γ-terpinene (17.86%), and γ-terpinene-7-al (15.41%) [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These obvious differences in the composition of EOs may be due to the type and origin of the plant material [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> seed EO was also active as an antifungal agent against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. When compared to other EOs, 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> EO was more effective than 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. EO [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and EOs from 
 <italic>Pelargonium roseum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus</italic> (L.) Rendle [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].
