<p>The antioxidant activity of oregano EO was correlated with its composition as reported by Kulisic et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. This correlation was detected not only for oregano EO but also for several other EOs. In a study conducted with the extracts and EOs of costmary (
 <italic>Tanacetum balsamita</italic> L.) and tansy (
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L.), it was shown that the antioxidant potentials were associated with the content of phenolic acids such as caffeic, rosmarinic, and ferulic acids [

 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus radiata</italic> EOs were referred to their major components, namely 1,8-cineole and limonene, respectively [
 <xref rid="B167-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Even though the antioxidant activity is generally correlated with the phenolic compounds of the EOs, recent research studies indicated that the relevant antioxidant activity may also be related with the non-phenolic compounds. It has been proven for limonene, linalool, and citral by Baschieri et al. [
 <xref rid="B168-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>], and these non-phenolic compounds have been found significant in terms of their contribution to antioxidant activity.
