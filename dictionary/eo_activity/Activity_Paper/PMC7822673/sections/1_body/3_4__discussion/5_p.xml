<p>Preceding phytochemical studies of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> with GC-MS analysis have reported 20 different chemical constituents including some famous antioxidant compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 2, 3-dihydro-3, 5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one, cis-stilbene, and 2, 5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, many polyphenols, such as quercetin, rutin, apigenin, caffeic acid, and myricetin, were also identified in 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> extract by HPLC-DAD. These polyphenols have been reported for their antihypertensive effects in various studies [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this work, we analyzed the extract and fractions from 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> by LC-DAD-MS, and seventeen compounds were described from AS-AT. The annotated compounds include organic acids, sugars, alkaloids, nucleoside, and glycosylated flavonoids. The molecular network revealed the components in the most active sample AS-AT compared to the other samples, and four major node cluster families were observed, which include glycosylated flavonoids and alkaloids. Thus, we believe that the presence of such constituents in 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> extracts could be responsible for their hypotensive and diuretic potential. One of the limitations of our study was not being able to identify which compound found in AS-AT may be responsible for its cardiorenal activities. Despite this, we conjectured that this effect should not be attributed to only one representative but rather to coordinated and synergistic action of the various metabolites present in AS-AT.
