<p>The direct surgical method was employed for measuring BP in anesthetized normotensive rats using thiopental (70–90 mg/kg). The trachea was exposed and cannulated to improve respiration during the length of the experiment. Next jugular vein and carotid artery were exposed and cannulated using a polyethylene catheter (PE-50) for extract/drug administration and recording BP, respectively. A catheter inserted into the carotid artery was connected to the pressure transducer fixed with the PowerLab data acquisition system for recording BP (ADI Instruments; Castle Hill, Australia). Following surgery, animals were allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes prior to record BP [
