 <italic>/ATPase Activity</italic>. The Na+/K+/ATPase activity was estimated by the methodology of Noel and Godfraind [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with minor changes using kidney samples with increasing concentrations (3–30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) of AS-AT. The assay solution (0.5 ml) was incubated into the kidney samples for 2 hr at 37°C. Before incubation, proteins in the kidney were so adjusted so that only 10–15% of the substrate could be hydrolyzed. The specific activity of the Na+/K+/ATPase enzyme was measured by the difference in the ATPase activity in the absence and presence of 1 mM ouabain (ouabain-resistant activity).
