 <italic>Measurement of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Activity in the Prolonged Diuretic Activity</italic>. For ACE activity, rats were separated into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and treated with AS-AT (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) and captopril (60 mg/kg). Briefly, after seven days of treatment, blood was collected from overnight fasting treated animals and centrifuged, and serum was separated. Serum (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was mixed with assay solution (490 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Then 1.2 mL of NaOH was added to halt the reaction followed by the addition of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of o-phthaldialdehyde. Finally, the formation of His-Leu in the reaction mixture was analyzed fluorometrically in triplicate to measure ACE activity.
