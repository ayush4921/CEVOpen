<p>The extract and fractions from 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> were previously analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and some constituents could be annotated [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, we reanalyzed them to expand the annotation of the constituents using GNPS library and data reported in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); moreover, the data were applied to create the molecular network from their constituents and so determine the goal compounds from the most active fraction AS-AT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The molecular formulae of the constituents from AS-AT were determined based on the mass errors up ±10 ppm and mSigma below 30.
