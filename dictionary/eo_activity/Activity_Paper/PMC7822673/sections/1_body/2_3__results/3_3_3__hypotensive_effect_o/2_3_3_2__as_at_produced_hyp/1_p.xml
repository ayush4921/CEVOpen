<p>Pretreatment with atropine significantly prevented AS-AT-induced hypotensive effect in normotensive rats. However, propranolol, hexamethonium, L-NAME, indomethacin, and captopril did not change the hypotensive effect of AS-AT. Treatment with only AS-AT (25 mg/kg) causes a 65.27 mmHg decrease in SBP whereas pretreatment with atropine significantly reduced this decrease in SBP to only 2.4 mm Hg (
