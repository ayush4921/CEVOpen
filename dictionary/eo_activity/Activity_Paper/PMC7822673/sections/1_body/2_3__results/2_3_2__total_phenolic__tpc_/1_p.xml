<p>Standard regression lines for gallic acid were used to measure total phenolic contents, whereas standard regression lines for quercetin were used to measure total flavonoid contents (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Phenolic contents in AT-Cr were found as 256.64 ± 4.82 
 <italic>μ</italic>g gallic acid equivalent/mg, whereas flavonoid contents in ATC-Cr were found as 137.20 ± 2.37 
 <italic>μ</italic>g quercetin equivalent/mg. The maximum quantity of both polyphenols and flavonoids was found in a crude extract of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> as compared to fractions whereas the total reducing power was found almost equal to total antioxidant capacity in all the extract/fractions. Furthermore, AT-Cr also exhibited high TRP and TAC in comparison to other fractions. The % scavenging ability of DPPH and nitric oxide (NO−) by extract/fractions of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> is presented in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The dose-dependent scavenging ability of DPPH and nitric oxide free radicals was observed with all the extract/fractions. Crude extract at the dose of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL showed a maximum of 75.55% inhibition of DPPH radical, whereas a maximum of 66.19% nitric oxide (NO−) free radical inhibition by AT-Cr was observed at IC50 259.4 ± 4.93 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as compared to ascorbic acid IC50 of 225.81 ± 5.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Similar DPPH and NO scavenging activities were exhibited by fractions of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic>. These results indicated that crude extract and fractions of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> have significant free radicals scavenging ability.
