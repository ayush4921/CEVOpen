 <italic>Effect of A. tenuifolius Extract/Fractions on Urine Volume</italic>. Acute diuretic effect with AT-Cr (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg), AS-AT (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg), BS-AT (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg), DS-AT (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg), and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg) is presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. AT-Cr (300 mg/kg), BS-AT (300 mg/kg), and DS-AT (300 mg/kg) increased the urine output at 6th h after the treatment whereas AS-AT (200 and 300 mg/kg) produced a highly significant increase in urinary output after 4 and 6 h of treatment. Also, the total urine volume calculated at 4 and 6 h in 300 mg/kg AS-AT treated rats was 4.96 ± 0.75 and 7.19 ± 0.7 mL/100 g, respectively, whereas the urinary output of rats in the control group after 4 and 6 hours was 2.39 ± 0.05 and 3.51 ± 0.12 mL/100 g, respectively. Moreover, urinary output at 4 and 6 hours in rats treated with AS-AT (300 mg/kg) was very similar to the output in rats treated with HCTZ, a standard diuretic drug. Urinary output data of various fractions also showed that urine excretion was increased as the polarity of the solvent increased suggesting that aqueous soluble fractions contain various polar compounds responsible for this activity.
