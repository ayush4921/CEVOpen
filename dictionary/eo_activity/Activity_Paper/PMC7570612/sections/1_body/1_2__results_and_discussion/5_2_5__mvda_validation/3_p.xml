<p>Regarding the acceptability and predictability of the model, it is vital to include external samples [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the original and predicted data for AGI activity. Based on the FTIR spectra, the AGI activity for all six samples was predicted and measured using the calibration model. All six external extracts showed high activity. Therefore, for predicting the AGI activity of
