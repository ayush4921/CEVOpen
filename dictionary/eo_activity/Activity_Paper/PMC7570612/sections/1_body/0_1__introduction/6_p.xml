<p>The AGI enzyme suppresses glucose absorption by Î±-glucosidase enzyme (AGE) inhibition, which is an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T2DM. The percentage of hydrolytic cleavage of oligosaccharides can be decreased by stopping the action of alpha-glucosidase, slowing the general rate of glucose absorption into the blood [
