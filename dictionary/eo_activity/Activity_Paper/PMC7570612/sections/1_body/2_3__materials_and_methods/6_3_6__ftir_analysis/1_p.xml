<p>The experiment was carried out with an FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) fitted with a horizontally attenuated total reflectance system with a diamond crystal. The instrument was adjusted to ambient temperature before operation. A minimal quantity of each freeze-dried sample was put onto the diamond crystal using a washed spatula [

 <sup>−1</sup> and at the resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The Attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal was cleansed with utmost care between measurements. The data were collected and processed through the software Perkin Elmer Spectrum version 10.03.09 (Waltham, MA, USA). The data were then measured using multivariate data analysis [
