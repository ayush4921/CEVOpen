<p id="p0030">The leaves of 
 <italic>Acacia sieberiana</italic> were reduced to a fine powder (930 g) and extracted by maceration in a mixture of dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>): methanol (MeOH) (1:1) (8 L for 48 h) at room temperature. The solution was filtered and the solvents were evaporated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> to afford a green residue that constituted the crude extract (ASL; 66 g). Part of ASL (60 g) was dissolved in water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O; 300 mL) and sucessively partitioned with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (Hex; 200 mL), ethyl acetate (EtOAc; 200 mL) and water-satured n-butanol (n-BuOH; 200 mL) to afford three fractions, ASLa, ASLb and ASLc, respectively. ASLc and ASLb displayed the best cytotoxic activities and were further processed to isolate their active phytochemicals.
