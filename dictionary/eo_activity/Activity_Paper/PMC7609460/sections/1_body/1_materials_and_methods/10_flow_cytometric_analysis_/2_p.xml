<p id="p0065">The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CCRF-CEM cells after application of ASL was detwemined by the flow cytometry. For instance, CCRF-CEM cells were treated with ASL, DMSO (solvent control), or hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>; positive control). After 24 h incubation in standard culture conditions, cells were resuspended in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and the production of ROS was evaluated using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFH-DA) (Sigma-Aldrich) staining as earlier described [
