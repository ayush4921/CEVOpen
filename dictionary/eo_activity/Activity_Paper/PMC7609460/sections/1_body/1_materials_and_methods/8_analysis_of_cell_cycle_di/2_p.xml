<p id="p0055">The distribution of cycle phases of CCRF-CEM cells after application of the crude extract (ASL) or doxorubicin was analyzed by the flow cytometry [

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, CCRF-CEM cells (1×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were treated with various concentrations of ASL, doxorubicin or DMSO (solvent control). After 24 h incubation in the standard culture condition described above, the cell cycle was analyzed using a BD Accury C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) by measuring the propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei. For the annexin V/PI staining, apoptosis was also assessed after 24 h incubation using fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V/PI assay kit (eBioscience™ Annexin V; Invitogen, San Diego, USA) and BD Accury C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with 5 μL FITC-conjugated annexin V (10 mg/mL) and 10 μl PI (50 mg/mL) and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature (RT) and then analyzed using BD Accury C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) [
