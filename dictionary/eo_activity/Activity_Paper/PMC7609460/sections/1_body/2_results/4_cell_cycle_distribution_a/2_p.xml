<p id="p0085">The effects of botanical ASL and doxorubicin on the distribution of the cell cycle of CCRF-CEM cells after 24 h treatment are depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. ASL and doxorubicin modified the cell cycles' distribution in concentration-dependent manner. ASL induced cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in CCRF-CEM cells, whilst doxorubicin induced S and G2/M phase arrest (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). ASL also increased significantly the amount of cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase in a range from 3.35% (3.36 μg/mL) to 20.05% (26.9 μg/mL). The corresponding significant increase for doxorubicin was from 3.28% (0.005 μM) to 12.05% (0.04 μM). The induction of apoptosis by CCRF-CEM cells by ASL and doxorubicin was later confirmed by using annexin V/PI staining as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. It can be observed that the treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with 26.9 μg/mL of ASL induced late apoptosis with 17.6% annexin V (+)/PI (+) cells
