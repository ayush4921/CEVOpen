<p id="p0090">The effects of ASL on the activation of caspases in CCRF-CEM cells was also investigated. The results depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> show that, though some significant differences were observed, treatment of cells with ASL does not importantly regulate the activity of caspases, with only 1.02-fold, 1.11-fold and 1.03-fold increases, respectively, for caspases 3/7, 8 and 9 at 26.9 μg/mL. Hence, ASL is not an intrinsic (caspase 3/7 and 9) nor extrinsic (caspase 8) caspases modulator.
