  <p>Effects of the crude extract (ASL) and doxorubicin on the distribution of CCRF-CEM cells' cycle after 24 h treatment. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were 13.45 μg/mL for ASL and 0.02 μM for doxorubicin. Control cells were treated with DMSO to a final concentration of 0.1%. (∗∗): values are significantly different to that of untreated control (P &lt; 0.05).
