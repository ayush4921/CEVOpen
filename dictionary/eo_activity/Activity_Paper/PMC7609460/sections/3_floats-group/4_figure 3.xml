  <p>Apoptotic effect of the crude extract (ASL) and doxorubicin as determined by the annexin V/PI assay in CCRF-CEM cells after 24 h. Flow cytometric measurements were performed after annexin V-PI double staining. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were 13.45 μg/mL for ASL and 0.02 μM for doxorubicin. Shown are mean values ±SD of three independent experiments. Control cells were treated with DMSO to a final concentration of 0.1%.
