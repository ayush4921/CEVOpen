  <p>Follow-up training and meetings: As additional activities to the regular EUPATI course, stakeholders advised organizing follow-up training and/or meetings for graduates in order to exchange experiences, letting them learn from each other and/or do training on the job. New students could meet graduates and learn from them as well (the “Value configuration” building block).</p>

  <p>Update/expand the course: Stakeholders can contribute by adding their “core competencies” to the EUPATI course: “
   <italic>In the coming years, new treatments, therapeutic innovations, and policies will emerge. As stakeholders, we could help keep the content of EUPATI up to date.”</italic> Furthermore, they could assist by making an active contribution to on-site training programs for specific skills related to effective patient involvement.

  <p>Partner network: Stakeholders see opportunities for mutual agenda setting: “
   <italic>This network could address important topics on medicines R&amp;D as a collective, as well as exchanging details and keeping each other informed about everyone's activities.”</italic> Graduates of the European and national programs should stay in contact, preferably as a strong EUPATI alumni network across Europe. A visible network of stakeholders and patient representatives will lower the threshold for a broad range of patient involvement initiatives.
