<p>The strength of this study is the objective, qualitative in-depth analysis among multiple stakeholders involved in medicines R&amp;D in the Netherlands. It let us combine the results from the governmental, academic, patient and pharmaceutical perspectives, and hence draw conclusions about collaboration between multiple stakeholders to promote and establish patient involvement in medicines R&amp;D by means of a relevant and high-level educational program, focused on patient representatives. The in-depth interviews in this study were held by two independent interviewers who did not come from any of the stakeholders. Furthermore, the business canvas model was used to compile the topic list, ensuring that all important attributes for building a sustainable Academy have been taken into consideration. This study, however, also has some weaknesses. Because participation in our study was partly selective—participants were already part of the steering group—participants were more likely to be motivated toward patient involvement, rendering our study population probably not representative of all the stakeholders involved in medicines R&amp;D. As a next step, we would recommend to also involve principal investigators responsible for clinical trial execution, for example in a hospital, to explore specific expectations and needs for this group as well. Although we used the business canvas model to compile the topic list, it is possible we missed topics that would have been identified if a different model had been used. Furthermore, results about the collaboration between stakeholders are tied to a single point in time, so important information could have been missed in understanding the long-term sustainability of collaborations. Continued monitoring the actual collaboration between EUPATI students, graduates, and other stakeholders and research into this is recommended.</p>
