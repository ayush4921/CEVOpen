<p>The respected Business Canvas Model (BCM) by Osterwalder and Pigneur (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) was used for exploring the business case. In our study, stakeholders' representatives assigned attributes to the nine building blocks with the four main pillars of BCM. The four main pillars of BCM were defined as (i) “Product,” indicating the Dutch version of the EUPATI course, (ii) “Customers,” indicating the patient representatives, (iii) “Infrastructure,” encompassing organization and network, and (iv) “Financial,” referring to the costs and revenues of the Dutch version of the EUPATI course. The four pillars of BCM consist of nine building blocks: Value propositions (Product) Customer segments, Channels, Customer Relations (Customer), Key Activities, Key Resources, Partner Network (Infrastructure), Cost Structure, Revenue Streams (Finances).
