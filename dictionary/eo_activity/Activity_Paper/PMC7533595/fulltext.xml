In 2014, the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) was started with the goal of increasing the capacity and capabilities of patient representatives in this field. To make this academy more accessible and applicable for the Netherlands, a Dutch version was launched in September 2019. To explore the options for a durable infrastructure for organizing the Dutch EUPATI course, a multi-stakeholder qualitative study was done. The views of various stakeholders from pharmaceutical industry, governmental organizations, patient organizations, and the academic world were examined about the benefits and challenges of this course for patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From April to June 2019, 10 semi-structured interviews were completed, each with two representatives of all stakeholders involved. In addition, individual Dutch graduates of the European EUPATI (EUPATI fellows) were consulted <italic>via</italic> an e-mail questionnaire. Using a directed content analysis based on the Business Canvas Model, the transcribed interviews were coded, analyzed, and final attributes consolidated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The semi-structured interviews and completed questionnaires explored how the stakeholders are aiming to assist patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D through the Dutch EUPATI course. The building blocks of the Business Canvas Model were described with concrete attributes for making the business case. Stakeholders stated that the Dutch EUPATI course was an incentive for patient involvement in medicines development, for patient-oriented research and outcomes, for the availability of patient representatives (expert ones in particular), and for the content and representation quality of patient representatives. The key values for collaborating in the network as mentioned by the stakeholders were neutrality, patients' interests, equality, independence, shared objectives, long-term commitment, transparency, understanding, trust, and respect.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D is evolving and the demand for qualified patient representatives is growing. Dutch stakeholders confirmed the added value of the patients' academy and expressed their willingness to contribute. Important values and conditions for long term collaboration were formulated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>patient involvement</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd><kwd>medicines research</kwd><kwd>EUPATI</kwd><kwd>patient engagement</kwd><kwd>training</kwd><kwd>patient representatives</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003761</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6877"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is increasing awareness that involvement of patient representatives in medicines research and development (R&#x00026;D) benefits the development process of medicinal products (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Integrating patients' priorities, perspectives, and knowledge throughout the medicines R&#x00026;D process may allow better treatments with more relevant outcomes to become available for patients and their healthcare providers with shorter development timelines (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To increase the capacity and capabilities of patient representatives in understanding and contributing to medicines R&#x00026;D, the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) patient expert training course for patient representatives was launched in 2014. This EUPATI training course takes 14 months and comprises six online modules and several face-to-face meetings. Topics addressed are discovery and development of medicinal products, non-clinical development, clinical development, registration, safety, pharmacovigilance, and health technology assessment (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). EUPATI started as a project of the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking and in 2017 it continued as a pan-European public-private partnership program of the European Patients' Forum<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> Since 2014, EUPATI has trained around 150 patient representatives (hereinafter &#x0201c;EUPATI fellows&#x0201d;) from many European countries (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), including eight patient representatives from the Netherlands. Due to the high demand for expert patients, the potential language barrier of the course being in English and the need to educate representatives not only about the European but also about the Dutch context (such as specific Dutch regulations, institutions, and materials), the Dutch EUPATI fellows pursued the idea of a Dutch version of the course. They therefore approached PGOsupport, a Dutch not-for-profit network organization that helps patient organizations and their counterparts accelerate patient involvement initiatives. In 2018, PGOsupport formed a multi-stakeholder steering group with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry, governmental organizations, patient organizations, and the academic world to initiate preparatory activities for the Dutch version of the EUPATI course. As recommended by the steering group, working groups were formed for each course module to adapt the online modules of EUPATI to the Dutch context. Each working group included the expertise and perspective of patient representatives (mainly EUPATI fellows), government, the academic world, and industry. In 2019, all the online modules of the EUPATI course were adapted for the Dutch context. A durable Dutch EUPATI course will need an effective infrastructure within the network it is to be embedded in. In parallel with the development of the Dutch version of the EUPATI course, we set out to determine the optimal conditions for such an infrastructure in order to promote and establish a long-term partnership. A multi-stakeholder qualitative analysis was conducted to that end among all the stakeholders (pharmaceutical industry, governmental organizations, patients, and the academic world). In addition, the results of this analysis will be used for further roll-out of the Dutch version of EUPATI in the Netherlands and the agreements on collaboration between involved stakeholders that arise from it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Aim</title><p>This multi-stakeholder qualitative study aimed to explore the business case for the Dutch version of the EUPATI course.

In that way, neutrality, patient-centeredness, and independence, as well as optimal utilization of existing knowledge about patient expert training, can be guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperation in the network of stakeholders should be based on &#x0201c;equality.&#x0201d; This is despite the fact that &#x0201c;<italic>all stakeholders do have a specific contribution to and role in the process of medicine development</italic>,&#x0201d; and should therefore contribute from their specific backgrounds and expertise. Working on long-term commitment is an important prerequisite for long-term cooperation, with transparency about financial flows. Values considered by the stakeholders to be important for the collaboration in the partner network were neutrality, patient-centeredness, equality, independence, transparency, understanding, trust, respect, and having a shared objective with long-term commitment. Finally, stakeholders recommended that the network should find a &#x0201c;lean&#x0201d; and efficient way of working&#x02014;preferably with a small steering group, representative of the main stakeholder groups and within existing national and other structures.</p><p>The stakeholders addressed the various challenges for the network. One of the perceived challenges concerned transparency and openness of individual interests: &#x0201c;<italic>While some interests could oppose each other&#x02014;for example those of the pharmaceutical industry vs. other stakeholders&#x02014;stakeholders should explain their motives for joining the EUPATI network immediately and discuss how to deal with potential differences, with an open mind and willingness to understand divergent values</italic>.&#x0201d; In addition, due to the dense network of patient organizations in the Netherlands, one stakeholder warned against an &#x0201c;exclusive&#x0201d; and isolated network of expert patients and urged aiming for close relationships with the existing network of patient organizations. Finally, although some reservations about close relationships with the pharmaceutical industry were voiced, the stakeholders unanimously identified the industry as an essential partner for the Dutch EUPATI course. A public private partnership will need to be built by all stakeholders based on mutual trust and respect, with a well-thought through governance structure. The stakeholders identified the following conditions for collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry that should be made explicit in a written agreement: (1). any suggestion of being a &#x0201c;mouthpiece&#x0201d; of the pharmaceutical industry should be avoided; (2). only umbrella organizations of pharmaceutical companies should be involved in the steering group; (3). Existing codes of conducts should be followed when designing the public private partnership structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Views on the &#x0201c;Financial Aspects&#x0201d;: Cost and Revenue</title><p>The estimated cost for one cohort of the Dutch version of EUPATI is around 150 k euros, consisting of personnel costs for teaching at the face-to-face meetings, personal coaching of students during the online course and maintenance of the online course environment (&#x0201c;virtual classroom&#x0201d;). Annual costs may vary depending on in-kind contributions from individual stakeholders. As the current policy of the European EUPATI program is to deliver these services and the education program without subscription fees for patient representatives (students) and their organizations, the stakeholders have been asked for a financial and/or in-kind contribution to the Dutch EUPATI course. Unfortunately, long-term financial support could not be guaranteed upfront (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> Attributes for building blocks Cost structure and Revenue model). Some parties saw openings for financial support for a certain period of time. One of these&#x02014;a governmental organization&#x02014;suggested a contribution as co-financer, provided the industrial partner would do the same. As a general prerequisite, the financial contributions should be distributed from an independent depot, with no ties to the individual sponsor. Concerning in-kind contributions, all stakeholders expressed an unconditional intention to provide expertise (e.g., as a guest lecturer), facilities (e.g., for meetings) and materials. As the &#x0201c;Revenue model,&#x0201d; the stakeholders recommended an independent periodic evaluation study of EUPATI in order to identify benefits and added value of EUPATI for students and stakeholders. How did graduates engage in medicine development activities? What was the impact? In addition, the evaluation study will provide suggestions for improving the Dutch EUPATI course: for example, is the content relevant and up to date? Are additional course modules relevant for the Dutch context? Another benefit of EUPATI is the diffusion of knowledge about patient involvement in medicine R&#x00026;D. Both graduates and involved stakeholders will act as an ambassador for (knowledge on) patient involvement in drug development to members of their respective networks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient involvement in medicine R&#x00026;D is evolving and demand for qualified patient representatives is growing. Dutch stakeholders confirmed the added value of the existing EUPATI patients' academy and expressed their willingness to contribute to a durable EUPATI program in the Netherlands. Important values and conditions were formulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>A multi-stakeholder qualitative analysis was conducted to explore the values and visions of stakeholders from the academic, governmental, industrial, and patient perspectives for a sustainable EUPATI program in the Netherlands. Building blocks within the BCM were used to structure both data collection and analysis.</p><sec><title>Dutch EUPATI Course Adds Value to Medicines R and D Ecosystem</title><p>Although the main purpose of our study was not to investigate the added value of patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D as such, our respondent outcomes overlap with earlier findings from others in this regard (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In general, stakeholders share a sense of urgency and express an overall interest with respect to patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D. They furthermore share a strong wish for capacity and capability building and agree that a Dutch version of the EUPATI training program could meet the needs that arise from such a wish. Stakeholders expect EUPATI to be a relevant and high-quality training program and thereby to contribute to an increase in the pool of patient experts available for patient involvement activities. It is believed that in addition to their valuable experiences as a patient, substantial knowledge of terminology, and the complex process of development of medicinal products is necessary for patients to be equal partners in the dialogue with stakeholders (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). By focusing on both technical knowledge and relevant skills in general, not only will the quality of the outcomes of the engagement activity benefit (e.g., the patient's advice), but so will the engagement process as such. Klingmann et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have already stated that if patients can obtain knowledge through education, multiple impactful roles in the medicine development process come within reach. Training may also be beneficial for restoring the power balance between patients and professionals from other stakeholder groups. According to Abma (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), patients need to develop a strong, self-conscious position before they are ready to participate and enter into a dialogue with researchers about their agenda. As well as concrete output from trained patient representatives, as graduates of a particular cohort, stakeholders also believe that a Dutch EUPATI course will indirectly add to the incentive for patient involvement in the Netherlands in general. As such, this is in line with previous observations that a combined effort of governmental organizations, the academic world, patient organizations, health foundations, and the pharmaceutical industry to share knowledge and resources in order to address the challenges of pharmaceutical innovation will be beneficial for all (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Internationally, the PARADIGM consortium is currently investigating the return on investment of patient involvement initiatives and metrics for quantitative and qualitative assessment. The initial publications from this consortium suggest a key role for education and empowerment in evaluating benefits and costs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>High-Level Training for Patient Representatives</title><p>Stakeholders believe the Dutch EUPATI course should target a broad population of patient representatives, including somatic, psychiatric, and rare conditions. By doing so, it may complement the pre-existing, more disease-specific coaching and training programs that various patient organizations provide for their patient advocates. Dedicated and high-level training programs with contributions from relevant stakeholder parties have until now been exclusively directed at professionals.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref> The Dutch EUPATI course means that a &#x0201c;generic&#x0201d; and high-level training program on this topic, established in collaboration with and directed at patient representatives, will become available in the Netherlands for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Benefits Extend the Aspect of Education</title><p>Although the primary deliverable of the Dutch EUPATI network is an educational program, stakeholders have identified other opportunities, aims and benefits for the collaboration as well. Mutual agenda setting and knowledge exchange were identified by some. A brief inventory of some of the existing EUPATI National Platforms (ENPs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref> in other countries reveals a diverse picture of approaches in different countries. Whereas, training is the central focus for most ENPs, network building, and raising awareness appear to be important as well (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As an additional spin-off, active participation by all stakeholders within the Dutch EUPATI context is expected to lower thresholds for future contacts between stakeholders and patient representatives. Face-to-face contacts during expert group meetings and on-site training elements will add to the aspect of &#x0201c;getting to know your future discussion partner already at an early stage&#x0201d;. This is expected to establish mutual trust and understanding for the longer term (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Important Values for a EUPATI Network and Training Program in the Netherlands</title><p>Stakeholders identified important key values and principles at an infrastructural level when asked to express their worries and expectations for their collaboration in a Dutch EUPATI network. Transparency, equality, trust, independence, and respect are among the most frequently mentioned values. Furthermore, alignment of goals was seen as essential for a successful inter-organizational collaboration, as has already been described by others (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The values and key principles that were derived from our multi-stakeholder analysis overlap nicely with international concepts as laid down in various codes of conduct and frameworks from regulatory authorities [such as EMA (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)], the industry [such as EFPIA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)], and patient organizations [such as Eurordis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)] that describe the guiding principles of patient involvement between two or more stakeholders. International programs for advancing patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D, such as the Patient-Focused Medicine Development initiative<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0004"><sup>4</sup></xref>, furthermore draw upon these values and principles by providing tools and resources for all stakeholder parties. Although national specifics will apply, these findings let us employ available resources by anticipating that an effective and durable Dutch EUPATI infrastructure could be mapped according to the international example.</p></sec><sec><title>Collaboration With the Pharmaceutical Industry: Valuable and Delicate</title><p>The position of the industrial partner in the Dutch EUPATI network deserves further consideration. All stakeholders regard the pharmaceutical industry as both a relevant and an essential partner for the Dutch EUPATI course. Combining knowledge and resources in order to address the challenges of pharmaceutical innovation has been proved to be beneficial for government organizations, the academic world, patient organizations, health foundations, and the pharmaceutical industry, as they all share that interest (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As involvement of an industrial partner is prone to be affected by a negative public image (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), careful deliberation is crucial to avoid a negative impact on the credibility of the training program. Combining the recommendations of several stakeholders in this regard, together with the available international and other guidelines on collaboration with the industry (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) will let us establish an internationally accepted modus operandi, customized for the Dutch situation. Trust, alignment of goals, balancing power, and open communication are among the underlying concepts to be considered (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations of the Research</title><p>The strength of this study is the objective, qualitative in-depth analysis among multiple stakeholders involved in medicines R&#x00026;D in the Netherlands. It let us combine the results from the governmental, academic, patient and pharmaceutical perspectives, and hence draw conclusions about collaboration between multiple stakeholders to promote and establish patient involvement in medicines R&#x00026;D by means of a relevant and high-level educational program, focused on patient representatives. The in-depth interviews in this study were held by two independent interviewers who did not come from any of the stakeholders. Furthermore, the business canvas model was used to compile the topic list, ensuring that all important attributes for building a sustainable Academy have been taken into consideration. This study, however, also has some weaknesses. Because participation in our study was partly selective&#x02014;participants were already part of the steering group&#x02014;participants were more likely to be motivated toward patient involvement, rendering our study population probably not representative of all the stakeholders involved in medicines R&#x00026;D. As a next step, we would recommend to also involve principal investigators responsible for clinical trial execution, for example in a hospital, to explore specific expectations and needs for this group as well. Although we used the business canvas model to compile the topic list, it is possible we missed topics that would have been identified if a different model had been used. Furthermore, results about the collaboration between stakeholders are tied to a single point in time, so important information could have been missed in understanding the long-term sustainability of collaborations. Continued monitoring the actual collaboration between EUPATI students, graduates, and other stakeholders and research into this is recommended.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.
