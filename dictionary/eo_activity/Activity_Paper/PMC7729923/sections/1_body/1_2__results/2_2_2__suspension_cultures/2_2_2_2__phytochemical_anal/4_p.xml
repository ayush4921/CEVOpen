<p>The total phenolic acids content increased almost two-fold, depending on the inoculum size, from 28.09 mg/100 g DW (1.5 g of inoculum) through 49.46 mg/100 g DW (3.0 g) to a maximum of 50.72 mg/100 g DW (4.5 g) (

The concentrations of these compounds ranged from 2.09 to 10.64 mg/100 g DW, from 6.78 to 10.44 mg/100 g DW, and from 13.39 to 26.34 mg/100 g DW, respectively. The concentrations of the remaining three phenolic acids, i.e., chlorogenic, vanillic and caffeic acids, were lower, with maximum values of 1.25, 1.43 and 4.80 mg/100 g DW, respectively (
