<p>The analyzed herb extracts were found to contain a high amount of verbascoside (1728.97 mg/100 g DW) and a much lower concentration of isoverbascoside (78.34 mg/100 g DW). From the phenolic acids investigated, in extracts three compounds—protocatechuic acid (25.75 mg/100 g DW), ferulic acid (29.76 mg/100 g DW) and rosmarinic acid (2.53 mg/100 g DW) were estimated. Of iridoids, verbenalin and hastatoside were found in the analyzed herb extracts. The verbenalin content was very high—4210.88 mg/100 g DW. The concentration of hastatoside was lower—398.87 mg/100 g DW. Among flavonoids, scutellarin and apigenin 7-glucuronide were found in the analyzed herb extracts. The scutellarin content was 172.13 mg/100 g DW while apigenin 7-glucuronide content was about 4-fold lower—41.77 mg/100 g DW (
