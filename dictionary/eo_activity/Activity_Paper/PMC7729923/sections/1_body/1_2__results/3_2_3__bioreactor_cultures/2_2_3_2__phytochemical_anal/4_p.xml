<p>The confirmed total amounts of phenolic acids in the cultures grown in the BB were very low (19.88 mg/100 g DW) (

In both types of bioreactors, the quantitatively dominant phenolic acids were the same as in the agar and/or suspension cultures, i.e., rosmarinic acid (10.22 and 14.87 mg/100 g DW), protocatechuic acid (5.07 and 9.68 mg/100 g DW), and ferulic acid (2.12 and 7.10 mg/100 g DW in BB and STB, respectively). The amount of total phenolic acids obtained in the STB bioreactor was higher than those of the agar callus cultures (19.42â€“26.90 mg/100 g DW) but lower than their maximum amount (50.72 mg/100 g DW) in the suspension cultures (
