<p>The biomass increments recorded during 2-week growth cycles varied depending on the inoculum to medium ratio. The values ranged from 6.66 to 16.77 times (fresh biomass) and from 6.34 to 18.06 times (dry biomass) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05609-f002">Figure 2</xref>). With the increase in inoculum size, a gradual decrease in biomass increments was observed, from 16.77–through 10.5–to 6.66-fold (fresh), and from 18.06–through 9.88–to 6.34-fold (dry biomass) (
