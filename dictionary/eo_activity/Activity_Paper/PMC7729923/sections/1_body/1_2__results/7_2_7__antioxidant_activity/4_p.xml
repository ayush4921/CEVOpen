<p>The results of the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity assay showed that 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C extracts interfered with the formation of the ferrous-ferrozine complex starting from the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, displaying at the maximum tested dose (2 mg/mL) an activity slightly lower than that of the standard EDTA, whereas 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo exhibited weak chelating effects only at the concentration of 1 and 2 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05609-f007">Figure 7</xref>). According to the calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S was found to be the most effective, followed by 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.767 mg/mL and 0.908 mg/mL).
