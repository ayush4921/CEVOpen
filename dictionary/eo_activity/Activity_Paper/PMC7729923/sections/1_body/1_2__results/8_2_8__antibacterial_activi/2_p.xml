<p>The bacteriostatic effect of 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo was twice stronger against Gram-positive bacteria (MIC 0.6–2.2 mg/mL) than Gram-negative strains (MIC 1.1–4.5 mg/mL) and bactericidal activity was slightly lower. MBCs were in range 4.5–9.0 mg/ml and 4.5–18.0 mg/mL, respectively. The most sensitive strain was 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC/MBC 0.6/9.0 mg/mL), and the most resistant was 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC/MBC 4.5/18 mg/mL).
