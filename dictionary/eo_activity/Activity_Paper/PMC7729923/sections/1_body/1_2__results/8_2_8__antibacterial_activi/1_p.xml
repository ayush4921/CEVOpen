<p>The MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) and MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentration) values of extracts obtained from 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> were determined to evaluate their activity against selected pathogenic bacteria. 
 <italic>Vo—</italic>in vivo, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo—</italic>STB showed antibacterial activity against tested bacterial strains (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts showed stronger bacteriostatic activity against Gram-positive bacteria (MIC 0.6−4.5 mg/mL), and lower in relation to Gram-negative bacteria (MIC 0.6–9.0 mg/mL). The extracts had similar bactericidal activity, and MBC values ranged from 0.6 to 18.0 mg/mL. The test strains had different sensitivity to the 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts. The most sensitive bacteria were 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MIC/MBC 0.6–2.2 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC 0.6–1.1 mg/mL, MBC 0.6–9.0 mg/mL). Differences in the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of the extracts were also observed.
