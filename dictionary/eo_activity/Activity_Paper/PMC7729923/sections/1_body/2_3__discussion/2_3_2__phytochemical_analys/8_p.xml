<p>Phenylpropanoid glycosides are often found in in vitro cultures of various plants. The highest concentration of verbascoside among plants grown in in vitro conditions were observed in 
 <italic>Buddleja cordata</italic> cell suspension cultures and reached 11.6 g/100 g DW [

 <italic>Salvia vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Cistanche salsa</italic> have been 16 g/100 g DW and 689 mg/L, respectively [
