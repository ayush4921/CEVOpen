<p>In the suspension cultures of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, successfully established for the first time in the present work, also grown on the previously selected MS medium (containing 1 mg/L BAP and 1 mg/L IBA), the increases in biomass varied from 1.87 to 5.02 times (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05609-f002">Figure 2</xref>), depending on the inoculum to volume-of-medium ratio. Satisfactory 5.02-fold increases were obtained during 2-week growth cycles with the smallest tested amount of inoculum (1.5 g per 30 mL of medium). Such biomass increments are satisfactory enough for suspension cultures.
