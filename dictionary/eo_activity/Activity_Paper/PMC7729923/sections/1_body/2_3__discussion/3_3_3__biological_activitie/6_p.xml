<p>The antibacterial potential of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts was assessed by MIC/MBC determination (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). All the extracts showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity, although the power of the effect was different. The strongest antimicrobial activity was found for 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, which is an agreement with the results of antioxidant assays and the highest content of total phenolics, verbascoside, isoverbascoside and phenolic acids in these extracts. The strong mode of action of verbascoside against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is based on the inhibition of protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts has been the subject of several studies. Results of previous research are consistent with ours, indicating that the verbena herb extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. The Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> showed resistance toward 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The high sensitivity of bacteria 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> to other plant extracts has already been confirmed by other authors. The MIC values of plant extracts for these bacteria were comparable to the values obtained for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The similar study performed by another team also showed differences in the antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> prepared from various parts of the plant. Extracts from the stems showed, in general, higher antibacterial activity than leaf and root extracts. However, the extracts were shown to be active against bacterial strains that cause serious infections, including methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains and multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> [
