<p>As for the secondary antioxidant properties, all the biomass extracts displayed higher chelating activity than that of 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo, which does not seem to be related to the phenolic content. In fact, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, exhibiting the highest total phenolic content, showed the best chelating properties, followed by 
 <italic>Vo-C</italic>, containing the lowest total phenolic concentration. The lack of correlation between chelating activity and phenolic content is in agreement with previous researches published by some of the authors [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and indicates that the observed activity might depend also on non-phenolic chelators present in the extracts. However, the partial involvement of phenylpropanoid glycosides and phenolic acids, whose chelating capacities have been reported, cannot be excluded [

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The greater activity observed for 
 <italic>Vo-C</italic> in comparison to 
 <italic>Vo-STB</italic> could be explained, at least in part, by the presence of higher amounts of isoverbascoside whose Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity was previously demonstrated to be 2-fold stronger than that of verbascoside [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and of chlorogenic acid, a strong iron chelator [
