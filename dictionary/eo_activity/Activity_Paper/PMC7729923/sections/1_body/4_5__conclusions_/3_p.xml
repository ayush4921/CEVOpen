<p>Based on the results, the STB was selected as the best in vitro system for the increased production of phenylpropanoid glycosides. In addition, the extract obtained from biomass produced in STB displayed significant efficacy in all the biological activity tests carried out in this study. Our results suggest that cultures maintained in STB could be a valuable source of bioactive compounds alternative to the parent plant grown in vivo.</p>
