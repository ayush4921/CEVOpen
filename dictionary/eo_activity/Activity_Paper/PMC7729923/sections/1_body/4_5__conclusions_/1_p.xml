<p>Optimization of the best culture conditions for biomass growth and for the production of bioactive compounds in three types of vervain in vitro cultures (callus, suspension, bioreactors cultures) was performed. Very good results were obtained in suspension culture and bioreactors cultures (balloon bioreactor—BB and stirred-tank bioreactor—STB) both established for the first time.</p>
