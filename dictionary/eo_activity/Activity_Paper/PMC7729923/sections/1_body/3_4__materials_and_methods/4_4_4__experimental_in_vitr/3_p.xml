<p>For the establishment of suspension cultures, the biomass propagated on agar medium was transferred (1.5, 3 and 4.5 g of callus) to the liquid medium by gently dispersing the biomass with a steel tweezer, to minimize mechanical damage of tissue. Biomasses were placed into 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 mL of MS medium with 1 mg/L BAP, 1 mg/L IBA and 30 g/L sucrose, and closed with silicone foam stoppers. The cultures were incubated on an orbital shaker (Innova 2300 Platform Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific, USA) for 14 days at 120 rpm (3 series, 10 samples each).</p>
