<p>In the second part of our research, a comparative evaluation of some biological activities of extracts obtained from biomasses grown in different in vitro systems and in the parent plant was performed. The toxicity of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts was determined in vivo using the brine shrimp (
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> Leach) lethality bioassay and the antiproliferative activity was assessed in vitro in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY-5Y cell line. The antioxidant potential of the extracts was evaluated through different in vitro methods: DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl), reducing power and ferrous ions (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) chelating activity assays. Moreover, the extracts were studied on antibacterial properties towards four Gram-positive and eight Gram-negative bacterial strains.
