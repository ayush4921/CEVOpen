 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, the major compounds of interest are phenylpropanoid glycosides, represented mainly by verbascoside which was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective (including neuroprotective activity), antibacterial, antiviral and anti-androgen properties. Verbascoside also protects the skin from UV irradiation [
