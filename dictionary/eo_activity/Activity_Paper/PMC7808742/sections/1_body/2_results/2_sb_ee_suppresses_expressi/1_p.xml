<p>As NO production is mainly regulated by iNOS in macrophages, we evaluated the effect of Sb-EE on 
 <italic>iNOS</italic> gene expression using semi-quantitative PCR (Lirk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). To further investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of Sb-EE, we examined the expression patterns of inflammatory genes such as 
 <italic>COX-2</italic> and 
 <italic>TNF-α</italic> in Sb-EE-pre-treated RAW264.7 cells. Sb-EE significantly diminished the mRNA expression of 
 <italic>iNOS</italic> and 
 <italic>COX-2</italic> at all concentrations (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). TNF-α expression was also inhibited in the group pre-treated with 200 µg/mL Sb-EE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). Then, to understand the molecular mechanism underlying anti-inflammatory activity of Sb-EE, molecular biological assays were conducted using Sb-EE of 200 µg/mL, the most effective but non-cytotoxic concentration. As these genes are regulated at the transcriptional level, we studied whether Sb-EE regulates NF-κB and AP-1, which are major transcriptional factors in inflammatory gene expression (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A luciferase assay was performed using HEK 293 cells susceptible to plasmid transfection. To mimic LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells, HEK 293 cells were transfected with MyD88 or TRIF, which are adaptor proteins for TLR4 signalling (Akira and Takeda 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We found that Sb-EE blocked only MyD88-dependent NF-κB and AP-1 luc activity, not TRIF-dependent signalling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B,C)</xref>). The inhibitory activity of Sb-EE against NF-κB and AP-1 was further confirmed by immunoblotting with nuclear lysates. Consistent with our luciferase assay results, nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits (p65 and p50) was significantly attenuated by Sb-EE at all indicated times after LPS stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>). Sb-EE also suppressed nuclear translocation of the AP-1 subunits, c-Fos and c-Jun, 30 min after LPS stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>). These results indicate Sb-EE exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting NF-κB and AP-1 signalling.
