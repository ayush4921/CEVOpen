<p>To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of Sb-EE, we assessed the effect of Sb-EE on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In the Griess assay, Sb-EE (25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µg/mL) significantly suppressed NO in a dose-dependent manner (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=34 µg/mL) (

Then, HPLC analysis was performed to identify the phytochemical composition of Sb-EE. Quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol, which have strong antioxidant properties, were used as standard compounds (Crozier et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Romanova et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Peak of each standard compound was observed at certain retention time (quercetin = 34.2, luteolin = 35 and kaempferol = 39), and Sb-EE sample also has peaks at 34.2, 35 and 38.9 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(D)</xref>). These results suggest that Sb-EE contained quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol, and that anti-inflammatory activity of Sb-EE may have been derived from these phenolic components.
