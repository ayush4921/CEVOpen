<p>To generate an acute gastritis mice model, ICR mice (four mice/group) were used as previously reported (Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) or ranitidine (40 mg/kg) was orally injected into ICR mice twice a day for two days. After 1 h of final administration, 60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl was orally injected to induce gastritis. After 1 h, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed. Subsequently, redness of gastric mucosal lesions was observed.
