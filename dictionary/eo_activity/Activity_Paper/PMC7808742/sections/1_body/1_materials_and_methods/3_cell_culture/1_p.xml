<p>To prepare cell culture media, 1% penicillin–streptomycin was added to RPMI 1640 and DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% FBS, respectively. RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells were cultured using RPMI1640 and DMEM media in a humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C. Trypsin was used for the subculture of HEK293T cells, and a cell scraper was used to detach RAW264.7 cells from the plate.
