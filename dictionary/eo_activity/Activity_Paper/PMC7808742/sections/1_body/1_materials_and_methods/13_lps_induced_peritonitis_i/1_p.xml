<p>Acute peritonitis mice were generated using C57BL/6 mice (10 mice/group) as previously reported (Yi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) suspended in 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was orally administered once per day for five days. Acute peritonitis was induced with an intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 mL (10 mg/kg) LPS on day 4 after Sb-EE administration. Peritoneal fluid was harvested by intraperitoneal lavage using sterile PBS on day 5. In peritoneal macrophages obtained from peritonitis mice, NO production and phosphorylation pattern of target proteins were analysed using an NO assay and immunoblotting, respectively.
