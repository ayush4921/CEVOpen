<p>To obtain total cell lysate, harvested cells were first washed with cold PBS containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The washed cells were then lysed in ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na
 <sub>3</sub>VO
 <sub>4</sub> and 1 mM NaF) including protease inhibitors (2 mM PMSF, 100 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL pepstatin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin and 2 mM EDTA) for 30 min with rotation at 4 °C. At this time, a sonicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to improve cell lysis efficiency as reported previously (Choi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Lysates were refined by centrifugation at 16,000×

In the first step, harvested cells were washed and lysed with 500 mL lysis buffer (50 mM KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 20 μg/mL aprotinin and 100 μM 1,4-dithiothreitol) on ice for 4 min. Second, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000×
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min. The pellet obtained from lysates was washed with washing buffer (lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40). Finally, the pellet containing nuclei was lysed with an extraction buffer (lysis buffer with 500 mM KCl and 10% glycerol). The nuclei/extraction buffer mixture was frozen at −80 °C, and then centrifuged at 16,000×
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as a nuclear extract.
