  <p>Inhibitory effect of Sb-EE on NF-κB signalling enzymes. (A, B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/mL) for the indicated time in the presence or absence of Sb-EE (200 μg/mL). The levels of phospho- and total-IκBα (A), Src, Syk, p85 and β-actin (B) were determined by immunoblotting using whole lysates. (C) RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with Sb-EE in a dose-dependent manner, and were thereafter triggered with LPS for 3 min. Then, p-Src, Src and β-actin levels were detected by immunoblotting. (D) To examine the direct effects of Sb-EE on Src and Syk activity, an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed with purified Src and Syk.
