  <p>Inhibitory effect of Sb-EE on AP-1 signalling enzymes. (A–C) RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/mL) for the indicated time in the presence or absence of Sb-EE (200 μg/mL). Then, an immunoblotting assay was performed with antibodies for phospho- and total-forms of target proteins. The antibodies against p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-p85 and p85 antibodies were used to detect the MAPKs (A). The antibodies against p-TAK1, TAK-1, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, p-MKK4/7, MKK4/7, p-MKK3/6 and MKK3/6 were used to detect the upstream enzymes of MAPKs (B, left and right panel). IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 antibodies were used to detect the initially activated enzymes in the AP-1 signalling pathway (C). (D) To examine the direct effects of Sb-EE on IRAK1 activity, an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed with purified IRAK1.
