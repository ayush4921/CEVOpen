<p>Currently, in vitro culture of callus has been reported as an alternative method for the production of biomass aiming at the production of secondary metabolites, especially for the ease of induction and proliferation, being a simpler process than organogenic or embryogenic responses, which allows increasing the in vitro plant biomass, one of the main economic limitations in the production of secondary metabolites in vitro [
