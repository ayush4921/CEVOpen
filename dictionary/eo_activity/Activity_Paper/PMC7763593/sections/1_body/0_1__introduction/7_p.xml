<p>In addition, calli could be a possible source of new medicinal compounds scarcely reported in commonly differentiated tissues, such as leaves, roots, and stems of medicinal plants cultivated under field conditions. Thus, callus cell proliferation can be an efficient bioreactor for the biosynthesis of specific plant-derived medicinal compounds from relevant medicinal plants, such as 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> species. In this context, the main objective of this study was to develop a protocol for in vitro callus induction and proliferation in 
 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic>, aiming at the production of plant biomass and the identification of main secondary metabolites in the calli of this species, in comparison to those conventionally produced by micropropagated plants grown in greenhouses.
