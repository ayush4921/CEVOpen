<p>The results obtained in the callus proliferation phase showed that the concentrations of 0.50 and 0.75 mg/L 2,4-D, in the absence of BA, resulted in the largest callus diameters at 60 days of cultivation (2.04–2.39 cm). In the culture medium containing BA, 0.25 mg/L 2,4-D combined with BA (1 or 2 mg/L) produced the best results (2.03–2.17 cm), with no statistical differences between BA concentrations (
