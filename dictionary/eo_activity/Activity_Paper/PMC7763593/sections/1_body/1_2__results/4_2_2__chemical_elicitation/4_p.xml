<p>However, in calli obtained in BA treatment and cultivated under light conditions, the most representative molecule, observed independently of elicitors, was identified as betulin-aldehyde or betulone (440 g/mol), with relative percentage of 62.5% with control, 61% with SA, and 76% with chitosan. Stigmasterol and γ-sitosterol were also concentrated in all treatments. Two molecules, α-muurolene (204 g/mol) and β-amyrin (426 g/mol), were biosynthesized only in the control and with SA as an elicitor, but not with chitosan.</p>
