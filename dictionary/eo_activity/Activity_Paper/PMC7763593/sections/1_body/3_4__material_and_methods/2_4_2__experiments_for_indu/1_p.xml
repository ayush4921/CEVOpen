<p>These experiments aimed to test the influence of 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on the induction of calli from stem nodal segments with approximately 1.0 ± 0.2 cm length and calli proliferation. For this, two experiments were carried out in the dark conditions, one for induction using the nodal segments of seedlings germinated in vitro and the second using the calli induced from the previous phase, with approximately 0.5 ± 0.2 cm diameter and 0.104 g/calli as explants. An experiment was also carried out with different concentrations of BA and callus cultivation under light conditions.</p>
