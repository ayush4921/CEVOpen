<p>From these comparisons, betulin or betulone and tetracyclic triterpenes were identified in green calli and were reported as the main metabolites with relative amounts ranging from 61â€“76% in green calli obtained with BA + light, from

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05895-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These substances and some of their derivatives proved to be potent candidates with anticancer activity, showing cytotoxic activity against different human cell lines of carcinoma and in vitro stomach (MGC-803), breast (Bcap-37, MCF-7), prostate (PC3), melanoma (SK-MEL-2, A-375), medulloblastoma (Dayo), glioblastoma (LN-229), ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3) colon carcinoma (HT-29), and promyelocytic leukemia cancer cell lines (HL-60) [
