<p>Although BA did not induce calli in nodal segments of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> under dark conditions, its use alone induced high proliferation of calli under light conditions. Not only was there an increase in the fresh weight and diameter of calli, but there was also a change in the pattern of development of these calli, which changed from a beige color and a friable appearance (with 2,4-D + dark) to a green color and a hard consistency (BA + light), demonstrating that the action of this cytokinin is enhanced in the presence of light, especially since light has effects on the regulation of cytokinin synthesis, action, transport, and oxidation (Roman et al., 2016), generating changes in growth (cell divisions), as well as in the differentiation of callus cells, resulting in a green color (chlorophyll biosynthesis) and rigid consistency (biosynthesis of cell wall) (
