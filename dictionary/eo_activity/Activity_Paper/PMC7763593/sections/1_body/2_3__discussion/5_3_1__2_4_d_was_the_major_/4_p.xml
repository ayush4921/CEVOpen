<p>In the proliferation phase of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> calli, the largest fresh weights were obtained in concentrations of 0.25 mg/L + BA (1 or 2 mg/L) and 0.50 or 0.75 mg/L of 2.4-D without the addition of BA, with an interaction between these two phytoregulators (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05895-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The largest fresh weight of calli (2.30 g/callus) in the present study was obtained with 0.75 mg/L 2,4-D. Muthusamy et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] using 7 µM 2,4-D + 1 µM BA reported fresh weight of 0.15–0.30 g/callus, much lower than values observed in the present study with the same species. Values close to 1.5 g/callus were reported by these authors only with the addition of 30 µM cinnamic acid.
