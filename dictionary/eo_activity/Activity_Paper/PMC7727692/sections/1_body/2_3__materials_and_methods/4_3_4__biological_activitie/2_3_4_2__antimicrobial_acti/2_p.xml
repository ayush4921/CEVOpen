<p>The samples (500 µg/mL in DMSO) were setup in triplicates. The negative control contained 160 µL culture + 20 µL DMSO, while the positive control contained 160 µL culture + 20 µL vancomycin (Gram-positive strains) or ampicillin (for Gram-negative strains). The sterile control contained 50 µL broth + 80 µL sterile distilled water + 50 µL DMSO, while the well for the samples contained prepared sample + 160 µL culture (to a final concentration of 55.6 µg/mL).</p>
