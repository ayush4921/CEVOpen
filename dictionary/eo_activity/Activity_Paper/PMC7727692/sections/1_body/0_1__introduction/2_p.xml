<p>Although 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> is widely cultivated for its ornamental purposes, the essential oils extracted from the plant are potent biological agents [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], e.g., exhibiting remarkable antifungal activities, for instance, the effectiveness in the treatment of fungal infections in the mammalian lungs was reported by Hood et al. [

 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> also exhibited bioactivities both in the in vitro and in vivo studies against 
 <italic>Aspergillosis</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [
