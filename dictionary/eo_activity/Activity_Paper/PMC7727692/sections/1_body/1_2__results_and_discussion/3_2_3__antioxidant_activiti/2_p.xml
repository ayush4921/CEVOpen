<p>Both the crude extract and the flavonoid compound (6-methyltectochrysin) isolated from 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> showed positive antioxidant activity. The crude extract of 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> was found to exhibit better antioxidant activity than the purified isolated flavonoid. The oxygen radical absorption of the crude extract was found to be 2-fold greater than 6-methyltectochrysin, and about 8-fold higher in ferric-reducing potential relative to the isolated flavonoid. The ABTS radical scavenging assay showed a similar trend, with the methanolic crude exhibiting almost 3-fold higher antioxidant capacity than the isolated flavonoid. The purified flavonoid and the naturally occurring antioxidant samples had lower antioxidant capacities against the ascorbic acid control.
