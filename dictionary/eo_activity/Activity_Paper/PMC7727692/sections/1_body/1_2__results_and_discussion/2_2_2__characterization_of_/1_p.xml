<p>A portion of the yellowish powdery material obtained (0.6 g) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography to obtain pure yellowish crystals (235 mg, one spot on TLC) (suspected flavonoid) while other fractions obtained were (suspected) mixtures of flavonoid and triterpenes. The purified compound, yellowish needle-shaped crystals had R
