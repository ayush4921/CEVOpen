 </sup> with slight modifications. A stock solution of DPPH (0.1 mM) was prepared in methanol and kept overnight in the dark at room temperature. The working solution of DPPH was prepared by its stock solution diluting with methanol to an absorbance of 0.9 ± 0.05 at 517 nm. The 100 µl of chloroformic extract with different concentration (20– 100 µg/ml) was mixed separately with 1.9 ml of working DPPH solution and kept in dark for 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm.
