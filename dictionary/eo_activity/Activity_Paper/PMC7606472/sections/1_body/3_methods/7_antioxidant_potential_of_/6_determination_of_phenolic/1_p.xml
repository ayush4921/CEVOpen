 </sup>. The system was equipped with microsorb-MV 100-5 C-18 column of dimensions 150 × 4.6 × 5 µm particle size, LC- 30 AD quaternary gradient pump and SPD-M20 A diode array detector (DAD). Seventy percent methanol and water was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 27 °C and the run time of the sample was 26 min. The compounds were identified at 280 nm by comparison of their retention time with available standards.
