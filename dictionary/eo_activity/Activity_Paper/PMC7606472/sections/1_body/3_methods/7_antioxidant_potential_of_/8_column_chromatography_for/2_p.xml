<p id="Par33">The most active fraction showing a single band on thin layer chromatography (TLC) was further subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using (Shimadzu Nexera system, USA) to see the purity of active fraction. Acetonitrile (40%) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup> and injection volume of 300 µl at a temperature of 45 °C. The detections were monitored at 280 nm
