 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> strain TA98 was used, provided by the Institute Pasteur, France. From the above mentioned stock of chloroformic extract, different concentrations (0.05-1 mg) were prepared in 30% DMSO. For positive control, 0.1 ml of overnight grown culture and 0.1 ml of 2 AF (2- aminofluorene) mutagen was added to top agar and poured onto minimal agar plates. To determine the toxicity of the fungal extract, 0.1 ml of the overnight grown culture and 0.1 ml of the chloroformic fungal extract were used. Further, to calculate the percentage inhibition of chloroformic fungal extract, the co- incubation and pre-incubation modes were used where 0.1 ml of overnight bacterial culture, 0.5 ml of S9 mix (Sterile distilled water 16.75 ml, 0.2 M Sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 M NADP, 1 M G-6-P, MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>–KCl, Rat liver S9 (phenobarbitone induced), 0.1 ml of 2-AF and 0.1 ml of chloroformic fungal extract were added into top agar and poured onto the plates.
