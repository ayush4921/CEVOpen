<p id="Par18">The bioactive components present in the chloroformic extract have been analysed using GCâ€“MS which revealed the presence of various compounds that might be responsible for bioactivities. One of these compounds, i.e. phenol, 2,4 bis (1,1dimethylethyl) isolated from 
 <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> associated with seaweed 
 <italic>Gracilaria gracilis</italic>, has already been reported for its antibiofilm potential

 </sup> Similarly other such compound i.e. 7-hexadecenal, (Z) has been reported for antiviral activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Hexadecenal, 10-heneicosene (c,t), 3- eicosene and 1-heneicosanol compounds have been previously reported in literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> but not studied for their antimutagenic, anticancerous and antioxidant activities which adds further credence to the study. Thus, the study concludes with the observation that the endophytic 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> possessed a good bioactive potential and can be used for further development of bioactive drug/s for pharmaceutical and medical applications.
