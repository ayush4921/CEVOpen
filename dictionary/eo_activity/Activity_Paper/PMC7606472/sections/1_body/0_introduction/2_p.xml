 </sup>. Therefore, endophytes have been drawing the attention for their metabolites which may turn out to be better than plant metabolites. Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants have thus proven to be a rich source of bioactive metabolites having antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities

 </sup>.Thus, endophytic communities existing in the tissues of living plants are potential resources of novel natural products for exploitation by the pharmaceutical industry.
