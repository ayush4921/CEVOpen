<p>Whilst there are numerous studies on the biological activity of essential oils, aspects such as safety, astringency, cost and the solubility in water stifle their applications as nutraceuticals. This study was mainly focused on investigating the in vitro hypoglycemic effects of aqueous extracts of Cinnamon. This is in view of developing a safe, readily soluble Cinnamon extract for human consumption that could effectively control hyperglycemia in diabetic individuals. Hence in the current study, the total phenolic content, proanthocyandins and essential oils were determined as compounds largely responsible for the biologicals activities explored. The results showed that Sri Wijaya Cinnamon water extract prepared using high pressure and the decoction method had the highest anti-diabetic potential. The extracts have to be further purified and developed with in depth studies using cell cultures and experimental animals for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.</p>
