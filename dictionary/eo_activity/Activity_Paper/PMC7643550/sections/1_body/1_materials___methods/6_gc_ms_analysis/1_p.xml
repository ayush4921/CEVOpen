<p>Crude extract (4.00 mg) was dissolved in 1.00 mL of hexane and the samples were filtered using a nylon filter (0.45 µm pore size). A 0.7 µL aliquot of the above was injected in the split less mode into a GC/MS 7890B Gas Chromatograph (Agilent, American) equipped with a 5977B mass spectrometer (Agilent, American). A fused silica capillary Agilent Technology HP-5 (5% phenyl-methyl polysiloxane) column (30 m ×  0.25 mm ×  0.25 µm) was used for the separation. The injector temperature was 250 °C. The initial temperature was kept at 40 °C, for 3 min and the temperature was gradually increased to 220 °C at the rate of 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and was then held for 2 min at 220 °C. Again the temperature was gradually increased to 230 °C at the rate of 8 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and held for 3 min at 230 °C. The Post run was at 235 °C held for 3 min. The Total GC running time was 54.25 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> at the split-less mode. EI was used as the ion source, and the ion source temperature was 230 °C. The sector mass analyzer was set to scan from 40 to 650 amu The volatile components of the extracts were identified using mass spectral data, with computer assisted matching with WILEY 275 and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST6.0) libraries.
