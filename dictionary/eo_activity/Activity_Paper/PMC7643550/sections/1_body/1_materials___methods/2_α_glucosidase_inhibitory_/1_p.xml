 </italic> was used to determine the in vitro anti-diabetic properties of Cinnamon extracts. Varying concentrations (12.5 µg/mL – 400 µg/mL) of Cinnamon quill extract (100 µL) and 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (100 µL) with α-glucosidase enzyme solution (1 Unit/mL) were incubated in 96 well plates at 37 °C for 10 min. After pre-incubation, 2.5 mM 4-Nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) solution (20 µL) in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 was added to each well. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After the incubation, the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded by the micro plate reader (Spectra Max M5, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Acarbose was used as the positive control (12.5 µg/mL – 400 µg/mL). The solvent alone was used as the blank in the assay. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated as follows;
