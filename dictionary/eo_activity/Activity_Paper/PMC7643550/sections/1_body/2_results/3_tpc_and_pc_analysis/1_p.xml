<p>Total phenolic content was expressed as mg GAE/g and PC was expressed as mg of catechin equivalent/g. In comparing the TPC and the PC of extracts, the highest TPC and the highest PC were obtained for the DWE (2.24 ±  0.00 mg GAE/g and 40.05 ±  0.10 mg of catechin equivalent/g respectively) for SW. The extracts obtained by SD had the lowest TPC and PC for SW (0.21 ±  0.01 mg GAE/g and 1 ±  0.01 mg of catechin equivalent/g) (
