 <italic>Musculus gastrocnemius</italic>), heart, kidney, and liver tissues were removed, rinsed with a standard normal saline cold solution, dried with gauze, and kept in the refrigerator at −20°C for further use. All the blood samples were drawn in individual additive test tubes which contained EDTA and coated with heparin. However, the whole blood samples and erythrocytes in blood were used for the determination of the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Blood samples were stored at −20°C until they were analyzed.
