<p>The rats which had blood glucose levels more than 200 mg/dl were considered diabetic and were included in the conducted study. Blood glucose concentration was measured with a Glucostix strip test in a glucometer (Abbott Glucometer Med. Prod., California, United States). Since streptozotocin injection may result in fatal hypoglycemia related to massive insulin release, the diabetic rats were kept on a 5% glucose solution diet for 24 h after STZ injection to prevent hypoglycemia.</p>
