<p>Glucose levels in blood samples obtained from each experimental group by cutting the tail of rats every week of the experiment were estimated using blood Glucostix strips (Abbott-Glucometer, USA). The levels of HDL-C, TG, and TC in serum samples were assessed using standard biochemical apparatus as an autoanalyzer (Abbott, USA). However, the serum insulin level in the serum was evaluated using Rat ELISA kit (Lab science, E-EL-R2466, USA). Moreover, the plasma SOD and GSH-Px levels were estimated by utilizing available commercial kit (YL Biotech, Shanghai), and the PON1 and ARE enzyme activities in serum were estimated using a commercial kit (Rel Assay Diagnostics, Mega TÄ±p, Gaziantep, Turkey).</p>
