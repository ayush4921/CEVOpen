<p>TCM has been used in the treatment of CHD for thousands of years and has achieved certain curative effects [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Studies have reported the roles of TCM. For example, based on a blinded randomized controlled trial, Chen et al. showed that Huoxue Huayu therapy is an effective and safe therapy for patients with CHD after percutaneous coronary intervention; it works by decreasing the degree of restenosis and improving the revascularization rate [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, Gong et al. found that Radix 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Radix Astragali, and other herbs were frequently used for the treatment of CHD as evidenced by a literature review covering the recent 20 years [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although many TCMs have been reported to show curative effects when used for CHD, their widespread applications are also hampered due to a lack of rigorous clinical trials and their complex compositions, as well as their unclear pharmacological mechanisms.
