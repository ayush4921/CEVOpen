AD is detected by the presence of several molecular lesions that lead to the inflammatory and oxidative damage due to the presence of misfolded proteins accumulated in the aging brain, amounting to synaptic dysfunction and energy loss [<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globally, over 24 million people are estimated to have dementia, of who a majority suffer from AD. Thereby imperatively prioritizing AD research, which represents a major public health concern. As of today, the treatments available focus on reducing the symptoms of AD. Implying the need to understand better the disease pathogenesis in an attempt to discover/develop the kind of treatment that could subside the symptoms or repair the done damage [<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Age remains the main risk factor associated with the AD; with most of victims aged over 65 years [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Early diagnosis and investigation remain the most crucial factor to focus the therapeutic ventures involving both pharmaceutical and psychosocial support systems.</p><fig id="adr-4-adr200228-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Histopathological variations between a) healthy neuron and b) AD neuron.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="adr-4-adr200228-g001"/></fig><p>The end stages of AD are marked by the continuous loss of physical and mental autonomy, culminating in dependency and burden on others due to motor function deterioration. The advance stages of AD usually include mood swings, language disorientation, self-care mismanagement, loss of motivation, and behavioral integrity. A sense of social and familial withdrawal is also observed as the condition worsens [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>]. Ultimately body functions are lost gradually leading to death. The rate of disease progression varies among individuals, and the average life expectancy in an event of AD may range from 3&#x02013;9 years after the initial diagnosis [<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1, 5</xref>].</p><p>Knowledge about the causative factors of AD is limited; however, genetic inheritance of the disease is believed to be the major associated risk factor [<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other risk factors include head trauma, depression, and hypertension [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Notwithstanding, AD remains a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease which includes both risk factors and genetic mutations occurring due to abnormal accumulation of amyloid-&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) and tau proteins. While the presence of phosphorylated tau has been identified in the brain during early stages, the later stages are characterized by the presence of insoluble A&#x003b2; protein deposits. Studies indicate that the amount of insoluble A&#x003b2; protein deposits is directly proportional to the extent of dementia in those suffering with AD [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, A&#x003b2; protein is believed to cause further inflammatory reactions that promote development of AD and cognitive decline. The A&#x003b2; hypothesis postulates that A&#x003b2; protein accumulation is the primary cause or effect of the pathogenesis of AD and the disease further progresses due to the imbalance caused by the A&#x003b2; production and clearance. Several primary strategies have been deployed against AD using this hypothesis [<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>AD diagnosis mostly comprises of cognitive testing, apart from the regular blood tests and medical imaging [<xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the definite diagnosis of AD relies upon a clear brain tissue examination. Although studies suggest that the risk of AD can be reduced by performing physical and mental exercises to reduce obesity, there are no such specific therapies limited to risk reduction for AD [<xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Although some medication can help reduce the symptoms, no such treatment exists which promises either reversing or stopping the AD progression [<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prescribed antipsychotic drugs are limited to the treatment of psychosis, behavioral changes, or dementia, with no or little benefit toward the patient as they promote an early death [<xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The initiation of AD occurrence involves a complex pathogenic process which may have started decades before the symptomatic phase arrives. Early stage treatment addressing the problem at molecular levels at which the initial structural alterations occur would translate into a successful therapy. Currently, such disease-modifying drugs designed to be used in the early stages of AD are in the developmental stage. Multifactorial pathogenesis of AD addressing various molecular targets seems to be the possible approach to be followed modify the disease progression. Thus, the drugs having multimodal action or the combination of drugs targeting the single molecular mechanism promise alternative AD therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>DISEASE PREVALENCE STATUS</title><p>AD was first described more than 100 years ago [<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As of 2015, about 29.8 million people were affected by AD globally [<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It mostly affects the people over 65 years of age, resulting in the death of 1.9 million affected patients. This form of dementia or AD is expected to double every two decades meaning that the number of AD cases would be around 42 million in the ongoing year of 2020 and reach nearly 81 million by 2040 [<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Regarded as a costly disease due to its expensive treatment costs, the cause of AD is poorly understood. While 70% risk of AD may be inherited from the person&#x02019;s familial history. Hypertension, head injuries, and depression are a few other risk factors leading to the cause of AD. The patients usually rely on others for their assistance by being a burden to them. Survival and incidence are the other factors on which the prevalence of AD depends. In the year 2000, AD prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in the age group 65&#x02013;74, as compared to 19% in the age group 75&#x02013;84. However, there is a low prevalence rate in the less developed regions. In 2005, 0.379% of global population suffered from dementia, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating an increase in the prevalence rate from 0.441% in the 2015 to 0.556% in 2030. If this trend continued, the rate of prevalence would triple in the upcoming years [<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>STAGES OF ALZHEIMER&#x02019;S DISEASE</title><p>AD is characterized into give different stages: 1) Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Mild AD; 3) Moderate AD; 4) Severe AD; and 5) Very Severe AD. Several studies suggest that the very early phase may be regarded MCI, which may remain unchanged for years, characterized by predominant loss of memory along with cognitive deficits. Whatsoever, there is no clear evidence for this disease. An ambiguity does prevail regarding MCI, with a few concluding it to be an AD precursor, while others classify it a normal aging phenomenon. Despite the debate, few studies have reported that cognitive impairment is the precursor causing dementia which is 15-fold more likely than normal aging to progress into AD. Presently, both early metabolic and structural changes in the brain can be identified using imaging techniques, whereas there is no single screening technique/test to identify the individuals affected with MCI. In such a situation, people with cognitive decline can be accurately predicted utilizing the combination tests involving neuroimaging and neuropsychology.</p><fig id="adr-4-adr200228-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.2</label><caption><p>Different stages involved in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="adr-4-adr200228-g002"/></fig><p>The stable MCI phase ends up with cognitive function decline that may last for about two to five years with the degradation of implicit memory (related to experience) and semantic memory (of stored general knowledge and facts). However, there is no evidence that may link such loss of memory to AD. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that these risks can be reduced only if an early recognition and assessment of mild cognitive impairment can be conducted [<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Mild AD stage is noted for short term memory loss coupled with forgetfulness, loss of interest and hobbies, repetitive questioning, and change in the routine [<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The patients may also suffer from lingual disorientation caused due to shrinking vocabulary and troubled fluency. Upon disease progression, the patients may be incapable to perform several tasks independently, particularly requiring supervision or assistance for the cognitively demanding activities [<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>When it comes to moderate AD, there are further drastic changes and impaired routine observed alongside symptoms of emerging psychological behaviors of dementia, following the continuous cognitive deficits coupled with the transitions in care. Long term memory loss is observed at this stage where 30% of patients may also develop illusionary misidentifications.</p><p>The fourth stage, severe AD, is characterized by altered and agitated sleep patterns with progressive symptoms pertaining to psychological behaviors of dementia and may require assistance even to bathe, feed, or dress. Thereby implying a complete dependence of the patients on caretakers.</p><p>The final stage is called very severe AD where reduced language or oration, like the use of one word or simple phrases eventually leading to no speech, and being bedbound with loss of basic psychomotor skills, can be observed. Ultimately the patients will lose the capacity to carry out any task on their own. In this stage, death may occur not just due to AD but also due to comorbidities such as pneumonia or ulcers [<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><fig id="adr-4-adr200228-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Flowchart 1</label><caption><p>Symptoms associated with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="adr-4-adr200228-g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER&#x02019;S DISEASE</title><p>Delaying or slowing down AD progression as well as postponing or preventing the disease in an older age can assure a consequential quality of life and health improvement. The high/elevated amounts of saturated fats may have negative effects on the age-related MCI and cognitive decline [<xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Case studies have shown that several risk factors are involved in causing AD. They include family history, depression, head injury, age, hypertension, apolipoprotein <italic>E4</italic> (<italic>APOE4</italic>) concentrations, low cognitive and physical activity, high cholesterol and diabetes. Promisingly, a few of the above-mentioned risk factors are modifiable [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that the risk of dementia and cognitive decline could be reduced with the possible association toward fish consumption resulting in uptake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids. On the contrary, consumption of dairy products with whole fats by elderly people might lead to cognitive decline [<xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moderate or light consumption of alcohol is also associated with a reduced risk of AD and incidence of dementia. There is limited evidence on how vegetable and fruit consumption may generally play a neuroprotective role against dementia, AD, and cognitive decline [<xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Notwithstanding, there is no clear evidence for the cause(s) of AD, except for the fact that about 1 to 5% of the reported cases indicate genetic reasons. However, a few hypotheses have been put forth in an attempt to explain the cause and prevalence of AD.</p><sec id="sec0025"><title>Hereditary factors</title><p>AD caused due to genetic heritability ranges from 49% to 79%, according to the studies conducted on familial history [<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of the above, only 0.1% of the cases have been symptomatic at the age of 65 or earlier, mostly due to the autosomal dominant inheritance, amounting to an early-onset disease [<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In any such case, the autosomal changes or mutations have been reported to occur in one of the three genes, <italic>viz.</italic> the genes encoding for presenilins 1 and 2, and the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP</italic>) [<xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a reported upregulation of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>, a small protein that happens to be the main component of senile plaques, production due to the above-mentioned gene mutation [<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, two other genes, <italic>SORL1</italic> (Sortilin related receptor 1) and <italic>ABCA7</italic> (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A member 7), have been identified to be associated with the autosomal dominant inheritance in AD [<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, AD is not usually inherited due to autosomal inheritance but due to mutational risk factors such as the genetic and environmental differences, so termed sporadic AD. The best-known example for such sporadic causes is the genetic inheritance of <italic>&#x0025b;</italic>4 allele of <italic>APOE</italic>. Supporting this, about 40% to 80% of the reported cases indicate at least one <italic>APOE</italic> allele [<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><title>Cholinergic hypothesis</title><p>According to the cholinergic hypothesis, it was postulated that AD occurred due to the decreased synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). This is the oldest known hypothesis and the currently available therapies for AD are mostly based on this [<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, limited support has been provided to the cholinergic hypothesis since the medications/drugs available to treat the deficiency of ACh are not that effective [<xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>This hypothesis is based on the fact that cholinergic neurons use ACh for cognitive processes of central and peripheral nervous systems apart from modulating several important neural functions. The cholinergic neurons, mainly found in the basal forebrain, spinal cord, striatum, medial habenula, and olfactory tubercle, are involved in vital physiological aspects such as memory, wakefulness and sleep, learning, sensory information, attention, and stress response-management. The CA3 cholinergic receptor is mainly involved in memory management, thus blocking this receptor might impair the functions of memory and information management in the brain. This consequent dopaminergic impairment and loss of cholinergic neurons was presumed to be the main factor responsible for the psychiatric symptoms related to AD [<xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, AD patients with terminal AD were said to have decreased enzymatic activity pertaining to the synthesis and degradation of acetylcholinesterase. Few research groups have confirmed the above hypothesis through evidence that some patients with AD have experienced a cognitive decline as a result of dysfunctional cholinergic system&#x000a0;[<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0035"><title>Amyloid hypothesis</title><p>The amyloid hypothesis, proposed in 1991, reasoned that AD occurred due to the presence of accumulated A&#x003b2; proteins [<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The <italic>APP</italic> gene, responsible for the production of A&#x003b2; protein, is located on the 21st chromosome and people exhibiting Down&#x02019;s syndrome (trisomy 21) carried an extra copy of this gene thus having the earliest recorded symptom(s) of AD by the age of 40 years [<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>APOE4</italic> has been considered the major risk factor for AD as it helps in the breakdown of A&#x003b2;, while some isoforms of <italic>APOE4</italic> are not very effective resulting in excess neural deposition of the amyloid [<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Researchers suspect that non-plaque A&#x003b2; oligomers referred to as ADDLs (amyloid-derived diffusible ligands) are the aggregates of several monomers which are the pathogenic primary forms of A&#x003b2;. The ADDLs modify the structure of synapse by binding to the neurons through surface receptor, causing a breakdown of neuronal communication [<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>This hypothesis was updated recently to suggest that there is a major culprit, N-APP, that not only causes AD but was also closely related to the A&#x003b2; protein. N-APP has been identified to be a fragment of the amyloid-&#x003b2; protein precursor (A&#x003b2;PP) peptide&#x02019;s N-terminus, eventually cleaved or broken-down from A&#x003b2;PP that is adjacent to the A&#x003b2; protein. This fragment, N-APP, binds to the neural receptor DR6 (death receptor 6). Also known as the TNFRSF21, to trigger a self-destruction pathway in the neuronal cells. The N-APP-DR6 pathway was reported to further damage the aging human brain as those brain regions affected by AD overexpress DR6 [<xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><sec id="sec0040"><title>Role of A&#x003b2;PP in normal conditions</title><p>A&#x003b2;PP is a resourceful molecule occurring in three isoforms and these isoforms are not functionally limited to the brain. They are reportedly present throughout the body, implying that A&#x003b2;PP must have important functions.

The A&#x003b2;PP<sub>695</sub> isoform lacks a KPI (Kunitz protease inhibitor) domain, in the extracellular region. In an event of AD, A&#x003b2;PP<sub>695</sub> has been reported to be overexpressed as compared to the other isoforms, at a ratio of 1:10:20 (A&#x003b2;PP<sub>770</sub>:A&#x003b2;PP<sub>751</sub>:A&#x003b2;PP<sub>695</sub>) [<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28, 29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><title>Putative functions of A&#x003b2;PP</title><p><italic>As a G protein-coupled receptor:</italic> G protein-coupled receptor(s) typically binds to a ligand(S) to induce a G protein complex trimer, eventually dissociating into the G<sub><italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> and G<sub><italic>&#x003b2;&#x003b3;</italic></sub> dimer subunits. These subunits are used to activate the intracellular downstream signaling pathways. G protein-mediated A&#x003b2;PP activation is not very well understood owing to the complexities involved in understanding the G protein coupling and pathways linked to it.

Therefore, numerous cases of MCI are diagnosed with a reduced brain size as compared to that of a healthy individual [<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, microscopic examination of AD brain tissues provides for a clear visibility of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques [<xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While plaques are formed around the neurons due to the deposition of dense and insoluble A&#x003b2; proteins, neurofibrillary tangles are the aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins accumulated inside the neurons. As a consequence of aging, fewer individuals might develop certain tangles and plaques when compared with the patients suffering from AD, who would display a greater number of tangles and plaques in the temporal lobe region [<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>DIAGNOSING ALZHEIMER&#x02019;S DISEASE</title><p>AD is primarily diagnosed based on the parameters that include the patient&#x02019;s medical history of behavioral observations and familial history. In addition, the presence or absence of neuropsychological and neurological characteristic conditions are also taken into consideration [<xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Assessment of patient&#x02019;s memory impairment by the means of their thinking skills, behavior changes, and functional abilities will have to be carried out in order to characterize stage of a prevailing AD [<xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Currently, there are standardized diagnostic protocols provided by various medical organizations, easing the AD detection process. Several tasks may be assigned by the consulting physician to analyze the individual&#x02019;s cognitive skills such as problem-solving, memory, thinking-ability, and language usage. Additionally, the below mentioned standard tests can be carried out to differentiate a case of dementia from that of&#x000a0;AD.</p><sec id="sec0075"><title>Mental status testing</title><p>A physician can test a patient&#x02019;s memory and thinking skills by checking their mental status and use scores to evaluate the degree or stage of cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="sec0080"><title>Brain imaging tests</title><p>The patient may be tested to evaluate their mental health and brain conditions associated with the cognitive skills. The interpretation of symptoms might indicate a wide range of conditions, like vitamin B-12 deficiency, thyroid disorder, dementia, or AD. To rule out or overcome this problem, certain confirmatory test will have to be conducted at a laboratory. Medical imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been extensively utilized to diagnose the AD. Notwithstanding, they may not be useful to differentiate between the other conditions mentioned above [<xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. But these techniques are definitely helpful in predicting the different stages of AD [<xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The loss or degeneration of brain cells associated with AD can be shown up in many ways.

They tend to hide the symptoms due to the loss of independence. Studies indicate that if the right choice is made at the right time, an early diagnosis could be beneficial to initiate either drug or non-drug therapies to control the progression of the disease by slowing down the decline of cognitive skills and memory. Additionally, sustenance strategies may be suggested to the caretakers to minimize the disease progression by planning activities to change the patient&#x02019;s everyday routine and enhance their living environment. An early diagnosis also it prepares the patient&#x02019;s family members to plan their future accordingly by prioritizing issues such as finances, community, and home care services [<xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0105"><title>PREVENTING ALZHEIMER&#x02019;S DISEASE</title><p>Certain studies have shown that there is no support or evidence to cure the disease solely via pharmaceutical means. Globally, measures have been taken to delay or even prevent the disease. However, a few studies have shown inconsistent results. Epidemiologically, various studies have suggested that several factors, such as the intellectual activities, diet, and cardiovascular risk factors, can be modified to delay the development of AD. Notwithstanding, clinical evidence is pending to conclude if the above can really help control AD occurrence. Yet, AD remains associated with very high-risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and diabetes, which may worsen the course of the disease&#x000a0;[<xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0110"><title>TREATMENT FOR THE DISEASE</title><p>AD and dementia have gained major public health concern owing to their lack of treatment. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that progresses day by day. The therapeutic agents used to treat AD must either completely cure the disease or slow down the progression. Presently, there are a few first-line medications/drugs, most of them working as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, available and with a Food and Drug Administration USA approval to treat AD. Researchers worldwide are focusing on modifying the disease to prevent or to stop further brain damage occurring in the patients. Treatment of patients with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can provide comfort by increasing the time of independence. Albeit, only treatments carried out on early or middle stage AD can have a positive effect and reduce the memory-related symptoms. Notwithstanding, none of these medications can completely reverse or stop the progression of this disease [<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The below table provides the details of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory drugs used to treat the mild to moderate to severe AD treatment with their listed mode of action and side effects.</p><p>The mechanistic route behind the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for AD is still unclear. A recent study suggested that the breakdown of ACh is prevented by these drugs. As the disease progresses, there would be a dip in amount of ACh in the brain, resulting in non-functional cholinesterase inhibitors. None of the above-listed medications can neither completely cures the disease nor enhances the patient&#x02019;s cognitive or memory skills as they are not designed to improve the neural functions. Hence, a need for an alternate source of medication to cure the AD arises [<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Ayurveda is a traditional medicinal practice that utilizes numerous plants and herbs to cure effectively a wide range of diseased conditions. Certain herbs have also been used to treat neurocognitive disorders like AD. This review looks into a few such herbal lead compounds for their activity against AD [<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0115"><title>HERBAL TREATMENT TO CURE ALZHEIMER&#x02019;S DISEASE</title><p>The process of AD drug discovery is critical, riskier, and not cost-effective [<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Medicinal plants and herbs constitute a complex mixture of phytocompounds of diverse pharmaco-biological significance, which is why herbal therapeutics are recommended to treat several diseases. In fact, plants have remained a major source of drugs across different medicinal practices. Few plants are used in the anti-aging therapies to help maintain homeostasis [<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the recent years, herbal formulations have gained significant commercial as well as scientific importance. Those medicinal plants/phytochemicals with the potential to restore memory, stimulate, and strengthen neuronal activity are termed &#x02018;Nervines&#x02019;. Phytochemical components such as tannins, sterols, flavonoids, alkaloids, lignins, triterpenes, and polyphenols are responsible for the plant&#x02019;s pharmacological activities such as antioxidants, anti-cholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic effects [<xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The studies have shown that using herbs against AD have a remarkable effect on the patient in improving their memory skills due to the increased activity of cholinesterase in the brain [<xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
