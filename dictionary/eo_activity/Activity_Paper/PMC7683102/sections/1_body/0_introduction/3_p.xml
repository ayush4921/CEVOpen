<p>Knowledge about the causative factors of AD is limited; however, genetic inheritance of the disease is believed to be the major associated risk factor [

Notwithstanding, AD remains a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease which includes both risk factors and genetic mutations occurring due to abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins. While the presence of phosphorylated tau has been identified in the brain during early stages, the later stages are characterized by the presence of insoluble Aβ protein deposits. Studies indicate that the amount of insoluble Aβ protein deposits is directly proportional to the extent of dementia in those suffering with AD [

The Aβ hypothesis postulates that Aβ protein accumulation is the primary cause or effect of the pathogenesis of AD and the disease further progresses due to the imbalance caused by the Aβ production and clearance. Several primary strategies have been deployed against AD using this hypothesis [
