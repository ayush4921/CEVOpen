<p>AD and dementia have gained major public health concern owing to their lack of treatment. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that progresses day by day. The therapeutic agents used to treat AD must either completely cure the disease or slow down the progression.

Researchers worldwide are focusing on modifying the disease to prevent or to stop further brain damage occurring in the patients. Treatment of patients with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can provide comfort by increasing the time of independence.
