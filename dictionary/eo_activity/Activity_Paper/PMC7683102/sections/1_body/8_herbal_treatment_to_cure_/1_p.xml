<p>The process of AD drug discovery is critical, riskier, and not cost-effective [

Medicinal plants and herbs constitute a complex mixture of phytocompounds of diverse pharmaco-biological significance, which is why herbal therapeutics are recommended to treat several diseases. In fact, plants have remained a major source of drugs across different medicinal practices. Few plants are used in the anti-aging therapies to help maintain homeostasis [

Those medicinal plants/phytochemicals with the potential to restore memory, stimulate, and strengthen neuronal activity are termed ‘Nervines’. Phytochemical components such as tannins, sterols, flavonoids, alkaloids, lignins, triterpenes, and polyphenols are responsible for the plant’s pharmacological activities such as antioxidants, anti-cholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic effects [
