<p>AD was first described more than 100 years ago [

 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It mostly affects the people over 65 years of age, resulting in the death of 1.9 million affected patients. This form of dementia or AD is expected to double every two decades meaning that the number of AD cases would be around 42 million in the ongoing year of 2020 and reach nearly 81 million by 2040 [

While 70% risk of AD may be inherited from the person’s familial history. Hypertension, head injuries, and depression are a few other risk factors leading to the cause of AD. The patients usually rely on others for their assistance by being a burden to them. Survival and incidence are the other factors on which the prevalence of AD depends. In the year 2000, AD prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in the age group 65–74, as compared to 19% in the age group 75–84. However, there is a low prevalence rate in the less developed regions. In 2005, 0.379% of global population suffered from dementia, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating an increase in the prevalence rate from 0.441% in the 2015 to 0.556% in 2030. If this trend continued, the rate of prevalence would triple in the upcoming years [
