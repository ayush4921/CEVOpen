<p>AÎ²PP is a single membrane protein with a large amino-terminal domain in the extracellular region and a small cytoplasmic domain in the intracellular region. Numerous sub-domains of the protein have been recognized in the extracellular region, and the cysteine-rich sub-domains are present in the amino terminus, following which is an acidic sub-domain and other two subdomains that are found to be neuroprotective. Several other subdomains associated with putative functions have been recognized in the extracellular region [
