<p>Excessive deposition of collagen is pathologically considered to be the main cause of fibrosis, and proline residues are the major constituents of collagen. Therefore, an eProRS inhibitor would downregulate collagen synthesis and would be a potential therapeutic agent against fibrosis. Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. developed DWN12088 (
 <bold>91</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f021">Figure 21</xref>), one of the class A compounds (eProRS IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 78 nM) covered in the aforementioned patent (WO 2018147626 A1), for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In IPF patient-derived primary lung fibroblasts, treatment with 
 <bold>91</bold> reduced the synthesis of collagen and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) under transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induction. In the mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, oral administration of 
 <bold>91</bold> for 2 weeks significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.4 mg/kg, in vitro) and the collagen amount in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [

 <bold>91</bold> provided considerable repair of lung function in this mouse model, as measured by whole-body plethysmograph. GLP (good laboratory practice) toxicity studies of 
 <bold>91</bold> with a 4-week repeated dose in rats and monkeys were conducted to examine a wide safety margin. Furthermore, 
 <bold>91</bold> was designated an orphan drug for IPF by the FDA in August 2019 [
 <xref rid="B62-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and a phase I clinical trial (a randomized, parallel-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled; ACTRN12619001239156) began in Australia in September 2019. The goal of the study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of single- and multiple-ascending doses of 
 <bold>91</bold> compared with placebo following oral administration in healthy volunteers (expected 
 <italic>n</italic> = 80) [
 <xref rid="B63-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The study was conducted in two parts: part A (single-ascending dose, six cohorts, eight subjects/cohort) and part B (multiple-ascending dose, four cohorts, eight subjects/cohort). In part A, two subjects in each cohort received placebo, and six subjects received a single dose (100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, or 800 mg) of 
 <bold>91</bold>. In part B, two subjects in each cohort were given placebo, and six subjects received multiple doses (25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) every 12 h for 14 days. The safety and tolerability of 
 <bold>91</bold> patients were evaluated in each cohort prior to dose escalation. Blood samples for PK and PD (pharmacodynamics) analysis were collected at certain time points from the pre-dose of 
 <bold>91</bold> through 72 h post-dose. The preliminary results showed that human ProRS was significantly overexpressed compared with normal lung tissue from IPF patients [
