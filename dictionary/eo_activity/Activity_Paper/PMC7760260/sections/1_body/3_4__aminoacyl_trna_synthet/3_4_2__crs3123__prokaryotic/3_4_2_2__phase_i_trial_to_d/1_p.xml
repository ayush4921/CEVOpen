<p>An additional single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple-ascending dose phase I study (NCT02106338) was pursued to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of 
 <bold>92</bold> by oral administration to healthy adults [
 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In this study, thirty healthy subjects aged 18–45 years were randomized into three cohorts, receiving either oral doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg 
 <bold>92</bold> (eight subjects per cohort) or placebo (two subjects per cohort) every 12 h for 10 days. The safety and tolerability and the plasma, urine, and fecal concentrations and systemic exposure of 
 <bold>92</bold> were determined after multiple oral doses for 10 days. The total duration of this study was 46 weeks. Recently, Crestone Inc. reported the results of this clinical study, showing that 
 <bold>92</bold> was generally safe and well-tolerated without serious adverse events (SAEs), severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and any clinically significant cardiac symptoms [
 <xref rid="B68-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Pharmacokinetically, 
 <bold>92</bold> was absorbed rapidly (T
 <sub>max</sub> = 1–2 h), and the half-life in plasma was approximately 5–6 h without accumulation after multiple dosing. The increase in plasma concentrations was less than proportional to the increase in dose. Importantly, the high oral dose of 
 <bold>92</bold> was not fully absorbed, and fecal concentrations of all dosages were considerably above the target MIC
 <sub>90</sub> value of 1 mg/L for pharmacodynamic success. Moreover, 
 <bold>92</bold> was inactive against important commensal anaerobes, such as 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic>bifidobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>clostridia</italic>, showing favorable microbiome data over other current medications for CDI. The results of the two phase I clinical studies described above assured further clinical evaluation of 
 <bold>92</bold> patients with CDI. According to the Cortellis report (Clarivate Analytics, 2020), a phase II clinical study to evaluate 
 <bold>92</bold> in CDI is being planned, and preclinical evaluation for gastric 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection (HPI) with or without a proton pump inhibitor is underway [
