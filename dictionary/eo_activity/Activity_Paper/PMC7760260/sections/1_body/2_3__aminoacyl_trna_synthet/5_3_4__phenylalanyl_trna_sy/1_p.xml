<p>The Kahne group at Harvard University developed tRNA synthetase inhibitors of secondary amines for killing Gram-negative bacteria and treating tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although the target enzyme is not specifically mentioned in their patent, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS; FARS, formerly FRS) might have been explored due to the specific note about FRS in the table of antimicrobial activity. They synthesized 458 secondary amines, one tertiary cyclic amine, 15 tertiary cyclic amides, and one tertiary cyclic carbamate compound. The antimicrobial activities of each compound were measured via the Gram-negative (
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>bau</italic>)) MIC protocol and tuberculosis luminescence assay. Among these compounds, the methyl substitution of R
 <sub>6</sub> and ortho substitution of R
 <sub>5</sub> on the secondary benzylic amine significantly increased the antimicrobial activities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f018">Figure 18</xref>). In particular, the para- or meta-methyl substitution of R
 <sub>8</sub> provided the most potent antimicrobial compounds, 
 <bold>66</bold> and 
 <bold>67,</bold> with MIC values of 33 μM (
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> WT), less than 1 μM (
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic> Δ-TolC), and 33 μM (
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>bau</italic>) against Gram-negative bacteria as well as 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) activity of 10 μM against H37Rv WT. Furthermore, they showed that combination treatment of compound 
 <bold>62</bold> (R
 <sub>1</sub>-
 <sub>6</sub> = -H, R
 <sub>7</sub> = -1-cyclohexene, HCl salt) and AN3365 (an LeuRS inhibitor) dramatically decreased the viability of bacterial cells, suggesting that the combination therapy could attenuate antibiotic resistance, thus expanding the lifespan of antibiotics.
