<p>Additionally, the internal C-C bond of piperidine was removed to yield 37 4-amino-2-piperidones, including 
 <bold>50</bold>–
 <bold>61,</bold> which were screened for 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> growth inhibition at a single dose (1 μM or 10 μM). Eleven compounds (
 <bold>50</bold>–
 <bold>60</bold>) showed decreased activity in the 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> growth inhibition assay by showing more than 80% inhibition at 10 μM; 
 <bold>61</bold> with a methoxy on the C-5 of the indole ring showed better activity with ~60% inhibition at 1 μM (
