<p>Benzoxaboroles are a class of boron-containing compounds with a broad range of biological activities. A subset of benzoxaboroles have antimicrobial activity primarily due to their ability to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) via the oxaborole tRNA-trapping (OBORT) mechanism, which involves the formation of a stable tRNA
 <sup>Leu</sup>−benzoxaborole adduct in which the boron atom interacts with the 2′- and 3′-oxygen atoms of the terminal 3′ tRNA adenosi006Ee [
