<p>However, a significant amount of research targeting mammalian ARSs for the treatment of human diseases have recently emerged. For example, febrifugine derivatives, including halofuginone which targets prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS), are under investigation for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis, and inflammatory diseases [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) was identified as a target protein of antiangiogenic borrelidin [

 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] separately provided thorough reviews on the physiology, pathology, and structural aspects of ARSs, as well as the development of ARS inhibitors for human diseases, including infectious diseases, cancer, inflammatory diseases, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this review, we focus on the recent development of ARS inhibitors ranging from discovery to clinical trials from medicinal chemistry perspectives and provide a related patent analysis.
