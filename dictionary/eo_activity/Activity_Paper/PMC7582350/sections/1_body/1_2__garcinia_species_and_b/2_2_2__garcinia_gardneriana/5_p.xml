<p>Phytochemical analyses of 
 <italic>G. gardneriana</italic> detected several classes of compounds, such as steroids, triterpenes, biflavonoids, and xanthones [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Several biflavonoids found and identified as volkensiflavone (

 <bold>24</bold>), fukugetin (or morelloflavone; 
 <bold>9</bold>), and fukugesid (
 <bold>18</bold>) have demonstrated analgesic effects [

 <italic>G. gardneriana</italic> leaves, named GB2a-OMe (
 <bold>25</bold>), also presented a significant analgesic effect in the formalin test in mice in the neurogenic and inflammatory phases [
