Indeed, the daily consumption of a mangosteen drink for 30 days in healthy adults resulted in reduction of the inflammatory markers and increased the antioxidant capacity of human blood, due to reduction of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, reducing the risk of inflammation and chronic diseases related to immunity [

Thus, it has been proven that the mangosteen is a plant which can provide benefits in the development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases, mainly as it is a rich source of xanthones and other bioactive substances [
