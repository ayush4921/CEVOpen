At the dose of 400 mg/kg, the lipidic peroxidation was reverted significantly, and in several parameters of inflammation generated in the colon showed improvement (i.e., the punctuation of macroscopic damage, lipidic peroxidation, and histopathological exam of the colon tissue), demonstrating its therapeutical potential for the treatment of colitis [
