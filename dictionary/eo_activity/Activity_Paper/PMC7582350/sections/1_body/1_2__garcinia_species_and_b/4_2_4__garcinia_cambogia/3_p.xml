<p>The hypolipidemic effect of the

The generated anti-inflammatory effects resulted in the improvement of some parameters analyzed in experimental colitis, where 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol caused lesions characterized by severe necrosis of the mucosa, hyperemia, and focal adhesion to adjacent organs. Administration of the extract by oral gavage at a dose of 1.0 g/kg reduced the length of the lesions observed macroscopically; thus, it may provide a source to search for new anti-inflammatory compounds useful in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory diseases [
