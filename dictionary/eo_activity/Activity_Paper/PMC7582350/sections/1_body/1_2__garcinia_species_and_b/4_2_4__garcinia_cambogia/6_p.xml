<p>The HCA (

 <italic>G. cambogia</italic> is a potent and competent inhibitor of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides [

 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. HCA (
 <bold>30</bold>) presents a chemical structure similar to citric acid and, therefore, inhibits the action of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase in the citric acid cycle. This action inhibits the conversion of citric acidinacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and suppresses the synthesis of fatty acids. The increased quantity of citric acid that is not converted into acetyl-CoA leads to acceleration of the production of glycogen from glucose. Thus, the ingestion of HCA (
 <bold>30</bold>) stabilizes glucose levels in the blood, resulting in the suppression of feelings of hunger. Therefore, it is also expected to show a preventive effect against hyperphagia [
