<p>Although 
 <xref rid="nutrients-12-00609-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> includes the compounds that were detected in 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> using different extraction methods, the anti-cancer activities were not assessed. Various phytochemicals have been shown to have specific anti-cancer properties, but it is generally accepted that these compounds probably act synergistically to achieve an anti-cancer effect [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Wang et al. identified ergosterol in a chloroform extract from 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> and observed anti-cancer properties such as a pro-apoptotic and inhibition of migration effects [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further, in a study published by Yoshikawa et al., fomitopinic acids and fomitosides inhibited cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 activity [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although many of the compounds detected in 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> have not been assessed in isolation, some of the compounds have been isolated from other species and found to have anti-cancer properties e.g., gallic acid [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on the available evidence, it is not possible to determine exactly which compounds exert the strongest anti-cancer properties, and further research is required.
