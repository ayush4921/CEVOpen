<p>A small number of in vivo studies have been performed wherein the anti-cancer properties of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> were investigated. These studies are listed in

 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> ethanol extract showed no activity against the prostate cancer xenograft. The discrepancy in the results is thought to be due to the lack of bioavailability of the ethanol powder extract, as well as treatment at a later stage of disease [
