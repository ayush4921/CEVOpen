<p>Fungi are poorly, and sometimes incorrectly, described [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More recently, sequence-based classification and identification (SBCI) has been used to detect and classify environmental fungi and also to confirm or dispute identification or classification of named specimens. The ITS of rRNA genes can be PCR-amplified and sequenced, and this method is commonly used for SBCI [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Further, 16S rRNA sequences may also be used for this purpose, but it is regarded as less accurate than ITS sequencing, as the latter is less highly conserved and is therefore more likely to vary from one species to another [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To help avoid misidentifications, Edgar recommends the sequencing of two rather than one variable region, which could include V3, V4, V5 and ITS, or full-length 16s rRNA or large subunit rRNA genes [

 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With the integration and standardisation of stand-alone databases, and the incorporation of phylogenetic trees into pipelines used to identify or name specimens, data will be easier to incorporate into databases and therefore more likely to be deposited, and easier to access, thus strengthening the accuracy of fungal identification [
