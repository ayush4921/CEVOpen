<p>A recent study by Taghzouti et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00759" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] for Fès-Meknès region reported for the ethyl acetate extract a TPC value of 50.99 μg GAE/mg of extract, which is close to the one determined in the present study. However, the flavonoid content (8.96 μg QE/mg of extract) was lower, and this finding might be due to many factors, such as environmental conditions, extraction method and portion of the plant used.
