<p>Compounds were identified by using the “FFNSC 4.0” (Shimadzu Europa GmbH, Duisburg, Germany), and “W11N17” (Wiley11-Nist17, Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA; Mass Finder 3). Each compound was identified applying a MS similarity match and an LRI filter. Linear retention indices (LRI) were calculated by using a C7-C40 saturated alkanes reference mixture (49452-U, MerckKGaA). Data files were collected and processed by using “GCMS Solution” software, ver. 4.50 (Shimadzu).</p>
