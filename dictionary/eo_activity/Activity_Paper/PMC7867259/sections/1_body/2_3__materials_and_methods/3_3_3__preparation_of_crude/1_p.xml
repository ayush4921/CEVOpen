<p>The extraction of samples was conducted by Soxhlet apparatus with chloroform, and ethyl acetate, in order to get two extracts with different polarities. 50 g of dried leaves of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> were rigorously extracted with 250 mL of each solvent, then the obtained extracts were concentrated and free of solvent under reduce pressure, using rotary evaporator. At the end of the extraction operation two crude extracts were obtained and were subsequently weighed to calculate the yield of the extraction for each solvent and stored in a refrigerator (4 Â°C) in airtight bottles until used for further analysis.
