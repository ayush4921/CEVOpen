<p>As LSD1 belongs to the monoamine oxidase (MAO) family, the inhibitory effects of compounds 
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold> and 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> to its homologies MAO-A and MAO-B were also examined using commercially available kits

 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all synthesised compounds 
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold> and 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> had no significant effects on MAO-A and MAO-B. These findings indicated the high selectivity of chalcone-dithiocarbamate inhibitors 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> on LSD1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, we found that the substitution on the phenyl ring was important for the activity showing an over 6-fold activity loss, when the fluorine atom was replaced with the hydrogen atom (compounds 
 <bold>D3</bold> vs. 
 <bold>D5</bold>). Replacement of the ethyl group of compound 
 <bold>D5</bold> with a methyl group (
 <bold>D4</bold>) led to a loss of the activity. However, changing the benzyl group (compound 
 <bold>D7</bold>) to a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (compound 
 <bold>D6</bold>) led to a significant improvement of the activity against LSD1. All these results indicated that the substituent group at piperazine ring may play an important role for their inhibitory activity. The detailed illustration for preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR) of target derivatives was showed in
