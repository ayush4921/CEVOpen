<p>Based on the antiproliferative results, concentrations of 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, and 4 μM were chosen to investigate the proliferation effects of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> on the cell viability of leukaemia cells (HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15, MOLT-4 and LC4-1). We added the 5-Fluorouracil as a positive control to do the cytotoxicity assays in these leukaemia cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5-Fluorouracil against HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15, MOLT-4 and LC4-1 cells were 5.10 μM, 4.02 μM, 4.17 μM, 2.10 μM, 2.89 μM and 10.2 μM, respectively. From the results of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited cell proliferation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.10 μM, 3.64 μM, 3.85 μM, 1.87 μM, 0.87 μM and 2.73 μM against HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15, MOLT-4 and LC4-1 leukaemia cells. These findings supported that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> potently inhibited cell proliferation against leukaemia cells in a concentration dependent manner.
