<p>A series of chalcone derivatives were designed, synthesised and evaluated for LSD1 inhibitory activity. All chalcone-dithiocarbamate hybrids 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> exhibited potentially inhibitory activity against LSD1. Especially, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> showed the best LSD1 inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 μM. In addition, 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited cell proliferation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.10 μM, 3.64 μM, 3.85 μM, 1.87 μM, 0.87 μM and 2.73 μM against HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15, MOLT-4 and LC4-1 leukaemia cells. Further investigations demonstrated that compound 
 <bold>D6</bold> selectively inhibited LSD1 in a time dependent and reversible manner. It also up-regulated the expression levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 against MOLT-4 cells. Importantly, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour growth in a xenograft model without apparent toxicity. Taken together, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> could be a lead candidate for its further development in the treatment of leukaemia.
