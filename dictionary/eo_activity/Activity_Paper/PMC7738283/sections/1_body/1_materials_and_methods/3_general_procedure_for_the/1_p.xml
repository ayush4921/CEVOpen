<p>To a solution of analogues 
 <bold>C1∼C4</bold> (2 mmol) in acetone (20 ml) was added carbon disulphide (3 mmol), sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (1.5 mmol) and piperazine derivatives (2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h. After the end of the reaction was established by TLC, the solvent was removed under vacuum, and excess saturated Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added. The resulted mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The product was purified by a silica gel column using ethyl acetate and petroleum ether as eluent to afford compounds 
 <bold>D1∼D7</bold>. All the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra of compounds 
 <bold>D1∼D7</bold> were listed in
