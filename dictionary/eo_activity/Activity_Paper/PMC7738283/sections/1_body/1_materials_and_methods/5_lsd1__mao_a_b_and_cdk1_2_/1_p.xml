<p>The inhibition of LSD1 activity was evaluated according to reported references [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. pET-28b-LSD1 (full length) was transfected into BL21 (DE). Then, the protein was induced with 0.25 mmol/L IPTG following sonication and purified with Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Tubingen, Germany), Resource Q (GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and Sephacryl S-200 HR (GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The fluorescence intensity was read using EnVision Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to calculate the inhibition rate. The MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Active Motif (Cat#31502, Cat#31503, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Biochemical Kits were purchased from Promega (MAO-Glo Assay, Madison, WI, USA). The inhibitory activities of MAO-A and MAO-B were obtained according to the reported reference [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The inhibitory activities of CDK1 and CDK2 were obtained according to the reported reference [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
