 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the correlation matrix chart of phytochemical content and pharmacological activities from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> studied genotypes. Extraction yield showed a significantly positive correlation with TPC, TFC, SC, DPPH, and FRAP. TPC recorded considerably correlated with TFC, SC, DPPH, and FRAP. TFC significantly correlated with SC, DPPH, and FRAP. SC associated considerably with antioxidant activity (DPPH assay). Furthermore, two tests of antioxidant activities were used in this study, DPPH, and FRAP, which showed a strong correlation. Significant associations were also found between RAC &amp; FRAP and RAC &amp; HeLa. MCF-7 and GIA showed the lowest correlation with other parameter studied of phytochemical components, extraction yield, and biological activities.
