<p id="Par27">The principal component analysis was performed for phytochemical contents and pharmacological activities to evaluate any promising group within the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes. Result PCA analysis in the first five principal components presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The first five principal components resulted in 93.31% of the cumulative percent of the variance. PC1 and PC2 explained 46.34% and 19.67% of variance with eigenvalue 4.63 and 1.97, respectively. PC3 to PC5 having smaller eigenvalue, thus these not significantly explained the variance in datasets (27.31%). Thus, PC1 and PC2 selected for explaining the variance. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the loading plot of phytochemical content and pharmacological parameters. EY, TPC, TFC, SC, DPPH, and FRAP parameters had the significant effects on the PC1. Meanwhile, RAC and HeLa parameters had strong influences on the PC2. Biplot analysis of phytochemicals and biological properties created from the comparison of component one-two PCs revealed three distinct clusters of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Four groups resulted, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Cluster I comprised of six genotypes viz. A1, A3, A4, A5, A7, and A8 with characterized by high rosmarinic acid and cytotoxic (HeLa &amp; MCF-7) activity, intermediary for other phytochemical and antioxidant activity, and lowly GIA. Cluster II has composed seven genotypes: A2, A6, A9, A10, A12, A13, and A14. These genotypes characterized by low phytochemical content and biological activities, except high for GIA. Cluster III composed two genotypes (A11 and A15) and characterized by high total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, sinensetin content, extraction yield, and antioxidant activity.
