 </sup> with modification. Standard solutions of rosmarinic acid and sinensetin, obtained from ChromaDex, were prepared separately in methanol at a range concentration of 1–100 μg/ml and 0.3–24 μg/ml, respectively. The Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to perform the analysis which was equipped with degassing unit (DGU-20A5R), pump (LC-20AB), autosampler (SIL-20A HT), column oven, (CTO-20AC), and UV–Vis detector (SPD-20A). The column used Shim-Pack VP ODS C18 Shimadzu (75 × 4.6 mm i.d., 3 μm pore size). The 0.1% formic acid in aqueous (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) were used as a mobile phase of elution. The gradient elution system used as follow: 0–7 min for 2–20% B, 7–10 min for 20–30% B, 10–18 min for 30–50% B, 18–20.5 min for 50–98% B, 20.5–23 min for 98% B, 23–26 min for 98–2% B, and the system was then balanced until 35 min before the next injection. Each genotype sample, the volume of injection was 10 µl, was analysed at 1 ml/min for the mobile phase flow rate and 320 nm for detector wavelength at 30 °C for 35 min. Results of rosmarinic acid and sinensetin content expressed as mg/g DW based on the calibration curve of rosmarinic acid and sinensetin standard, respectively.
