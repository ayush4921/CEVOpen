 </sup>. Total phenolic content in each extract was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and gallic acid was used as an external standard. About 10 μl extract sample was mixed with distilled water (160 μl), 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (10 μl), and 10% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (20 μl). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance was measured using the microplate reader (Epoch BioTek, USA) at 750 nm. The total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/ g DW). Total flavonoid content was measured using aluminium chloride reagent and quercetin was used as an external standard. In a 96-well microplate, a 10 μl extract sample was mixed with methanol (60 μl), 10 μl of 10% aluminium chloride, 10 μl of 1 M potassium acetate, and 120 μl of distilled water. Finally, after incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance was measured using the microplate reader (Epoch BioTek, USA) at 415 nm. Results expressed as quercetin equivalent (mg QE/ g DW).
