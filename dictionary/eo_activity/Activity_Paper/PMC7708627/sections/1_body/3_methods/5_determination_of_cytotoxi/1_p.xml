 </sup>. MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cell lines, obtained from Veterinary Medicine Faculty, IPB University, were used cytotoxic evaluation. Cell lines were grown in medium which consist of 850 μl Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA), 30 μl fetal bovine serum (10%; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 10 μl fungizone (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA). In brief, 50 μl cell line were exposed to a sample of 100 μg/ml. Also included, the control group was an untreated cell line. The cell incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 days. After incubation, 100 μl cells were added to 5 μl trypan blue. After homogenized, 10 μl cells were placed in a hemocytometer for calculation number of cells. The cytotoxic activity was determined based on the treated cell and untreated cells in percentage inhibition.
