<p id="Par30">The 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves have a lot of types of flavonoids but the concentration is low. Methoxy flavonoid is the known type of flavonoids in this leaves. Sinensetin, salvigenin and eupatorine are methoxy-flavonoid groups in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>. The total flavonoid and sinensetin contents of all extracts are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The report of Abdelwahab et al.

 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves had 17.46 mg RE/g extract. This report is equal to 8.69 mg QE/g extract. Different from the report of Chew et al.

 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> is about 1611.9 mg CE/100 g DW which equal to 16.78 mg QE/g DW. Our best TFC content found in A15 is only about 3.07 mg QE/g DW. The sinensetin content in the dried materials of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves, the highest was found on A11, while the lowest on A8. There is correlation between SC and TFC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It means that the sinensetin is major flavonoid in studied extract genotypes. On the other hand, it was reported that sinensetin content will decrease when extraction was performed using polar solvent such as ethanol 70%
