 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> collected from Indonesia was investigated for the characterization of phytochemicals contents and pharmacological activities and obtained promising elite genotypes without environmental impacts. The phytochemical and pharmacological distinction of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> has economic significance as well as being accommodating in the development of pharmaceutical industries and plant breeding programs for new varieties. Fifteen genotypes of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> were assessed for the quality of phytochemicals and pharmacological activities in all records of this discussion.
