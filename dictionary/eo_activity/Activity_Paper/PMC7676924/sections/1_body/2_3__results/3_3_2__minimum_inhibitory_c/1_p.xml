<p>The evaluation of the MIC of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> essential oil showed notable activity against all fungal strains tested except for 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> (ATCC 22019) and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> (ATCC 6258) which were used as quality controls had MICs in the recommended ranges. The MIC ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> were highly sensitive, showing comparable activity to C. 
 <italic>parapsilosis</italic>. 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of the essential oil. There were no significant differences in MIC of essential oil and fluconazole against yeast (
 <italic>p</italic> value &gt;0.05). The essential oil showed activity comparable to that of the standard drug (fluconazole) against 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> (
