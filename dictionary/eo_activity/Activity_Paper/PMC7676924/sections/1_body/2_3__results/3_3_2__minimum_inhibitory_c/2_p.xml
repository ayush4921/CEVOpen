<p>All the strains tested were susceptible to the standard drug (fluconazole for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>; amphotericin B for 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>). Linear regression showed that there was a positive relationship between concentration and zone of inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The slopes for all, except 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, were positive. The essential oil did not show a zone of inhibition against the isolate of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. The negative control (DMSO) did not show a zone of inhibition.
