<p>Essential oils are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They are widely used in traditional medicine and the food industry. The main constituents of essential oils are terpenes, terpenoids, aromatic and aliphatic constituents, and some hydrocarbons, which also exhibit antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have shown that essential oils target the cell wall membrane, thereby disturbing ATP production and pH homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A study conducted by Ameya et al. on the crude methanol and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Though the research was done on the crude extract against the two strains, the effect on the other fungal strains is unknown, and there has been no study on the essential oil of E. 
 <italic>kebericho</italic>. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the antifungal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. against 
 <italic>Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans,</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>.
