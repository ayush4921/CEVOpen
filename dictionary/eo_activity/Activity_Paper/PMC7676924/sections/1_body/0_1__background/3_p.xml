<p>Antifungal treatment options are highly limited, as there are few chemical classes represented by existing antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, there are three different classes of antifungal agents, polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Drug toxicity is the major limitation of polyenes and the older generation of azole antifungal agents. New antifungal agents (e.g., echinocandins and second-generation triazoles) in the past decade have transformed the management of invasive mycoses. These newer antifungal agents have also important limitations such as in pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, and unusual toxicities associated with long-term use [
