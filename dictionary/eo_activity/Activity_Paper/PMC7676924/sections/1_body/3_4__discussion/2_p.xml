<p>Screening of medicinal plants for antifungal activity is important for novel drug discovery [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In many countries, fungal diseases have been treated using herbal remedies as many pathogenic fungi are becoming commonly resistant to numerous conventional antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study is the first of its kind to investigate the antifungal activity of essential oil from 
 <italic>E. kebericho,</italic> although a previous study showed noteworthy antifungal activity using methanolic and ethanolic crude extracts of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
