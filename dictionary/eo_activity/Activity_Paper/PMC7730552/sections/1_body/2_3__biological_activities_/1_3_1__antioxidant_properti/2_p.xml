<p>These results demonstrate that the phenolics and flavonoids present in the fruit and resins are responsible for the antioxidant properties, along with other bioactive compounds. Indian gamboge is also rich in biflavonoids, xanthones, and benzophenones (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05690-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that act as antioxidants. Mangostins (α-, β-, and γ-mangostins) are xanthones reported in mangosteen (
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic>), and numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that mangostins exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant properties [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported that α-mangostin acts as a free radical scavenger, reducing the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induced by copper or peroxyl radicals and decreasing the consumption of α-tocopherol induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). α-Mangostin was isolated from the leaves of Indian gamboge [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Garcinol was reported to be the principal compound, which is a tri-isoprenylatedchalcone, and exhibited efficient scavenging activity of DPPH, hydroxyl, methyl radicals, and superoxide anions [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Garcinol was also detected from 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> by the authors of [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who reported that the antioxidant activity exhibited by 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> fruits and leaves is also due to garcinol.
