<p id="Par52">In ethnobiological research, age is identified as a factor that influences traditional botanical knowledge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. When comparing the data obtained for this research with that of the literature, there is a disparity of results in relation to studies that report on the influence of age on knowledge about medicinal plants. Studies point out that it would be best to collect data from older people, as they generally have greater knowledge about natural resources. Thus, they are considered to have knowledge about medicinal plants, both for their ability to retain it throughout life, derived from lived experience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and due to the frequent use they make of them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which is related to the number of plants that are cited in a free list, for example. These works end up restricting comparisons between individuals of different generations [
