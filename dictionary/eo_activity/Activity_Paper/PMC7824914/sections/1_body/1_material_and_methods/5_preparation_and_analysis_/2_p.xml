<p id="Par41">The two free lists were compared for each participant. We indentified (a) the plants that were cited in both free lists, and (b) the plants that were cited in only one of the free lists. From these data, the similarity of the plants cited was calculated using the Jaccard Similarity Index (JI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] for each participant, through the following formula: JI = a/a + b. From the data similarity results obtained from each participant, the mean and standard deviation were calculated. When compared, the free lists showed low similarity with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.16.
