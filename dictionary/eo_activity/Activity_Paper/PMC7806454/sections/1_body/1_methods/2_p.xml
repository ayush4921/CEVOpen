<p id="p0025">A website-based searching strategy, particularly Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Science Direct were used to access and collect articles published in different scientific journals. Several keywords were considered for the data search, including ethnomedicinal usage of traditional foods, antiviral foods, immune-modulatory action of foods, coronavirus, SARS, MERS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and so on. Moreover, the information on conventional foods such as spices, fruits, vegetables, and fermented foods that are effective against respiratory problems and possess immune modulating properties were also incorporated. The resource materials were collected from March, 2020 to May, 2020. Our exclusion criteria were to omit those resources, which had a very lower confidence level compared to literature on the same topic. In addition, we reviewed the guidelines related to COVID-19 published on the WHO database. Notably, at the present time literature relating to this continuous issue is growing rapidly therefore previously searched results may differ quickly.</p>
