<p id="p0075">Spirulina, a dried biomass of cyanobacterial blue-green algae, is being used as a common ‘nutritionally packed' dietary supplement available in different parts of the world. It has a long history to be used as a food source because of its diverse biological activities and nutritional significance. Spirulina possesses natural nutrients having bio-modulatory and immune-modulatory functions. 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. maxima</italic> are two species of spirulina for nutritional supplements, which can grow in fresh and marine waters throughout the world (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). Spirulina is mostly composed of protein. Besides, it contains vitamins (B
 <sub>12</sub> and provitaminA (
 <italic>β</italic>-carotenes) and minerals such as iron, phenolic acids, tocopherols and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-linolenic acid, polysaccharides, glycolipids, and sulpholipids etc (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Dillon et al., 1995</xref>). Many researchers reported that spirulina possessed promising biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritis, anti-diabetics, cardio-active, reproductive performance enhancer, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, hypocholesterolemic, radio protective, and metallic protective effects and obviously most prominent immune modulating properties (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). Spirulina displays promising antiviral efficacy via the production of phycocyanobilin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin and other significant compounds (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Dillon et al., 1995</xref>). Previous reports showed that calcium spirulan (Ca-SP) isolated from 
 <italic>S. platensis</italic> has shown antiviral effect against different enveloped viruses such as HIV–I, mumps virus, measles virus, 
 <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type-I, human cytomegalovirus, and influenza virus (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Rechter et al., 2006</xref>). Allophycocyanin is an another compound of spirulina neutralizes cytoplasmic effects induced by the enterovirus 71 in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells by delaying RNA synthesis and increasing the apoptotic process in the infected cells (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2003</xref>). Some studies noted that Cyanovirin-N (CV–N), sulpholipid and Ca-Sp compounds derived from spirulina exhibited potent antiviral activity against HIV–I and other enveloped viral particles, whereas, Cynovirin-N and Ca-Sp selectively inhibited the initial stage of viral life cycle in the host cells and sulpholipid interfered reverse transcription of HIV-RNA (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Luescher-Mattli, 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is expected that spirulina might be a useful therapeutics for AIDS, and may lead to a longer normal life as well as to reduce prevalence of HIV/AIDS (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Luescher-Mattli, 2003</xref>). Besides a long range of biological properties, some species of spirulina exhibited very strong immune-modulating and bio-modulating properties. Spirulina has direct effect on both innate and specific immunity that has been elicited through increased mobilization of macrophages, accumulation of NK cells, antibodies production, cytokine secretion, and mobilization of B and T cells to the site of infection (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). Experimental evidence showed that dietary intake of spirulina enhanced primary immune response by increasing the number of splenic antibody-producing cells against Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC), macrophages and interlukin-1 (IL-1) in mice (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1994</xref>). It was documented that spirulina up-regulated key cells and organs of the immune system in spite of the presence of toxins and infectious agents. Phycocyanin and polysaccharides of spirulina stimulate hematopoiesis, especially erythropoiesis, and white blood cells production and also enhance intestinal immune system (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ishii et al. (1999)</xref> reported that spirulina had a key role in mucosal immunity where it increased the IgA production in human saliva. A Japanese team concluded that spirulina increased the production of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> and NK cell damage after taking this microalga extract (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hirahashi et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study has revealed that spirulina exhibited remarkable immune-modulatory effect by decreasing the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 and increasing the level of IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ in 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infected tumor bearing mice (
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Shokri et al., 2014</xref>). Based on available previous data, it was noted that spirulina supplementation can improve the anemia and immune function of senior citizens by increasing complete blood count (CBC) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme activity as a sign of immune function (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Pertovaara et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, antiviral and immune boosting evidence of spirulina might be an effective supplement to build strong shield against COVID-19 as like asother preventive options, where prevention is still the best strategy to fight against COVID-19.
