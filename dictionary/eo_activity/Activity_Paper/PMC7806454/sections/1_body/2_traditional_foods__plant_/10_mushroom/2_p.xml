<p id="p0070">Mushroom, the general term of higher basidiomycetes, is being used as traditional medicine in different countries. To date, approximately 700 species of medicinal mushrooms with pharmacological properties have been documented. However, a very limited number of them are cultivated and used for medical purposes in different parts of the world. Various polysaccharides, lipids, steroids, organic acids, and tetracyclic triterpenes are some major components of various mushrooms (

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Takehara et al. (1979)</xref> reported that lentinan from 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic> (shiitake), agaric and polypore mushrooms effectively fought the flu-causing influenza viruses. 
 <italic>Daedaleopsis confragosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Ischnoderma bezoinum</italic> species showed potent virus neutralizing effects against influenza A virus (

Some other mushrooms like Piptoporus sp. and Ganoderma sp. showed antiviral activity against pox and HIV virus by preventing virus adsorption by cells, blocking viral enzymes for nucleic acid synthesis and increasing cellular immunity (

 <italic>Tinea versicolor</italic> were much active as antiviral agents against HIV and cytomegalovirus. Moreover, velutin from 
 <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic> caused inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as an antiviral effect (

Besides their antiviral effects, many mushrooms have immune-modulatory effects that help researchers to produce immune-modulating drugs from mushrooms. For example, Agaricus and Himematsutake mushrooms act as a source of FIo-a-β, FA-2-b-Md immune-modulator, whereas Lentinan, KS-2, LEM immune stimulator is reported from Shiitake and Golden Oak mushrooms (
