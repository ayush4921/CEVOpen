<p>We analysed in detail the changes made in the SmPCs and the overall outcome of the procedures concerning the benefit-risk balance. A change was defined as any modification made as a result of the referral procedure in the relevant sections of the SmPCs: section 4.1. therapeutic indications, section 4.2. posology (dosage) and method of administration, section 4.3. contraindications and section 4.4. special warnings and precautions for use. For section 4.1., a change was further defined as a number of indications (including prophylactic and non-prophylactic treatment) deleted or added by the European regulators or withdrawn by the marketing authorisation holder; for section 4.2., modifications in posology and method of administration were defined as a number of amendments in posology, adjustments of dosage for specific populations and amendments in the methods of administration; for section 4.3., modifications in contraindication, i.e. harmonisation or deletion, were assessed and for section 4.4., any amendments including harmonisations of warnings were registered.</p>
