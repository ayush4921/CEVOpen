<p>Our findings highlight the importance of the European regulatory actions, i.e. referral procedures over the last decade, on updating product information of key antibiotics as laid down in the SmPC and PL. The majority of the referralsâ€™ outcomes can be linked to restriction of use (i.e. the indication) and therefore can be considered as an important step against AMR. Inappropriate and unjustified use of antibiotics remains a critical determinant of AMR. Further studies on antibiotic utilisation, clinical practice changes and AMR epidemiology should provide more insight into the real public health impact, both positive and negative, of these regulatory measures. We expect more ongoing harmonisation activities from the EU regulatory network in order to restrict the use of antibiotics further. Therefore, further research is needed to understand better the relationship between the regulatory actions and antimicrobial use, which will be the focus of our future work.</p>
