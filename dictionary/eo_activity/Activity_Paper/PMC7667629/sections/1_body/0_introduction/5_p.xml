<p>The SmPC is an integral part of a marketing authorisation (license) of any medicinal product [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is a document that describes the properties of a medicine, the officially approved therapeutic indications, information on dosing, safety warnings and directions for appropriate use. It is updated throughout the life cycle of the medicinal product as new data relevant to the benefit and risk become available and/or results of studies that may potentially have an impact on the marketing authorisation. A referral procedure may result in adjustments to the SmPC. The SmPC gives essential information for healthcare professionals on how to prescribe the medicinal product safely and effectively. The package leaflets (PL) that are intended for patients are drawn up in accordance with the SmPC. Changes in the SmPC and the PL as a result of a European referral procedure need to be implemented nationally by the Members States. The aim of the current study was to evaluate such post-authorisation changes made between 2007 and 2020 in the product information of a number of key antibiotics as a result of completed EU referral procedures.
