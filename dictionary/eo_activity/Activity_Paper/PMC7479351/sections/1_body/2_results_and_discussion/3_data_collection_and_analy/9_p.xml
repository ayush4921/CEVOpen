<p id="p0105">In a similar study, the traditional use of medicinal plants for cancer treatment around Borno state in the far Eastern region of Nigeria has been reported elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Ngulde et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, a vast number of species identified in Sokoto are consistent with that of the species documented in the region of Borno state. For instance, 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sieberiana</italic>, 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic>, among others, have also been cited by the native people of Askira/Uba LGA of the Borno state. Culturally, hausa and fulani ethnic groups formed the minority in the region when compared to Sokoto state. The study reported by Ngulde and co-workers was insufficiently documented, even though both regions lie in the Sudan savanna. In the study, respondents are reported to collect herbs during the day any time between sunrise through sunset of the plant. In the present study, informants argued that leaves are actively collected from the beginning of the flowering to premature fruiting. Barks, on the other hand, are best collected during the dry season before the beginning of the rainy season. This approach, they argued, is effective in collecting medicinally active principles of the plants.
