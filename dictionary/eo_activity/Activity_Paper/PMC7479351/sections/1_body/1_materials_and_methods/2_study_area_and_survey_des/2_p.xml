 <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">NPC, 2013</xref>) comprising different ethnic groups including Hausa, Fulani, Zabarmawa, and Tuareg. Hausa is considered as the largest ethnic group dominated in the region. Agriculture is predominantly the most common practice among the population living in the region. On the other side of the region, Sokoto borders with Zamfara to the south and Kebbi State to the West. Among the twenty-three (23) Local Government Areas (LGAs) contained, Sokoto-North, Sokoto-South, Wamakko, Dange-Shuni, and Bodinga LGAs were selected for the study. The LGAs were selected due to the closeness to the central region where herbal trade and traditional medical practice is most prominent.
