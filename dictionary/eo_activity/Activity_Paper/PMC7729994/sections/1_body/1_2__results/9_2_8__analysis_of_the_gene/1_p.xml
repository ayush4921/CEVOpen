<p>Effects of vindoline and the extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> on intracellular ROS production in RIN-5F cells exposed to high concentrations of glucose are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f006">Figure 6</xref> below. The levels of ROS were measured using the cell permeable probe, CM-H2DCFDA and fluorescing cells were quantified using flow cytometry. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows a histogram of the fluorescence of untreated cells in red, which produced one major peak representing cells with low levels of ROS. This peak is labeled as ROS-. The fluorescence of cells treated with hydrogen peroxide is presented in blue and produced two peaks. One smaller peak that overlays with the peak of ROSâˆ’ cells and a second peak that represents cells with high levels of ROS and is labeled as ROS+. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f006">Figure 6</xref>b present the data from the histograms as a bar graph. Increased ROS production was observed in cells following high glucose treatment. Treating glucotoxic-induced RIN-5F cells with CR-Meth and CR-DCM extracts resulted in significantly lower ROS production (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when compared to the high glucose untreated high.
