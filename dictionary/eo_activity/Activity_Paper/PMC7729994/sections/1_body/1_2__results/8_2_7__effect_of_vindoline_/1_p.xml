<p>The effect of the pure compound vindoline (0.125 mM) and 
 <italic>C. roseusâ€™</italic> extracts on the release of insulin by beta pancreatic cells that were previously exposed to high (50 mM), low (6.25 mM) and in the absence of glucose concentrations was investigated and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f005">Figure 5</xref> below. Following stimulation with high/low glucose with/without treatments for 2 h, the amount of insulin secreted was determined. In RIN-5F cells that were previously exposed to 50 mM glucose, vindoline (0.125 mM) markedly increased the secretion of insulin (0.72 ng/mL) when compared to the cells that were treated with CR-Meth (0.0625 mg/mL) and untreated high glucose exposed cells with 0.43 and 0.3 ng/mL insulin levels respectively. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in the amounts of secreted insulin in glucose-exposed cells that were treated with vindoline, CR-Aq (0.03125 mg/mL) and CR-DCM (0.0625 mg/mL) at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. In cells previously exposed to low glucose (6.25 mM), vindoline also exhibited improved insulin secretion when compared to the cells treated with CR-Aq, CR-Meth and the untreated controls. In normoglycemic (0 mM) glucose exposed cells, the secretion of insulin following treatment caused no significant changes among the groups, implying that the treatments in normal cells did not significantly alter insulin secretion.
