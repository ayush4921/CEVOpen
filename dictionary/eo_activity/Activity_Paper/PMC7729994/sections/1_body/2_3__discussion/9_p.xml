<p>Alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase are enzymes that play fundamental roles in carbohydrate metabolism. Alpha amylase catalyzes the breakdown of polysaccharides such as starch into maltose via disruption of the alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds [

Inhibition of the activity of these enzymes is an effective therapeutic approach that has been shown to control postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. Inhibitors such as acarbose delay the cleavage of carbohydrates consequently diminishing the rate of glucose absorption thereby improving the glycemic index [
