<p>The release of an inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was evaluated in RIN-5F cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) that were exposed to high/low glucose concentration and in the absence of glucose for 24 h. The optimized concentrations of vindoline and of the extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> were added to the respective wells and were incubated for 24 h. Following the 24 h exposure to the plant treatments, the media in each well was aspirated, centrifuged and supernatants were then stored at −80 °C until the TNF-α concentration were measured by ELISA.
