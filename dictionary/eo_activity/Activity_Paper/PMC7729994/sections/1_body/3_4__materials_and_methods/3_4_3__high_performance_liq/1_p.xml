<p>Phenolic compounds present in different extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> were determined according to the method of Bramati et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] using the high performance liquid chromatography-HPLC system (Agilent Technology 1200 series, Bellefonte, Santa Clara, CA, USA). On the HPLC system, a G1315C diode array detector and a C18 column of 5μm (4.6 mm × 150 mm i.d) were used to separate the compounds. The chromatographic conditions were the following: 20 µL sample injection volume and flow rate set at 1 mL/min for 15 min. Detection was performed at wavelengths of 220, 320 and 350 nm: rutin and quercetin at 350 nm; chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and coumaric acid at 320 nm; vindoline at 220 nm. Peaks were identified based on the retention time of vindoline, flavonoid and phenolic standards. The analytical signals were monitored at 2–20 mV potential applied. To determine the concentrations of the compounds present in the extracts, the following equation was used:
