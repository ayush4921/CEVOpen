<p>The effect of vindoline (0.125 mM), CR-Meth (0.0625 mg/mL), CR-DCM (0.0625 mg/mL) and CR-Aq (0.3125 mg/mL) on the release of insulin in stressed and non-stressed cells was evaluated. The cells were seeded at a concentration of 2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates. After the 24 h incubation time, the cells were exposed to the respective treatments for 24 h. The next day, the media was removed from the wells and cells were washed with prewarmed DPBS, thereafter, cells were starved in glucose free media for 30 min. To determine the effect of plant treatments on the response of cells to glucose, RIN-5F cells were then treated with media containing a high/low concentration of glucose (50 and 6.25 mM) and in the absence of glucose. This was followed by a 2-h incubation period; the media was then aspirated, centrifuged and stored at −80 °C until the concentration of insulin was determined by ELISA.
