<p>The WST-1 is a colorimetric assay (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) performed to quantify the count of viable cells per well after exposing cells to respective treatments. In this assay, the tetrazolium salt (which is red in color) in WST-1 reagent is broken down to form a yellow colored formazan product catalyzed by succinate-tetrazolium reductase enzyme found in metabolically active cells [

The intensity of the yellow formazan product is measured using a plate reader at 620 nm is therefore directly proportional to the number of metabolically active cells in the culture. The absorbance values of the formazan product were measured at a wavelength of 420 nm and reference wavelength of 620 nm.
