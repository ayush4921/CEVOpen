<p>The ferric reducing antioxidant power of samples was measured using the method that was developed by Benzi and Strain in 1996. FRAP is a concentration independent colorimetric assay that assesses the strength of samples to reduce the ferric ion (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to ferrous ion (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>). Reduction of the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ion present in the (TPTZ) complex to a ferrous form (tripyridyltriazine complex) results in the blue colored product. Absorbances are determined using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 593 nm. The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 30 mL of (300 Mm) acetate buffer at a pH of 3.6, 3 mL of TPTZ solution, 3 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution and 6 mL of distilled water. L-Ascorbic acid solution (1 Mm solution, 0.088 g of ascorbic acid +50 mL distilled water) was used as the standard and used as a stock solution to prepare different concentrations of standards. Of the sample/standard 10 μL was pipetted into the 96-well plates in triplicates. Of the FRAP reagent 300 μL was eventually added to make a total volume of 310 μL in each well. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and readings were taken and results were compared to a standard curve that uses an equation (
