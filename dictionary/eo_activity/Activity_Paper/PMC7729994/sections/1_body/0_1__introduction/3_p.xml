 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (Linn. G. Donn) is both a medicinal and ornamental plant belonging to the Apocyanaceae family. It is a commercial plant that is grown in most parts of the world because of its medicinal uses [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. roseus’</italic> water decoction has a long history of usage in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, wounds, scurvy, hypertension and malaria [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of a wide array of bioactive compounds. Besides, phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> are rich in alkaloids like vincristine, vinblastine, ajamalicine, serpentine, alstonine and reserpine. These alkaloids are popularly known to contribute significantly to the plant’s medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to the above properties, 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> has been shown to possess antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Vindoline is one of the alkaloids of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> that is mainly found in its leaves. Previous studies demonstrated a hypoglycemic effect of vindoline, which was suggested to be linked with stimulated insulin secretion [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study aims at assessing and comparing the in vitro antidiabetic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of different crude extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> and vindoline in high glucose induced insulinoma cells and by evaluating their effect on glucose metabolizing enzymes.
