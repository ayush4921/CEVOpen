  <p>Effect of vindoline and the extracts on intracellular ROS. HG/UT: untreated high glucose exposed cell; HG/V: high glucose exposed cells treated with vindoline; HG/Aq: high glucose exposed cells treated with CR-Aq; HG/M: high glucose exposed cells treated with CR-Meth; HG/DCM: high glucose exposed cells treated with CR-DCM; H

   <sub>2</sub>: positive control; Control: cells not exposed to high glucose concentration, treated with media. (
   <bold>a</bold>) is a histogram that represents levels of ROS in RIN-5F cells that are untreated and treated with hydrogen peroxide. Red = Untreated, Blue = Treated. (
   <bold>b</bold>) is a graphical presentation of percentage ROS in cells following exposure to high glucose and respective treatments.
