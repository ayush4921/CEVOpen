    "The <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> plant has been used traditionally to treat diabetes mellitus. Scientific evidence supporting the antidiabetic effects of this plant's active ingredient-vindoline has not been fully evaluated. In this study, extracts of <i>C. roseus</i> and vindoline were tested for antioxidant activities, alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities and insulin secretory effects in pancreatic RIN-5F cell line cultured in the absence of glucose, at low and high glucose concentrations. The methanolic extract of the plant showed the highest antioxidant activities in addition to the high total polyphenolic content (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The HPLC results exhibited increased concentration of vindoline in the dichloromethane and the ethylacetate extracts. Vindoline showed noticeable antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid at <i>p</i> < 0.05 and significantly improved the in vitro insulin secretion. The intracellular reactive oxygen species formation in glucotoxicity-induced cells was significantly reduced following treatment with vindoline, methanolic and the dichloromethane extracts when compared to the high glucose untreated control (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Plant extracts and vindoline showed weaker inhibitory effects on the activities of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes when compared to acarbose, which inhibited the activities of the enzymes by 80%. The plant extracts also exhibited weak alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase inhibitory effects."
