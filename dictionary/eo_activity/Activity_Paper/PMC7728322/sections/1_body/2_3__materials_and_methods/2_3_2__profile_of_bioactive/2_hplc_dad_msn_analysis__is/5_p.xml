<p>For the isolation of epicatechin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulphate 5 g of dried methanol extract was applied to a sephadex column (4 × 100 cm) and eluted with methanol 0,5 mL/min, using a Dionex P680 pump. Fraction of 10 mL were collected using a Varian 920 fraction collector, 300 fractins obtained and pooled on the basis of their TLC behaviour (Solvent Dichloromethane: Methanol: Water: Acetic acid 10:6:0,5:1) in 20 groups. Fraction 96–113 (650 mg) was used for semipreparative HPLC. Agilent 1100 system equipped with diode array and fraction collector was used, Agilent XDB C-18 3 × 150 mm was used as stationary phase. Flow rate was 5 mL/min and solvent was isocratic mixture of Acetonitrile (45) water 1% formic acid (55). Peak was collected on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm. Epicatechin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulphate was obtained as dark yellow powder (50 mg) and structure was elucidated on the basis of its NMR and MS data. NMR assignments are reported in
