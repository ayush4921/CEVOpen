<p>Three different methods were performed for the proanthocyanidins and spiroketal glycosides analysis. First, an Agilent Eclipse XDB C-18 (3.0 × 150 mm) 3.5 μm was used as stationary phase and as eluents water 0.1% formic acid (A), acetonitrile (B) were used. Elution gradient started with 90% of A and 10% of B and go to 100% of B in 30 min. The flow rate was 1.00 mL/min. Second, an Agilent Zorbax SB-C3 (4.6 × 150 mm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 5 μm coupled with an Agilent Eclipse XDB C-18 (3.0 × 150 mm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 3.5 μm were used as stationary phase to increase the number of plates. The same eluents and elution gradient were employed. Third, the same two columns were used as stationary phase and as eluents, water 0.1% formic acid (A), acetonitrile (B) and methanol (C) were used. Elution gradient started with 98% of A and 2% of B and go to 35% of A, 60% of B and 5% of C in 120 min. Then the amount of B was increased to 90% while the amount of C was increased to 10% in 80 min. The flow rate was 400 µL/min.</p>
