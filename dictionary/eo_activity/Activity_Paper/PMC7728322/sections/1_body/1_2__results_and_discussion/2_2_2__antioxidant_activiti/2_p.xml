<p>Overall, findings showed that there is a good correlation between the different assays except with metal chelating assay. Such kind of correlation was also observed in several other studies [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The methanol bark extract exhibited the highest antioxidant property with all assays except metal chelating. For instance, the latter extract displayed the most potent DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities (202.09 ± 0.15 and 490.12 ± 0.18 mg TE/g, respectively), strongest Fe

 <sup>2+</sup> reducing potential (325.86 ± 4.36 and 661.82 ± 0.40 mg TE/g, respectively) and possessed the highest total antioxidant capacity (3.33 ± 0.13 mmol TE/g). Scientists have claimed that highly polar solvents, especially methanol, have a high effectiveness as antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], since a different plant part demonstrated high radical scavenging activity. For instance, the methanolic and ethyl acetate leaf extract displayed the highest DPPH and ABTS activity, respectively, (DPPH: IC50 = 2.42 µg/mL; ABTS: 7195.45 ± 44.31 µM TEAC/g).
