<p>Our results are consistent with the phytochemical composition results shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05537-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presenting methanolic bark extract with the highest phenolic content. Several lines of evidence have showed that plant extracts with high phenolic content exhibited substantially high antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the dichloromethane fruit extract showed poor antioxidant activity with ABTS, FRAP and CUPRAC tests and inactivity was reported with DPPH and metal chelating assays. Interestingly, despite the fruit showed high nutritional composition in terms of starch, protein, amino acid and mineral content in the work of Murugan, Prabu, Chandran, Sajeesh, Iniyavan and Parimelazhagan [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the results presented herein showed that the fruit possessed low phytoantioxidants content.
