<p>In order to understand the possible different antioxidant mechanisms of 
 <italic>B. retusa,</italic> a set of assays were conducted. For example, DPPH and ABTS assays were used to assess radical quenching ability, FRAP and CUPRAC assays to investigate reducing power, metal chelating to determine ability of extracts to chelate ferrous ions and phosphomolybdenum to determine total antioxidant capacity. The results are presented in
