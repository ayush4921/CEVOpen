 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f002">Figure 2</xref> represent different chromatograms obtained during the method development. At beginning a reverse phase column (3.0 × 150 mm C-18 Eclipse XDB, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used and gradient was formed by aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile as reported in materials and methods. Many peaks appeared to be overlapped as visible in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f002">Figure 2</xref> chromatogram A. Thus, to increase separation a second column was added. We selected a C-3 reverse phase (4.6 × 150 mm SB C-3 Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to obtain different selectivity but working with same eluent that was fitted before the C-18 column acting as a sort of pre-chromatography. Column diameter of 4.6 mm was selected in order to offer less resistance to flow and higher carbon loading due to complex matrix of the sample. Gradient elution was the same as used for chromatogram A. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f002">Figure 2</xref>B show the improvement of the separation with the use of the two columns. Then gradient was modified as indicated in materials and methods allowing more time for separation and result is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f002">Figure 2</xref>C. This was selected as ideal conditions for all the samples.
