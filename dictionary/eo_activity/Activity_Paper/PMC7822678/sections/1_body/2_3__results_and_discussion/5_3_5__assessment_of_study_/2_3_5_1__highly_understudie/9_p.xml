 <italic>C. buchananii</italic> was mentioned twice as being used in other African countries and cultures, namely, as a natural remedy against fungal infections in the southern highlands of Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and against back pain, hernia, and erectile disfunction in the Kagera region, northwest Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. At our study site in the Greater Mpigi region [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we also documented the common practice of using this plant medicinally in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The Kagera region is relatively close to the Greater Mpigi region and also situated in the Lake Victoria basin. Among other Tanzanian medicinal plants traditionally used to treat fungal infections, 
 <italic>C. buchananii</italic> has been investigated for cytotoxic, genotoxic, and CYP450 enzymatic competition effects [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In addition, in the 1990s, three compounds were isolated from 
 <italic>C. buchananii</italic>: (1) elabunin, a novel dammarane triterpene from the root bark with moderate cytotoxic activity against L-1210 leukemic cells [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]; (2) mutangin, a novel sesquiterpene from the plant's fruit, with moderate antifeedant activity [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; and (3) buchaninoside, a steroidal glycoside from the plant's fruit, with antifeedant activity against 
 <italic>Spodoptera exempta</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].
