<p>Only four publications mentioned the traditional use of 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>; however, there was one article on bioactive natural product structures isolated from this species. The first paper classifies 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> as a weed that is used medicinally as an emetic and contraceptive, as well as for treatment of eye diseases, diarrhea, burns, and wounds by the Haya people in the Kagera region, Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In the second paper, Kibuuka and Anywar describe the traditional use of 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> against hernias in Central Uganda [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The third paper mentions the use of the fresh leaves in treatment of hypertension in Bulamogi county, Uganda (eaten together with 
 <italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic> or 
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The fourth ethnobotanical study from the DoP
 <sub>traditional use</sub> was conducted in rural and urban areas across Central Uganda (including part of the Greater Mpigi region). The article mentions the use of the root powder (1 tablespoon) in 200 mL water, which is boiled for 5 minutes and then drunk twice a day to induce vomiting [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In terms of the DoP
 <sub>structure elucidation</sub>, Chidewe et al. isolated six compounds from 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Two were already known (the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the glucosinolate glucoiberverin), while the other four remained unidentified and were not structure elucidated.
