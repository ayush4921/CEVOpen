<p id="p0065">Herpes genitalis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) or herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). They are enveloped DNA virus. The primary mode of transmission is by direct contact. There are some similarities between HSV-1 and HSV-2 based on type of epitopes and antigenic cross reactions. HSV-1 occurs in childhood and HSV-2 occurs during sexual contact. HSV-2 is commonly seen in females. Primary infection results in papular skin, lesion in mucous membrane, swelling in inflammatory regions in vulva, and dysuria. The recurrent infection includes fever, menstruation stress, abortion, and eye lesion. The diagnosis is done by swabbing the infected mucous membrane and then analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Another diagnosis includes antibody detection of HSV infection.
