<p id="p0035">Viruses generally consist of DNA or RNA (single/double stranded or positive/negative stranded) as their genetic material which is surrounded by a lipoprotein/glycoprotein covering. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the classification of selected animal viruses with DNA/RNA genomes. Viruses invade host and employ the host metabolic processes as well as generate many copies of viral proteins that produce individual virus. The viral strains eventually get adapted to the host's immune systems. Pre-vaccination was found to be more effective approach. The transmission of virus also depends on the contact of people in a population. Since the viral strains are mutated and are getting adapted, it is difficult to develop the vaccines (

The antiviral drugs play a very important role in today's life by suppressing the viral transmission and helps in host surviving. Analyzing and understanding the kinetics and dynamics of antiviral drugs aid in controlling the virus during pandemics because the hosts may expose to the infection again. Antivirals are effective in cases where there are no vaccines available for viruses like Influenza virus (
