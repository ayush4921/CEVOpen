<p id="p0260">Newly emerging viral diseases are serious threat to human health. Recent impact of viral disease outbreaks like COVID-19, SARS, EVD, ZIKV disease, NIV disease, and Influenza viruses have emphasized new drug designing and vaccine development. Though synthetic molecules are available for viral infections, traditional medicines or novel drug formulations from different natural sources benefit better with low complications. Natural resources viz. medicinal plants, bacteria, and fungi have been identified as promising producers of plethora of alkaloids, coumarins, phenolics, flavonoids, lignans, terpenoids, tannins, and peptides which have shown tremendous abilities as antiviral agents and suggested their role in the development of ideal antiviral drugs in future. Indian medicinal plants and Ayurveda have shown beneficial effects against diversified groups of viral diseases. In addition, CHMs and Unani medicines contained several plant products and preparations which played a tremendous role in treating various ailments. These evidences led to investigate further the field of pharmacology in order to strengthen the constant warning of emerging and re-emerging viral infections and develop a state of preparedness in the world. However, plethora of natural resources still requires in depth pharmacological investigations in terms of suggesting their profound roles as therapeutics.</p>
