<p>Leukemia is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis and high mortality, characterized by clonal hematopoietic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Among the hematopoietic diseases, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. T-ALL occurs primarily in children or adults over 40 years of age and is characterized by abnormal white blood cell proliferation in the blood and bone marrow, which interferes with normal immune responses and induces anemia [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a major T-cell growth factor, IL-2 plays a critical role in T cell growth and immune responses mediated by the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. IL-2 expression is involved in T cell survival and inflammatory responses; hence, the inhibition of IL-2 expression may contribute to the regulation of T cell proliferation and treatment of T-ALL [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, research on chemotherapy for T-ALL is increasing, but the prognosis is still poor and the problems of side effects persist. In this study, we evaluated the effect of A.S. extract on cell survival and IL-2 expression in human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cells. The combined treatment effects with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as axitinib and dovitinib were also observed.
