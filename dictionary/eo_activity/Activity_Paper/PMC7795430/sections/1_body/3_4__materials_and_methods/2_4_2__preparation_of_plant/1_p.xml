 <italic>Allium senescens</italic> L. (
 <italic>Allium senescens subsp. senescens</italic>) was collected from the Urkhut ovoo, Saikhan soum, Bulgan province, Mongolia. The plant sample was collected and identified by Mr. Zumberelmaa at the Mongolia International University. The voucher specimen was recorded as PB023262, having been deposited at the herbarium of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (Daejeon, Korea). This process was performed in 2008 and methanol extraction was performed in 2014 following the protocol of Bank. Briefly, the freezing dried and refined aerial parts (leaves and stems) of A.S. (91 g) were extracted with 1000 mL of 99.9% (

 <italic>v</italic>) methanol with a sonicator (SDN-900H, SD Ultrasonic Cleaner, Seoul, Korea) at 45 °C for 3 days (15 min sonication followed by 2 h standing; repeated 10 times per day). The resultant product was filtered with non-fluorescence cottons, condensed using a rotary evaporator (N1000SWD, EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) under reduced pressure at 45 °C, and lyophilized using a freeze dryer (Christ, Germany). The powder (FBM194–096; yield, 6.36%, approximated as 5.79 g) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a stock solution (25.26 mg/mL). The stock solution was diluted with culture medium or DMSO (for in vitro assay) before use in the experiments and DMSO was used as a vehicle.
