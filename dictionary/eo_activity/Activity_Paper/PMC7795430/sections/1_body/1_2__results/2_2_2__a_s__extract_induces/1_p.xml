<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B, the flow cytometry result shows that A.S. extract dose-dependently increased the population of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-positive cells. Additionally, treatment with A.S. extract activated phosphorylated and total levels of p38, but phosphorylated JNK was suppressed by A.S. extract in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). These results suggest that A.S. extract induced the production of ROS and the activation of MAPK p38 in Jurkat cells. The phosphorylation of p38 or JNK was associated with apoptosis of Jurkat cells [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the balance between p38 and JNK signaling controls apoptosis or autophagy [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The inhibition of JNK promotes intracellular ROS production and apoptosis of cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. JNK1 negatively regulates the expression of tumor suppressor p53, but JNK positively regulates the expression of p53 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00035" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the intracellular mechanism of treatment with small molecule compounds in previous studies and natural products in this study were different, our results suggest that ROS production by A.S. affects p38 activation of Jurkat cells and may be related to cell death by stress-activated protein kinase activity.
