  <p>A.S. extract induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in T-ALL Jurkat cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Jurkat cells were treated with A.S. extract for 24–72 h and the apoptotic cells were analyzed using the MUSE® Cell Analyzer. (
   <bold>B</bold>) After A.S. extract treatment to Jurkat cells for 24 h, protein expression of caspase-3 (cytosol), cleaved caspase-3 (cytosol), and PARP-1 (nucleus) was measured by Western blot using 10% (caspase-3 and actin), 15% (cleaved caspase-3), and 8% (PARP-1) polyacrylamide gels. Actin was used as a loading control against cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The detected band intensities were quantified based on the ImageJ software, and the relative ratio between proteins were normalized by actin.
