 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2012b)</xref> used activity-guided fractionation to identify nine diarylheptanoids (platyphyllenone, hirsutenone, platyphyllone, platyphyllonol-5-xylopyranoside, hirsutanonol, oregonin, rubranol, rubranoside B, and rubranoside A) from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud.</italic> They evaluated their SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitory effect using a continuous fluorometric assay. The results showed that hirsutenone, hirsutanonol, oregonin, rubranol, rubranoside B, and rubranoside A exerted a significant dose-dependent inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV PLpro with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 3 to 44.5 µM. Hirsutenone possessed the most potent inhibitory effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.1 ± 0.3 µM which was less important than that of the reference inhibitor curcumin (5.7 µM). The enhanced inhibitory potential of diarylheptanoids seems to be related to the presence of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, and catechol groups.
