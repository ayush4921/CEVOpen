 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge ethanolic extract (30 µg/ml) caused 88% inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro. Moreover, seven bioactive tanshinones (tanshinone IIA, tanshinone IIB, methyl tanshinonate, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, dihydrotanshinone I, and rosmariquinone) were identified from the n-hexane fraction. These tanshinones were evaluated with regard to inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro activity using a fluorometric assay. Both molecules exhibited important inhibitory time-dependent activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.8 to 30 µM. The dimethyl tetrahydronaphthalen structure was associated with enhanced inhibitory potential. The results obtained showed that cryptotanshinone was the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.8 ± 0.2 µM. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that rosmariquinone was a mixed-type inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro, whereas the other tanshinones were noncompetitive inhibitors (
