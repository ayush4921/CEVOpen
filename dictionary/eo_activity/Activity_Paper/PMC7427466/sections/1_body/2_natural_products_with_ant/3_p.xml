<p>Owing to its importance as a key protein for SARS-CoV genome replication, SARS-CoV helicase still remains a target of novel antiviral drugs. Sixty-four natural molecules originated from 15 medicinal species were evaluated regarding their inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV helicase. Myricetin and scutellarein (

 </xref>) significantly inhibited the SARS-CoV helicase activity. At 10 µM, myricetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.71 ± 0.19 µM) and scutellarein (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.86 ± 0.48 µM) were able to inhibit 90% of the ATPase activity of the SARS-CoV helicase. Accordingly, Myricetin and scutellarein were suggested to be promising future anti-SARS drugs (
