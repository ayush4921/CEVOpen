 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al. (2011)</xref> evaluated 200 Chinese herbal extracts for their anti-SARS-CoV effect using a cell-based assay. Among them, six extracts [rhizomes of 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra</italic> Bunge; tuber of 
 <italic>Dioscorea polystachya</italic> Turcz.; seed of 
 <italic>Senna tora</italic> (L.) Roxb.; stem and leaves of 
 <italic>Taxillus chinensis</italic> (DC.) Danser; and two extracts of 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic> (L.) J.Sm. rhizome] were found to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV growth and replication. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 25 to 200 μg/ml. By using FRET assay, the study demonstrated that extracts obtained from tuber of 
 <italic>Dioscorea polystachya</italic> Turcz. and rhizome of 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic> (L.) J.Sm. caused marked inhibition of SARS-CoV- 3CL protease with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 39 and 44 μg/ml, respectively.
