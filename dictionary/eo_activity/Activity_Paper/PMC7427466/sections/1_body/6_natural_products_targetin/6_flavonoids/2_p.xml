 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al. (2020)</xref> evaluated the inhibitory effect of 64 flavonoids towards SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) using the FRET method. They found that at 20 µM, rhoifolin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin possessed the higher inhibitory effect, with IC50 values of 27.45, 33.17, and 37.78 μM, respectively. In addition, molecular docking revealed that flavonoids possessed an important binding affinity for SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) owing to their hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups.
