<p>SARS-CoV-2 shares several genetic and clinical similarities with other coronaviruses of the 
 <italic>β</italic> genus such as SARs-CoV and NL63 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fani et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, the entry of both viruses needs their interaction with the ACE2 receptor. However, some differences have been reported among these strains such as the length of the S protein and the structure of the receptor binding region (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ceccarelli et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, a high nucleotides homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in addition to a high homology (95–100%) that has been demonstrated between the proteins of the two strains. Actually, S2 and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 99 and 90% similarities, respectively (
