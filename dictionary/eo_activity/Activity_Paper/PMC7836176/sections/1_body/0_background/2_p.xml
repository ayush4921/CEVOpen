<p id="Par39">Development of efficacious therapies for NASH is still faced with unresolved challenges, owing to the multiple potential pathogenic pathways involved in the disease and their equivocal associations. Although the ultimate remedy for most patients is regulation of their body weight and diet, pharmacological therapies are still needed. The ideal drug for treating NASH should possess an assortment of characteristics, in that it should be able to reduce the hepatic fat content and also exert anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, taking a cocktail of drugs inevitably has latent side effects that limit its use. Therefore, herbal medicines, which mainly comprise crude extracts of medicinal plants, are used as conventional remedies globally. Although their overall chemical profiles are unknown and their mechanisms are unclear, the therapeutic effects and safety of medicinal plants in humans have been verified through their long-term use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Through their cocktail effects from a mixture of innate herbal compounds, the multipurpose therapeutic effects of herbal medicine on human diseases have been well documented. Considering their complex potencies, we hypothesized that the efficacy of herbal medicines in NASH may be evaluated suitably.
