<p id="Par46">Liver samples were lysed with RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), after which the protein concentration of each lysate was measured. The protein concentration of each liver lysate was then equalized by dilution in an appropriate volume of RIPA buffer, after which the loading dye was added. Detection of chemiluminescence signals via western blot analysis was conducted using an LAS-3000 Bio Imaging System (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the band density was measured using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). As for primary antibodies, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Cat. sc-13,032), Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (Cat. sc-390,991), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) (Cat. sc-13,595), and α-SMA (Cat. sc-53,142) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). The primary antibodies against transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) (Cat. #3711), Smad2/3 (Cat. #5678), p-Smad2/3 (Cat. #8828S), and Smad4 (Cat. #38454) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).</p>
