 <italic>db</italic>) mice from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) were obtained by the Central Lab. Animal, Inc. (Seoul, Korea). After 1 week of acclimation, 22 mice were separated into four experimental groups according to their body weight. After the acclimation period, the MCS group was provided a diet supplemented with methionine and choline, whereas the other groups were fed a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD) (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 3 weeks. During the experimental period, the vehicle solution (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose [CMC]) was provided to the MCS and MCD groups by oral gavage. The GFT group was administered elafibranor (GFT505) in 0.5% CMC solution at a dosage of 10 mg·kg

 <sup>− 1</sup>. After 3 weeks, the mice were administered a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection and blood samples were collected from the heart. Mice were sacrificed by excessive blood collection during the anesthetized state and liver samples were collected. The animal experimental designs were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee of KIST (approval number KIST-2018-107; date of approval, December 28, 2018).
