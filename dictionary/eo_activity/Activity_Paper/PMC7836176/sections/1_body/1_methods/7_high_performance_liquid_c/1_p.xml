<p id="Par47">The chemical profile of the ethanol extract of LV was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The Phenomenex Kinetex C18 reversed phase column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.7 μm) that can construct ultra-HPLC (UPLC) analysis conditions in any liquid chromatography machine was equipped onto the HPLC apparatus (UltiMate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were prepared, and the mobile gradient was as follows: 0–10 min, with an initial mobile gradient of A and B of 99:1; 15 min, 90:10; 30 min, 70:30; 40–41 min, 30:70; 41–44 min, 0:100; and 45–50 min, 99:1. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, the column temperature was 45 °C, and detection was carried out at 254 nm. After separation of the chemical compounds with HPLC, MS was performed using a Q-TOF 5600+ device (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) with electrospray ionization. The negative ionization mode was used for focusing on the flavonoids and phenolic compounds in the plant. The MS scan mode (50–1000 m/z) was set to full scan and information-dependent acquisition. The MS operation conditions were as follows: 4.5 kV capillary voltage; 400 °C gas temperature; and 600 L/h gas flow. For automatic MS/MS scanning of the abundant chemical compounds in the sample, the MS survey mode was used with auto switching collision-induced dissociation, and the collision energy range was − 35 ± 15 eV. The tentative chemical compounds were determined by comparison against the analyzed MS/MS spectra and mass spectral libraries like the Human Metabolome Database and National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
