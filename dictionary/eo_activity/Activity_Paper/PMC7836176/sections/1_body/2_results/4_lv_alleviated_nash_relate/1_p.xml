<p id="Par53">Sirius Red was used to stain the fibrotic regions in liver tissues, which appeared as yellow areas under the microscope (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), and these fibrotic regions in the liver were quantified by measuring the amounts of hydroxyproline in the tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Liver fibrosis decreased in the LYS group; however, interestingly, GFT505 did not ameliorate liver fibrosis. The GFT group presented high levels of hydroxyproline and in amounts similar to those in the MCD group. In contrast, the LYS group showed significantly reduced hydroxyproline levels. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of fibrogenesis-related genes decreased after treatment with LV extract (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Moreover, we found that the levels of TGFβ and Smad signaling-related protein (TGF-β1, Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3, and Smad4), one of the key mechanisms regulating the expression of fibrotic genes, was significantly decreased in the LYS group compared with MCD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
