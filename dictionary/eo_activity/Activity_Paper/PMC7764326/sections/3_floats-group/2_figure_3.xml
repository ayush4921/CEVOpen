  <p>The effect of VHC1 and VHC2 on the viability of human gingival cell lines—primary gingival keratinocytes (PGK) and human primary gingival fibroblasts (HGF) at 72 h post-stimulation. The cell viability percentage was normalized to control cells (no stimulation), considered 100% cell viability. The data represent the mean values ± SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA analysis was applied to determine the statistical differences followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*
