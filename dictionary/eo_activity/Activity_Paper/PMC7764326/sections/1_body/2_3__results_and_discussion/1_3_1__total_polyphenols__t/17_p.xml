<p>As mentioned above, because of the extractive solvent used for the analysis of individual polyphenols (ethanol for VHC1/VHC2 powder and hot water for ready-to-drink VHC1/VHC2 beverages), there is a significant difference between the TP content of the two finished products. Also, as expected, the amount of all individual polyphenols was significantly higher in the powdered products compared to the ready-to-drink beverages. However, kaempherol (KP) was the only exception; its concentration was higher in VHC1 ready-to-drink product than in the VHC1 powder product.</p>
