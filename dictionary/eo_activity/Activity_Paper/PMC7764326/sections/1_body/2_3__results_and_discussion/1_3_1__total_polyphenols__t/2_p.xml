<p>The final products VHC1 and VHC2 obtained as powders exhibit high values of polyphenol content (127.81 ± 2.33 and 137.7 ± 2.23 mg GAE/g, respectively). In the ready-to-drink products based on the use of VHC1 and VHC2 powders, the TP content is lower (17.14 ± 0.55 mg GAE/g and 18.50 ± 0.52 mg GAE/g). The difference occurs because of the technological process of beverage preparation that uses water as solvent which has weaker polyphenol extraction capacity than ethanol. As presented above, cocoa powder is one of the richest matrix in TP, previous studies reporting similar results [
