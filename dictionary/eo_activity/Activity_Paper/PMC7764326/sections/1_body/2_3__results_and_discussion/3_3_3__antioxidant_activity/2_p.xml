<p>The CUPRAC method was introduced in 2004 by Apak et al. as a total antioxidant capacity assay in order to provide some advantages to other previously applied methods; thus the copper(II)-neocuproine (Cu(II)-Nc) reagent is easily affordable, soluble in both aqueous and organic media, stable and selective, provides faster kinetics, can be used at physiological pH and responds to all types of antioxidants including the ones that can be found in foods and beverages [

Apak et al. estimated in a comprehensive review published in 2007 that the CUPRAC method meets six out of the eight criteria proposed to define an ideal standardized antioxidant capacity assay as follows: simplicity, clear end-point and mechanism, readily available equipment, intra- and inter-assay reproducibility, ability to simultaneously respond to hydrophilic/hydrophobic antioxidants, high throughput for routine analysis [
