<p>To date, our studies on the two innovative varieties of hot sugar-free chocolate have focused on the analysis of total and individual polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, determination of the proximate composition and nutritional value, study of antimicrobial activity on nine strains of microorganisms and toxicity studies on several cell lines. The present study has a few limitations that provide an opportunity for future research. Thus far, our study focused on obtaining antimicrobial and toxicological data after an initial in vitro biolosgical assessment. Nevertheless, the studies can be continued by testing our two new products on other microbial strains and cell lines. For the sensory analysis the number of panelists used was limited due to the pandemic condition. Thus, to evaluate the consumerâ€™s acceptability regarding the consumption of the two products, a more extensive panel of sensory evaluators can be used. The anticariogenic activity of the products was evaluated only by in vitro studies. Clearly, further clinical tests are needed to reveal the anticariogenic action of these products and to emphasize even more the importance of replacing the classic hot chocolate with sugar, so loved especially by children, with these new products, tasty and with many health benefits.</p>
