<p>However, the viability of human primary gingival fibroblasts—HGF cells decreases with increasing concentration of VHC1 and VHC2 samples; the application of up to 10 µg/mL VHC1 and VHC2, respectively, on HGF cells induces an acceptable viability level of over 70%. In contrast, HGF cells stimulated with concentrations of 25 µg/mL of each product, respectively, exhibited 64% cell viability for VHC1 and 65.63% cell viability for VHC2 sample. The highest applied concentration (50 µg/mL) induced a decrease in HGF cell viability, quantified at 54.81% for VHC1 and 42.97% for VHC2 (
