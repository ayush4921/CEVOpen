<p>However, HDFa cell viability (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01844-f003">Figure 3</xref>), where low concentrations (5 and 10 Âµg/mL) exhibit less harmful effect; still, the sensitivity of HDFa cells to the tested samples is higher compared to the one of HGFa cells. HDFa cells treated with the VHC1 sample exhibit a viability percentage between 62.13% and 44.95% depending on concentration, while the cell population treated with VHC2 sample seems to be less affected than the HDFa cells stimulated with VH1C sample, the cells showing a viability between 67.63% and 54.32% vary in a concentration-dependent manner (
