<p>The in vitro toxicological evaluation of the finished products was carried out on primary gingival keratinocytes by the assessment of cell viability through the Alamar Blue test. The primary gingival keratinocytes are normal gingival epithelial cells with similar properties as the dermal epithelial cells and are frequently used for the analysis of the oral epithelium properties [

The experimental data obtained for the VHC1 indicated that after 72 h stimulation all tested concentrations (5, 10, 25, and 50 Âµg/mL, respectively) did not affect cell viability; moreover, they induced a slight stimulation of their number. Similar results were recorded for the VHC2 product (
