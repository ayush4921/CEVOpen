<p>The Folin-Ciocalteu method was employed for the determination of the total polyphenol content in both raw materials and finished products (in both powder and beverage form) [

In the case of ready-to-drink hot chocolate, after filtering the beverage was obtained by dissolving the respective VHC1 or VHC2 powders in hot water, and the samples were taken and analyzed. Total of 0.5 mL of each sample was treated with 1.25 mL Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) diluted 1:10 with water. After the addition of 1 mL Na

 <sub>3</sub> 60 g/L, (S.C. Chemical Company S.A., Bucharest, Romania), the extract was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. The absorption of the blue-colored solution was measured at 750 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Analytic Jena Specord 205, Jena, Germany). The calibration curve was prepared using gallic acid as standard (concentration range 5–250 µg/mL). All results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of sample (mg GAE/g). The experiment was conducted in triplicate and the results were statistically evaluated.
