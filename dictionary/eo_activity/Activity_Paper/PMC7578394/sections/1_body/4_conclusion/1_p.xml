<p>This study showed that the reduction in the disadvantages associated with continuous cropping can be divided into four main phases. In phase I, intercropping is beneficial to the growth of microorganisms by adjusting soil nutrient levels (pH, K, Ca, Cu). In phase II, the improved soil microenvironment significantly changes the abundance of different microbial species. In phase III, intercropping regulates microbial metabolism, and in phase IV, beneficial microorganisms and soil physical and chemical factors begin to positively influence each other. The RDA and correlation analysis revealed that pH and Ca were the primary factors determining the population dynamics changes to key microbiomes during CC. This study is the first time that high-throughput sequencing methods have been used to verify that interplanting ameliorates the CC disadvantages associated with patchouli cultivation, and provides useful information that can be used to solve the problems associated with CC. In the future, technical support will be provided when ecologically cultivating medicinal plants.</p>
