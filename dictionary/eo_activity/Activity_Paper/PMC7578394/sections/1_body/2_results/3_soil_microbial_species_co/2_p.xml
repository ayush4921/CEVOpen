<p>The LEfSe analysis results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) showed that there were many species of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Mortierellomycota, Glomeromycota, and Basidiomycota, and there were species differences among the four experimental groups. These results suggested that the dominant microorganisms decreased after CC. Intercropping with turmeric or ginger increased the species of dominant microorganisms, such as Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Mortierellomycota, Glomeromycota.
