<p>When the patchouli was harvested, the soil from the rhizosphere in the four sites was sampled according to the methods for soil rhizosphere soil used by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Schlaeppi et al. (2014)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">D’Amico et al. (2018)</xref>. Five patchouli plants were randomly selected from five uniform distribution sites within each planting treatment and the soil attached to the root system was collected. The collected rhizosphere soil samples were sieved to remove microbial residues and divided into three subsamples. The first part was dried in a cool place for physicochemical properties analysis, the second part was stored in a 4°C refrigerator for 2 days and was used for the microbial colony analysis, and the third was temporarily stored in a liquid nitrogen tank at –80°C for subsequent microbial 16s RNA and ITS sequence analysis. The methods used to determine the soil physical and chemical properties have been previously reported in 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. (2016)</xref>.
