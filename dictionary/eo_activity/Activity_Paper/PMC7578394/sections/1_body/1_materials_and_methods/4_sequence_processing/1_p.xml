<p>The raw 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing reads were demultiplexed, quality-filtered by Trimmomatic, and merged by FLASH (version 1.2.11) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Magoè and Salzberg, 2011</xref>) with a minimum overlap of 10 bp and mismatch error rates of 2%. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% similarity cutoff were clustered using UPARSE (version 7.1)

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kõljalg et al., 2005</xref>). All the comparisons used a confidence threshold of 0.7. Chao1, Simpson, and all the other alpha diversity indexes were calculated by QIIME (version 1.9.1) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Caporaso et al., 2010</xref>). The OTU rarefaction curve and rank abundance curves were also plotted by QIIME. The abundance statistics for each taxonomic unit were visualized using Krona (version 2.6) (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ondov et al., 2011</xref>) and the biomarker features in each group were screened by Metastats (version 20090414) (
