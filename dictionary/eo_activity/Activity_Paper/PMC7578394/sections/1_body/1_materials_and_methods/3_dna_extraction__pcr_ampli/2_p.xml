<p>The hypervariable V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primer pairs 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAT-3′) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), and the ITS region of the eukaryotic ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using primers (ITS3_KYO2F 5′-GATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA-3′) and (ITS4R 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (

 <sup>®</sup> 9700 PCR thermocycler (ABI, Foster City, CA, United States) (95°C for 2 min, followed by 27 cycles at 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 68°C for 10 min), where the barcode is an eight-base sequence unique to each sample. The PCR reactions were repeated three times using a 50 μL mixture containing 5 μL of 10 × KOD buffer, 5 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1.5 μL of each primer (5 μM), 1 μL of KOD polymerase, and 100 ng of template cDNA(16s)/DNA (ITS). After PCR amplification, the PCR products were extracted from 2% agarose gel and purified using an AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, United States) according to manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using a Quantus
 <sup>TM</sup> fluorometer (Promega, San Luis Obispo, United States).
