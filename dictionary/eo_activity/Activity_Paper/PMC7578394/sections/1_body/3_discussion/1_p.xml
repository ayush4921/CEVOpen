<p>The aims of this study were to determine the soil microbial factors that cause cropping yield decline when patchouli is continuously cultivated, and to clarify the changes in soil microbial diversity, soil microbial population structure, microbial community metabolic function, and soil nutrient content. This study indicated that intercropping turmeric or ginger with continuously cropped patchouli changed the microenvironment, and altered the soil nutrient content. These changes positively affected soil microbial community growth, soil microbial community structure, and soil microbial metabolic functions and pathways, which ameliorated the problems associated with CC. In addition, the active ingredient contents analysis of continuously cropped patchouli confirmed the other results produced by this work.</p>
