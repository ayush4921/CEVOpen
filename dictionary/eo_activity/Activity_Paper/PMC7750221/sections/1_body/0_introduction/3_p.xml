<p>In the early 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, some researchers continued to explore the potential uses of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> lattice and their chemical characterizations. The whole 
 <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex reduced the clotting time of blood, but its diluted latex prolonged it; this is significant because it demonstrates that the latex possesses both pro-hemostatic and anti-hemostatic activities [

 <italic>Jatropha</italic>, the latex of other plants has also demonstrated thrombin-like proteases that can treat bleeding wounds [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The presence of cyclic nonapeptide in lattices supports their potential use as cytotoxic compounds against tumoral cells [

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other biological activities identified in lattices include anti-inflammatory effects and wound healing. The lattices of 
 <italic>Jatropha neopauciflora</italic> Pax species, which are endemic to Mexico, promote wound healing that can attain up to 100% of the tensile strength of undamaged skin in a murine model. These lattices also promote antibacterial activity without toxicity when tested in cell lines [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When the cells infiltrating the lesion site were characterized, it was noted that CD68+ and CD34+ cells mobilized to skin tissues treated with 
 <italic>J. curcas</italic> Linn. latex [
