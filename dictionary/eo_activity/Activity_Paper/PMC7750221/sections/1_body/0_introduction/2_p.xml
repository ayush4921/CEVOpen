<p>In the past two decades of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, several studies have reported on the beneficial properties of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> lattices. Proanthocyanidin polymers have been found in the latex of 
 <italic>J. multifida</italic> and showed anti-complement activity [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latex of 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> has a proteolytic enzyme of around 22 kDa, and the diluted latex showed healing action when applied topically, although the undiluted latex produced caustic lesions [

 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, a novel cyclic nonapeptide with L-amino acids was identified in 
 <italic>J. podagrica</italic> latex with cytotoxicity activity [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
