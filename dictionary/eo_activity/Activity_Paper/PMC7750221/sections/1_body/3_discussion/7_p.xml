<p>Significantly, whole latex was less effective in promoting wound healing than 5% aqueous latex fraction; these data may suggest that the concentration and composition of phytochemical compounds are an important factor in promoting specific activity, as reported in a study where whole undiluted 
 <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex shortened the clotting time of blood but diluted latex prolonged it [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, diluted 
 <italic>J. curcas</italic> latex has been shown to have healing properties, but undiluted latex has produced caustic lesions [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings contrast with another study in which the latex of 
 <italic>J. neopauciflora</italic> Pax showed wound healing efficacy at 50%, 70%, and even 100% concentrations [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; this contrasts with the data of Salas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. who reported caustic lesions [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and our results. In summary, the above data suggest that the composition and concentration of phytochemicals can differ significantly among the latex of different 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species.
