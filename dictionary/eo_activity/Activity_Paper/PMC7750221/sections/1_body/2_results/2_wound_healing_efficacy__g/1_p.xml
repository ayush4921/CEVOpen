<p>At the end of the experiment, and immediately after euthanized the mice; the tensile strengths of the wounds were measured, and the wound-healing efficacies were calculated. We found the highest wound healing efficacies in the aqueous latex fraction (97.7%) and chloroform latex fraction (93%) groups, which were higher than that of the positive control (79.5%). For the glycerin (negative control), ethyl acetate latex extract, and whole latex groups, the wound healing efficacy was between 72 and 77%. The lyophilized latex demonstrated the poorest overall wound healing efficacy (59%), which was worse even than that of the glycerin placebo (
