 <italic>J. gaumeri</italic> plants previously authenticated by the Biology Faculty of the Autonomous Campeche State University were grown in a backyard in a Campeche city neighborhood. 
 <italic>J. gaumeri</italic> latex was obtained as a milky fluid exudate from cut stalk leaves and young stems and was stored in sterile tubes with protection from light. Previous asepsis was done with sterile water to ensure asepsis. The samples were transported in an icebox to the laboratory, kept at 4Â°C, and immediately fractioned.
