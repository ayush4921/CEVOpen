<p>In this experiment, the mice were anesthetized, and an aseptic incision of 1 cm was made in a previously shaved area on the back. The wounds were topically treated every 24 h with the respective extracts for 22 days. The progression of wound healing was recorded at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. On day 22, the mice were euthanized, and the tensile strengths of the wounds were determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The tensile strength of the skin was defined as the amount of force in grams required to tear the skin. The percentage of wound healing efficacy was calculated as: % wound healing efficacy=(Tensile strength of scarred skin in grams/Tensile strength of healthy skin in grams)Ã—100.
