<p>A 25 mL volume of latex was suspended in a water-to-latex ratio of 1:2. The no aqueous phase was then partitioned successively with 2:1 chloroform, and the no chloroform phase partitioned 2:1 in ethyl acetate. Three fractions were obtained (aqueous, chloroform, and ethyl acetate). The aqueous fraction concentrated by lyophilization in small volumes of 5-10 ml in a 50 ml flask to optimize the process. The chloroform and ethyl acetate solvent elimination was carried under reduced pressure by rotavapor at 30-35Â°C. In addition, we used whole lyophilized latex, the dried powder was used to prepare 5% mixture in glycerin for experimental testing in mice to screen for wound healing activity. All extracts with wound healing activity were prepared further at 1% and 5% dilutions in carboxymethylcellulose and retested in the same murine model.</p>
