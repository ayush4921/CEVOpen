<p>This result was similar with previous studies, as follows: Kareru et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported characteristic infrared absorbance of phyto-based saponins of the hydroxyl group (OH) ranging from 3429 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 3316 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Carbon–hydrogen (C-H) absorption ranged from 2931 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 2931 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and oligosaccharide linkage absorptions to sapogenins (C-O-C) were at 1074 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and between 1045 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 1046 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The study of Almutari and Ali [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported that saponins showed characteristic infrared absorbance of the hydroxyl group (OH) in soap nut extract, at 3407 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the aqueous extract, 3419 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the 95% ethanol extract, and from 3525 to 3281 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the standard Quillaja saponin. The results of
