<p>Total saponin content showed significant variations within the plant samples and ranged between 0.33–1.55 and 0.52–3.26 mg Diosgenin Equivalents (DE)/g extract, in crude water and crude methanol respectively. By using alcohol as the extracting solvent, 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> showed the highest amount of total saponin content (3.26 mg DE/g extract), followed by 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> (1.15 mg DE/g extract) and 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> (0.52 mg DE/g extract). In the same trend with the aqueous extracts, 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> showed the highest amount of total saponin content (1.88 mg DE/g extract), followed by 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> (0.52 mg DE/g extract) and 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> (0.33 mg DE/g extract). Notable that the detection of specific compound content in plant extract by using spectrophotometric method may cause an overestimation of the target compound content due to interferences with other components [

 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> fruit powder consisted of saponin (8.04%) and other compounds such as alkaloids, sugars, and flavonoids. Additionally, the study of Chavan et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] revealed that fruits of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> gave saponin as high as 10−11.5% and was known as “fruit for hair” that traditionally used as ingredient in traditional shampoo. Saponins exhibit surface properties such as low surface tension and shear visco-elasticity that possess mechanisms associated with foam and emulsion stabilization [
