 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01521-f003">Figure 3</xref> indicated that crude methanolic extracts of tissues of the detergent plants as well as the callus of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> (LG callus) gave complex metabolites, while standard diosgenin gave a single band at the rate of flow (Rf) 0.84. For detection of saponins, the blue, violet, yellow, and green should be visible after derivatization at the visible light. They were best resolved at the wavelength UV 366 nm after derivatization [

 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>, as shown in
