<p>The essential oils extracted were separately analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (Agilent 6890 GC, coupled to an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometric detector). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was combined with a chromatography column HP-5.5% phenylmethylsiloxane, with 30 m length, 0.32 mm film thickness, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m internal diameter. The injection port was held at 230°C, while the interface was at 280°C. The temperature was set from 50°C to 280°C at 10°C per minute, using helium as the carrier gas.
