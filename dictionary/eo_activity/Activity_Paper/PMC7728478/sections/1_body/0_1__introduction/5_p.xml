<p>Various conventional methods such as hydrodistillation, steam distillation, and cold pressing have been used for essential oil extraction in aromatic plants. However, the use of these methods has been disputable for successive determination of essential oil composition because the long extraction times at high temperatures may cause changes in the essential oil composition or degradation of unsaturated or esterified compounds and the loss of highly volatile compounds [
