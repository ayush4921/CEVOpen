<p>The major constituents observed in the essential oil extracted by the SFME method include 
 <italic>a</italic>-pinene (6%), D-limonene (11.27%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (9.09%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene (6.33%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-mycene (8.49%), caryophyllene (5.96%), and camphene (4.28%). However, in the hydrodistillation method, the oil was majorly composed of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (4.41%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (10.68%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (6.30%), germacrene-D (5.09%), humulene (5.55%), and 
 <italic>a</italic>-elemene (6.18%). This is in correlation with the findings of Mwangi et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Chagonda et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in their observations that sabinene, 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene, myrcene, germacrene-D, limonene, (Z)-
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene are major constituents in 
 <italic>H. arborescen</italic>s leaves. The absence of sabinene and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene in this study could be as a result of the difference in their geographic areas or some biotic and biotic factors in the environment [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is interesting to note that 22 compounds were unique to only the hydrodistillation method and 17 were distinctive to the SFME methods, while 13 were common to both methods. This buttresses the point that the chemical composition of essential oils is dependent on the extraction methods [
