<p>The antipyretic effect of chloroform extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) isolated from the title plant was evaluated using a standard procedure (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Muhammad et al., 2012</xref>). Animals were distributed into various groups (
 <italic>n = 6</italic>). All groups of animals were subjected to fasting and allowed free access to drinking water. Among the divided groups, Group I received saline (control), Group II received the standard drug (Paracetamol), while the remaining groups (III–VII) received the fraction at different doses 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) at 2.5, at 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg. The normal temperature was noted with the help of a numerical thermometer, and then pyrexia was induced in all groups of animals by introducing aqueous suspension (20%) of Brewer’s yeast (10 ml/kg, s.c.). After 24 h, the rectal temperature was noted and groups (III–VII) were administered with the above doses. After drug administration, the rectal temperature was once more noted periodically at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h of drug administration. The percent effect was calculated using our previous formula (
