 <italic>In vivo</italic> traction test, chimney test, and inclined plane screening test are the most widely used tools for evaluation of muscle relaxant activity (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2014</xref>). Results of the current finding indicated a strong potential of title plant fraction and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) for muscle relaxation. The muscle relaxation effect of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) isolated from the title plant is displayed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">

 </xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>. The tested fraction and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited marked muscle relaxation in several animal models such as traction test, chimney test, and inclined plane model. Muscle relaxation effect of the extract and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was assessed in several muscle relaxant paradigms including traction test, chimney test, and inclined plan model. In these models, the muscle relaxant efficiency was assessed after 30, 60, and 90 min of treatment of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>). Significant activity was observed after 60 min of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) administration. In all tested model the maximum muscle relaxation was noted at a higher dose. It is concluded that chloroform extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited promising muscle relaxation effects in various 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protocols. The hypodermic injection of brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia by eventually increasing the synthesis of prostaglandin, and this method is considered the most important 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis test for the evaluation of antipyretic activity (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bertram, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2014</xref>). Yeast-induced pyrexia is known as none pathogenic fever, the etiology of which is the making of prostaglandin (PG). Inhibition of PG synthesis may be the potential mechanism of antipyretic potency; that of paracetamol the inhibition of prostaglandin can be attained by blocking the cyclooxygenase enzyme effect (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barkatullah et al., 2016</xref>). The promising antipyretic effect of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) is associated with numerous mediators based on pyrexia, mainly prostaglandins (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barkatullah et al., 2016</xref>). The intraperitoneal administration of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) remarkably attenuated the rectal temperature of yeast-induced febrile mice. Therefore, it can be concluded that chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) interface with the synthesis/release of PG at any stage. We recommend chloroform extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) to researchers for further detailed and careful studies as potential plants for the controlling of various diseases. The promising gastrointestinal motility, muscle relaxation, antipyretic effects of chloroform fractions and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) provide a strong scientific background to the traditional uses of 
 <italic>Datura metel</italic> in the treatment of fever and muscle relaxation.
