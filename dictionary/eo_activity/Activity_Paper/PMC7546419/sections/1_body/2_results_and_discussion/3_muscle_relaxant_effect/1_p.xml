<p>In both muscle relaxant testing paradigms, the chloroform fraction and tested daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) demonstrated a significant muscle relaxant effect (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Tables 1</bold>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
  <bold>2</bold>
 </xref>). Dose- and time-dependent effects were noticed. The effect of chloroform fraction was 49.32% in both tested experimental paradigms. The muscle coordination activity of daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was greater than that of chloroform fraction. The isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) also demonstrated a significant dose- and time-dependent effect. However, the effect of daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was highly significant from the start of the experiment as compared to the chloroform fraction.
