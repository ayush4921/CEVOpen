 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited excellent movement of the charcoal meal at a dose of 20 mg/kg. The normal saline was used as a positive control. The tested fraction attenuated the movement of charcoal 60% as compared to normal saline, and the positive control demonstrated 24% motility (

 <bold>1</bold>) at a dose of 200 and 20 mg/kg significantly reduce the GIT motility (
