<p id="p0025">For phytochemical and antioxidant activity analyses, we used leaves of 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> as these parts are used in food and/or traditional medicine preparations. Fresh healthy leaves of 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic> (from three different randomly selected mature wild grown plants) were collected in separate polyethylene bags from around Haramaya University, eastern Ethiopia. Similarly, fresh leaves of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> were collected from the same area from plants grown in individual's garden. On the other hand, seeds collected from three randomly selected local spice seed vending shops (in Harar city) were used for the same purpose in the case of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> and 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> as seeds are the parts consumed by local Ethiopians. The plant specimens were identified by comparing with preserved specimens and authenticated by botanist at Haramaya University Herbarium.
