<p id="p0060">Nitric oxide (NO) generated from sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in aqueous solution at physiological pH was estimated by the use of Griess reaction (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 1982</xref>). The reaction mixture (3 mL) containing SNP (10 mM, 2 mL), phosphate buffer saline (0.5 mL, pH 7.4) and the extracts (0.5mL) at different concentrations (10–1000 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were incubated at 25 °C for 150min. After incubation, 0.5 mL of the incubated solution containing nitrite was pipetted and mixed with 1 mL of sulfanilic acid reagent (0.33% in 20% glacial acetic acid) and allowed to stand for 5 min for completing diazotization. Then, 1 mL of N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride was added, mixed and allowed to stand at 25 °C for 30 min. The absorbance of pink colored chromophore formed during diazotization was measured at 540 nm. Butyl Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) and catechin were used for comparison. The NO scavenging activity of the extract was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration), that is, the concentration of the extract at which NO radicals were quenched by 50%.
