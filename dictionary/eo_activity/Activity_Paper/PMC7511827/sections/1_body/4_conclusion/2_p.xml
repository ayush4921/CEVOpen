<p id="p0120">In the present study, we focused on total phenolic, total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of crude extracts from selected Ethiopian spices. Generally, the results of this study showed that all the tested spices have antioxidant property with their radical scavenging and reducing power. In this study, high to moderate positive correlations were observed between the total phenolic contents and antioxidant properties in different 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant assays. In all of the employed assays, a varying antioxidant activity was found among the spices studied, and 
 <italic>L.Â adoensis</italic> demonstrated better activity than the rest of the spices, suggesting variation in antioxidant property among the spices emanated from the difference in the amount of total phenolic contents. As these spices are promising sources of natural antioxidant agents, further studies on isolation and characterization of the active antioxidant phenolic compounds should be carried out.
