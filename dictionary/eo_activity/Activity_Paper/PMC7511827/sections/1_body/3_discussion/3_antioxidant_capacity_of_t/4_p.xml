<p id="p0115">Nitric oxide (NO∗) is a reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which can be changed to stronger oxidant, peroxynitrite, upon reaction with superoxide anion radical (O

In this study, both the methanolic and aqueous extracts of the tested spices significantly inhibited the formation of potent RNS when compared with the control (solution without extracts) that had 0% inhibition. Percent inhibitions of the spices increased with increasing extract concentrations, but significantly lower than the standard antioxidants (BHT and catechin). Based on the methanolic extracts, RNS inhibition activities of the tested spices were in the order of

 <italic>T. ammi &gt; T. schimperi &gt; N. sativa</italic>. On the other hand, RNS inhibition activity of
