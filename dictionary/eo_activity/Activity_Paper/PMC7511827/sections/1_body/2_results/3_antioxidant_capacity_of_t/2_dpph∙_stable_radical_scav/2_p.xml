<p id="p0080">With regard to DPPH stable radical quenching activity of the methanol and aqueous extracts of different spices, a concentration dependent radical scavenging ability towards DPPH was observed. There was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 4.577) difference between antioxidant sources in DPPH scavenging potential at each concentration level examined. Some of the spices were on a par with standard antioxidant compounds, that is, BHT and AA (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A and B). There was significant difference (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 6, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 336.284) between extract concentrations in terms of DPPH radical scavenging potential. Extraction solvent used to get the extracts had also significantly impacted (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001, df = 1, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 65.212) DPPH stable radical quenching activity. DPPH radical scavenging potentials of most spices' methanolic extracts were superior to aqueous extracts (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A and B). The DPPH scavenging activity of methanolic extracts showed strong positive correlation (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.980, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .003) with total phenolic contents. Likewise, the correlation between DPPH scavenging activity of aqueous extracts and total phenolic contents was strong (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.945, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .016). Assessment by IC
 <sub>50</sub> values also showed significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, df = 4, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 25.041) variation between spices in their DPPH scavenging activity by their methanolic extracts with values in decreasing order of scavenging activity: 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49.2 ± 4.2 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 60.1 ± 0.4 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>P. capense</italic> (IC

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 74.4 ± 2.7 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 94.1 ± 5.6 μg/mL). Similarly, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of aqueous extracts significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, df = 4, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 64.995) varied between spices in scavenging DPPH radical in decreasing order of their potential, 
 <italic>L. adoensis</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.9±5 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 149.8 ± 3.1 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>P. capense</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 205.5 ± 34.8 μg/mL)&gt; 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 323.2 ± 5.5 μg/mL)&gt;
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 330.2 ± 1.6 μg/mL). The scavenging activity of all spices, however, found to be lower than the standard antioxidant, ascorbic acid, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 17.69 ± 6.63 μg/mL.
