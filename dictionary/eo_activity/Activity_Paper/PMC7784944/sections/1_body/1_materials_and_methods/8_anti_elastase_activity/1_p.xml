<p>The elastase inhibition assay was a method modified by Panjapa and Bungorn.[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Elastase 2 Units/mL dissolved in 1 M Tris-HCL buffer (pH 8) then incubated at 37°C for 10 min and the substrate AAAPVN was also dissolved in buffer at 1.6 mM. Briefly, the mixture of 40 μL test extracts (mg/mL) and 20 μL enzyme solutions was incubated for 10 min; therefore, add substrate solution 540 μL. Using EGCG as standard, the absorbance was immediately determined at 410 nm at time interval of 0 and 5 min. In the end, the elastase inhibitory effect of test extracts was expressed by the following Eq. (2).
