<p>The phytochemical constituent present in the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>,

 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry equipped with HP5MS capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The 2 μL of sample volume for injection. In the assay conditions, carrier gas was used ultra-high purity helium and flow rate 1.2 mL/min, split ratio 20:1, thus the inlet temperature at 250°C; consequently, MS programs scanned a quality range of 40–550 amu, solvent delay 3 min, transfer line 280°C.[
