<p>The anti-elastase activity assay performed by taking EGCG as a standard, showed that 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> with the great elastase inhibition of these plants that percentage of 12.45 ± 0.44. 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> also presented anti-elastase activity with a percentage of 6.67 ± 0.15 and 1.29 ± 0.91, respectively. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. However, their inhibitions were lower than the standard EGCG, with the percentage of 95.89 ± 0.22. Elastin is a 2%–4% insoluble fiber protein found in the dermis matrix, which plays an important role in skin elasticity. In contrast, it is often degraded by elastase enzyme, which can be hydrolyzed on the peripheral proteins and structures in connective tissues.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although, the experimental results show a low elastase inhibition rate (12.45 ± 0.44 mg/mL) when compared to the standard. However, there are still observations that medicinal plants are lower price than synthetic chemicals sold in the market. It also gives a feeling of safety for customers because it is a natural ingredient. Therefore, the results suggested that 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> can be used as a raw material to resist the enzyme elastase but may need to be used at higher concentrations for improved qualifications.
