<p>Endo et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] investigated the antitoxoplasma effect of the 
 <italic>Quercus crispula Blume</italic> outer bark. The authors identified three pentacyclic triterpenoids, namely, 29-norlupane-3,20-dione, oleanolic acid acetate, and ursolic acid acetate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) and concluded that these compounds exhibited notable activities against the 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasite. Using 
 <italic>HRESIMS</italic> and 
 <italic>1D/2D</italic> NMR experiments, Gammacurta et al. [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] screened EtOAc extracts from the 
 <italic>Quercus petraea</italic> heartwood for phytochemical investigations and isolated eight new triterpenoids (1−8) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>) and two known functionalized triterpenoids. Posteriorly, Perez et al. [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] in their study, identified 12 new triterpenoids, 1−12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>), and five known oleanane types which showed cytotoxicity activity against cancer cells (PC3 and MCF-7) and lymphocytes.
