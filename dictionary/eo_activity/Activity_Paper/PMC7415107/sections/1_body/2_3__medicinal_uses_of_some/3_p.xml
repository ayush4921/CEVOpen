<p>The fruit (acorn) of oak species is a rich source of energy, containing high amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, lipids, and sterols. The earliest evidence of acorns as a foodstuff was dated to the late Mesolithic era and found in Western Europe. In the North American West Coast, acorns made up more than half of the diet of native peoples [

 <italic>Quercus humilis Mill</italic> are mainly consumed roasted, raw, or as an ingredient for making coffee only in particular areas [

 <italic>Q. ilex</italic> subsp. locally known as kiskurras were used raw, boiled, roasted, like coffee, or transformed into flour. In addition, its flour was mixed with cereal grain flour to make bread [

 <italic>Quercus cerris</italic> seeds are widely used for bread production [
