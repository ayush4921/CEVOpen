<p>Several studies have confirmed the cytotoxic and anticancer activity of a wide variety of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species extracts, against various cancer cell lines. The MeOH and water extracts of the barks of 
 <italic>Quercus cerris</italic> var. 
 <italic>cerris, Quercus macranthera</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>syspirensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Quercus aucheri</italic> were subjected to the evaluation of their cytotoxicity against the Hep-2 human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cell line. The results demonstrated that aqueous and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Q. macranthera</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>syspirensis</italic> showed the strongest cytotoxicity against the tested cell line, with IC50 values 165.291 ug/ml and 273.771 ug/ml, respectively [

 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> has been studied for its cytotoxicity by the MTT assay in various concentrations (250, 500, and 1000 mg/mL). The results indicated that the treatment inhibited cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner [
