<p>The docking studies of the ligands to protein active sites were performed by an advanced molecular docking program Glide module of Schrodinger suite 2019 Maestro-12.2 version for determining the binding affinities of the compounds. The designed analogues were docked towards the COVID-19 (PDB ID: 5R82) in order to ascertain their inhibitory activity. The analogues show a best fit RMSD value of 0.2. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it is clearly demonstrated that Compound 
 <bold>A38</bold> has the highest G-score (−7.83) when compared to all the standard compounds which are proposed for COVID-19 treatment such as ritonavir (−7.48), lopinavir (−6.94), nelfinavir (−5.93), hydroxychloroquine (−5.47) and mataquine (−5.37). Compounds 
 <bold>A38</bold>, 
 <bold>A13</bold>, 
 <bold>A23</bold>, 
 <bold>A18</bold>, 
 <bold>A7</bold>, 
 <bold>A48</bold>, 
 <bold>A46</bold>, 
 <bold>A32</bold>, 
 <bold>A20</bold>, 
 <bold>A1</bold>, 
 <bold>A47</bold> and 
 <bold>A36</bold> are significantly active against COVID-19 with Glide score more than −5.5 when compared to currently used drug hydroxychloroquine (−5.47) and mataquine (−5.37). The above compounds have good affinity to the receptor due to more lipophilic character and hydrogen bonding.
