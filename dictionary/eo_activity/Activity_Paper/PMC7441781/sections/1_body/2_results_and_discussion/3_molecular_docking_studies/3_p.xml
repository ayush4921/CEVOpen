<p>The docking results of the compounds exhibited similar mode of interactions with COVID-19 and the binding pocket of the residues between GLN19 and GLN189. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Almost all Compounds 
 <bold>A1–A48</bold> with COVID-19 (PDB ID: 5R82) are docked in the same binding pocket. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2a</xref>, the amino acid residues GLN19, THR24, THR25, THR26, SER46, HIE41, ASN142, HIE164 and GLN189 are making polar region and the amino acids LEU27, MET49 and MET165 are making hydrophobic interaction with the ligand. The hydroxyl group of the phenyl ring is interacted by hydrogen bonding with ASN 119. The Glide scores are mainly increased due to the lipophilic evidence of the aromatic moieties.
