<p>From the results of MM-GB/SA studies, the Δ
 <italic>G</italic> bind values were observed in the range of −26.01 (cpdA35) to −63.24 kcal/mol (cpdA14) for significantly active compounds and also dGvdw values, dG lipophilic values and the energies are positively contributing towards total binding energy. The stability of docking complex will be predicted by MMGBSA scoring function. The Glide score and MM-GBSA free energy are obtained by the docking of ligands into the coupling pocket, which are more stable.
