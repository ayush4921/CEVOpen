<p>The primary bioactive naturally occurring compounds identified in 
 <italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic> and associated species have been scanned for their antiviral activities against HCoV-OC43 (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). These compounds were cepharanthine, tetrandrine, and fangchinoline, and all of them exhibited antiviral activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.83 ± 0.07, 0.33 ± 0.03, and 1.01 ± 0.07, respectively (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The ability of these compounds to inhibit viral-induced apoptosis might be attributed to their potential to suppress the virus-induced host response, virus replication, and viral S protein and nucleocapsid protein (N protein) expression. Moreover, tetrandrine can improve the host response induced by the virus by activating the p38 MAPK pathway in MRC-5 cells.
