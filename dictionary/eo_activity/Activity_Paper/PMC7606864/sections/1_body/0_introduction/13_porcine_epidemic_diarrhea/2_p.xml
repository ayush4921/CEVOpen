<p>In general, several studies have emphasized that naturally existing substances active against animal coronavirus strains (e.g., quercetin, griffithsin) are also active against human coronaviruses. This confirms the possibility of using natural-derived substances with recognized antiviral activity to identify drugs for the treatment of animal coronavirus strains of economic importance, such as PEDV. However, it is of concern to test multiple strains of coronavirus when searching for the antiviral potential of phytochemicals and to determine their precise mechanism of effect to develop effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
