<p>Infections of animal coronaviruses have attracted veterinary attention for nearly a century. However, in the last two decades, the role of animals in generating coronaviruses has been highlighted since the emergence of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 diseases, which had a zoonotic origin. Hence, animal coronaviruses became important models for studying how this large family of viruses evolves, generating strains with different biological characteristics. Efforts of veterinary scientists to develop effective anti-coronavirus treatments or vaccines against well-known animal coronaviruses, using herbs and/or Western remedies, contribute to the development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. Plants are one of the medicinal active compound sources that have been broadly used as treatments for several diseases caused by microbes (

Moreover, purified natural products and traditional herbal medicines may guide the development of more effective substances based on their structure and desired activities. There are many plant bioactive substances cited to have activities as an antifungal (

The naturally occurring compounds that have been recognized to have antiviral activity can be used as a starting point to find probable bioactive substance candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking can be employed to predict how the receptor protein interacts with bioactive compounds (ligands) (

This review focuses on introducing available information on phytogenic compounds or extracts that may have therapeutic potential and demonstrate antiviral capabilities to inhibit coronaviruses, hoping to help in suggesting a naturally based drug for SARS-CoV-2.
