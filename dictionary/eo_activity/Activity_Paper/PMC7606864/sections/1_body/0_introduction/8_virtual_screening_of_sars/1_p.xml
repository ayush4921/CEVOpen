<p>Due to the limited time, since the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies conducted on SARS-CoV-2 are minimal; however, several computer modeling studies for screening purposes are available (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Despite the difficulty of obtaining consistent output through various modeling approaches, computer modeling nonetheless provides the opportunity to compare the relative binding affinity of a molecular bank concerning the intended receptor (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Computer modeling may also be of specific value due to its speed and versatility. This precipitates the prospect of finding a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 instead of relying on the conventional physical selection of large banks for bioactivity of plant extracts or phytochemicals. This consumes a long time and high costs (
