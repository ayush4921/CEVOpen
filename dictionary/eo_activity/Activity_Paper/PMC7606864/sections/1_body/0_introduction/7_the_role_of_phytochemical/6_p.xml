<p>Limited studies have evaluated the potential of some plant-derived compounds for inhibiting M
 <sup>pro</sup> and S protein of SARS-CoV-2 using the molecular docking method. These studies are essential in facilitating subsequent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations either in clinical trials on humans or in animal models. Hesperidin, the principal flavanone glycoside in the citrus peel, has been cited to be better than nelfinavir (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) with a docking ratio of S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> ranging from −8.3 to −13.51 and −9.6 to −10.4, respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Moreover, Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) revealed that the best hesperidin position against SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was −10.1. Also, the active compounds of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. indica</italic>, namely, cannabinoids, recorded a docking score against S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> of −8 and −10.2, respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Cannabinoids have been described as effective anti-inflammatory (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and anti-herpes simplex virus agents (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).
