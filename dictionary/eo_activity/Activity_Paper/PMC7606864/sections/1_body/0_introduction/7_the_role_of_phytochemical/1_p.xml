<p>It is of importance to screen the potential of phytogenic compounds to participate in finding substance candidates, which are able to prevent viral infections (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This rule is beneficial because it acts as a basis for the prediction of a high probability of failure or success of one substance with specific biological or pharmacological activity to be developed as a drug. This rule also suggests that if a compound shows two or more range-of-five (RO5) violations, then the substances show low solubility or permeability (
