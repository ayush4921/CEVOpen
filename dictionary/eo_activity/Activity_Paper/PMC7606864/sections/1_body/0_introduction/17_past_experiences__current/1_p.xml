<p>The current review presents an overview of the present knowledge and existing advances related to herbal plants and natural phytochemicals as potential agents against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although several drugs, vitamins, minerals, and immune-stimulators are in full use to reduce the mortalities and provide appropriate medical care for the infected persons, the search for active and specific therapeutic agents is required as soon as possible. Furthermore, several agencies, companies, and research institutes, as well as different health organizations and WHO, are on the way to find and develop a vaccine against COVID-19. Currently, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous investigations have been tried by scientists to find active compounds from natural sources such as plants that could inhibit and/or stop the virus replication. However, the strategy of control, prevention, and eradication of the infection of COVID-19 needs collaboration to effectively apply social distancing and precautions to reduce or stop the further spread of COVID-19. Control of the COVID-19 outbreak and future epidemics requires global efforts among clinicians, immunologists, nutritionists, researchers, veterinarians, pharmacists. Also, public awareness should be focused on the role of nutrition, medicines, spices, herbs, and natural phytochemicals, enhancing the immune system and thus health. In addition, recent published trials by Ulasli et al. (
