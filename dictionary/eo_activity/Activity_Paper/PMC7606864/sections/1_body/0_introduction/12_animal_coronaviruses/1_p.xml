<p>A broad spectrum of livestock and domestic animals suffers from severe morbidity and mortality caused by many strains of animal coronavirus, leading to a sizeable economic demise around the world (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Coronaviruses are considered by their ability to adapt and rapidly mutate in addition to their genomic diversity, and these characteristics represent a unique challenge for the development of new antivirals. Therefore, it is important to explore alternative ways to control these viruses that can be effective across many or all serotypes. Several of the natural plant-derived substances have shown high antiviral activity against several animal coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) through one or more of these mechanisms: (1) stimulation of the immune response of the host (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>), (2) the direct inhibition of some viral parts such as spike proteins or proteases as abovementioned in the method of antiviral impacts of silvestrol and griffithsin (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>), and (3) host-targeting forming antiviral substances, thus blocking the virus entry to the host's cell, for example, inhibition of the clathrin-based endocytosis pathway by extracts of
