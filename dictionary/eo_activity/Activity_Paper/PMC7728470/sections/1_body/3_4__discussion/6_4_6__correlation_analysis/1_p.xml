<p>Regarding the relationships between TPC and TFC and antioxidant activities, the studied parameters were significantly correlated, as shown by Pearson's correlation matrix in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The highly significant positive (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.947, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) correlation between TPC and TFC observed in the present study was expected because flavonoids can be classified as a group of phenolic compounds. The TPC in the extracts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> exhibited a significantly high negative correlation (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in the DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assays but exhibited a low negative correlation with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained in the FRAP assay (
 <italic>R</italic> = –0.586, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A similar trend was observed with TFC and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in the applied assays. These results indicate that increases in the TPC and TFC decrease the IC
 <sub>50</sub> or EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, resulting in high antioxidant activity. The present findings are in agreement with previous reports that indicate that TPC and TFC are responsible for high antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Significant positive correlations were also detected between the antioxidant assays, which indicates good agreement between the antioxidant capacities obtained using these assays. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in the DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assays and the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value from the FRAP assay along with the comparison of correlation coefficients suggest that TPC and TFC both contribute similarly to the observed antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts.
