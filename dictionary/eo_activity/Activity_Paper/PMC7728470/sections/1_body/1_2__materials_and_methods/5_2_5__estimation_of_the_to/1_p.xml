<p>TFC was estimated using an aluminum chloride assay, described by Ordoñez et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, 2 mL of the plant extracts (0.1 mg/mL in methanol) in a test tube was mixed with 2 mL of a 2% methanolic aluminum chloride solution. The test tube was incubated at 30°C for 60 min to allow for color development. Upon completion, the absorbance at 415 nm was measured. A range of quercetin standards (0.01–0.1 mg/mL in methanol) were prepared to produce the calibration curve, which was analyzed in the same manner as the plant extracts. The TFC was calculated using the regression equation derived from the quercetin standard curve. The results are expressed as mg QE/g dry weight of the plant extracts.
