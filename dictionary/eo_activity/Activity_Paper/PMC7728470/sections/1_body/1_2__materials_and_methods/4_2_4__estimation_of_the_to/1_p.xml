<p>The Folin–Ciocalteu method was applied as previously described [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to determine the TPC in each plant extract. Then, 2.5 mL of 0.2 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added to 0.5 mL of the plant extracts (0.1 mg/mL in methanol), mixed for 5 min, and then 2.0 mL of a 7.5% aqueous sodium carbonate solution was added. The reactants were then incubated at 30°C for 90 min to allow for color development. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm on a JASCO V-530 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). This procedure was repeated for the methanolic solutions of gallic acid standards (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL) in order to prepare a calibration curve. The TPC was calculated using the regression equation deriving from the standard curve. The results are expressed as mg GAE/g dry weight of the plant extracts.
