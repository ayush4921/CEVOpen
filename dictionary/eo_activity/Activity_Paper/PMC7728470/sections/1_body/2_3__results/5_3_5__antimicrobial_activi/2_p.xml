<p>Based on the broth microdilution assays, the Gram-positive bacterium (i.e., 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>) was the most susceptible microorganism, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against the aqueous methanol extract of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic>. The Ap-AME extract also showed appreciable activity with MICs of 512 and 1024 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against the growth of 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, respectively.
