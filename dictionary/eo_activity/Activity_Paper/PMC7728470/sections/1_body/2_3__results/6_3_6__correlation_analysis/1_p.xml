<p>Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlations between TPC and TFC and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> or EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the antioxidant assays as well as between the assays. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table"> Table 2</xref> shows the correlation coefficients (
 <italic>R</italic>) obtained between TPC and TFC and the antioxidant capacities, and their linear correlations are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. A strong significantly positive (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.947, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) correlation between TPC and TFC was observed. Significant positive correlations were found between the antioxidant assays. The lowest correlation was found between the FRAP and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assays (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.800, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Pearson's correlation coefficient between the TPC and the antioxidant capacities revealed that TPC exhibited high negative correlations with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.940, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and DPPH (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.817, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) assays and a medium correlation with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained in the FRAP assay (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.586, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the TFC exhibited a negative and high correlation with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.969, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and DPPH (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.881, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) assays, though it also had a high negative correlation (
 <italic>R</italic> = −0.747, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained from the FRAP assay.
