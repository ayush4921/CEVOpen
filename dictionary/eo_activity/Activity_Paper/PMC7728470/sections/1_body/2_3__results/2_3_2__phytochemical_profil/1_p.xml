<p>Qualitative screening of the phytochemical constituents of the aqueous ethanol extracts from the aerial and root parts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> revealed most of the screened phytochemicals in different abundances. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that the root extract contained significant amounts of alkaloids, phenols, and flavonoids, whereas the extracts of the aerial parts exhibited glycosides and triterpenoids in abundance. The presence of anthraquinones was not detected in either the aerial parts or the root extracts.
