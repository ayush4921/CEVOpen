<p>The present study demonstrated that 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts exert antimicrobial activity against various human pathogens and indicate that it might be valuable in treating infectious diseases caused by microorganisms. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts were found to contain a high amount of total phenolic and total flavonoids. Likewise, the extracts revealed significant antioxidant activities against various tests: DPPH, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2,</sub>, and FRAP. In general, the results prove the effectiveness of the plant for its potent antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Accordingly, the positive values of the plant regarding its application in traditional medicine have been confirmed. The present findings are expected to be equally beneficial to everyone dealing with medicinal plant benefits across the world. However, further studies, including in vitro and in vivo investigations, are needed to confirm their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, identify and isolate the active compounds, and elucidate their pharmacological properties. Consequently, further studies are being carried out by the authors to isolate the flavonoid compounds of these extracts and to test their effectiveness as anticancer agents.
