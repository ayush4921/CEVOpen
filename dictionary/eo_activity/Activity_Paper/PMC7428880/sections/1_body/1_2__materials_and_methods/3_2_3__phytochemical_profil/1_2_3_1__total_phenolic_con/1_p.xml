<p>Total phenol was determined using Folin-Ciocalteau's reagent by the method described by [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with slight modifications to the concentration. A 0.5 mL aliquot of the different extracts (1 mg sample/mL in methanol) and the gallic acid standard was mixed with 2.5 mL of 10% (v/v) Folin-Ciocalteau's reagent and incubated for five minutes. To the solution, 2 mL of 7.5% (w/v) anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) was added. The mixtures were incubated at 40°C for 30 minutes (LABOTEC-South Africa). Spectrophotometric measurement of absorbance was taken at 765 nm (Hewlett Packard VR-3000 PC spectrophotometer). Total phenolic (TP) content (mg GAE/g) was derived from the standard curve equation: 
 <italic>y</italic> = 8.3093
 <italic>x</italic> − 0.0023, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9992. This was expressed from the formula 
 <italic>y</italic> = 
 <italic>CV</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic>, where 
 <italic>C</italic> is the total content of phenolic compounds in plant extract in mg GAE/g, 
 <italic>V</italic> is the volume of plant extract used in the assay in mL, 
 <italic>m</italic> is the mass of extract used in the assay in g, and 
 <italic>y</italic> is the concentration obtained from the standard curve in mg/mL.
