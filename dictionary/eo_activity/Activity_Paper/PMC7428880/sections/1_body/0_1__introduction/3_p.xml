<p>Banana and plantain, members of the Musaceae family (
 <italic>Musa</italic> spp.), are important food crops that supply energy-based carbohydrates, including a wide spectrum of other nutritive components in human nutrition [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They are tropical herbaceous plants that grow up to heights reaching 9 metres, and are produced largely in the Asian, African, and South American regions; sweet fruits in the case of banana and for plantain are popularly cooked for food [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These plants have been implicated in agricultural and industrial uses, which make them valuable to the bioeconomy [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Banana and plantain fruits possess very thick coverings known as the peels; however, they have low dietary incorporation status as they constitute waste because they are usually disposed during the consumption of the fruit pulp. It is with the foregoing that this study has been designed to evaluate polyphenolic constituents and biological activity of extracts across the compartments (flesh, peel, and boiled peel extract) of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits, with an aim to establish the phytomedicinal viability of the often neglected peel and boiled peel extract component. In so doing, this study seeks to project the peels of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> as potential functional foods with medicinal, therapeutic, and nutritional value. With the foregoing, this study has been designed for the evaluation of the pharmacological potential in the extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits, which will further validate the dietary medicinal value of the soft flesh and particularly the less utilised peels of the fruits.
