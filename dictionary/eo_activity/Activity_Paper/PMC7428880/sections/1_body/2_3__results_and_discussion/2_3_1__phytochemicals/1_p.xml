 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows total phenol, proanthocyanidin, and flavonoid contents of the acetone, aqueous, and ethanol solvent extractions of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits. In 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic>, the ethanol extract of the peel contained the highest phenol (157.19 ± 4.76 mg GAE/g), while the acetone extract of the peel also contained the highest proanthocyanidin (619.39 ± 21.88 mg CE/g) and flavonoid (734.52 ± 32.55 mg QE/g) contents. Similarly, in 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic>, the acetone extract of the peel contained higher phenol (136.87 ± 5.69 mg GAE/g) and proanthocyanidin (530.06 ± 53.51 mg CE/g) contents, while the acetone extract of the flesh contained the higher flavonoid (777.35 ± 150.95 mg QE/g) content. The boiled peel extract sample of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> contained the highest phenol (97.05 ± 3.60 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (418.35 ± 427.26 mg QE/g) contents amongst the aqueous extractions, just as the boiled peel extract sample in 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> had the highest phenol (114.23 ± 4.58 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (83.58 ± 34.16 mg QE/g) contents. On the other hand, 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> acetone extracts had the highest phenol (136.87 ± 5.59 mg GAE/g) and proanthocyanidin (530.06 ± 53.51 mg CE/g) in the peel with the highest flavonoid (777.35 ± 150.95 mg QE/g) in the flesh. Summarily, polyphenolic constituent was consistently predominant in the organic (acetone and ethanol) solvent extractions of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh and peel as evidenced by the extremely low or absent proanthocyanidin levels in all the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> and for flavonoid in the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> flesh and peel and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh as well.
