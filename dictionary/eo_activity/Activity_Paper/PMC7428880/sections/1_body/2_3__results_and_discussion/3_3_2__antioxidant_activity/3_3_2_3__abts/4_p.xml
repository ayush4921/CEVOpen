 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> shows that peak activity in the plant extracts was observed in the acetone extract of 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh (&lt;0.0025 mg/mL). However, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the flesh and peel, including the peel extract of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic>, had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values above the highest concentration (0.01 mg/mL). From the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, ABTS had its peak activity in the peel extract of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> (0.03 mg/mL), followed by the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> peel (0.04 mg/mL). On the other hand, 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> had a joint peak activity in aqueous extracts of the peel and peel extract (0.04 mg/mL) (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The negative values observed in acetone and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh (DPPH and ABTS) could suggest the preoxidant activity at particular concentration levels and potent scavenging capacity as well.
