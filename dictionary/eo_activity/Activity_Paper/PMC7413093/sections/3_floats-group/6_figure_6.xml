  <title>Protein composition of HMWp.</title>
  <p>(A) Protein profile of HMWp on SDS-PAGE gel (15%). The gel was cut into 6 sections (labelled 1 to 6) and digested with trypsin before LC-MS/MS analysis. (B) Percentage distribution of HMWp proteins identified by label-free shotgun proteomic (Q-TOF LC/MS) based on 
   <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 genome database. Proteins with unknown and/or uncharacterized functions (including predicted, hypothetical and not annotated) were grouped as non-informative (54.75% of the total proteins). Proteins with less than 1.0% abundance were grouped as “Others” (3.92%).
