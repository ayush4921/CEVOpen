  <title>Sephadex G-50 fractionation of Ligno TG-K CWE</title>
  <p>A total of 150 fractions (2 mL of fraction/tube) were collected. The carbohydrate content was determined by phenol sulfuric method (absorbance at 490 nm) and protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay (absorbance at 595 nm). Using the protein calibration standards, the molecular weights of the HMW, MMW and LMW were estimated between ¿15 kDa, 5.0-14.0 kDa and ¡ 4.4 kDa, respectively. Abbreviations: HMW, high molecular weight; MMW, medium molecular weight; LMW, low molecular weight.</p>
