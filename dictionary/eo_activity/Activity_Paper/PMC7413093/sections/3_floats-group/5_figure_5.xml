  <title>The effects of HMWp on body weight and vital organs of the mice.</title>
  <p>(A) Body weight change in control and HMWp-treated mice. Body weight is shown as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). Data were analyzed using SPSS, independent samples 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
   <sup>∗</sup> indicates significant difference in the body weight between control and treatment groups (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). (B) Histological sections of vital organs of control and HMWp-treated mice. Microscopy examination of the hematoxylin and eosin stained tissues showed no significant histopathological abnormalities in the organs (heart, lung, spleen, kidney and liver) of control and treated rats. Abbreviations: AS, alveolar space; PT, portal tract; H, hepatocyte; WP, white pulp; RP, red pulp; G, glomerulus; T, tubule. (100 × magnification).
