  <title>Effects of HMWp in suppression of MCF7 tumor xenografted in NCr nude mice.</title>
  <p>(A) Percentage change of the MCF7 tumor volume on the NCr nude mice treated with HMWp (
   <italic>i.p.</italic>) (5 µg/g BW/200 µL, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) or PBS (control, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) alternate-day for 21 days. Tumor volume was measured weekly and the percentage change of tumor volume was calculated by comparing to volume on day 1 (assigned as 100%). Tumors harvested at the end of treatment (day 22): (B) control mice treated with PBS and (C) HMWp-treated mice. (D) Average weight of tumors harvested from control and treated mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). * indicates significant difference between the control and treated group (SPSS, independent samples 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
