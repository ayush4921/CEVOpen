<p>The CWE exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity on MCF7 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 28.93 ± 7.74 µg/mL, which is approximately 6-fold lower than the non-tumorigenic breast 184B5 cells, (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 183.67 ± 34.70 µg/mL). Although CWE showed significant cytotoxicity on lung cancer A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 70.67 ± 16.17 µg/mL) and prostate cancer PC3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 95.00 ± 7.07 µg/mL) cells, it was also cytotoxic to the non-tumorigenic lung NL20 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 71.83 ± 5.13 µg/mL) and prostate RWPE1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.63 ± 0.04 µg/mL) cells. Further fractionation of the CWE showed that the HMW has strongest cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells at which the IC
 <sub>50</sub>(4.23 ± 0.08 µg/mL) were at least 8-fold lower than MMW (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 34.75 ± 1.78 µg/mL). LMW did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;500 µg/mL) on MCF7 cells. The HMW showed less cytotoxicity to 184B5 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.10 ± 1.98 µg/mL). The protein (HMWp) and non-protein (HMWnp) components of HMW was subsequently separated using ammonium sulfate precipitation. The HMWp showed strong cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.17 ± 0.47 µg/mL and was about 3-fold lower than the 184B5 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.43 ± 0.60 µg/mL). No significant cytotoxic activity was observed in HMWnp on the MCF7 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;500 µg/mL).
