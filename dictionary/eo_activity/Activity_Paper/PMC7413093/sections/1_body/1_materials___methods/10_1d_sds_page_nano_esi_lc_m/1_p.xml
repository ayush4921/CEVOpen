<p>HMWp (30 µg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins bands separated on the gel were excised into 6 sections S1-S6. In-gel digestion of the proteins was carried out as described by 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al. (2015b)</xref>. Briefly, destained protein sections were subjected to reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide prior to digestion with trypsin (Pierce™ Trypsin Protease, Thermo Scientific, USA). The tryptic digested peptides were desalted and the sample (in 0.1% formic acid) was subjected to nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS using Agilent 1260 HPLC-Chip/MS Interface, coupled with Agilent 6550 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Two microliters of sample were injected into the microfluidic nanospray chip containing a 160-nl enrichment column packed with C18 (300 Å) at 4 µL/min. Analytical separation of the peptides was completed through the pre-column in-line with a 75 µm × 150 mm analytical column at 0.4 µL/min in a linear gradient from Solution A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 95% Solution B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) in 47 min including post-run of 8 min. MS/MS data acquisition parameters were as previously described in 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al. (2015b)</xref> with minor adjustments. For subsequent MS (rate: 20 spectra/s, time: 50 ms/spectrum) and MS/MS (rate: 8 spectra/s, time: 125 ms/spectrum) analyses, spectra were acquired in a MSMS mode with scan range from 200 to 3,000 m/z and 50 to 3,200 m/z, respectively. Capillary and fragmentor voltage were 1,800 V and 175 V, respectively, with drying gas flow rate of 11.0 L/min at 290 ° C. MS/MS spectra were searched using Agilent Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench software packages (

 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 genome database (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2014b</xref>). The spectrum mill settings were set as follows: MH+ scan range from 100 to 3,200 Da, complete carbamidomethylation of cysteines, filter protein FDR &gt;0%, filter peptides FDR at &lt;1.0% and filter protein score by 20.0 and above. Only results with “Distinct Peptide” identification of 2 and above are considered significant.
