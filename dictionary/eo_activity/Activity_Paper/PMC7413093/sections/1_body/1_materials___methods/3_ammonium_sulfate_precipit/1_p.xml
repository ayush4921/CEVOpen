<p>Proteins in the CWE-HMW fraction were precipitated by using 100% saturation ammonium sulfate (stirring at 4 °C for 1 h). Precipitated proteins were then collected by centrifugation followed by desalting using Vivaspin
 <sup>®</sup> Centrifugal Concentrator 15R (MWCO-5 kDa) (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany). The non-protein component (supernatant) was recovered using Sephadex G-25 (fine) gel filtration chromatography by desalting.
