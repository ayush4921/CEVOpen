One of the reasons for the high mortality rate in cancer patients is the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapeutic drugs that lack target specificity, typically causing systemic toxicity and various side effects including fatigue, hair loss, infection and organ dysfunction, which leads to poor quality of life in patients. Therefore, there is a continual need to search for novel, effective and more specific therapeutic agents.
