<p>The previous study showed that blood-glucose levels increased significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) in the control group in comparison to other groups that received 3 g 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic>/l in drinking water. However, the remaining treated groups showed a significant decrease in comparison with control (

 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), reported that the drinking water of broiler chickens supplemented with different levels of 
 <italic>B. carterii </italic>powder led to a significant decrease in blood glucose concentrations, at levels 0.5, 0.75, and 1 g/l. However, 0.75 and 1 g/l water supplementation reduced the values of blood plasma concentrations of glucose. 6 weeks complementarity of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> to type 2 diabetic patients also produced a very significant decrease in fasting blood glucose and an increase in insulin level (

 <italic>B. glabra</italic> aqueous extract increased the synthesis of secretory granules in the beta-cell and led to an increase in pancreatic enzyme resulting in reduced blood-sugar level (
