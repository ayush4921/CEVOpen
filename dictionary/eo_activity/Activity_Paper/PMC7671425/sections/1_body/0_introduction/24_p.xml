<p>Several herbal medicines such as 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba </italic>can manage and improve hyperlipidemia or obesity in patients (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Numerous academic research projects performed during recent years showed that 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species would be efficient hypolipidemic agents. It has been demonstrated that the water-soluble fraction of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> reduces the levels of total cholesterol (38-48%) (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) in experimental animals, which confirms its hypolipidemic potentials. Moreover, Zutshi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed the antihyperlipidemic activities of 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> gum (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Salami gum keeps the levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride of animals within optimal ranges that would be received on diets with increased cholesterol and saturated fat (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). It was reported that AKBA inhibits NF-κB activity in atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Of course, AKBA has anti-adiposity properties, through which it can induce lipolysis in mature human adipocytes that have been observed by Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in the
 <italic> in vitro</italic> study. Moreover, this event has been followed by downregulating the expression of PPAR-g2 and losing phenotypic markers (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The study of Al-Yasiry 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) showed that 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species (3 g 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic>/l in drinking water) reduced the cholesterol level in broiler chicken. Their findings were in agreement with those of Pandey 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). In this study, they showed that the supplementation of BS gum resins extract 15 mg/100 g body wt for 90 days caused a significant decrease in serum cholesterol and increased HDL in rats. It has also been reported by Al-Daraji 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) that 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> (0.5, 0.75, and 1 g/l in drinking water) decreased significantly cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels. The results of this study suggest the probability that 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> supplementation restores β-cells function for insulin secretion, and that insulin helps to reduce serum lipid profiles (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> may have a protective effect on pancreatic β cells through its anti-oxidant action (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table1</xref>). Obesity, a chronic disease characterized by the storage of excess energy in fat cells, is a result of abnormal metabolism. Obesity is a complex issue and its causes, consequences, and management are an area of considerable debate as a widespread disease. Several studies reported 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species exhibited anti-obesity effects by lowering total cholesterols, triglycerides, free fatty acids, LDL concentrations, circulating adiponectin, food intake as well as elevating HDL (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>-
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The study performed by Tawfik showed that boswellic acid has a promising anti-aggregatory effect by reducing the enhanced HLP, oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Gomaa 
 <italic>et al.</italic> investigated that 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> extract is as effective as orlistat in preventing obesity, hyperlipidemia, steatosis, and insulin resistance. These actions may be mediated by the suppression of food intake and reducing the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and leptin resistance along with increasing adiponectin (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> extract has anti-obesity effects and can be attributed to the presence of active principles such as phenolic compounds and triterpenoids (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>-
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). In another study, 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> extract showed a suppressive effect on cumulative food intake compared to ephedrine used as a standard anorectic drug (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).
