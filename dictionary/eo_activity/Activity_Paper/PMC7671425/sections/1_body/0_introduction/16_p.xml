 <italic>et al</italic>., clinically studied patients with type 2 diabetes supplemented with extract of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> gum resin for six weeks and compared them to type 2 diabetic patients. A considerable reduction of fasting blood glucose and a decrease in insulin levels have been reported (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The researchers were satisfied with the findings, and thus developed the research and examined antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, and hepatoprotective impacts of the supplement 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> in 60 patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders. Treating diabetic patients with the extract of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> gum resin (orally, 900 mg) for six weeks led to a considerable enhancement of the levels of HDL and significant decline of cholesterol, LDL, as well as the amounts of fructosamine SGPT and SGOT. The research indicated that the administration of 900 mg of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> supplement daily is one of the healthy and efficient options for decreasing hazardous agents related to type 2 diabetes. Diabetic patients who receive 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> can keep fructosamine level, hepatic enzyme activity, and lipid profiles close to the standard levels and have a high-quality life (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Herbal formulations with 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> oleo-gum-resin as an ingredient of the supplementation led to considerable antidiabetic activities on non-insulin-dependent DM in streptozocin induced diabetic rat model.
