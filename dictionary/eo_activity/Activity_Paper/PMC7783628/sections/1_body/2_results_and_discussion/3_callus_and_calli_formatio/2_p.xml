<p id="p0050">The undifferentiated biomass accumulation of cells of parenchymatous are recognized as callus. For callus induction, the surface sterilized leaf and stem (node, internode) explants slice into minute pieces (0.5–1.0 cm) and placed on MS basal semi-solid medium supplemented with PGRs; auxins and cytokinins (2,4-D, NAA, IAA, BAP (0.5–2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>), alone and in combination, different concentrations, incubated under dark condition (5 days), then its transferred L/D (16/8 h) conditions for callus and calli induction and formations. Early callus stimulation was perceived on the wounded water hyssop leaf and stem explants surfaces after seven days of inoculated on MS medium (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The callus, calli secured from leaf, stem explants were noticed that friable, pallid with soft surfaces, and then it’s curved to compact and green after revelation to luminosity conditions. Subculture was performed on every 4th weeks subsequent to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> callus, calli maintain the culture, and with the medium has same and dissimilar MS medium composition. From leaf explants highest calli development was perceived on NAA (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) it showed (94.22%) followed via 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>; 82.43%), lowest calli formation was obtained on IBA (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>), respectively (

 <sup>−1</sup>; 71.14%) followed with NAA (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) showed (62.15%), fewest calli formation was noticed on IBA (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) showed (50.32%), respectively. from the internodes explant uppermost calli formation was obtained from 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>; 65.21%) followed in NAA showed (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>; 52.14%), lowest calli formation was secured in amalgamation of 2,4-D + BAP (2.5 mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) showed (21.45%), respectively. finally overall comparison of callus, calli induction, formation noticed from NAA (
