<p>ALT, AST, and ALP are sensitive markers of the liver, and their elevated levels are indicative of liver damage. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, no marked changes of AST, ALT, and ALP levels were detected in normal control rats and the AECe group, which confirmed the safety of AECe at a dose of 250 mg/kg. The injection of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> to the rats induced liver injury, which represented markedly elevating activities of AST, ALT, and ALP serum levels compared with the normal control group. However, the AECe treatment (250 mg/kg) induced a significant (
