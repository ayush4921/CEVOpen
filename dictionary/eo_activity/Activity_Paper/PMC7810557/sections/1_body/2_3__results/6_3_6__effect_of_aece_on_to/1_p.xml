<p>The administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> alone to the animals resulted in a marked increase in the plasma glucose, triglycerides, and VLDL levels (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively) when compared to the normal control group. The rats treated with AECe (250 mg/kg) and the standard treatment silymarin (40 mg/kg), showed a significant reduction in all of the parameters that were increased in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group. Overall, the results observed after administration of AECe at 250 mg/kg were comparable to those of silymarin at 40 mg/kg. On the other hand, no significant differences were detected in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group compared to the normal control group (
