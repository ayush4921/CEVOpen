<p>Liver injuries are induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats models. CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is a commonly used model for the investigation of hepatoprotective activity on various experimental animals [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The liver damage caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is similar to that produced by viral hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The elevated serum enzyme levels of AST, ALT, and ALP have been attributed to the damaged structural integrity of the liver because they are cytoplasmic in origin and are released into the blood after hepatic damage [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our findings showed that AST, ALT, and ALP activities were increased in rats with the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> treatment alone in comparison with the normal control group. This elevation in hepatic markers has been attributed to the cells damaged or cell membranes became leaky and they are released into the circulation [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast, a significant reduction in plasma activities of AST, ALT, and ALP was found in rats with AECe + CCl
 <sub>4</sub> in comparison with the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group. This decrease in serum levels of transaminases activities is in agreement with the commonly accepted view that transaminases activities return to normal due to the stabilization of plasma membrane, as well as repair of hepatic tissue damages caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This finding suggests that AECe protected the liver tissue from CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced injury. Besides, AECe ameliorated the excretory function of the liver, and this effect was shown by suppressing the elevation of the bilirubin (total and direct) serum level. The level of total protein was reduced due to the stabilization of the endoplasmic reticulum leading to protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When animals are treated with CCl
 <sub>4</sub>, it is metabolically activated in the hepatic cell by cytochrome P450, generating a highly reactive carbon-centered Trichloromethyl radical. This radical reacts with oxygen to form the Trichloromethyl peroxyl radical, CCl
 <sub>3</sub>OO

 </sup> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These two free radicals initiate the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and that is usually measured through its catabolite MDA [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The increase of MDA content in the liver of the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group was found in this study in good agreement with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. AECe decreased the MDA content in the liver significantly as compared to the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group. This is can be explained by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and its propagation in the liver.
