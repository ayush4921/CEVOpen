<p>Carbon tetrachloride- (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-) induced liver injury is the best-characterized animal model of xenobiotic-induced free-radical-mediated hepatotoxicity. CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is converted into two free radicals, which are trichloromethyl radical (CCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and proxy trichloromethyl radical (OOCCl
 <sub>3</sub>) by cytochrome P450 [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These free radicals are capable of initiating lipid peroxidation and liver damage [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several studies indicate that antioxidants protect the liver from oxidative damage, and they can prevent the risk of liver diseases [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, much attention has been focused on natural antioxidants. Many studies have been shown that medicinal plants are very rich in antioxidant compounds that exhibited powerful hepatoprotective activity by improving antioxidant status [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among many medicinal plants
 <italic>, Caralluma europaea</italic> (CE) is one of the medicinal species belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is widely distributed in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Spain, and Italy [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> has been traditionally used in the treatment of different diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cyst, kidney stones, and respiratory and cardiovascular disorders [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The juicy stems of 
 <italic>Caralluma europaea</italic> are consumed as food [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides, the stems of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> are orally taken with water or milk to treat diabetes. Also, the stems roasted are administered with garlic and tomato as an antidiabetic salad [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several pharmacological reports have confirmed the antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have been reported on the biological activities of extracts obtained from many species of 
 <italic>Caralluma</italic> such as hepatoprotective [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] activities. To the best of our knowledge, no work on the hepatoprotective activity of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> stems has been reported to date, which encourage us to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of stem aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> (AECe) against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatic damage in rats.
