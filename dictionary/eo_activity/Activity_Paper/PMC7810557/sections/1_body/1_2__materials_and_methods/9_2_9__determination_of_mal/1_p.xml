<p>The concentration of liver lipid peroxidation was measured through the estimation of MDA by using thiobarbituric acid (TBA) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In brief, 0.5 mL of TCA (30% w/v) was added to 0.5 mL of liver homogenate, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. 1 mL of the supernatant was added to 1 mL of TBA (0.67% w/v), and the mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. The reaction mixture was stopped in an ice-cold bath. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 535 nm. The results were expressed in nanomoles of MDA produced per gram of tissue, using the following molar extinction coefficient: 1.56 × 10
