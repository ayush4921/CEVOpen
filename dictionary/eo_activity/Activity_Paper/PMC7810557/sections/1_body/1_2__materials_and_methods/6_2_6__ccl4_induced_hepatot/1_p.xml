<p>One week after the adaptation, the animals were divided into five experimental groups of 6 animals each (♂/♀ = 1 : 3 males and 3 females), and treated as follows: the normal control received distilled water (10 mL/kg). The CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated control group (negative control) received distilled water (10 mL/kg). The AECe and AECe + CCl
 <sub>4</sub> groups received a single dose of the aqueous extract (250 mg/kg). The positive group received CCl
 <sub>4</sub> + silymarin (40 mg/kg). The animals of the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated control group, AECe + CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group, and CCl
