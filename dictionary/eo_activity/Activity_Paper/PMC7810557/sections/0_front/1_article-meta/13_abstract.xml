 <p>The present study aims to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of stem aqueous extract of 
  <italic>Caralluma europaea</italic> (AECe) on carbon tetrachloride- (CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-) induced hepatic damage in Wistar rats. The animals were daily treated with the aqueous extract of 
  <italic>C. europaea</italic> at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight for 14 days. CCl
  <sub>4</sub> was injected (1 ml/kg, 
  <italic>i.p</italic>.) two times, on the 7
  <sup>th</sup> and 14
  <sup>th</sup> days. At the end of the experimental period, all rats were anesthetized to collect blood for the assessment of biochemical parameters and then sacrificed to collect the liver for weighing. Hepatotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (total and direct), malondialdehyde (MDA), total protein (TP), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-c ), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Based on the results obtained in this study, the administration of 
  <italic>C. europaea</italic> before exposure to the administration of CCl
  <sub>4</sub> conferred favorable hepatoprotective effect in rats. The treatment with AECe (250 mg/kg) exhibits a significant hepatoprotective effect by ameliorating CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced alterations of these biochemical parameters. Hence, 
  <italic>C. europaea</italic> could be a potential medicinal herb that can be used in the future to prevent liver intoxication.
