 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> (35) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Some plants were recorded quite frequently, including 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> (23), 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> (20 articles reported), 
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> (19), 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (18), 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> (17), 
 <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> (16), and 
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> (15). The wide acceptance of these particular medicinal plants may not only be due to their efficient activity but also involve a few other factors like their large availability in markets and their possible long history of use in the traditional medicine practiced by healers, making their use more feasable than the use of plants which are difficult to harvest [
