 <italic>L. lanatonodus, L. diacanthophyllus, L. platyacanthus, L. hirtus,</italic> and

 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An acute toxicity study was performed in mice according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/OCED) guidelines 423 (Acute Oral Toxicity-Acute Toxicity Class Method) [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] with each group comprising of ten mice. The animals were orally administered a dose of 5000 mg/kg aqueous and ethanol extracts from five 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species and were observed continuously for 30 min and 4 h, intermittently for 24 h, and then once a day for the next 14 days for general behavioral change, signs of toxicity and mortality. There was no evidence of differences in physiological or behavioral responses between the normal control group and extract-treated groups and also no differences in the consumption of food and water, which implied that the five 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species are not toxic.
