<p>Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> was prepared by adding a THF solution (3 ml) of 6-morpholinopyridin-3-amine (1 eq) to a THF solution (5 ml) of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> followed by pyridine (1 eq) at 0 °C. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. After reaction completion, the mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue was purified by column chromatography using 10–40% ethyl acetate in hexane to obtain compound 
 <bold>8</bold> as yellow solid, yield 41.0%, MP: 196.8–197.3 °C.
