<p>Profiling was conducted against human cancer cells after the initial assessment of the antiproliferative activity of the selected compounds against M-NFS-60 cells suggested that this type of compounds could be possible candidates to develop novel antiproliferative chemical entities. Because cancer is not a single disease but a heterogeneous group of diseases that might originate from diverse body tissues, bioactivity screening was conducted using nine panels of cancer diseases employing the well-trusted sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay protocol.</p>
