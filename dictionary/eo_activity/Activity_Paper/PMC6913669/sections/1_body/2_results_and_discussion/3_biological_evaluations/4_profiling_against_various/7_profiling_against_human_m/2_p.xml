<p>Herein also, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, the hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was of very low efficacy against the tested nine melanoma cell lines showing no inhibition against six cell lines and very weak activity that does not exceed 6% against the remaining three cell lines. Similarly, compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> showed no significant inhibition of any of the nine melanoma cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6)</xref>. In addition, compound 
 <bold>6b</bold> did not inhibit five cell lines but inhibited UACC-62 cells by around 20% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6)</xref>. Other compounds triggered much more significant growth inhibition against melanoma cancers despite some compounds showed low growth inhibition against some melanoma cells. To illustrate, 
 <bold>6a</bold> inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells by 59.6%; 
 <bold>6c</bold> inhibited the growth of LOX IMVI by 47.6; 
 <bold>6d</bold> inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-435 and SK-MEL-28 by 67.27 and 52.39%, respectively; 
 <bold>6f</bold> inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-435 by a high value of 79.80%; and 
 <bold>6g</bold> inhibited the growth of UACC-257 by 83.27% and MALME-3M by 42.79%. Similar to the above-mentioned results against other cancers, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was the best hit among the tested compounds showing excellent activity against several cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6)</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> lethally killed MDA-MB-435 cells by 130.59% growth inhibition, inhibited the growth of UACC-62 cells by 81.16%, SK-MEL-5 cells by 71.26%, M14 cells by 67.69%, and SK-MEL-2 by 58.78%. Accordingly, compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> might serve as a leading compound for the development of potential anti-melanoma therapies.
