<p>Understanding the relationship between the observed activity and the underlying structural features of a certain series allows medicinal chemists to significantly improve the activity of this series. In our case, several conclusions can be drawn about the relation between the structural modifications and their effect on the antiproliferative activity as shall be discussed in this section. In contrast to the low activity of the hit compound 
 <bold>4</bold>, the developed lead compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> was able to inhibit the growth of multiple cancer cell lines, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>. The structural features of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> involve 3,5-dimethoxybenzamide moiety, 4-methoxyphenoxy moiety and piperidino substituent on the pyridineamino moiety. These distinct structural features might be the reason behind the observed antiproliferative activity of 
 <bold>6e</bold>. In this series, the piperidino moiety seems to be of crucial importance for a highly potent broad-spectrum antiproliferative agent. This could be inferred from the comparison of the activities of compounds 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> in which 
 <bold>6d</bold> processes a morpholino group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1)</xref>. One plausible explanation for this significant difference in the antiproliferative activity might be related to the hydrophobicity of the piperidine moiety

 <sup>,</sup>
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>. This hydrophobicity might facilitate the desolvation of 
 <bold>6e</bold> with respect to 
 <bold>6d</bold>. Additionally, enhanced binding between 
 <bold>6e</bold> and the host macromolecule might be gained from a potential entropy-driven water displacement at the binding site by the hydrophobic effect of the piperidine. In other words, the oxygen of the morpholino moiety of 
 <bold>6d</bold> might encourage an unfavourable solvated state at the pocket of the target site, while the piperidine moiety displaces the water of solvation resulting in filling a hydrophobic pocket and gaining a higher binding affinity. Despite the notion that this simple isosteric replacement of the oxygen with methylene group (
 <bold>6d</bold> vs. 
 <bold>6e</bold>) could results in drastic change in the whole molecular geometry and binding mode, the assumption that the two molecules bind the same pocket of a certain molecular target in the same binding fashion might make the solvation hypothesis plausible. In addition, the assumed higher affinity of 
 <bold>6e</bold> for the host macromolecule(s) might reflect the higher antiproliferative activity at the cellular level.
