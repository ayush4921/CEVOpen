<p>A Camag microliter syringe with a 0.22 µm syringe filter was used to filter the methanol extracts. Next, a Linomat 5 (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) was used to apply spots (5 µL) of methanol extracts (5 mg/mL) of

 <sub>254</sub>) (E Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The solvent solution was formed by toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid (70:30:1,

The plate was subsequently dipped into a polyethylene glycol 400 reagent and allowed to dry for 5 min in a cool air stream. A Camag TLC scanner at 366 nm in absorbance mode was used for the densitometric scanning. A regression equation based on a calibration curve of the KA standard (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to quantify KA concentrations.
