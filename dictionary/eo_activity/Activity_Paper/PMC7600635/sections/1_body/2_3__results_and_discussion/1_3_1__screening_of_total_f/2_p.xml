<p>Several studies have been conducted to develop efficient procedures for the large-scale industrial application of natural antioxidants. Due to higher yields, ethanol and methanol are commonly used as solvents to extract flavonoids [

 <italic>Morus alba</italic> fruits, acetone-based mixtures turned out to be more effective than methanol-based mixtures for phenolic and flavonoid extractions. In order to optimize and maximize extraction procedures, it is critical for researchers to take the food matrices and the concentration of the solvent into consideration when extracting phenolic compounds and flavonoids from herbal plants [
