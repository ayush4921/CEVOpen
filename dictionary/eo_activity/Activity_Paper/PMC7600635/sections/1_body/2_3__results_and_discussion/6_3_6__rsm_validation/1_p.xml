<p>The KA yield evaluation results were found to be within the limits of the yield checkpoint. Further validation was performed on the RSM results, and the percentage prediction error was found to be 0.789% when comparing the experiment values of the response with the anticipated values. This provided sufficient evidence to establish the validity of the generated equation and to describe the domain of applicability of the RSM model. The goodness of fit was excellent for the predicted and experiment value linear correlation plot (R
