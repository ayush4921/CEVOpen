<p id="p0200">The present study indicated that the hydroalcoholic extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Dodonaea angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhamnus prinoides</italic>, and 
 <italic>root bark of Brucea antidysentrica</italic> possess wound healing activity established by a significant rate of wound contraction and shorter epithelization period that may be due to the presence of biologically active secondary metabolites acting as either individually or collectively to bring about the overall effect. These findings provide scientific support for the folkloric repute of the leaves of 
 <italic>Dodonaea angustifolia, Rhamnus prinoides</italic>, and root bark of 
 <italic>Brucea antidysentrica</italic> as a wound-healing agent. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the authors would like to forward the following recommendations.
