<p id="p0125">The results of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity with 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction and compound 1 against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> presented strong parasite inhibition with 60.55 % of parasite inhibition rate and 2.76 μg/mL IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, followed by EtOAc fraction and MeOH extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> with 36.29 and 51.25 % of parasite inhibition rate with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.42 and 98.88 μg/mL, respectively. Chloroquine is taken as a standard with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.002 μg/mL. The result of the test proved that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> which isolated from methanol extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> is available as a new antiplasmodial agent against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain. The evaluation of antiplasmodial potential against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain is expectedly able to encounter novel therapeutic agents which are applicable harmless against 
 <italic>P. falciparum.</italic>
