<p id="p0110">The antioxidant in 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> has also observed using the ABTS scavenging test. The highest antioxidant capacity was observed in compound 
 <bold>1</bold> with 97.64 % of inhibition rate and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.34 μg/mL. The extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> showed the antioxidant capacity value of 82.61% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 18.86 μg/mL. Trolox is used as a standard with 95.97% of inhibition rate and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.15 μg/mL. Therefore, the extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> stem bark shown a mild antioxidant activity and may be a very interesting candidate for the research and development of natural, environmental and healthy antioxidant for the pharmaceutical and food industries. High phenolic content in the extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> was shown by the TPC test with 97.54 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g of extract. Flavonoid content was also observed in the extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> with 298.89 mg of quercetin equivalents (QE) per 100 g of extract. Gallic acid and quercetin were used as a standard for total phenolic and flavonoid content in the extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis.</italic> DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging of α-viniferin which is isolated from 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> extract are shown in
