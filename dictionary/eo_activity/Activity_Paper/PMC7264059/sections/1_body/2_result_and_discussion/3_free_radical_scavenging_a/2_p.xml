<p id="p0105">DPPH is a stable free radical in aqueous or methanol solution. In order to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity using the test samples, the change of the optical density of DPPH radicals was monitored [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The ability of methanol extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> to scavenge free radicals was assessed by reducing the stable DPPH radicals to the yellow colored 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine. DPPH is nitrogen centered free radical, which color changes from violet to yellow while extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> donates a proton to reduced the radicals. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed a potent antioxidant compound with 76.11% of DPPH radical scavenging capacity and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 88.92 μg/mL. Extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> also showed free radical scavenging activities as a potent antioxidants with 77.35 % of DPPH inhibition capacity and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 57.59 μg/mL as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was compared to Trolox as standard with 97.89% of inhibition rate and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.46 μg/mL.
