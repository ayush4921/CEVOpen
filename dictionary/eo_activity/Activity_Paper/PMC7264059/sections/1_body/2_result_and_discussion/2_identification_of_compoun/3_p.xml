<p id="p0100">Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was obtained as a brown white powder. A detailed assessment of the NMR data indicated that 
 <bold>1</bold> is an alpha-viniferin, a compound group known as components of plant species. The IR spectrum showed absorption for aromatic (1599 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), aliphatic (2928 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and hydroxyl (3362 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was elucidated with 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral data, as well as 2D-NMR techniques (HMBC and HMQC). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum (in MeOH-
 <italic>d4</italic>) showed signals for three sets of two aromatic protons [δ5.79 (1H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>1.6 Hz, H-14a), 6.13 (1H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>2 Hz, H-12a); δ6.62 (1H, overlap, H-14b), 6.18 (1H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>2 Hz, H-12b); δ6.42 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J=</italic> 2 Hz, H-14c), 6.19 (1H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>2 Hz, H-12c)], three sets of four aromatic protons [δ6.91 (2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8 Hz, H-2a, H-6a), 6.62 (2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8.8 Hz, H-3a, H-5a); δ7.07(2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8.8 Hz, H-2b, H-6b), 6.67 (2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8.4 Hz, H-3b, H-5b); δ6.69 (2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8 Hz, H-2c, H-6c), 6.64 (2H, 
 <italic>d¸ J=</italic>8.8 Hz, H-3c, H-5c)] and three series of two aliphatic protons signals [δ6.04 (1H, 
 <italic>s</italic>, H-7a), 3.88 (1H, 
 <italic>s¸</italic> H-8a); δ5.83 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J=</italic>9.2 Hz, H-7b), 4.56 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J=</italic>9.2 Hz, H-8b); δ4.63 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J=</italic>7.2 Hz, H-7c), 4.42 (1H, 
 <italic>d, J=</italic>7.2 Hz, H-8c)]. Further evidence for the structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was provided by HMBC and HSQC experiments shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Based on these data, the structure of alpha-viniferin was assigned for compound 
 <bold>1</bold> as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. NMR data were in accordance with literature data [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
