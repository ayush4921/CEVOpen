<p id="p0025">The Dipterocarpaceae is a large tropical plant family including 16 genera with at least 600 species inside approximately. 
 <italic>Dipterocarpus</italic> is the biggest genus of this family. This genus consist of about 75 species is widely distributed in the Southeast Asia regions especially in Malaysia and Indonesia [

 <italic>Dipterocarpus littoralis</italic> is the endemic species of this genus distributed in Nusakambangan, Central Java with local name Meranti Jawa. The 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> wood is used as a building material and furniture industry. The stem bark of this plant is used as a traditional remedy to treat diseases like diarrhea, diabetic and malaria [

 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> chemical constituents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antioxidant, antidiabetic and antiplasmodial potency of a chemical constituent from 
 <italic>D. littoralis.</italic> Thus, the aim of this research was to isolate and characterize chemical constituent from the methanol extract of the stem bark of 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> and evaluate their bioactivities including antioxidant, antidiabetic and antiplasmodial.
