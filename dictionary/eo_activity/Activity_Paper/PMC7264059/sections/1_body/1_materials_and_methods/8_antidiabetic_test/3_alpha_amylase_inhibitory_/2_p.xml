The sample (2 μL dissolved in DMSO) and substrate (50μL) were mixed in 30 μL phosphate buffer 0.1M (pH 6.9). After pre-incubation for 5 min, 20 μL of α-amylase solution were added and the solution was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After that, 50 μL HCl 1M and 50 μL iodin were added to the solution. The absorbance was observed at 650 nm by a microplate reader (As). Acarbose was taken as a control. The blank solution was monitored its absorbance at 650 nm (Ab). The α-amylase inhibition was examined with the formula: α-amylase inhibitory activity (%) = [(A
 <sub>b</sub>-A
 <sub>s</sub>)/A
 <sub>b</sub>] x100.
