<p>There were 306 use reports related to treating 11 symptoms in the ICPC-2 category of digestive disorders (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00906">Table S1</xref>), of which more than one-third were used to treat flatulence, while 27% mentioned the treatment of abdominal pain. Of the reports, 9% mentioned that gingers were used to treat gastritis, which is a condition related to abdominal pain; however, the original reports specifically mention uses of ginger for the treatment of gastritis. Uses of gingers as a laxative, and to treat diarrhea and colitis, made up approximately 7% of all use reports, while issues of indigestion, food poisoning, antiemetic, bile tonic and hepatopathy each had very a few use reports (
