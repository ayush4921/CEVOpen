 </sup> The present study was aimed to test an Eastern Medicine coded plant based medicinal formulation Eczegone ointment comprising of 
 <italic>Azin, Fuin, Spin</italic> and 
 <italic>Lain</italic> for its toxicity evaluation and clinical effects for atopic dermatitis. The toxicity studies were performed by using Human Skin Keratinocytes HaCaT cell line by treating them with different concentrations of Eczegone. The morphological changes for any toxicity were observed after treating with HaCaT cells and crystal violet stained cells used to find out the safety of Eczegone on skin cells and their cell viability by using Methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay. Furthermore, the samples of Eastern Medicine coded formulation Eczegone in the form of both tablet and ointment were tested using acute oral and dermal toxicity tests on Swiss albino mice and albino rabbits with different drug concentrations. In addition to safety and toxicity evaluation of Eczegone, we also aimed to asses antibacterial activity of Eczegone whether it possess antibacterial activity or not. To check any potential of Eczegone against the bacterial growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative nature, antibacterial activity was conducted in the current study.
