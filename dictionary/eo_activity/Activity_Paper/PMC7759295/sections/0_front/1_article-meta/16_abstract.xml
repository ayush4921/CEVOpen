  <italic>Stellaria dichotoma</italic> var. 
  <italic>lanceolata</italic> Bunge. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant of Caryophyllaceae, which contains many chemicals, such as 
  <italic>β</italic>-carboline alkaloids, sterols, cyclic peptides, phenolic acids, and flavonoids and so on, which was used as folk medicines for antifebrile to treat fever and to inhibit the cell growth, cyclooxygenase, and also can anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, vasodilator, and other effects. Illumina paired-end reads data were used to assemble the complete chloroplast (cp) genome. 16,898,032 raw paired-end reads and the length distribution in 150,602 bp, including a large single-copy (LSC) region of 81,844 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) region of 17,022 bp and a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) of 25,868 bp. Besides, nine protein-coding genes (PCGs) genes and six tRNA genes possess a single intron, while clpP and ycf3 have a couple of introns. Based on the concatenated coding sequences of cp PCGs, the phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>S. dichotoma</italic> and 
  <italic>Pseudostellaria palibiniana</italic> (MK309611) are closely related to each other within the family Caryophyllaceae.
