 <italic>Stellaria dichotoma</italic> were collected in the Ningxia Forestry Institute (38°28′N, 106°16′E; Ningxia, NW China), then deposited at Pharmaceutical Laboratory in Xi’an International University, the voucher specimen is SD193777. The genomic DNA was extracted with the modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). We constructed a shotgun library with Illumina HiSeq X Ten Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s specification. The program MITObim v1.8 (
