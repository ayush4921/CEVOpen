<p>The antioxidant potential in terms of DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B.retusa</italic> positively responded toward the possible involvement of the antioxidant molecules from the leaf extract during the synthesis of AgNPs. It is well known that plants have a large repository of phenolics and flavonoids molecules which have super antioxidant capacity and are considered to be strong free radical scavengers. The DPPH radical scavenging result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed the antioxidant potentials of aqueous leaf extracts of three ethnomedicinally important plants. The percentage (%) DPPH scavenging activity (IC50) was found to be 16.98 ± 0.12 μg/ml, 30.71 ± 0.22 μg/ml, and 22.66 ± 0.25 μg/ml for 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively. The presence of a significant concentration of total phenolics and flavonoids in 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B.retusa</italic> leaves indicated a notable antioxidant activity. Previous research revealed that the high molecular weight and the adjacency aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups are more focused in the free radical scavenging activity of bioactive phyto-compounds (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Pratap Chandran et al., 2013</xref>). The antioxidant activities were highly correlated with the total phenolic and flavonoids levels. It is also essential to evaluate the antioxidant potential as some of the plant molecules still remain with AgNPs post-purification as a capping and stabilizing agent, which should not be harmful to normal cells during the cellular application of the nanoparticles. Thus, the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> established that the green synthesis process of AgNPs is highly safe for biomedical applications.
