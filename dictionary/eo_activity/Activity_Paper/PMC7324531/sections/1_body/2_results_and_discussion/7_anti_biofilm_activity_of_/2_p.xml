<p>Treatment of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for 24 h with AgNPs (100 μg/ml) synthesized using 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic> plant extract, reduced biofilm formation by &gt;99%. Similarly, AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> at a concentration of 50and 60 μg/ml, respectively, reduced biofilm formation by &gt;99%. The MIC (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of AgNPs needed to inhibit biofilm formation were 68.94 ± 0.2 μg/ml, 12.9 ± 0.2 μg/ml, and 23.48 ± 0.2 μg/ml for AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium, S. anacardium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively. AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extract exhibited potent inhibition of biofilm formation at a very low IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> also exhibited high levels of inhibition of biofilm formation against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Notably, the AgNPs derived from all three plant sources exhibited anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. concentrations of 80, 50, and 100 μg/ml. AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium, S. anacardium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively, exhibited &gt;99% inhibition against biofilm formation by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, a Gram-negative bacterium. MIC (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 45.5 ± 0.2 μg/ml, 23.42 ± 0.15 μg/ml, and 64.14 ± 0.3 μg/ml were calculated for the AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium, S. anacardium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively. In the case of the Gram-positive bacterium, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, &gt;99% inhibition was evident at 90 μg/ml (
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>), 60 μg/ml (
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>), and 60 μg/ml (
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>). The AgNPs derived from both 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> greatly inhibited biofilm formation by 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The AgNPs also exhibited potent antibiofilm activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with a calculated MIC (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 52.54 ± 0.1 μg/ml (
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>), 33.77 ± 0.2 μg/ml (
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>), and 32.67 ± 0.15 μg/ml (
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>). The AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> exhibited the best anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
