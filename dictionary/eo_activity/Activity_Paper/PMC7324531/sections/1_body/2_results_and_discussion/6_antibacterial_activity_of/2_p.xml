<p>The AgNPs synthesized using plant extracts exhibited significantly greater antibacterial activity than AgNPs synthesized from other sources, such as bacteria, fungi, algae, etc. Multiple reports support the use of AgNPs as antibacterial agents (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004)</xref> focused on the interaction of AgNPs with 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> and confirmed that at the first stage of interaction, AgNPs attach to the bacterial cell wall. After stable adherence, AgNPs penetrate the bacterium and induce cell death by rupturing the cell membrane. AgNPs acting as oxidizing agents on the surface of proteins present on the plasma membrane and cellular homeostasis have also been suggested as the mechanism underlying AgNP antibacterial activity. Another suggestion is that AgNPs attach to the cell membrane surface and decrease its permeability and respiration. The current study, although supportive of all the proposed mechanisms, confirms that the bactericidal activity involves the uptake of AgNPs. Notably, plant-synthesized AgNPs have an added advantage over chemically synthesized AgNPs due to the ability of plant metabolites to function as capping and stabilizing agents, as well as exhibiting their own antibacterial activity, which collectively enhances the antibacterial activity of AgNPs.
