<p>A 96-well microtiter plate (flat bottom, polystyrene) was used to determine the anti-biofilm activity of the AgNPs as described by 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gurunathan et al. (2014)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barapatre et al. (2016)</xref>. Individual wells of the plates were filled with 180 μl of Muller Hinton Broth and 10 μl of the test pathogens (OD = 1.0, 600 nm) were added. Subsequently, 10 μl of AgNPs were added and the preparation was thoroughly mixed. A two-fold dilution series of the AgNPs was used to determine the MIC of AgNPs against biofilm formation. The same was used to test the anti-biofilm activity of the plant extracts and to determine their MIC. After completing the preparation of the test plates, they were incubated in a static condition for 24 h at 37°C. Mixtures without bacteria were used to adjust the OD for absorbance by the extract components. After incubation, the contents of the wells of the microtiter plates were discarded and gently washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove free-floating non-adherent bacterial cells from the walls and bottom of the wells. The wells of the microtiter plates were then air dried for 45 min. After drying, adherent “sessile” bacteria in the wells were fixed with 2% w/v sodium acetate and the wells were then flooded with crystal violet stain (0.1%, w/v) and incubated in the dark for 30 min. Afterward, the wells were thoroughly washed with sterile deionized water until all excess dye was removed. The plates were then air dried again. After complete drying, 200 μl of ethanol (95%, v/v) was added to each well and absorbance at 620 nm was measured (Multi-scan plate reader, Thermo Fisher scientific). The percentage of inhibition of biofilm formation was calculated using following equation:
