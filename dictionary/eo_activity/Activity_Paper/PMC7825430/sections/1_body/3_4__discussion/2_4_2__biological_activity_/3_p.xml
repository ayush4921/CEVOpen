<p>The present study revealed in vitro the great bioactive properties of crude polysaccharides isolated from the wild growing cauliflower mushroom. They were found to be non-toxic to normal human colon epithelial cells; simultaneously, they significantly inhibited the proliferation of the human colon cancer cells and destroyed their cell membrane integrity. It needs to be highlighted that CPS had the lowest efficiency in the elimination of the Caco-2 cancer cells, which are the most differentiated but the least invasive cell line among the investigated ones. On the contrary, the HT-29 cells representing the advanced stage of colon cancer development were the most sensitive to the anticancer effect of CPS [
