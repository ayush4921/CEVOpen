<p>Overproduction of ROS in vivo can also occur through some enzyme-mediated reactions. Xanthine oxidase constitutes one of the main enzymatic sources of ROS in vivo due to its participation in the oxidative damage resulting from the reperfusion of ischemic tissues, brain edema and injury, or vascular permeability changes [
