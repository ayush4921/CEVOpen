 <italic>S. crispa</italic> is a medicinal mushroom with a long history of use in traditional Asian therapies. The fruiting body of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> contains approximately 13.4 g of protein, 21.5 g of carbohydrates, and 2.0 g of fat per 100 g of dry weight [

Ultrasonic-assisted extraction (with water as an eluent) was used to obtain polysaccharides, since the ultrasonic enhancement of the process causes the disruption of cell walls, reduces particle size, and enhances transfer of cell components resulting in better extraction efficiency than traditional techniques [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The isolation of the crude polysaccharides was preceded by preliminary extraction with ethanol (to remove small molecules) and involved the deproteinization method (with Sevage reagent). Therefore, proteins and phenolics were finally present in CPS only in trace amounts. Sugars constituted the main group of compounds in crude polysaccharides (

 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of CPS confirmed that it contained polysaccharides (

 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum contains some anomeric proton signals in the region of 4.5–5.3 ppm and the remaining proton signals in the region of 3.0–4.3 ppm. The signals in the region of 4.5–4.6 ppm are characteristic for β-monosaccharides and confirmed the presence of β-glucan, which was determined with the enzymatic method and described in
