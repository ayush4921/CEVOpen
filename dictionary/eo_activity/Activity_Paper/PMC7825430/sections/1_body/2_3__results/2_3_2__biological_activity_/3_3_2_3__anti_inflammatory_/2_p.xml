<p>The mode of LOX inhibition by CPS was determined using the Lineweaver–Burk plot presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00161-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The y-intercept and the slope of a Lineweaver–Burk plot indicate that CPS caused the noncompetitive inhibition of LOX, in which the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, resulting in the decreased efficacy of the enzyme. In this mode of inhibition, CPS shares the same affinity for both the enzyme and the enzyme–substrate complex and the enzyme is prevented from forming its product [
