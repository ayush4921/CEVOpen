<p>The antioxidant activity of CPS was also evaluated using enzymatic assays with xanthine oxidase (XO) and catalase (CAT). The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00161-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. CPS was found to have no influence on XO activity, as neither the activation nor inhibition of this enzyme was observed. The catalase activity assay revealed that CPS did not activate this enzyme, which suggests an absence of antioxidant activity. On the contrary, our study revealed that catalase activity was inhibited by CPS in 32.74% at the CPS concentration of 5 mg/mL.
