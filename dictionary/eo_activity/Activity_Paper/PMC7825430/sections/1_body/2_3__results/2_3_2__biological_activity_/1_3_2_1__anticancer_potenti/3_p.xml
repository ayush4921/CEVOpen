<p>The MTT test demonstrated no impact of the CPS on the metabolic activity of both CCD841 CoN and Caco-2 cells. At the same time, the polysaccharides exerted a significant antiproliferative effect on the LS180 and HT-29 cells (IC50 LS180 = 78 µg/mL; IC50 HT-29 = 14 µg/mL). The strongest inhibition of proliferation was observed in the HT-29 cells, wherein the lowest and the highest investigated concentrations of CPS caused a decrease in cancer cell proliferation by 58.6% and 79.1%, respectively. The LS180 cells were less sensitive to the CPS; nevertheless, even the lowest dose of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> polysaccharides reduced the cancer cell proliferation by 22.6%.
