<p>Chelating power (CHP) was determined with the method described by [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The reaction mixture consisted of 5 mL of CPS, 0.1 mL of FeCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2mM) and 0.2 mL of ferrozine (5 mM). Absorbance was measured at λ = 562 nm after 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Six dilutions of CPS were examined to plot a dose–response curve. The result was expressed as the concentration of polysaccharides providing 50% of activity based on the dose-dependent mode of action (EC
 <sub>50</sub>).
