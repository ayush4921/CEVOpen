<p>Inhibition of xantine oxidase (XO) was determined as previously described with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The assay mixture consisted of phosphate buffer (1/15 M, pH 7.5), the CPS sample (1 mg/mL, in water), the enzyme solution, and xanthine as a substrate. The assay mixture was incubated at 30 °C with the absorbance (λ = 295 nm) measured spectrophotometrically over a 2 min period. The XO inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition of XO in the assay mixture system.
