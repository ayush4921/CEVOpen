<p>Cells were seeded on 96-well microplates at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL (cancer cells) and 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL (normal cells). On the following day, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were exposed to serial dilutions (10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of the crude polysaccharide extract from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> prepared in the fresh medium with a standard content of FBS. After 48 h of incubation in standard conditions (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C), the impact of CPS on DNA synthesis was measured by a colorimetric immunoassay, namely the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test measures cell proliferation by quantitating BrdU (analog of thymidine, 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine) incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA in proliferating cells. Absorbance was measured at a λ = 450 nm wavelength using the microplate reader (BioTek ELx800, Highland Park, Winooski, VT, USA). The results were presented as a percentage of the BrdU incorporation to DNA in cells treated with the investigated compound versus the cells grown in the control medium (indicated as 100%).
