<p>Cells were seeded on 96-well microplates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL (cancer cells) and 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (normal cells). On the following day, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were exposed to serial dilutions (10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of the crude polysaccharide extract from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> prepared in the fresh medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After 24 h of incubation in standard conditions (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C) the culture supernatants were collected in new 96-well microplates, which were used to perform the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay following the manufacturer’s instruction. The test was based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium upon damage to the cell plasma membrane. The absorbance was recorded on a microplate reader (BioTek ELx800, Highland Park, Winooski, VT, USA) at a wavelength of λ = 450 nm. The results were presented as the percentage of LDH released from cells treated with the tested compound versus the cells grown in the control medium (indicated as 100%).
