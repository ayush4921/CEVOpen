<p>Inhibition of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) was determined as previously described with some modifications using soybean 15-LO, generally regarded as predictive for the inhibition of the mammalian enzyme [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The LOX inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically at 20 °C by measuring the increase in absorbance at λ = 234 nm over a 2 min period. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 9.00), the CPS sample (1 mg/mL, in water), the enzyme (167 U/mL), and linoleic acid (134 µM) as a substrate. Acetylsalicylic acid (1 mM) was used as a control. All measurements were carried out in triplicate. The LOX inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition of LOX in the above assay mixture system in relation to the control without the inhibitor (indicated as 100%). The mode of inhibition on the enzyme was shown using the Lineweaver–Burk plot.
