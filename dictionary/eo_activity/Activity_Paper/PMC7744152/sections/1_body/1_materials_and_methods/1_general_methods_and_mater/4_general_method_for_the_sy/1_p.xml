<p>A solution of chlorosulphonyl isocyanate (212.0 mg, 1.50 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (0.5 ml) was prepared. In the next step, a solution of formic acid (70.9 mg, 1.54 mmol) and 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-DMA (1.4 mg, 0.016 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 3.5 h. Then, a solution of the corresponding derivative 
 <bold>2A-L</bold> (1.00 mmol) in 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-DMA (3.4 ml) was added, and the obtained solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. Subsequently, reaction mixture was poured into water (50 ml). The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with water. The crude product was recrystallized from ACN to give the desired products 
 <bold>3A-L</bold>.
