<p>The next step of the biological evaluation was to verify whether the obtained new STS inhibitors based on 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamates 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> are able to inhibit STS activity in the MCF-7 cancer cell line. In the course of our study, we determined the level of STS inhibition in the MCF-7 cells after incubation in the presence of inhibitors at 100, 10, and 1 nM concentrations. The summarised results are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In the course of our research, we found that in the presence of inhibitor at 100 nM concentration, the lowest STS activities were measured for derivatives 
 <bold>3K</bold> (5.43% of STS activity) and 
 <bold>3L</bold> (5.29% of STS activity) substituted at R
 <sub>1</sub>, R
 <sub>2</sub> or R
 <sub>3</sub> position with fluorine atoms. These results were comparable with those obtained for the reference compound – 
 <italic>Irosustat</italic> (remaining STS activity of 5.72%). In the next step, six of the most promising derivatives 
 <bold>3G-L</bold> were selected and tested at an inhibitor concentration of 10 nM. Among these compounds, the highest STS inhibitory activities were observed for the derivatives 
 <bold>3I</bold>, 
 <bold>3K</bold>, and 
 <bold>3L</bold> (remaining STS activity of 42.09%, 42.01% and 27.48%, respectively). As the research showed, the tested compounds showed slightly weaker activity in comparison with 
 <italic>Irosustat</italic> (remaining STS activity of 12.93% at an inhibitor concentration of 10 nM). In order to further verify the potential of the new selected compounds, the STS activity was measured in the presence of 
 <bold>3I</bold>, 
 <bold>3K</bold>, and 
 <bold>3L</bold> at the inhibitor concentration of 1 nM. For these compounds, an IC
 <sub>50</sub> parameter was determined as well. The studies showed that the tested compounds based on 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamates 
 <bold>3I</bold>, 
 <bold>3K</bold>, and 
 <bold>3L</bold> found to be very potent STS inhibitors characterised by low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 30.14, 17.02, 15.97 nM, respectively (IC
 <sub>50</sub> parameter determined for 
 <italic>Irosustat</italic> was 1.14 nM). The obtained results indicated that 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamates may be very promising in further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Overall, among all the newly prepared compounds, the highest activity was shown by those with fluorine atoms in their structures. We assume that their effectiveness may be influenced by the possibility of electrostatic interactions between fluorine atoms and the Arg98 residue in the STS active site (as suggested in molecular modelling studies) as well as a higher susceptibility of these structures to nucleophilic substitution reaction on the sulphur atom. Moreover, the presence of C-F bonds in the structure of biologically active compounds often affects a number of favourable properties, including metabolic stability, leading to higher therapeutic effectiveness.
