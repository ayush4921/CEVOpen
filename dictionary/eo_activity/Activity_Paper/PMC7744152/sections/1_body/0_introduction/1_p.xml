<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. As reported by 
 <italic>International Agency for Research on Cancer</italic>, there were more than 18 million new cases diagnosed and 9.5 million tumour-related deaths in 2018 worldwide

 </xref>. The most common types of cancer are lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, and stomach, which constitute almost 50% of all tumour cases. Moreover, lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, and breast cancers are responsible for nearly 50% of all deaths. 
 <italic>National Cancer Institute</italic> estimates that more than 270 000 (15.3%) new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and more than 42 000 (7.0%) deaths will be reported of this disease in the United States of America in 2020

 </xref>. Approximately 95% of breast cancer cases in the primary stage are hormone-sensitive, and therefore, biological active hormones (including oestrogens and androgens) play a crucial role in the proliferation of tumours cells

 </xref>. The biosynthesis of active steroids in cancer tissues mainly depends on the following three enzymatic pathways: aromatase (responsible for the transformation of androgens into oestrogens), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (implicated in the reduction of oestrone to oestradiol) and steroid sulphatase (STS). STS acts by hydrolysing steroid sulphates (including oestrone sulphate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) and therefore plays a pivotal role in human steroidogenesis process

 </xref>. Current breast cancer therapies are based on chemotherapeutics that act as selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. 
 <italic>Tamoxifen</italic>) or inhibitors of the aromatase enzyme complex (e.g. 
 <italic>Letrozole</italic> or 
 <italic>Anastrozole</italic>)

  <sup>8–10</sup>
 </xref>. Unfortunately, both methods of treatment are unsatisfactory. The main reason for the failure of the therapy based on aromatase inhibitors is the fact that aromatase expression is significantly lower than STS

  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref>. Furthermore, there are studies demonstrating a significant increment of STS and 17β-HSD1 following aromatase inhibitor therapy of ER positive postmenopausal breast carcinoma patients due to the compensatory response of breast carcinoma tissues to oestrogen depletion
