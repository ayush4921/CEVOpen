<p>The chloroplast genome size of 
 <italic>Lophatherum gracile</italic> was 137,749 bp with four typical sub-regions: a large single copy (LSC) region of 80,610 bp, a small single copy (SSC) region of 12,429 bp, and two inverted repeats (IRs) containing 22,355 bp each. The guanine-cytosine (GC) content in this genome was 38.64%. The whole genome contained 130 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Twenty one genes were duplicated in the IRs regions, which were 9 protein-coding genes (rps19, rpl2, rpl23, ndhB, rps7, rps12, ycf68, ycf1, rps15), 8 tRNA genes (trnH-GUG, trnl-CAU, trnL-CAA, trnV-GAC, trnl-GAU, trnA-UGC, trnR-ACG, trnN-GUU), and 4 rRNA genes (rrn16S, rrn23S, rrn4.5S, rrn5S).
