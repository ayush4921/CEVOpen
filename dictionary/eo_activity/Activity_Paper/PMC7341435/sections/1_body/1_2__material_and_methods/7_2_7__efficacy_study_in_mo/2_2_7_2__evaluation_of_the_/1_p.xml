 <sup>w</sup> at single daily oral dosages of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, starting day 3 (72 hours) postinfection. The negative control and positive control groups received, respectively, a daily dose of 10 mL/kg of distilled water and 10 mg/kg of chloroquine, respectively. A sixth group of five uninfected female mice considered as the normal group was monitored without any treatment in the same experimental condition. Parasitemia was followed daily from tail blood of mice and Giemsa staining. The percent parasitemia obtained 24 h after the last drug administration was used to determine the dose that reduce parasitemia to 50% or effective dose 50 (ED
 <sub>50</sub>) using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. The percent parasitemia was calculated daily using the following formula [
