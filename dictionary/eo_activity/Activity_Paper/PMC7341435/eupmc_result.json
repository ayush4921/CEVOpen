    "<h4>Background</h4><i>Terminalia mantaly</i> is used in Cameroon traditional medicine to treat malaria and related symptoms. However, its antiplasmodial efficacy is still to be established.<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study is aimed at evaluating the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antiplasmodial activity and the oral acute toxicity of the <i>Terminalia mantaly</i> extracts.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Extracts were prepared from leaves and stem bark of <i>T. mantaly</i>, by maceration in distilled water, methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane (DCM), and hexane. All extracts were initially screened <i>in vitro</i> against the chloroquine-resistant strain W2 of <i>P. falciparum</i> to confirm its <i>in vitro</i> activity, and the most potent one was assessed in malaria mouse model at three concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/bw). Biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters were also determined.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 7 extracts showed <i>in vitro</i> antiplasmodial activity with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.809 <i>μ</i>g/mL to 5.886 <i>μ</i>g/mL. The aqueous extract from the stem bark of <i>T. mantaly</i> (<i>Tm</i>sb<sup>w</sup>) was the most potent (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.809 <i>μ</i>g/mL) and was further assessed for acute toxicity and efficacy in <i>Plasmodium berghei</i>-infected mice. <i>Tm</i>sb<sup>w</sup> was safe in mice with a median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) higher than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. It also exerted a good antimalarial efficacy <i>in vivo</i> with ED<sub>50</sub> of 69.50 mg/kg and had no significant effect on biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results suggest that the stem bark extract of <i>T. mantaly</i> possesses antimalarial activity."
