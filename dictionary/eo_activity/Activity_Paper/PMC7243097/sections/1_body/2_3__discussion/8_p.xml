<p>The last two candidates, 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> roots and 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> pods, are interesting candidates for anti-obesity purposes given that they have not been studied for this indication previously. The roots of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> are traditionally employed for the treatment of cancer, fever, and malaria, but not obesity [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Conversely, the leaf extract of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> has anti-obesogenic potential based on its ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 273.5 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, our findings regarding the potential of the roots of the plant to inhibit pancreatic lipase, stimulate lipolysis, and reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes should increase its potential utility for the treatment and prevention of obesity. There has been no report on the anti-obesogenic effects of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>. Our result that 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> pods strongly inhibit pancreatic lipase, weakly stimulate lipolysis, and reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes is a novel finding for this plant. Although 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> was found to be cytotoxic at high concentrations, it can be a good candidate for treating obesity at limited doses.
