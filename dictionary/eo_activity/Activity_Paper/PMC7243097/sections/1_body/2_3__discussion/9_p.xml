<p>In conclusion, we screened 70 Thai medicinal plants using three in vitro methods for their anti-obesogenic potential, and seven plants were selected as candidates. Each candidate is expected to emerge as a potential candidate for obesity treatment. In particular, 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic>, 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> exhibited activity in all three assays, suggesting their greater potential. In fact, the potential of 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> has been demonstrated in in vivo experiments. Through further study of the other two plants, we hope to reveal that the combined in vitro assay is effective for screening potential medicinal plants and clarify the potential of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> for treating obesity.
