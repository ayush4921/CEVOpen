<p>We found that 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> leaves exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase and strong lipolysis-enhancing effects. 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> leaves have been traditionally used in health products including soaps, anti-mosquito oils, candles, and pain-relieving oils [

 <italic>C. nardus</italic> which contains 
 <italic>R</italic>-citronellal, neryl acetate, citronellyl acetate, geraniol, and Î²-citronellol, in obese rats [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Inhalation of this essential oil led to increased sympathetic nerve activity and decreased appetite, weight gain, and cholesterol levels. The anti-obesogenic effects of consumption of this leaf have not yet been studied.
