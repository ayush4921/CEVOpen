<p>Moreover, 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> roots displayed low pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity but strong potential to enhance lipolysis and reduce lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> is a well-known medicinal plant in the Asian region, and several studies have described the potential of its roots to treat obesity [

 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For instance, our research group previously explored the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> roots and their lipolysis-enhancing activities in a cell-based assay [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the report, we identified eurycomanone and 13β,21-epoxyeurycomanone as the bioactive compounds in the roots of 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic>. The two quassinoids enhanced lipolysis with EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 14.6 and 8.6 μM, respectively. An in vivo study also demonstrated the efficacy of this plant. The study found that a standardized quassinoid-enriched fraction of 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> reduced body weight gain, adipose tissue hypertrophy, and serum glycerol levels in mice with HFD induced obesity [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical testing illustrated that consumption of the 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> extract together with exercise enhanced lipolysis [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, in addition to being identified as a promising candidate in this study, 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> has been proven effective for the treatment of obesity by several researchers.
