<p>Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> heartwood strongly inhibited pancreatic lipase activity and reduced lipid accumulation reduction at all tested concentrations in the present study. Due to the lack of effects on lipolysis, the inhibitory effects of the extract on lipid accumulation are assumed to arise from the reduction of lipid synthesis in 3T3-L1 cells. The constituents in this plant have been previously studied. The heartwood of 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> contains flavonoids such as protosappanin and hematoxylin, and the main constituent among them is brazilin [

 <italic>C. sappan</italic> and was demonstrated to have anti-obesogenic activity. In particular, the compound inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through suppressing the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³, the master regulator of adipogenesis [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Together with our current result illustrating its potential to regulate lipid digestion and synthesis, 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> is considered a promising candidate for the treatment of obesity.
