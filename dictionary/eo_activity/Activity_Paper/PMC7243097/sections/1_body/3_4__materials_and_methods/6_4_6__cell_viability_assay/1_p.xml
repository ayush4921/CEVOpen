<p>Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Lab., Kumamoto, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. In brief, following 24 h of treatment with each extract, cells were incubated with CCK-8 reagent for 3 h. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. Triton X-100 was used as the positive control for reference for cytotoxicity measurements. The experiments were repeated at least twice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 each), and representative values are presented in the figures or tables.
