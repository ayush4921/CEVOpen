   <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 crude extracts affected the viability of biosensor cells. Thebiosensor cells were treated continuously with ethyl acetate crude metabolites from 
   <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 for 48 h before viability determination. The viability assay was repeated with biologically independent replicates. Each point is shown as the mean Â± standard deviation from one experiment.
