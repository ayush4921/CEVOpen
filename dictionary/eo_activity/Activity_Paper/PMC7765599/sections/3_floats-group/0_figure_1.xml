 <caption>
  <p>Construction of fluorescent biosensor clones. (
   <bold>a</bold>) mCherry was inserted at the C-terminus of 
   <italic>53BP1</italic>. The non-targeted and targeted knockin of 
   <italic>53BP1</italic> when the genomic DNA was cut with XbaI were 3.6 and 5.4 kbp. (
   <bold>b</bold>) For 
   <italic>RAD54L</italic>, the non-targeted and targeted knockin when the genomic DNA was cut with SpeI and KpnI were 6.4 and 10 kbp. Codon regions are represented by boxes, and the gray-colored box is the last codon in each gene. The black triangle is the restriction site, and an open triangle denotes the stop codon. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Southern blotting of XbaI-digested (53BP1) and SpeI-KpnI-digested (RAD54L) genomic DNA. Definitions: mCherry, monomeric Cherry; mVenus, monomeric Venus; kbp, kilobase pair; 
   <italic>53BP1</italic>, tumor protein p53 binding protein 1; 
   <italic>RAD54L</italic>, DNA repair protein RAD54-like; WT, wild type.
