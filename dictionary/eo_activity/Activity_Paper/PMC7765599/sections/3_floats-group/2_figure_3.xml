  <p>The viability of biosensor clones following exposure to DNA-damaging agents demonstrated the same phenotype as wild-type DT40. The experiments were reproduced with biologically independent replicates. Data are shown as the mean Â± standard deviation from one experiment. The error bars are shorter than the height of the symbol in some points. Definitions: ETP, etoposide; CPT, camptothecin.</p>
