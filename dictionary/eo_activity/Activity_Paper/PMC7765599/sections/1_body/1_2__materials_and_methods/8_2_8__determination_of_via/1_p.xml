<p>The viability assay was adapted from Yomamoto et al. and Wiyakrutta et al. [

DT40 and DNA repair-deficient cell lines were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 40,000 cells/mL in the final volume of 100 µL. Thereafter, 50 µL of various concentrations of crude extracts was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 40 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24–48 h. The final DMSO concentration was set to not exceed 0.3% (

 <sup>®</sup> (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the signal was read out using the Infinite 200Pro microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
