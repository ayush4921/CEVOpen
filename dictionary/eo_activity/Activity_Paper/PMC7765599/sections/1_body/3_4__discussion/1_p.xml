<p>In this study, we constructed a biosensor based on the DSB repair pathways to investigate the bioactivity, with particular focus on DNA damage and repair, of crude extracts from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and its endophyte 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41. The DSB repair reporter was previously developed as a biosensor to detect HR or NHEJ in human cell lines. Mao et al. employed a rare-cutting endonuclease sequence, I-SceI, to generate the plasmid cassettes to separately determine HR and NHEJ [

However, the genetic stability of the human cancer cell model is not stable over longer periods and so might not be suitable for screening compound libraries. DT40, a chicken B lymphoma cell line, is known for its stable karyotype and is used in DNA repair studies [
