<p>COX-2 is one of the most important proinflammatory enzyme of action for anti-inflammatory drugs, and celecoxib was a COX-2 selective inhibitor in clinical practice [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As observed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the ethanol crude extract of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> roots showed significant COX-2 inhibitory effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 77.2 ± 4.2
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL; however, there was an indicated remarkable difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in comparison with that of celecoxib with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 22.4 ± 1.4ng/mL. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first time to determine the COX-2 inhibitory activity for 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
