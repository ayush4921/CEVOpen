<p>In the present study, the phytochemical compositions were identified using UHPL-Q-TOF-MS/MS based on the existing literatures and public databases, including ChemSpider, Massbank PubChem, and mzCloud, and summarized and described in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The base peak chromatograms of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>dentiger</italic> roots extract in positive and negative ion modes were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 78 compounds, including 15 phenylpropanoids, 15 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 14 fatty acids, 7 phenols, 4 steroids, 4 cyclic peptides, 3 terpenoids, and 2 others, were identified. The molecular formula was accurately assigned within mass error of 5 ppm. Then, the fragment ions were used to further confirm the chemical structure. Furthermore, the fragmentation pathways of some representative compounds were proposed in order to facilitate structural identification. Among them, compounds 7, 10, 11, 13-32, 34-39, 41, 43-46, 48, 50-59, 61-65, 67-69, and 71-77 were reported for the first time in the Araliaceae family. Moreover, this is the first report on compounds 1-3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 40, 42, 47, 49, 60, 66, and 78 from the genus 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> and compounds 4, 8, 33, and 70 from 
 <italic>Dendropanax dentiger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
