<p>Compounds 
 <bold>23</bold>, 
 <bold>24</bold>, 
 <bold>37</bold>, and 
 <bold>49</bold> were isoquinoline alkaloids, which were widely distributed in medicinal plants and have high medicinal value. Compound 
 <bold>23</bold> gave fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 342.1718, 297.1133, 282.0899, and 265.0867 in the positive mode were corresponding to [M + H]

 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>N–CH
 <sub>3</sub>OH]
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively, of which ring B lost a C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>N by a-cleavage and formed a Cp-ring; then, the ring A lost a methoxy at C-6 and formed an epoxy between C-6 and C-7. The tandem mass pattern of this compound was similar with magnoflorine. Thus, it could be identified as magnoflorine. The ESI–MS spectra of compound 
 <bold>24</bold> exhibited similar quasi-molecular ions peak [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 328.1557; their MS
 <sup>2</sup> generated fragments at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 178.0862 and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 151.0759 by splitting of RDA on C-ring. Hence, compound 
 <bold>24</bold> was tentatively identified as stepholidine. The [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion of compound 
 <bold>37</bold> at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 278.1183 had a similar mass and fragmentation pathway to the dehydroroemerine, according to the characteristic ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 263.0948 [M + H–CH

 <sup>+</sup>. For compound 
 <bold>49</bold>, the positive mode MS spectrum showed the parent ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 336.1233 [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>, and MS
 <sup>2</sup> spectrum showed the fragment ions at

 <sup>+</sup>. Compared with literature data, compound 
 <bold>49</bold> was identified as berberine, and the possible fragmentation mechanism was depicted in Figure
