<p>To date, only one paper was reported the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic>, and its ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions showed significant against DPPH free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, 7 phenolic compounds were isolated from the extract of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> and showed moderate or significant against DPPH free radical scavenging activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.038-0.741 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, comparable to that of V
 <sub>c</sub> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.059 
 <italic>μ</italic>M [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, this observed antioxidant activity could be due to the greater presence of secondary bioactive metabolites belonging to the flavonoids or phenolics noticed in ethanol crude extract of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> roots.
