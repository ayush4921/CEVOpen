<p>Another aspect that could be investigated is the indirect effects of these compounds on the DENV biology. Studies have shown the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in DENV infectivity [

 <xref rid="B138-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Most of the bioactive compounds that have anti-DENV activities are polyphenols and diterpenoids. These compounds have been abundantly reported to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in many studies [

 <xref rid="B141-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. However, investigation of the medicinal plant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on dengue fever pathogenesis is still lacking. Only a study by Tseng et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] have studied this aspect. They reported that andrographolide induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity, an antioxidant enzyme in mice that strongly delayed the disease onset and mortality by activating the antiviral host type-1 interferon (IFN) response in an infected mice model as well as reduced DENV-1â€“4 loads in the infected mouse brains [
 <xref rid="B130-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. HO-1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of heme into carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and iron. It is known that HO-1 exhibits its cytoprotective effects through antioxidant effects [

 <xref rid="B143-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. This suggests that any therapy or drug capable of inducing the HO-1 signaling pathway could be a promising candidate of treating DENV infection.
