<p>The bioactive constituents reported here showed different degrees of inhibitory activities against different serotypes of DENV. The isolated constituents belong to various chemical classes such as glycosylated and non-glycosylated polyphenols including flavonoids, sulfated polysaccharides, alkaloids, quinones, and terpenoids. Antiviral activity of andrographolide, a diterpene isolated from 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> showed significant inhibitory activity against DENV-2 in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 21.304 and 22.739 ÂµM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B118-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The compound also possessed larvicidal activity, which effectively increased the percentage of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> larvae mortality, concentration-dependently [
 <xref rid="B119-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. This property might be useful for the management of dengue vector.
