<p>A total of 51 bioactive compounds obtained from various plant sources were reported in this article to exhibit different degrees of anti-dengue activity. These compounds comprise six terpenoids, four phenolic acids, two alkaloids, a saponin, seven polysaccharides, 14 flavonoids, and 17 phenolics and flavonoid glycosides and derivatives. Plaque- and focus-forming assays used in in vitro studies are the major techniques for determining anti-dengue activity of potential compounds. Both assays are run to quantify the viral titer. The former is used to ascertain the number of DENV infectious particles (virions) by the means of plaque formation, while the latter is a variation of the former assay, which employs an immunostaining technique. The assay quantifies infected host cells and infectious DENV virions before the formation of a plaque after DENV-induced cell lysis.</p>
