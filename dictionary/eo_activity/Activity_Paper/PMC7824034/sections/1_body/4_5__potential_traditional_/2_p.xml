<p>Phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, have been identified as suitable candidates for binding and inhibiting ACE-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein through in silico crystal structure modeling [
 <xref rid="B155-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Quercetin obtained from different plant sources has been reported in different studies to inhibit SARS-CoV-related infection. Its purified compound from the tender leaf extract of 
 <italic>Toona sinensis</italic> was reported to inhibit cellular entry of SARS-CoV and prevent viral replication [

 <italic>Scutettaria baicalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Asplenium belangeri</italic> as well as myricetin from 
 <italic>Myrica rubra</italic> inhibit the ATPase activity of SARS-CoV helicase nsP13 [
