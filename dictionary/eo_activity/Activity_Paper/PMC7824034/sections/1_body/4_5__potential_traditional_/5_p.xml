<p>Moreover, many plant-based lectins have also been reported to demonstrate significant inhibitory activities against coronaviruses. Thirty-three lectins purified from different plant species were screened against SARS-CoV and feline coronavirus (FCoV). Mannose-binding lectin was identified to possess a notable anti-coronavirus activity by targeting the entry and the release of virus particles [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00042-f003">Figure 3</xref> depicts the possible specific target receptors and proteins in SARS-CoV that could be modulated by medicinal plants and their phytoconstituents. Another possible target is the type II transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). It can cleave the coronaviral receptor ACE-2 to amplify infectivity as well as activate the viral spike protein for membrane fusion [

Similar to DENV studies, no reports have been published regarding the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the medicinal plants on SARS-CoV infectivity, even though oxidative stress and inflammation have been demonstrated to play significant roles in the disease progression [
