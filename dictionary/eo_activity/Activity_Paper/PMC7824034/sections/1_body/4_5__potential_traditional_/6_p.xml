<p>As previously mentioned, none of the mentioned studies was conducted in in vivo models. The potential of the anti-coronavirus activity of the extracts can be evaluated in many existing animal models like non-human primates, hamsters, mice, and ferrets [

 <xref rid="B171-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] were established to study the infection biology of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies can therefore employ these animal models to evaluate the efficacy of medicinal plants or pure compounds against SARS-CoV-2 for the development of antiviral or therapeutics.
