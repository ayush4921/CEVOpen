Vegetative shoots are numerous, densely pubescent, with numerous leaves, and leaves are tough, twice pinnately dissected. Generative shoots are in a smaller number and leafy. Baskets are in loose panicles, drooping, and multiflowered. Flowers are five-membered, adhesion olepest, with a naked Corolla, yellowish. Achenes are obovate, brownish brown, thinly striated [
