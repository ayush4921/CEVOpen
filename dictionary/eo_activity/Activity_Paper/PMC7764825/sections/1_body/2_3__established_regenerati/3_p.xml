<p>Ex situ regeneration occurs outside of the natural environment such as the collections of botanical gardens, gene banks. These two approaches are fundamentally different: during ex situ conservation, the taxon of interest is removed from the natural environment and cultivated under artificially created conditions, whereas in situ conservation involves determining the habitat and monitoring the plant in situ [

The major challenges in organizing protected areas and establishing “living” collections of rare and vulnerable species are the creation, monitoring, and protection of habitats that cover large areas, as well as damage to plants by pests and pathogens [

It is worth mentioning that the protection of biological diversity in situ is the most preferable, but not always suitable for the conservation of individual species. Therefore, ex situ gene pool conservation strategies are becoming more and more popular. They are based on creating collections of rare and endangered plants with the creation of seed banks and field gene banks [
