<p>In addition to traditional methods of ex situ preservation, the use of in vitro culture of isolated tissues and organs is becoming more common. The most effective methods of clonal micropropagation have been optimized for more than 150 species, 1150 varieties, and selected forms belonging to 59 families. The development of effective methods of plant reproduction is the basis for preserving the gene pool. Optimal explants (apical meristem with leaf primordia) were determined for the stable reproduction of plants. Scientific bases of formation and methodological aspects of conservation of rare and valuable plant species in in vitro genetic banks are being developed. Most of the collections of angiosperms are stored in conditions of slow growth (3–7 °C), and the factors affecting the duration of preservation in in vitro have been determined. When creating genetic banks, special attention is paid to the representativeness and preservation of the genetic stability of plant species. One of the most attractive advantages of in vitro conservation is the possibility of obtaining sterile cultures of species (rare, endemic) without removing them from their natural habitat, which helps to prevent the destruction of phytocenoses [
