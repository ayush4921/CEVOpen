 <sub>2</sub> followed by washing in distilled water, 100% of the seeds were sterile. It has been observed that the surface of the seeds becomes quickly slimy when liquid gets on it. Most likely, the mucus form when using Tween-20 prevents deep sterilization of seeds. It can be concluded that using a mixture of peroxide and ethanol at the first stage of sterilization can effectively and quickly get rid of the unwanted infection. The 10 min exposure time of the seeds to mercury chloride (HgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) showed a more satisfactory sterilization result compared to the shorter five minutes exposure time. The sequence of use of the sterilizer was not important for a similar exposure time.
