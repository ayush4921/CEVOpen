<p>Thus, we developed a micropropagation technology for 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic>. The high efficiency of using a mixture of alcohol and hydrogen peroxide at the initial stages of seed sterilization as explants was revealed. The harmful effect of 0.2% mercury chloride solution on 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> seeds was revealed. The positive effect of BAP at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L on the multiplication of 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> shoots was determined. The MS whole media with a half concentration of macronutrients are quite effective for stimulating the formation of 
 <italic>H. angustifolius</italic> in vitro roots.
