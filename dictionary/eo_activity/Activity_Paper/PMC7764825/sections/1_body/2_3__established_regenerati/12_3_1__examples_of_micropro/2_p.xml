<p>Seeds were sprouted on MS medium [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] without addition of phytohormones. The pH level of the nutrient medium was normalized by using 1 M KOH solution to level 6.3 before autoclaving. The pH level is deliberately overestimated, because after autoclaving, the medium is acidified [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-09-01733" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Autoclave was performed for 30 min at 121 °C and 1.5 atmosphere in devise MLS-3751L (Sanyo). The plants were cultivated under a 16 h photoperiod and at 23 °C.
