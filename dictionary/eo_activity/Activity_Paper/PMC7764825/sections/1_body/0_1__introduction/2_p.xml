<p>Various plant species in Europe, Asia, America, and in Russian Federation; particularly in the Rostov region of Russia are currently under threat of extinction and have one or another status of rarity. The reasons for the rarity of some plants in this area are mostly the anthropogenic load in the form of plowing land, grazing, construction, and the low competitiveness of the plant species in phytocenoses. Other influencing factors for the propagation of these rare plant species are low seed germination or vegetative reproduction, relict species, torn areas, harsh climatic conditions, eaten by animals and birds, etc. [

Several methods have been adopted to preserve the plant gene pool, for example, (a) collection of closed and open ground-based botanical gardens and nurseries, (b) creation of reserves, and other specially protected natural areas (SPNA), and (c) modern biotechnological tools to create seed banks, cells, tissues, and pollen storage, and organization of banks of plant genetic material, i.e., micropropagation. The modern biotechnological tools have been evolved as the fastest, and most efficient strategies to preserve the plantâ€™s gene pool [
