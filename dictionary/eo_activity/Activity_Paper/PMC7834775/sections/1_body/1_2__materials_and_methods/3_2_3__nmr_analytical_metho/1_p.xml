   <p>Preparation of samples for 
    <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR analysis: we have adopted the Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission extraction method [
    <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for sample preparation. Decoction pieces of 
    <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. were crushed in a pulverizer and passed through a 40-mesh sieve. 10 g of 
    <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. powder was precisely weighed and put it in ethyl acetate and back flow for 1 h (material-liquid ratio 1 : 20 g/mL). Then, the filter residue was taken and put it in methanol back flow for 1 h (material-liquid ratio 1 : 15 g/mL). The filtrate was made into an extract and dissolved in water. The solution was washed three times with n-butyl alcohol, and the filtrates were combined to make extract.

   <p>Preparation of standard solution: we followed the methods of [
    <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 5 mg of isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin were accurately weighed and put in DMSO-d
    <sub>6</sub> (480 
    <italic>μ</italic>L) and 20 
    <italic>μ</italic>L dichloromethane solution (internal standard reference) were added, respectively. The standard solutions of isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin were obtained, respectively. 30 mg of extract was accurately weighed and dissolved in 480 
    <italic>μ</italic>L DMSO-d
    <sub>6</sub>, and 20 
    <italic>μ</italic>L methylene chloride solution was added. The NMR spectra of extract and isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin are shown in
