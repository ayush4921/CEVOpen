<p>The instrument parameters such as D1 have a greater impact on the accuracy of the test results. Studies have shown that D1 must be set long enough (&gt;5T1) in qNMR experiments to fully relax the nucleus and then be integrated. The impact of D1 on the experimental results was carried out. For the same sample to be tested, using the ratio of the quantitative peak and the internal standard peak (Au/As) as a reference, the D1 values for liquiritin, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritin were 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, and 40 s. When the D1 value is greater than 10 s, the Au/As value will not change anymore. Hence, 10 s was select as relaxation delays to save test time.</p>
