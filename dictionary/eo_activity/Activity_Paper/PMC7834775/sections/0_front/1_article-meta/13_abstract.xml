  <title>Objective</title>
  <p> To establish a method for simultaneous determination of liquiritin, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritinin glycyrrhizin using hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance quantitative technology (
   <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR). 
   <italic>Methodology</italic>. Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the solvent, and dichloromethane was used as the internal standard. The probe temperature was 298.0 K, the pulse sequence was Zg30, the number of scans was 16, and relaxation delay (
   <italic>D</italic>1) was 10 s. Quantitative characteristic signal peaks were 
   <italic>δ</italic> 4.891∼4.878 ppm, 
   <italic>δ</italic> 8.187∼8.172 ppm, and 
   <italic>δ</italic> 6.790∼6.776 ppm for liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin, respectively.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> In this study, a new method for determination of three flavonoids in Licorice using 
   <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR was established. This experimental method has the advantages of accuracy, efficiency, and economy. It lays a foundation for the study on the determination of flavonoids content in licorice by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
