<p>The fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Typhonium giganteum</italic> were provided from Medicinal Herb Garden, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University (

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves and deposited in National Institute of Biological Resources (42 Hwangyeong-ro, Seo-gu, Incheon, 22689, Korea) with collection number of NIBRGR0000622204. The high quality PE reads were assembled by CLC Genomics Workbench (ver. 10.0.1, CLC QIAGEN), followed by manual curation through PE reads mapping (Kim et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Annotation of the complete chloroplast genome was performed with GeSeq and manual corrections (Tillich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>T. giganteum</italic> was submitted to GenBank with the accession number of MN626718.
