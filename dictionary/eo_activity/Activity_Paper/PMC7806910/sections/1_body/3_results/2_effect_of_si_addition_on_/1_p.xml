<p id="Par24">From the total sugar data over 2 years, it was observed that the total sugars of roots were increased by Si under salt stress, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The addition of Si could affect the content of total sugar; compared to plants grown with Na
 <sub>1</sub> (CK), the content of total sugar was significantly intensified with Si
 <sub>2</sub> and Si
 <sub>3</sub>. After adding Si, the total sugar increased to 14.38% in the Si
 <sub>2</sub> treatment (2.8 ds/m). With increasing Si concentration, the total sugar content gradually increased to 25.70% under salt stress.
