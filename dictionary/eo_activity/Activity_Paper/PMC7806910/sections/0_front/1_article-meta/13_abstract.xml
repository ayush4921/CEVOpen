 <p id="Par1">Salt stress is one of the key factors that limits the cultivation of 
  <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. (
  <italic>G. uralensis</italic>) in the northern part of China. In this study, three salt treatments (including 21, 42 and 63 ds/m NaCl/kg dry soil) and four Si (silicon) concentrations (including 0, 1.4, 2.8 and 4.2 ds/m SiO
  <sub>2</sub>/kg K
  <sub>2</sub>SiO
  <sub>3</sub> in dry soil) were tested using 
  <italic>G. uralensis</italic> as the plant material in a pot experiment with three replications. The results showed that the application of various concentrations of Si increased sucrose synthetase (SS), sucrose phosphate synthetase (SPS) and glutamine synthetase (GS), as well as nitrate reductase (NR) activities, and promoted carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Si application also increased the root dry weight of 
  <italic>G. uralensis</italic>. Multilevel comparative analysis showed that the application of 2.8 ds/m SiO
  <sub>2</sub> was the optimum rate for improved growth and yield of 
  <italic>G. uralensis</italic> under different salt levels. This study provides important information that can form the basis for the cultivation of high-yielding and high-quality 
  <italic>G. uralensis</italic> in saline soils.
