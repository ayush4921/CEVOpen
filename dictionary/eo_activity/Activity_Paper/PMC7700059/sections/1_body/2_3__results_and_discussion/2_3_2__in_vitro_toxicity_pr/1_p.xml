<p>Numerous reports suggest that the evaluation of cellular toxicity and protective effect of plant extracts is necessary to document whether the extract is safe to use against various harmful effects caused by free radicals [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, the free radicals and ROS are generated from aerobic metabolism [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. If not efficiently neutralized by our antioxidant mechanism in our body, these oxidants are very reactive. They quickly interact with membrane proteins as well as intracellular components such as DNA molecules and cause damage which leads to a pathological state [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Free radicals and ROS are associated with numerous diseases which include neurodegenerative disease, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, and atherosclerosis [
