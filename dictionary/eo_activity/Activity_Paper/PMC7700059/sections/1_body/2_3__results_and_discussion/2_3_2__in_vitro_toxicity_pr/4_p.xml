<p>The toxicity of cells upon being treated with larger doses of TA extract and longer exposure could be due to the presence of bioactive compounds present in the extract. Alternatively, the decrease in cell viability at higher doses could be due to the presence of some prooxidant activity, and extortion of conditional media for a longer period of time (48â€‰h) could increase the toxicity on skin fibroblasts; however, at lower doses, the prooxidant effect is negligible. This explanation is well supported by reports that the TA extracts exert a significant antiproliferative effect against a panel of human tumor cell lines at both dose- and time-dependent contexts [
