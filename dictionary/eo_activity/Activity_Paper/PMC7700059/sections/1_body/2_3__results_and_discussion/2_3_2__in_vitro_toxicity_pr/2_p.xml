<p>A few years ago, Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated the importance of evaluating the toxicity profile of plant extract (
 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> extract) using skin fibroblasts as a cellular model [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The study further reveals that exposure of dermal skin fibroblasts to 0.8 mM dose of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 h reduces cell viability by 59% when compared with untreated control skin fibroblasts. However, pretreatment of dermal skin fibroblasts with 
 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> extract in a dose-dependent way (50 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) reduces the cell death of dermal skin fibroblasts significantly, thus preventing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Consistent with these findings, the current study sought to investigate the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity and protection offered by TA extracts on a human skin fibroblast (Hs27). The experimental setup was designed for both dose- (27.5, 55, 110, and 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) as well as time-dependent (4, 24, and 48 h) manner. We observed a significantly negligible toxicity at both lower and higher doses (5–9%,

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of TA extracts when Hs27 cells were exposed for 4 h in comparison to the untreated control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, when Hs27 fibroblasts were exposed for 24 h, the toxicity of cells at lower doses was insignificant (1–5%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas, at the highest dose (220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), we found significant toxicity in the 23–26% range, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, for 48 h time point, skin fibroblasts exposed to varying doses of TA extracts revealed that significant toxicity (17–22%, 35–41%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed at higher doses (110, 220 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), respectively (
