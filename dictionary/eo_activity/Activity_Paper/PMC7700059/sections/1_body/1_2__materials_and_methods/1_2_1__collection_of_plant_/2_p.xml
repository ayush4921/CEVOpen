<p>Extracts of all parts of TA were formulated by the standard protocol mentioned in our previous article [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All the parts (fresh leaves, dry leaves collected from the floor, stem, and root) were first air-dried in the shade to remove moisture completely. After being chopped into small pieces, all parts of TA were ground in a kitchen blender to produce a fine powder. After weighing 12 g of powder of each part of TA, the power was added to 300 mL of 100% methanol and stirred constantly for 5 days at room temperature [

The mixture obtained after stirring was filtered through a cheesecloth to remove the bulk followed by filtering through a Whatman filter paper in an autoclaved glass beaker. Then the methanol (solvent) was completely evaporated from the plant extract mixture in a glass beaker by keeping the temperature of the hot plate at 45°C. This was done to avoid degrading the heat labile compounds. Following this, the fine powder of residue was left in the glass beaker after the solvent's evaporation and stored at 4°C for future experiments to evaluate the biological activities of the TA plant.
