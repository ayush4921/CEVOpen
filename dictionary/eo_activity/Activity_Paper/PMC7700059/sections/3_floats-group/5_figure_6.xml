  <p>Cell viability determined by MTT assay. Hs27 skin fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to incubate overnight to attach to the surface. Next day, treat the cells with TA extracts (fresh and dry leaf, stem, and root extracts) for 24 h along with quercetin as positive control (16 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and control as untreated. After the completion of treatment, expose the pretreated cells with 300 
   <italic>μ</italic>M of H₂O₂ for 1 h. Data shown as mean ± SEM;
