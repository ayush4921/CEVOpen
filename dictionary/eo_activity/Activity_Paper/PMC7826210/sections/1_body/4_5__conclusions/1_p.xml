<p>In conclusion, the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> pathway might contribute to CPT-evoked kidney toxicity, and Rb3 could exert a protective effect on the kidney toxicity through the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> pathway-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis during the treatment of oral cancer by CPT. Our finding provides a novel insight into the protective effect of Rb3 on CPT-evoked kidney toxicity. It is very significant for the development of Rb3 and the treatment of oral cancer in the clinic.
