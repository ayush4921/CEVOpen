<p>Apoptosis is a physiologically programmed cell death process to get rid of the unwanted and dysfunctional cells for maintaining the homeostasis of the body [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mitochondrial, recognized as the regulated center of cellular activities, controls the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation serving for nearly all of the cellular physiology. In the apoptosis progression, mitochondrial depolarization occurs as response to apoptosis stimuli, cytochrome C releases from mitochondrial, and the expression of apoptosis-related factor Bcl-2 and Bax in mitochondrial changes; following actives, the series of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase) of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 eventually induced the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and cell death [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Any disordered mitochondrial apoptosis section would cause functional cell death and trigger the normal tissue injury [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The research studies had confirmed that CPT evoked the kidney cell apoptosis via inducing Bax expression, inhibiting Bcl-2 expression, and activating caspase activities. TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> was also reported to take part in the cell apoptosis via mitochondrial. Our results implied that TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> partly contributed to the CPT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, the present study revealed that TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> is essential to Rb3 protecting against CPT-evoked apoptosis, which confirmed that Rb3 lost the protective effect in the pretreatment with the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> inhibitor of disitertide in kidney cells.
