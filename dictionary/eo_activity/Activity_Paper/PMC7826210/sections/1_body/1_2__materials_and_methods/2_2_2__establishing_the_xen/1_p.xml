<p>The SPF male and 6 weeks aged nude mice were purchased from the Xiamen University Laboratory Animal Center (Xiamen, China). All mice were housed according to genotype and sex, five per cage and raised at the atmosphere of 22–26°C on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with continuous access to food and water. After adapting the environment for five days, the mice were subcutaneously implanted with the precultured oral carcinoma cells ACC83 (approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells in 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L PBS per mice). One week later, when the implanted ACC83 cells began to display a little tumor swell with different sizes in the subcutaneous of mice, we selected the mice bearing tumor of uniform size as mung beans and randomly divided into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). The selected mice were maintained for another one week and treated with CPT and/or Rb3 to evaluate the toxic effect.
