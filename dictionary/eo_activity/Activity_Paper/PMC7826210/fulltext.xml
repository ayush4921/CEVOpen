Introduction</title><p>Oral cancer, occurring in the oral cavity and lip, is the sixth most common carcinoma and accounts for approximately 300,000 new cases around the earth [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The lack of early diagnosis strategy to oral cancer delayed the treatment and led to the dismal survival rates and mortality in oral cancer [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the statistics, there are 145,000 patients of oral cancer who died in 2012 [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oral cancer has caused an alarming mental and health burden in human [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although there are plentiful of therapy methods for oral cancer in clinic and theory, the effective strategy for cancer treatment remains a challenge [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, chemotherapy is still one of the usual therapies to various cancers including oral cancer [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and cisplatin (CPT) is an essential chemotherapeutical agent wildly applied to oral cancer for years [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, CPT could kill almost all of the contacted cells of normal and cancer cells in the body, which lead to the toxicity to normal tissues such as the heart, kidney, and liver [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lack of selectivity to cells restricted the clinic application of CPT in treating against oral cancer [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Excitingly, recent research studies have shown that several traditional Chinese herb extractions and their components could suppress CPT-trigged liver impairment, kidney injury, and myocardial damage [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among these active herb extractions and components, it was reported that Rb3 could alleviate CPT-evoked kidney injury in the cancer model [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the potential effect and mechanism of Rb3 on the kidney toxicity during CTP treating against oral cancer remain obscure. Therefore, it is urgent to elucidate the kidney protective role of Rb3 in the process of CPT-treating oral cancer for Rb3's medicinal development and the clinic treatment of oral cancer.</p><p>TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> pathway is considered as an essential process of signal cascade response to the transforming growth to mediate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It exerts a variety of pathological and physiological function in the tumor progression, wound healing, immune response, and so on [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, several emerging shreds of evidences have shown that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> could serve as a tissue repair mediator to benefit or exacerbate the tissue damage in the brain, liver, and other tissues via mitochondrial apoptosis [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Jin et al. reported that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> contributed to LRG1-induced ischemia/reperfusion injury via apoptosis [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another study by Wang et al. also indicated that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> participated in the miRNA-590-5p-regulated chondrocyte apoptosis in response to the mechanical pressure injury [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Mitochondrial apoptosis is exceptionally essential to maintain the stabilization of homeostasis in the body, which could clean up the unwanted and abnormal cells according to a serious of programmed signal instruction of apoptosis factors. However, the disorder and despitefully employed apoptosis would result in normal cell death and tissue injury [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the treatment of cancer by CPT, enormous shreds of evidence confirmed that CPT induced the cell apoptosis and tissue injury in the normal kidney, liver, lung, and other tissues and eventually caused the severe toxicity effect [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This information implies that CPT-evoked kidney toxicity during the treatment of oral cancer may be associated to the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-induced mitochondrial apoptosis.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to confirm the role of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in the CPT-evoked kidney toxicity during the treatment of oral cancer and elucidate the underlying mechanism that Rb3 alleviates kidney toxicity by CPT via TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. First, the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral carcinoma cells ACC83 was constructed. The kidney toxicity by CPT, the protective effect of Rb3, and the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression in kidney tissue were evaluated. Second, the human renal epithelial GP-293 cells were employed to determine the effect of Rb3 and CPT on the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis. Finally, the role of the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway on Rb3 suppressing mitochondrial apoptosis evoked by CPT in GP-293 cells was studied.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. The Protective Effects of Rb3 on CPT-Evoked Kidney Toxicity in Xenograft Nude Mice</title><p>Bodyweight and histopathology are standard methods for the evaluation of medicinal toxicity. In the control group, the bodyweight of xenograft nude mice bearing oral carcinoma cells ACC83 had a linear increase from 0 to 28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The mice injected with CPT displayed a horizontal linearity in bodyweight which was evident beneath compared with that of the control group, demonstrating that CPT caused the bodyweight loss of mice. Expectedly, ginsenoside Rb3 (the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>) administration by gavage at 20&#x02009;mg/kg dosage in CPT&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rb3 groups alleviated the loss of bodyweight caused by CPT as determined by the bodyweight curve close to that of the control group. Furthermore, histopathology analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>) showed that numerous necrotic areas were found in the kidney tissue of the CPT group rather than that of the control group. Meanwhile, ginsenoside Rb3 pretreatment inhibited the necrosis of kidney tissue caused by CPT. These results indicated that ginsenoside Rb3 could protect against the CPT-evoked kidney toxicity in xenograft nude mice bearing an oral tumor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

As seen in the representative images of immunohistochemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>), kidney tissue of mice in the control group presented a normal cellular morphology and TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression. In contrast, CPT injection promoted the induction of deformed cellular morphology and TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression compared with these of the control group (<sup><italic>&#x02217;</italic></sup><italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). Conversely, Rb3 administration at 20&#x02009;mg/kg dose suppressed CPT-induced TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression and repaired the deformed cellular morphology in kidney tissue, and its levels were similar with these in the control group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). Additionally, Western blotting assay revealed the similar changing trend of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression with data obtained by immunohistochemical staining, which was that CPT induced the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression and Rb3 suppressed the induction of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression by CTP in kidney tissues of xenograft nude mice bearing oral tumor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. The Effects of Rb3 on the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> Signal Pathway in GP-293 Cells</title><p>To further evaluate the effect of Rb3 on the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway, we detected the expression and phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Smad3 using Western blotting assay in human renal epithelial GP-293 cells.

Following the treatment with Rb3 at different concentrations, the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression level and phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells were suppressed compared to the CPT group, and its suppression level was concentration-dependent.

The Effects of Rb3 on CPT-Evoked Mitochondrial Apoptosis in GP-293 Cells</title><p>In order to determine whether mitochondrial participated in Rb3 suppressing cellular apoptosis evoked by CPT, the mitochondrial membrane potential of GP-293 cells was detected by flow cytometry of JC-1 staining, and mitochondrial-related protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was probed by Western blotting. The histogram from flow cytometry analysis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>) showed that the fluorescence ratio of green/red in the cells of the CPT group is nearly four-folds to that in the control group and demonstrated that CPT induced mitochondrial depolarization which is the early event of cellular apoptosis.

Discussion</title><p>CPT has been commonly used in the treatment of oral cancer clinically for several decades; however, the toxicity to normal tissue including the kidney limited its benefits as an effective antitumor agent. Although it was in the vague understanding that how CPT induced kidney toxicity, some shreds of evidence have shown that the pathway of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are associated with the kidney toxicity by CPT. Additionally, the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> pathway plays a vital role in the kidney injury via kidney fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, and cellular apoptosis. However, the role of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in CPT-evoked kidney toxicity is rarely reported. In the present study, we found that CPT could induce the expression of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in the kidney tissue of the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral tumor and in the human renal epithelial cells GP-293; furthermore, CPT could also mediate the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway characterizing by the expression and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells. The results demonstrated that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> might take part in CPT-evoked kidney toxicity.</p><p>Rb3 is a representative triterpenoid saponin isolated from ginseng, which could exert various biological activities in the apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and others. Recent studies suggested that Rb3 could serve as a protective agent to alleviate the injury of kidney tissue, cardiomyocyte, and hippocampus [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The study by Xing et al. revealed that Rb3 protected against the CPT-induced kidney toxicity via the autophagy pathway mediated by AMPK and apoptosis [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In another study, Rb3 was reported to exert the cardioprotective effects via the activation of the antioxidation signaling pathway of PERK/Nrf2/HMOX1 in vivo and vitro [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the current research, we illustrated a novel mechanism that Rb3 might protect against CPT-evoked kidney toxicity via the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism confirmed that Rb3 suppressed the expression of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> induced by CPT in the kidney tissue of the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral tumor and in renal cells GP-293 and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells.</p><p>Apoptosis is a physiologically programmed cell death process to get rid of the unwanted and dysfunctional cells for maintaining the homeostasis of the body [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mitochondrial, recognized as the regulated center of cellular activities, controls the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation serving for nearly all of the cellular physiology. In the apoptosis progression, mitochondrial depolarization occurs as response to apoptosis stimuli, cytochrome C releases from mitochondrial, and the expression of apoptosis-related factor Bcl-2 and Bax in mitochondrial changes; following actives, the series of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase) of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 eventually induced the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and cell death [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Any disordered mitochondrial apoptosis section would cause functional cell death and trigger the normal tissue injury [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The research studies had confirmed that CPT evoked the kidney cell apoptosis via inducing Bax expression, inhibiting Bcl-2 expression, and activating caspase activities. TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> was also reported to take part in the cell apoptosis via mitochondrial. Our results implied that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> partly contributed to the CPT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, the present study revealed that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> is essential to Rb3 protecting against CPT-evoked apoptosis, which confirmed that Rb3 lost the protective effect in the pretreatment with the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> inhibitor of disitertide in kidney cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> pathway might contribute to CPT-evoked kidney toxicity, and Rb3 could exert a protective effect on the kidney toxicity through the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> pathway-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis during the treatment of oral cancer by CPT. Our finding provides a novel insight into the protective effect of Rb3 on CPT-evoked kidney toxicity. It is very significant for the development of Rb3 and the treatment of oral cancer in the clinic.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1102800 and 2016YFC1102805).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data generated or analyzed to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ghantous</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Abu Elnaaj</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global incidence and risk factors of oral cancer</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Harefuah</italic></source><year>2017</year><volume>156</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>645</fpage><lpage>649</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">29072384</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>D&#x02019;Souza</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Addepalli</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preventive measures in oral cancer: an overview</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Biomedicine &#x00026; Pharmacotherapy&#x02009;=&#x02009;Biomedecine &#x00026; Pharmacotherapie</italic></source><year>2018</year><volume>107</volume><fpage>72</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.biopha.2018.07.114</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-85050857336</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">30081204</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shibahara</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral cancer diagnosis and therapy</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Clinical Calcium</italic></source><year>2017</year><volume>27</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>1427</fpage><lpage>1433</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28947694</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keshavarzi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Darijani</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Momeni</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Molecular imaging and oral cancer diagnosis and therapy</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Journal of Cellular Biochemistry</italic></source><year>2017</year><volume>118</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>3055</fpage><lpage>3060</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/jcb.26042</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-85026916358</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28390191</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Varela-Centelles</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Castelo-Baz</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Seoane-Romero</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral cancer: early/delayed diagnosis</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">British Dental Journal</italic></source><year>2017</year><volume>222</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>p. 643</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.380</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-85018903009</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kanagalingam</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wahid</surname><given-names>M.
