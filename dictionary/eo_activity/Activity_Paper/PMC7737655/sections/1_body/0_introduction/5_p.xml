<p>Rehman et al. investigated the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic> and isolated two new flavone glycosides (
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (Rehman et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These two isolated compounds were evaluated for their potential against Î±-glucosidase, aldose reductase (ALR1 and ALR2). Compounds were only found active against ALR1 and ALR2.
