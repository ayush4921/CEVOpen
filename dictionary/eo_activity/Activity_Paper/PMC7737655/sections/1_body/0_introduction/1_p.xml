<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism attributed to low production of insulin or mounting resistance to its action leading to persistent hyperglycemia. DM affects about 5% of the population globally and its management exclusive of any side effects is still an issue that confronts the scientific community (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels are extensively known as one of the initial disease markers in the prediction of consequent micro-vascular and macro-vascular complications, which ultimately progresses to type 2 DM (Fonseca, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Type 2 DM usually results from defects in insulin secretion and its action. Such insufficiency leads to high concentrations of blood glucose, which sequentially damages many of the body's systems, particularly the blood vessels. Other complications include retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and angiopathy. One of the strategies for the management of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia by reducing glucose absorption from the intestinal tract. This strategy is based on the inhibition of key enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates to simple monosaccharides which are subsequently absorbed (Hussain et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Rahim et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Among these enzymes α-glucosidase is a crucial enzyme which is widely distributed in animals, plants, and microorganisms (Kimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This membrane-bound intestinal enzyme is implicated in the catabolism and liberation of α-glucose from the non-reducing side of the complex sugars, making them available for absorption (Nichols et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Thus, the administration of enzyme inhibitors will reduce the cleavage of dietary complex carbohydrates to simple monosaccharides, thus leading to a reduction in postprandial glucose levels and suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia (van de Laar, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).
