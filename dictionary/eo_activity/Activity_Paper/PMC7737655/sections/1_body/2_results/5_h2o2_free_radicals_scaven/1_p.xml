<p>In hydrogen peroxide radicals scavenging assay, Ec.Chf and Ec.Cr exhibited the highest radicals scavenging activity. Ec.Chf showed 75.46 ± 0.97, 68.16 ± 0.44, 54.06 ± 0.52, and 46.10 ± 0.58% anti-radicals activity at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml, respectively. For Ec.Cr, the observed scavenging efficiency was 75.16 ± 0.72, 66.06 ± 0.52, 55.10 ± 0.66, and 46.33 ± 0.52% at the same concentrations. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for Ec.Chf, Ec.Cr were 150 and 145 μg/ml respectively. Among other fractions, Ec.Hex caused 66.13 ± 0.46, 56.13 ± 0.69, 47.23 ± 0.61, and 36.03 ± 0.60% inhibitions at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively. The ABTS free radicals scavenging efficacy of Ec. EtAc was mediocre with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 330 μg/ml. The aqueous fraction showed the least activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 790 μg/ml. Standard drug ascorbic acid inhibitory activity was 85.13 ± 0.46, 74.13 ± 0.55, 65.46 ± 0.73, and 53.36 ± 0.63% at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 85 μg/ml.
