<p>Based on the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays of all fractions of 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic>, the chloroform fraction was selected for the 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> assay as can be seen in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In acute toxicity studies, the Ec.Chf was found to be safe, causing no mortality or unwanted reactions. The chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic> was observed to be a potent antidiabetic agent following the 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments. The Ec.Chf at concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 μg/kg body weight exhibited a blood glucose level of 10.3, 15.4, 16.8, 17.8, and 19.4 mmol/liter in mice. Obviously, the blood glucose level at 24 h and 500 μg/kg was 10.3 mmol/liter which was almost in comparison to the standard drug value which was 7.9 mmol/liter.
