<p>Chloroform fraction was analyzed by means of an Agilent USB-393752 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with HHP-5MS 5% phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA) equipped with an FID detector. The temperature of the oven was retained at 70°C for 1 min at first, and then raised at the rate of 6°C/min to 180°C for 5 min and to finish at the rate of 5°C/ min to 280°C for 20 min. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 290°C, correspondingly. Helium was utilized as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (Mahmood et al.,
