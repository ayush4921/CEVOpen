<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) scavenging capacity of plant samples were evaluated using the previously reported method (Ahmad et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In brief, 2 mM hydrogen peroxide solution was prepared in 50 mM phosphate buffer with 7.4 pH. Plants samples (0.1 ml) were taken in test tubes and their volumes were raised to 0.4 ml using 50 mM phosphate buffer solution. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.6 ml) was added to the tubes and were properly mixed using vertex mixer. Absorbance of each sample was measured at 230 nm against the blank after 10 min. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity was calculated using the equation;
