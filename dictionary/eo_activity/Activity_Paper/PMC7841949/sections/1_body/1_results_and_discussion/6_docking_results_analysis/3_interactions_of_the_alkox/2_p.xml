<p>However, compounds 
 <bold>23</bold> and 
 <bold>24</bold> have a common methanethiol group on the phenyl ring with different 
 <italic>meta</italic> and

 <bold>11</bold> was observed in making good interactions with active-site residues Glu233, Trp59, and leu162 (

 <bold>23</bold> shows higher activity (IC

 <bold>24</bold>. It may due to the
