<p>The docking study was used to explore the binding interactions of the ligand molecules into Î±-amylase active-site residues. At the end of docking simulation, the binding interactions of all of the 24 compounds were discussed and their 3D images were taken. From the docking study, it was revealed that the docked conformations of all of the compounds are appropriately oriented toward the catalytic residues, making sufficient interactions with the active-site residues Trp58, Trp59, Tyr62, Leu162, Arg195, Asp197, Glu233, Asp300, and His305 of the target enzyme.</p>
