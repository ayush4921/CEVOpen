<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1–7</bold> contain alkyl groups on the phenol moiety of the acetamide core structure at various ortho, meta, and para positions. Compound 
 <bold>22</bold> of this group containing chloro-methylphenyl group shows the best activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.33 ± 0.09 μM) against α-amylase enzyme. The NH group of the indole moiety of the compound makes a hydrogen bond with Asp300, and the phenol ring shows π–π interaction with Trp59 active-site residues. The activity may be due to the presence of chloro-methylphenyl moiety
