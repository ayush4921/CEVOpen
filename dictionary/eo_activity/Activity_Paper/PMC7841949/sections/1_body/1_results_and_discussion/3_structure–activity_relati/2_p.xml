<p>Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.15 ± 0.1 μM) bearing 
 <italic>para</italic> methoxy substituents displayed superior activity to methyl-substituted derivatives. Compound 
 <bold>9</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.42 ± 0.07 μM) having two methoxy groups 
 <italic>para</italic> to each other resulted in slightly decreased inhibition. Replacing one of the methoxy groups with methyl and changing their position in compound 
 <bold>10</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.24 ± 0.06 μM) resulted in better inhibition compared to compound 
 <bold>9</bold>. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>11</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.63 ± 0.1 μM) having 
 <italic>para</italic>-substituted butoxy group displayed similar activity to compound 
 <bold>12</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.64 ± 0.1 μM) with octyloxy substitution (
