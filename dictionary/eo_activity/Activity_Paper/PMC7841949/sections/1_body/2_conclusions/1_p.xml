<p>Indole-3-acetamides (
 <bold>1–24</bold>) were synthesized and evaluated for α-amylase inhibition along with antioxidant activity. All synthetic compounds displayed good inhibition against α-amylase. The synthetic molecules are also found to have good antioxidant potential. Among 24 derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>15</bold>, and 
 <bold>18</bold> were found to exhibit potential inhibition compared to the standard acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.92 ± 0.40 μM). The molecular docking studies identified the types of binding interactions, which helped the synthetic compounds to interact within the active site of enzyme. Thus, this study identified many lead candidates that can act as potential antidiabetic and antioxidant agents.
