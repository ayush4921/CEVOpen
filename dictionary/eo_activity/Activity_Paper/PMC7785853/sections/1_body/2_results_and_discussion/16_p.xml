<p>Based on the binding energy score, we suggest that these compounds can be tested against Coronavirus and used to develop effective antiviral drugs. Recently, plant compounds such as flavonoids showed good docking affinity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Jo et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and there are several reports on Indian medicinal plants used to treat SARS-CoV infections. In line with this, 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> was reported to suppress NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3, caspase-1 and IL-1 Î² activity on SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 virus (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>, Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Glycyrrhizin active compound from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> inhibits viral replication of the SARS-associated virus (Cinatl et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In addition to their ability to interfere with viral replication, andrographolide from 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> exhibits anticancer and immunostimulatory effects (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Similarly, Jain et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) reported that the polyherbal formulation of Nilavembu Kudineer has a prophylactic effect and antiviral effect against chikungunya and dengue virus infection. This study hypothesizes that a group of compounds from KK may exert its antiviral properties against novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by either blocking the host cell receptor or inhibiting the key viral protease required for its replication in the host cell. This study might render light on the drug discovery studies for the treatment of viral infections similar to SARS or COVID-19 in future.
