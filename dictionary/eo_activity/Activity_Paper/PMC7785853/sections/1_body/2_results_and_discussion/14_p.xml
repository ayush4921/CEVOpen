 <italic>Piper longum</italic> and Gamma sitosterol from 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) exhibits excellent binding energy against 3CL proviruses and it was found to be −79.94 and −81.94 kcal/mol which comprises of van der Waal interaction and hydrogen bonding interactions. The main active site and domain range of the Asarianin are Thyronine 239 and H-S. Likewise, Alanine 70 and V-M are the active site and binding domain of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> on Gammasitosterol. Mair et al. (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) reported the antiviral activity of piperamides from black pepper. It is the first report that 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum</italic> possesses antiviral properties on 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> by using 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis.
