<p>We selected 145 phyto-compounds from Kabasura kudineer complex (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A total of 145 two-dimensional ligands were generated with ACD chem sketch. The ligands extracted in the mol format were converted to pdb format using OPEN BABEL software (
