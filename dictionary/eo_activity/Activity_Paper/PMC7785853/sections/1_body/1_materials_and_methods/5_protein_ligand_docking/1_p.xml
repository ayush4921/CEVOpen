<p>After the compounds are screened, a virtual screening environment is created through an integrated tool iGEMDOCK. The tool affords the interactive interfaces to prepare both the binding site of the target protein and the screening compound library. Post-screening, each compound in the library is docked into the binding site and thereby generating the protein-compound interaction profiles of electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and van der Waals interactions. The tool then corroborates the pharmacological interactions and clusters the screening compounds for the post-screening analysis based on the interaction data and the compound structures, ranks and visualizes the screening compounds by combining the pharmacological interactions and energy-based scoring function. With the population size 800 set with 80 generation and 10 solutions, the ligands were subjected to very slow accurate docking and the docking pose and their corresponding energy values were analyzed.</p>
