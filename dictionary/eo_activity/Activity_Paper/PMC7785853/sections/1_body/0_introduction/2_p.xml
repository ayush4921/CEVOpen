<p>The HCoV is a positive sense virus with a single-stranded 30,000 bp RNA (+ssRNA). The virus consists of two clusters of proteins, namely (a) the non-structural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RRP) that is significant in the replication of the virus, and 3C-Like Protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) enzyme that cleaves the two polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) translated from viral RNA in the host cell, and (b) Spike proteins that help in fusion and entry of the virus into the host, Nucleocapsid, Matrix and Envelope proteins (Elfiky et al.,
