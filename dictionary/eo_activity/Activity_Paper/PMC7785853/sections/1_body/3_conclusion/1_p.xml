<p>The possible medications using natural compounds were screened from approved bioactive compound databases using molecular docking techniques. This research was aimed at identifying the molecules from natural products that could effectively inhibit the COVID-19 by acting on the main protease (Mpro). Obtained results from molecular docking showed that Acetoside, Luteolin 7 -rutinoside, rutin, Chebulagic acid, Syrigaresinol, Acanthoside, Violanthin, Andrographidine C, myricetin, Gingerenone -A, Tinosporinone, Geraniol, Nootkatone, Asarianin, and sitosterol are main compounds from KK plants which may inhibit COVID-19 giving a better energy score compared to synthetic drugs. Our data suggest these results encourage further
