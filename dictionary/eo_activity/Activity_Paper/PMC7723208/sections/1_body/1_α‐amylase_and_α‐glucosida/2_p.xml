<p>Carbohydrate digestibility has been reported to relate to elevated postprandial blood glucose. One of the strategies to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia is to limit the activity of carbohydrate digestive enzymes in intestinal tract. α‐Amylase is the key enzyme that degrades the polymeric substrate into shorter oligomers by catalyzing the hydrolysis of α‐1,4‐glucan linkages present in starch, maltodextrins, and other related carbohydrates (Truscheit et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). α‐Glucosidase has been found on the brush border of human intestinal mucosal cells (including maltase, α‐dextrinase, and sucrase). This enzyme participates in the body's carbohydrate metabolism and cuts glucose from the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide by hydrolyzing the α‐1,4‐glycosidic bond. The dietary starch and other related carbohydrates are digested by α‐amylase to large number of maltose, which is further digested by α‐glucosidase to glucose to be absorbed in human intestine (Vocadlo &amp; Davies, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Therefore, strict control of postprandial blood glucose by inhibiting α‐glucosidase and α‐amylase is significant for the development of diabetes and the prevention and treatment of diabetic patients (Elbein, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>; Tundis et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). α‐Amylase inhibitors (AIs) can act as carbohydrate blockers, limiting the digestibility and absorption of carbohydrate in the gastrointestinal diet (Horii et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). Clinically, AIs can be used to prevent diseases such as diabetes, hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, and obesity. Moreover, in most cases, the inhibitory mechanism of protein to α‐amylase occurs by directly blocking the active centers of several subsites of the enzyme (Françoise, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). To determine the inhibition of α‐amylase, the most widely used method is the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) assay, which is not selective for the reduction in oligosaccharide ends formed during hydrolysis (Bernfeld, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1955</xref>). The α‐glucosidase inhibitor (GI) inhibits α‐glucosidase activity by reversibly occupying α‐glucosidase and sugar‐binding sites, thereby reducing polysaccharide degradation, delaying intestinal absorption of carbohydrates, and achieving hypoglycemic effects. The most prominent feature of GIs is the inhibition of α‐glucosidase on the rate of intestinal carbohydrate decomposition (Larr, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Seifarth et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>), and it does not stimulate insulin secretion to lower blood sugar, thus not increasing the islet β‐cell burden. For α‐glucosidase, synthetic chromogenic molecular probes such as 
 <italic>p</italic>‐nitrophenyl‐glucoside (pNPG) are widely used assays because of the ease of measurement. Natural GIs include iminosugars, thiosugars, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes (Ghani,
