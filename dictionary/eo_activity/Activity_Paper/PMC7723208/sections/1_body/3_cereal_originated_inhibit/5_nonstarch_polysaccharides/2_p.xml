<p>Nonstarch polysaccharides with α‐glucosidase and α‐amylase inhibitory activities have been identified in barley, wheat, buckwheat, and corn silk (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The barley polysaccharide exhibited a noncompetitively inhibitory process toward α‐glucosidase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 22.49 mg/ml. The sulfation can significantly raise the enzyme inhibitory activity with increases in dose and the degree of substitution of sulfate group. However, the mechanism of sulfated polysaccharides against α‐glucosidase was reversible as a mixed one (Qian et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The oligosaccharide from barley malt defined as α‐pyran glucosan composed of four glucoses with (1 → 3) linkage was an effective α‐glucosidase inhibitors as acarbose (Shelat et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of crude oligosaccharides, pure oligosaccharides, and acarbose was 1.30, 0.48, and 0.26 mg/ml, respectively. A novel purified neutral polysaccharide (TBP‐II, 26 kDa) from buckwheat was reported to exhibit α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). TBP‐II was mainly consisted of galactose, arabinose, xylose, and glucose with a molar ratio of 0.7:1:6.3:74.2. The backbone of TBP‐II was composed of (1 → 4)‐linked‐d‐glucopyranosyl (
 <italic>Glcp)</italic>, while the branches comprised of (1 → 3)‐linked‐d‐glucopyranosyl (
 <italic>Glcp</italic>), (1 → 6)‐linked‐d‐galactopyranosyl (
 <italic>Galp</italic>), and (1 → 2,4)‐linked‐d‐rhamnopyranosyl (
 <italic>Rhap</italic>). TBP‐II exhibited an excellent inhibitory activity on α‐glucosidase, which was superior to acarbose and crude polysaccharide, and the percentage inhibition depended on the concentration of polysaccharides.
