<p>Some of the bioactive peptides generated from cereal proteins by enzymatic, or chemical hydrolysis and fermentation, have been reported to exhibit enzyme‐inhibiting activities (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The inhibition activity of peptides from rice bran protein on α‐amylase, ranged from 6.9 to 56.1 μg acarbose equivalent mg
 <sup>‐1</sup> protein, was generally correlated with the degree of protein hydrolysis (Uraipong &amp; Zhao, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Moreover, different fractions (albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutelin) of rice bran proteins, which were subjected to different protease hydrolysis (Alcalase, Neutrase, Flavourzyme, and Protamax), resulted in different activities. In general, highest inhibition activities were found with albumin and glutelin hydrolysates produced by Protamax‐ and Alcalase‐catalyzed hydrolysis. The results of this in vitro study highlight that the bioactivity of peptides in the hydrolysates is dependent on the proteolytic enzyme used. Accordingly, hydrolysates generated by 14 different enzymes from barley and brewers’ spent grain protein were evaluated for the α‐glucosidase and α‐amylase inhibition activities by Connolly et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The tryptic hydrolysate resulted in the highest inhibition of α‐glucosidase, which had increased from 12.43% inhibition for unhydrolyzed protein‐enriched isolates to 66.81% at 7.5 mg/ml. For α‐amylase inhibition, the unhydrolyzed isolates inhibited by 8.08% to 13.35% with the concentration increased from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/ml. However, no significant increases were found for all 14 hydrolysates. Additionally, the α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides may also be produced during digestion. Peptides released from quinoa during the in vitro duodenal phase showed the highest inhibitory effects, which reaching an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.19 mg protein/ml for α‐amylase inhibition and 1.75 mg protein/ml for α‐glucosidase inhibition, respectively (Vilcacundo et al.,
