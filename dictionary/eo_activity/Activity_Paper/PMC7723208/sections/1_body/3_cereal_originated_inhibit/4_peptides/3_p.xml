<p>The structure–activity relationships were studied for several identified peptides. The most potent α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptide identified is LQAFEPLR (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35.67 μg/ml) derived from oat globulin by trypsin hydrolysis. As demonstrated by Di Stefano et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity appears to occur more for peptides containing serine, threonine, tyrosine, lysine, or arginine at the N‐terminal, and a proline residue closer to the C‐terminal with methionine or alanine occupying the C‐terminal position. The roles of hydrophobic amino acids on the inhibition of α‐glucosidase were confirmed by Vilcacundo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Potential α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides identified in quinoa after digestion were IQAEGGLT and DKKYPK. Peptide IQAEGGLT containing three hydrophobic residues showed potent inhibitory activity toward α‐glucosidase via hydrophobic interaction. In case of α‐amylase inhibitory peptides, the aromatic–aromatic interactions between the enzyme residues and peptide arising from hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions, which may form a sliding barrier via a hydrogen bonding with the residues of the active/substrate‐binding region, are critically for the inhibitory activity (Siow &amp; Gan,
