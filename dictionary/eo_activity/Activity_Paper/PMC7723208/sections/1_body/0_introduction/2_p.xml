<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is commonly featured by postmeal or postprandial hyperglycemia. Nutritional strategies that designed to improve postprandial glycemia by reducing the glucose intake from the digestible carbohydrates were advised to the early‐stage diabetes patients before they were administered on pharmacologic treatment (Ch’ng et al.,

 <sc>d</sc>‐glucan‐glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2. 1.1) and α‐glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) are the two key enzymes involved in the carbohydrate digestion process (Dona et al.,

Inhibitors of α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase, which slow the final stages of carbohydrate digestion and consequently preventing the entry of glucose into the circulation, are considered as a viable prophylactic treatment of hyperglycemia. However, synthetic and chemical α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitors have certain adverse effects such as causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Chiasson et al.,
