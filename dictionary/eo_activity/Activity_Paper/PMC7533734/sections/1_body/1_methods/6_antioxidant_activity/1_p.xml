 </sup>. Briefly, a reaction mixture containing 2.5 mL of DPPH solution (0.13 mM) and 2.5 mL of each plant extract or standard (rutin and BHT) dissolved in methanol at varying concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 mg/mL), stirred and kept in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm and DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated as:
