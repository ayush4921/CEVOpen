 </sup>. 0.5 g of the pulverized leaves was mixed with 200mL of 10% acetic acid in ethanol. The mixture was covered, incubated at room temperature for 4 h, filtered and concentrated to about a quarter of its original volume in a water bath. To the extract, concentrated ammonium hydroxide was added in drops till precipitation was complete. After the solution was allowed to settle, precipitates obtained were washed with dilute ammonium hydroxide and then filtered. The residue was dried in an oven (40Â°C), weighed and the alkaloid content was determined using the following formula:
