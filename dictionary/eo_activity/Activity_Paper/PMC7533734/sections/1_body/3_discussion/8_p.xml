<p>In recent years, more attention has been given to the development of antibacterial drugs from medicinal plants instead of synthetic ones. The antibacterial activities of plant extracts have been confirmed against an array of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria

 </sup>. The resistance of all the bacterial strains to the aqueous extract at all concentrations tested and the significant antibacterial activity of the blanched extract obtained in the present study, could be attributed to poor solubility of the antibacterial compounds in cold water and high extractive power of boiled water. In addition, the higher antibacterial activity observed in the acetone and ethanol extracts could be due to relatively higher flavonoid and phenolic contents present
