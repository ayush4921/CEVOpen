<p>Ethanol has been reported to be suitable for extraction of compounds with a wide range of polarity while water is suitable for very polar compounds

 </sup>. Consequently, a higher quantity of phenolic compounds, proanthocyanidin and flavonoids were observed in the ethanol samples when compared to the acetone, blanched and aqueous extracts; hence, better activity. This is in agreement with previous reports that ethanol is more suitable for the extraction of phenolic compounds in plants

 </sup>. Furthermore, high phenolic compounds were indicated in ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, suggesting the reason for its high antioxidant activity
