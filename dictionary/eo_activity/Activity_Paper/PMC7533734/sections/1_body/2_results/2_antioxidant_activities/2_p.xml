 </bold> The total antioxidant capacity of the extracts and standards (BHT and rutin) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. There was a dose dependent increase in total antioxidant capacity of the samples, with the ethanol extract showing the highest antioxidant capacity when compared with other extracts. Based on the IC 
 <sub>50</sub>, (
