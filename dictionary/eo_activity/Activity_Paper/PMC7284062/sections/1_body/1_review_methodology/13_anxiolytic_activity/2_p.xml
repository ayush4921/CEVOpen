<p id="p0085">The tranquilizing and ability to lessen anxiety of methanol, aqueous, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> leaves at body weights of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg was appraised in mice via EPM model, diazepam (standard drug) (2 mg/kg) by actophotometre. Methanolic extract and diazepam displayed comparable activities in lengthening the time spent by test organisms in open arms and improve locomotory behaviour [

 <italic>S. media</italic> was assessed on Swiss albino mice via EPM model. The fraction and diazepam exhibited comparable activity at 20 mg/kg, po and 2 mg/kg respectively, thus, justifying the ethnomedical claim of
