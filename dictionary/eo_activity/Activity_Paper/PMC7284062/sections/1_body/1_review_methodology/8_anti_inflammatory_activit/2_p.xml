The inflammatory effect of methanolic leaf extract (MLE) was investigated on test rats of different body weights (100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg). Pronounced reduction in inflammation was exhibited on formalin-induced paw lick and albumen induced paw oedema after oral administration of MLE, indomethacin (5 mg/kg b.w) and distilled water (10 mg/kg b.w). Also, MLE considerably inhibited egg albumen-induced paw oedema at p &lt; 0.05 [
