 <italic>S. media</italic> was assessed for their hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic potential in alloxan induced diabetic mice using established documented procedures. Significant inhibitory activity was exhibited by pancreatic β-glucosidase and α-amylase. This instigated significant reduction in fasting blood sugar, serum transaminase and HbA1c (−48.4%) of tested organism when compared to control model. Also, blood glucose levels were acceptably maintained [
