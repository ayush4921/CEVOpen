<p id="p0040">Phytochemical appraisals of extracts and fractions of different parts of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> have led to identification of about 50 bioactive metabolites. Few chemical compounds have been reported from bioassay isolation of different crude or purified fractions. Most of the bioactive metabolites reported till date belongs to phenolic compounds and saponins. Preliminary phytochemical investigation of ethanolic, ethyl acetate, methanolic, chloroform and aqueous extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, fatty acids, tannins, terpenoids and phenolic compounds, however, phlobatannins and anthraquinones were undetected [
