<p id="p0090">Up to date, few studies have appraised the immunology or inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> against Leishmania parasites. In recent times, alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> was appraised on 
 <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> KWH23 promastigote isolated from an infected patient in Peshawar, Pakistan, sprouted in M199 medium with HEPES buffer, 10% FCS, penicillin and streptomycin. The isolated parasite was cultured on a microtitter plate and incubated at 24 °C for 72 h. The inhibitory effect of the alcoholic extracts was appraised in microscope with aid of Neubauer counting chamber. From observation, methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts significantly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic> with inhibitory activity of 185.9 ± 7.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 36.4 ± 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL respectively, however, glucantime exhibited weak activity of 5.6 ± 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
