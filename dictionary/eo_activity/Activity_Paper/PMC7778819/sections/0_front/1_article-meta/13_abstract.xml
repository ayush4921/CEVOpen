  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Patients with lymphoedema are at high risk of getting bacterial and fungal wound infections leading to acute inflammatory episodes associated with cellulitis and erysipelas. In Ethiopia, wound infections are traditionally treated with medicinal plants.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Agar well diffusion and colorimetric microdilution methods were used to determine the antibacterial activity of methanol extracts of the three medicinal plants against 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella alage</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCCÂ®43300TM, 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC25923, 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922, 
   <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC700603, and 
   <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC37853.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The methanol extract of 
   <italic>L. inermis</italic> leaves showed high activity against all tested bacterial species, which was comparable to the standard drugs. Similarly, the extracts of 
   <italic>A. indica</italic> showed activity against all tested species though at higher concentrations, and higher activity was recorded against 
   <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolates at all concentrations. However, the extract of 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic> showed the lowest activity against all tested species except 
   <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolates. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was recorded with the extract of 
   <italic>L. inermis</italic> against 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate and 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Methanol extracts of 
   <italic>L. inermis, A. indica</italic>, and 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic> leaves exhibited antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial isolates involved in wound infections, of which the methanol extracts of 
   <italic>L. inermis</italic> exhibited the highest activity. The results of the present study support the traditional use of plants against microbial infections, which could potentially be exploited for the treatment of wound infections associated with lymphoedema.
