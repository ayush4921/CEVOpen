<p id="Par47">Fresh cultures of bacteria were prepared from frozen stock, streaked on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in an incubator. After- 18-24 h of incubation, a single colony of microorganisms was picked and inoculated into 3 mL sterile saline solution. The saline tube was then vortexed to create a uniform solution, and turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL).
