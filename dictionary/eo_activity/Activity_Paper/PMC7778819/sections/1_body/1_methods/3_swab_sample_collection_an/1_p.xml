<p id="Par33">Wounds were cleaned with sterile normal saline and wound swabs and discharge were obtained from all study participants aseptically using a sterile moistened cotton swab. Swabs were then immersed in a container of Amies transport medium with charcoal (Bio mark Laboratories, Pune, India). All samples were transported on ice to the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, National Referral Bacteriology and Mycology Laboratory (Ethiopian National Accreditation Office accredited and ranked as Five Star by the American Society for Microbiology) where all laboratory tests were conducted. Swabs were used to inoculate MacConkey agar (Becton Dickinson and Company, Cockeysville, MD, USA), blood agar and mannitol salt agar (both from HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) and incubated aerobically at 37 °C, and 5% CO2 for 24 h. After 24 h, plates without growth were incubated further for up to 48 h.</p>
