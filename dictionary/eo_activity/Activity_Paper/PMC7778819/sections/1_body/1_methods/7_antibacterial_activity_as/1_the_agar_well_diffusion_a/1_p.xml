<p id="Par48">The Kirby-Bauer technique was used to determine the antibacterial activity of the extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A total of 11 bacteria strains were used for this test. Mueller Hinton agar (pH 7.2 &amp; 4 mm depth) plates were inoculated with test organisms (prepared in a sterile saline tube) by streaking the loop in a back-and-forth motion to ensure an even distribution of inoculum. MHA with 5% sheep blood was used for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. A circular 6 mm diameter well was punched aseptically with a sterile cork borer. Then, a volume of 100 μL methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic>, 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> leaves (at concentrations of 100 mg/mL, 200 mg/mL, and 400 mg/mL) were dispensed into the wells. Similarly, 5% Di-methyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) was dispensed into the control well, and reference antibiotic discs were placed on the surface of the plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. For 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes,</italic> a carbon dioxide incubator was used for incubation. Each experiment was done three times.
