<p id="Par73">The MIC values obtained from the present study indicated that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> leaves was more potent against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, which agrees with the initial antimicrobial screening test results (agar well diffusion test). Strong antibacterial activity was also observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, MRSA ATCCÂ® 43300TM, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC27853 at low concentrations of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> extract. The results of our study agree with those of previous report from Jordan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The differences in bacterial susceptibility could be due to variations in intrinsic tolerance of microorganisms, or the physico-chemical properties of phytochemicals present in the crude extracts of the plant materials [
