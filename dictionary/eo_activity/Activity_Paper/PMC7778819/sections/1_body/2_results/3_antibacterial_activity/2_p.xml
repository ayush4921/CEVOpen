<p id="Par54">Generally, it was observed that bacterial growth inhibition increased as the concentration of the extracts increased. Pairwise comparison of ANOVA was used to test the variability in susceptibility of the microorganisms toward the extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed in terms of susceptibility between 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates and ATCC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.91), 
 <italic>S. algae</italic> isolates and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.74), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.89), 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates and MRSA ATCC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.0), or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.0). There was a significant difference in the zone of inhibition between 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> and the other two plant extracts, 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic>. However, no significant growth inhibition difference was detected between 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.55).
