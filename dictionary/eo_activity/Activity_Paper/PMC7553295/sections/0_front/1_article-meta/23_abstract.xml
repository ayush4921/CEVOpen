 <p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic helminthiasis caused by different species of the genus 
  <italic>Echinococcus</italic>, and is a major economic and public health concern worldwide. Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the 
  <italic>in vitro/in vivo</italic> scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against 
  <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000â€“2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against 
  <italic>E</italic>. 
  <italic>granulosus</italic> worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against 
  <italic>E</italic>. 
  <italic>granulosus</italic> belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of 
  <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> and 
  <italic>Ferula asafetida</italic> at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. 
  <italic>Z</italic>. 
  <italic>multiflora</italic> also depicted high 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against 
  <italic>E</italic>. 
  <italic>granulosus</italic>. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against 
  <italic>E</italic>. 
  <italic>granulosus</italic>, if further investigated for 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.
