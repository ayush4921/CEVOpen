<p>A moderate positive correlation was found between the IA and the total phenolic content, the highest with TI (

 </xref>, supporting the importance of phenolics in this biological activity. Conversely, for total flavonoid content no correlation was observed with both inhibitory activities. However, the eleven most active extracts resulted interestingly enriched in flavonoids (ranging from 1.47 to 56.47 mg RE/g of extract) and phenolics (ranging from 37.43 to 123.56 mg GAE/g of extract), which indicate also a potential activity as antioxidant agents.
