<p>Eleven extracts out of ninety resulted promisingly active against enzymes of cosmetic interest, showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values comparable or even lower than positive controls (PMSF and kojic acid). In particular, four out of them inhibited both enzymes, five tyrosinase only and two acted prominently only against elastase. For 
 <italic>C. officinarum</italic> (aerial parts), 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (barks), 
 <italic>R.nigrum</italic> (leaves), 
 <italic>T. platyphyllos</italic> (flowers and bracts) and 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> (leaves) the activity against one or both enzymes was reported for the first time, providing a new perspective for the use of these plants. Among them, 
 <italic>C. officinarum</italic> (aerial parts) resulted one of the most potent EI, while 
 <italic>R. nigum</italic> (leaves) and 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> (leaves) showed the highest inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. The plants active against both enzymes (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic>, 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic>, 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic>) are potentially useful to develop cosmetics endowed with both skin-whitening and anti-wrinkles effect. The five plants active against tyrosinase only (
 <italic>G. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>R. nigrum</italic>, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>T. platyphyllos</italic>) are suitable for skin whitening agents, and the two active only against elastase (
 <italic>C. officinarum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>) are interesting for selective anti-wrinkles cosmetics. Moreover, these plants resulted also enriched in polyphenols and flavonoids, conferring them additional antioxidant properties relevant for cosmetic ingredients and the total phenolic content showed a linear correlation with the enzymatic inhibitory activities.
