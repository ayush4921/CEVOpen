 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have been widely used, more recent studies have pointed out some limitations in these previous analytical methods, and propose a Bayesian approach in order to analyse the over- and underused plant groups [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This method allows us to consider the uncertainty of the proportion of medicinal plant species in the overall flora and shows its robustness in small datasets [
