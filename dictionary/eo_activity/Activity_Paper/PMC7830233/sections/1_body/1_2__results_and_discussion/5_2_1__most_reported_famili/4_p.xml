<p>Moerman [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] concluded that although in a random universe the size of a family would be the best predictor of its medicinal potential in number of taxa, the Asteraceae contain more medicinal plants than random would indicate, so that size is not the only condition for this success. Moerman et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found, through a comparative analysis of several geographically distant medicinal floras, that the five most important medicinal plant families in four very differentiated regions (North America, Korea, Kashmir, Chiapas highlands) were delineated by only nine plant families (Araceae, Bignoniaceae, Ericaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Loganiaceae, Malvaceae, Rosaceae, Solanaceae), accounting for the existence of a global pattern of human knowledge. Indeed, to include a fifth area (Ecuador), only three more families were necessary (Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae). In the same line, six out of the top ten families in the present study are among the 14 most quoted ones in the five North American, Mesoamerican, South American and Asian territories investigated by Moerman et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], those reported above plus Liliaceae and Ranunculaceae. The only top families in this paper not appearing in Moerman et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] are Adoxaceae, Oleaceae, Pinaceae and Rutaceae (considering the Amarillydaceae included in the Liliaceae 
 <italic>lato sensu</italic>, as this family was referred to in the aforementioned work).
