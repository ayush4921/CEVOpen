<p>The 120 families recorded are represented herein by 432 genera. If we analyse the number of genera per family, the results vary slightly, and families with more genera are Asteraceae (52), Fabaceae (30) and Lamiaceae (25). Apart from the two families with the most use reports, here appears the Fabaceae family (765 UR, 1.61%), although not being among the top ten. Despite not having a high percentage, Fabaceae is a relevant family in the Mediterranean flora (even being indicative of the Mediterranean character of a territory; [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]) and ethnoflora [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Conversely, Adoxaceae with a large number of use reports (1,971 UR, 4.14%) is very asymmetrically distributed in only two genera, 
 <italic>Sambucus</italic> (99.9%) and 
 <italic>Viburnum</italic> (0.1%), which would be explained by the change of family, since they previously belonged to the Caprifoliaceae, yet with the APG system, a new familiar delimitation of the Adoxaceae was created for these two genera, and for three more not present in our territory. On the other hand, there are 60 botanical families in which all the reports are grouped in a single genus. Some examples, representing pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, are the Equisetaceae, a family with 578 UR exclusive of the genus 
 <italic>Equisetum</italic>, the only one in the family to be present in the studied area, and the Taxaceae and the Juglandaceae families, with 17 and 570 UR respectively, exclusively represented by their corresponding single species growing in the area, 
 <italic>Taxus baccata</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> L. There are also families that concentrate all the medicinal records in one genus, although they have other representatives in the territories studied like Liliaceae 
 <italic>stricto sensu,</italic> with six genera in the concerned area, but with all UR from only one, 
 <italic>Lilium</italic>.
