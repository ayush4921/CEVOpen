<p id="p0090">Antioxidant capacity was evaluated by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Different concentrations (800, 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 μg/mL) of extracts were dissolved in methanol. 3.0 mL of 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH was added to each test tube. The mixture was incubated for 30 min in dark condition. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm in a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The percent inhibition activity was calculated from [(A
 <sub>C</sub>-A
 <sub>S</sub>)/A
 <sub>C</sub>] × 100, where A
 <sub>C</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A
 <sub>S</sub> is the absorbance of the sample. The inhibition curves were prepared and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated by using non-linear regression analysis in Graphpad Prism 6.0.
