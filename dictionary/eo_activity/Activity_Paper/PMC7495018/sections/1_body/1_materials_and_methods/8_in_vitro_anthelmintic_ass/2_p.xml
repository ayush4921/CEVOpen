<p id="p0095">The anthelmintic activity was performed according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The experiments were carried out using aquarium worm (
 <italic>Tubifex tubifex</italic>) due to its anatomical resemblance with the human intestinal roundworm parasites. They were collected from a local aquarium shop located at Kataban, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Five different concentrations of extract (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 mg/mL) were used for the experiment. Levamisole (Etrax®, ACI Limited, Bangladesh) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL was used as a positive control and distilled water was used as a negative control. The experiment was carried out in small beakers (50 mL). Five mL of extracts were taken in each beaker. For every concentration of each extract, three beakers were taken as biological replicates. In each beaker, ten worms were placed. The time was noted using a stopwatch. Two different times such as time for paralysis and time for death was noted. The mean time for paralysis (min) was noted when the movement was stopped except when the worms were shaken vigorously; the time of death (min) was recorded after the confirmation of no sign of movement when shaken vigorously or placed in warm water.
