<p id="p0120">Analgesic activity was evaluated by the test of abdominal writhing induced by acetic acid in mice as described previously [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A total of fourty Swiss albino mice was taken in each test and fasted for 18 h with free access to water. Each test was performed thrice. The mice were divided into eight groups, containing five mice in each group. Group 1 and 2 received two different doses of DrFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 3 and 4 received two doses of CfFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Whereas Group 5 and 6 received two doses of LsFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 7 received standard drug (Aspirin at 200 mg/kg body weight). Group 8 was treated with distilled water (10 mL/kg body weight), which served as negative control. After 45 min of respective treatment, each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 0.7% (v/v) acetic acid at a dose of 10 mL/kg body weight. 15 min later of the injection, the number of writhing responses of each mouse was counted for a 5 min period. To calculate the percentage of inhibition of writhing, the following formula was used:
 <disp-formula id="ufd3">Inhibition (%) = [1− {No. of writhing (positive control or extracts) / No. of writhing (negative control)}] × 100.</disp-formula>
