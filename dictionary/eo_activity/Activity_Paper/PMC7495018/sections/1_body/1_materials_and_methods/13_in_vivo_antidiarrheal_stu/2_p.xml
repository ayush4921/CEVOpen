<p id="p0125">The antidiarrheal activity was tested according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Forty Swiss albino mice were taken in each test and fasted for 18 h with free access to water. Each test was performed thrice. The mice were divided into eight groups, containing five mice in each group. Group 1 and 2 received two different doses of DrFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 3 and 4 received two doses of CfFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Whereas Group 5 and 6 received two doses of LsFME (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight) respectively. Group 7 received standard drug (Loperamide hydrochloride at 3.0 mg/kg body weight). Group 8 was treated with distilled water (10 mL/kg body weight), which served as negative control; After 30 min of the administration, all mice received 0.5 mL of castor oil orally to initiate diarrhea and were individually placed in cages on blotting paper. At every hour, the paper was changed. During an observation period of 5 h, the number of diarrheal feces was recorded and the percentage of inhibition of defecation was calculated for every group of animals by the following formula:
 <disp-formula id="ufd4">Inhibition (%) = [1− {No. of diarrheal feces (positive control or extracts) / No. of diarrheal feces (negative control)}] × 100.</disp-formula>
