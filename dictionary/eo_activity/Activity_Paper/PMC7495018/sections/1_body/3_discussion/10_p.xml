<p id="p0230">Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the body is unable or inadequately produce insulin while in the case of type 2 diabetes, insulin is less prevalent in the bloodstream or less properly utilized. High blood sugar levels lead to a condition called hyperglycemia when insulin is not provided to utilize glucose diabetes [

This may be because of the amount of flavonoids and phenols it posses. Flavonoids have been studied concerning diabetes mellitus, either through the inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidase enzyme or through their capacity to avoid glucose absorption and/or to improve glucose tolerance [
