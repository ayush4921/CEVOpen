<p id="p0175">In the acetic acid-induced writhing test, all the experimental mice displayed writhing after the administration of acetic acid. The results are represented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. After administration of the extracts the reduction of writhing served as a basis where the best activity was shown by the CfFME at the 400 mg/kg body weight dose where the number of writhing was 14.4 ± 2.6 and the inhibition was 64.34%. This was very close to the inhibition (74.72%) observed after the treatment with aspirin which showed the lowest number of writhing compared to any other treatment groups with extracts. Among the other treatments with DrFME (400 mg/kg body weight) and LsFME (400 mg/kg body weight) showed inhibition (%) which are (51.20%) and (32.63%) respectively.
