<p id="p0180">In the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antidiarrheal study, castor oil was used to induce diarrhea in mice, and then extracts were administered to see the inhibition of diarrhea. The results are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. From the result, all the extracts showed good antidiarrheal activity, while DrFME served as the best among them. The doses of DrFME (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) dose-dependently reduced the total number of diarrheal feces. The percentage inhibition of diarrhea was 70.27% and 46.15% respectively. Among the other treatments with LsFME (400 mg/kg body weight) and CfFME (400 mg/kg body weight) showed inhibition (%) which are 61.27% and 57.67% respectively. Loperamide hydrochloride was administered as a positive control which achieved 85.39% inhibition of diarrhea.
