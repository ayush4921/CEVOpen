<p id="p0165">To explore the action in the plasma coagulation cascade, citrated human plasma clotting time was analyzed. The results of anticoagulant activity are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The results were shown in terms of prothrombin time (PT) test and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test. All three extracts were utilized in three different concentrations and found to be effective as anticoagulants as they extended the time of coagulation at different concentrations. However, comparatively, DrFME was found to be more effective because of providing greater anticoagulant activity. In the case of PT, the standard reference time of clotting is 12-15 s. After adding the extracts the time extends to 41 s for DrFME, followed by 35 s for LsFME and 32 s for CfFME at their 1.0 mg/mL extract concentration. In the case of aPTT, the standard reference time of clotting is 25-39 s. After adding the extracts the time extends to 50 s for DrFME, followed by 48 s for LsFME and 42 s for CfFME at their 1.0 mg/mL extract concentration.
