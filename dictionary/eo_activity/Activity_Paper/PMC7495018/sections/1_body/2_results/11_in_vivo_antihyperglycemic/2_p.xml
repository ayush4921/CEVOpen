<p id="p0185">Administration of the extracts to the glucose-loaded mice resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of blood glucose. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The highest activity was shown by LsFME, where at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight, lowering of blood glucose levels in experimental mice were 26.8% and 46.94% respectively, compared to the lowering (53.95%) in mice by the positive control Glibenclamide. Among the other treatments with DrFME (400 mg/kg body weight) and CfFME (400 mg/kg body weight) showed inhibition (%) which are 16.60% and 12.50% respectively.
