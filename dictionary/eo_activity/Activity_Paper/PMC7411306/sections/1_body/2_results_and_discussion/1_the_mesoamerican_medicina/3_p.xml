<p>The many species of Asteraceae (226), Fabaceae (194), Euphorbiaceae (85) and Lamiaceae (79) reported for medicinal purposes in the 28 studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Table 4.3</bold> in the

 </xref>) reflect the floristic representation of these plant families in the region (see 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Bye and Linares, 2015</xref>, p. 394). The use consensus of Asteraceae is on digestive (D; 54% spp./19.5% use-records) and inflammatory skin disorders (S; 47.8% spp./12.8% use-records) but the characteristic presence of cytotoxic sesquiterpene lactones in this family can lead to allergenic reactions (
 <xref rid="B417" ref-type="bibr">Siedle et al., 2004</xref>). The family with the highest share of species for skin disorders in the MAMPDB are the Solanaceae (66.2% spp./20.8% use-records) and the Euphorbiaceae (64.7% spp./24.7% use-records.), the latter notorious for their proinflammatory properties (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Evans and Taylor, 1983</xref>). The family showing the highest share for A ‘unspecified’ are the Solanaceae (61.8% spp./18.6% use-records), Lamiaceae are most frequently used for digestive problems (D; 73.4% spp./20% use-records) and Fabaceae for skin disorders (S; 51% spp./15.6% use-records).
