<p>The list of medicinal species reviewed in

  <bold>Table 3</bold>
 </xref> constitutes a data collection that can be drawn on by the Mexican Herbal Pharmacopoeia Committee for increasing the Appendix VI (list of species with medical use in Mexico). Appendix VI is the prelude to the monographs of medicinal plants contained in the Pharmacopoeia and could be used to promote a better integration of native Mesoamerican species into that regulatory document. It should also be considered that knowledge about herbal remedies is increasingly shaped by literature and popular media, through which global trends in T&amp;CM are introduced to local communities.
