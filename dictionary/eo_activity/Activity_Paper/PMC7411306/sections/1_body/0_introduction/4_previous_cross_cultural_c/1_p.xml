<p>Several national and regional compilations of medicinal plants exist in Mexico, covering over 3,000 botanical taxa (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Argueta and Zolla, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Bye etÂ al., 1995</xref>). Unfortunately, these often demonstrate serious methodological deficits, particularly in regard to taxonomic identification and interpretation of ethnomedical data (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Bye and Linares, 2015</xref>, p. 396-397). Further, the lacking quantification of traditional uses limit the utility of these compilations for the identification of cross-culturally salient taxa.
