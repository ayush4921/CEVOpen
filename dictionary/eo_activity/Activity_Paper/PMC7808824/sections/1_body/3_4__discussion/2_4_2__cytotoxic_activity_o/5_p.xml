<p>A number of studies about the pharmacological properties of plant metabolites support the findings of this study. The majority of plant-based secondary metabolites are phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. All of these natural products possess diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, including cytotoxicity and chemoprevention of carcinogenesis. Flavonoids, triterpenoids, and steroids in particular exert multiple biological effects due to their antioxidant and free radical scavenging mode of action [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Further studies have shown particular antioxidant and cytotoxic activities to be associated with a variety of chemical classes of compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins [

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A phenol derivative and triterpenes have been isolated from

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, nine chemical compounds, five bibenzyls, three phenanthrenes, and one coumarin derivative have been identified from 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>. One of them, isolated from the stem, exhibited antioxidant activity [
