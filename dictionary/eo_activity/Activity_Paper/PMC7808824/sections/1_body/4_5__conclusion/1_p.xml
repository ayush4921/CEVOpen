<p>The present findings, based on these first cellular studies, establish the orchid species, 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>, as a novel source of active agents with the potential for treating human malignancies. Both wild samples and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-grown protocorm mass of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> exhibited cytotoxic activities in a dose-dependent manner against selected cancer cell lines of human cervical carcinoma and human glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>-cultured protocorms were comparable to wild stems in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in HeLa and U251 cell lines, respectively. Therefore, protocorm 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture offers a highly suitable process for the production of the investigated pharmacologically useful compounds contained in protocorm samples. Further work on the isolation and pharmacological validation against a range of targets and medical indications of bioactive compounds derived from protocorms is needed. However, this may underscore the general attractive utility that protocorms are a potential source for the commercial production of desirable metabolites from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Such technology implementation would certainly augment to vast extent very much needed efforts to minimize the pressure on the natural population and their entire habitats of threatened but commercially important medicinal orchids in Nepal.
