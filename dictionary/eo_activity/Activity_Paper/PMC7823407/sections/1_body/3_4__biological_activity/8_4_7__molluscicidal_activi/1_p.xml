<p>Regarding the effects of fruit extracts on juvenile and adult 
 <italic>Bulinus globosus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. truncatus,</italic> two Planorbid (ramshorn) freshwater snails have been reported [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. LC
 <sub>95</sub> values were 16.9 and 19.7 μg/mL and 14.2 and 12.0μg/mL for juvenile and adults of 
 <italic>B. globosus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. truncatus</italic>, respectively. Seed, endocarp, mesocarp and whole fruit extracts were assessed against adult 
 <italic>Biomphalaria pfeifferi,</italic> another Planorbid snail, and 
 <italic>Lymnaea natalensis,</italic> a Lymnaeid pond snail [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. LC
 <sub>90</sub> values were 77.70, 120.04, 89.50 and 97.55 mg/L against 
 <italic>Biomphalariapfeifferi</italic> for seed, endocarp, mesocarp and whole fruit extracts, respectively, and 102.30, 138.21, 115.42 and 127.69 mg/L against 
 <italic>Lymnaeanatalensis.</italic> Furthermore, the molluscicidal activity of seed oil on 
 <italic>Monacha cartusiana</italic>, a Hygromiid land snail, has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Bioactive compounds were identified as saponins, such as diosgenin, yamogenin and 3,5-spirostadiene.
