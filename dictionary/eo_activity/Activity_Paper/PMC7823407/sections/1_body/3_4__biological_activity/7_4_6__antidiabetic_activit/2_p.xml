<p>Hassanin et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] tested a crude ethanolic fruit extract and its butanolic and dichloromethane fractions on stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK-JNK) signaling in experimental diabetic rats. Six groups of male Wistar rats were used: normal control, diabetic, diabetic rats treated with crude, butanol or dichloromethane factions (50 mg/kg body weight), and diabetic rats were treated with gliclazide as a reference drug. Treatments continued for one month. Extract treatments produced a reduction in plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lactic acid, lipid profile and malondialdehyde levels, which induced an increase in insulin and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities. Moreover, the authors observed the downregulation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and protein 53 and the upregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 in rat pancreas. Glucose transporter 4 was upregulated in rat muscle. Liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis identified balanitin-2, hexadecenoic acid, methyl protodioscin and 26-(O-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-β-[4-O-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-O-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy]-22,26-dihydroxyfurost-5-ene in crude extract and balanitin-1 and trigonelloside C in butanol and dichloromethane fractions of crude extract. Ezzat et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] isolated several compounds from pericarp, including stigmasterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>a</bold>), a pregnane glucoside: pregn-5-ene-3β,16β,20(R)-trio1-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>b</bold>); a furostanol saponin: 26-(O-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-22-O-methylfurost-5-ene-3β,26-diol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>c</bold>). The latter component possessed significant α-glucodidase (AG) and aldose reductase inhibitory activities in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Compound (
 <bold>c</bold>) also caused a significant increment in insulin and C-peptide levels.
