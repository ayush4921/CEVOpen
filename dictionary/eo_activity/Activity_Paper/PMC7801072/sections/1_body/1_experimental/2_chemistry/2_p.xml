<p>All reagents were obtained commercially and were used without further purification. Solvents were dried according to standard procedures. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes and were uncorrected. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were measured on an AV-300 (Bruker, Switzerland), and all chemical shifts were given in ppm relative to TMS. Mass spectra were measured on a HP1100LC (Agilent Technologies). High-resolution mass spectra were measured on an MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Germany).
