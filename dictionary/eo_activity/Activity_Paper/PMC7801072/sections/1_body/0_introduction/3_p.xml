<p>Carbazole alkaloids have attracted considerable attention in medicinal chemistry because they exhibit a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, antituberculous, antitumour, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties

 </xref>. Dihydrotriazine compounds have a higher hydrophobicity compared with guanidine compounds and several molecules containing this scaffold have been reported as antibacterial agents

 </xref>. Recent studies have identified dihydrotriazine-containing compounds as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 7,8-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate, which is involved in metabolic reactions such as purine and thymidine nucleotide biosynthesis
