<p>The steady increase of microbial pathogens that do not respond to conventional treatments presents a significant threat to global public health. Fungal and bacterial infections are becoming progressively more resistant towards currently available antimicrobial medicines, such as antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for new drugs that target these pathogens. Without effective antimicrobials for prevention and treatment of infections, medical procedures such as organ transplantation, chemotherapy, diabetes management and routine surgery (e.g. caesarean sections or hip replacements) have a significantly higher risk of morbidity and mortality
