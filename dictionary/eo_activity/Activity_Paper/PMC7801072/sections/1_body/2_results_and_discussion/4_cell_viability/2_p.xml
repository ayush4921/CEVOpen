<p>To determine whether the synthesised compounds were selectively toxic towards microbes and not human cells, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of six compounds in two gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901 and AGS) and a normal human liver cell line (L-02) using a standard technique. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the cytotoxicities of compounds 
 <bold>8b</bold>, 
 <bold>8d</bold>, 
 <bold>8f</bold> and 
 <bold>8k</bold> were lower than that of compounds 
 <bold>9b</bold> and 
 <bold>9e</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>8b</bold>, 
 <bold>8d</bold>, 
 <bold>8f</bold> and 
 <bold>8k</bold> had no effect on human liver cell viability at their MICs and, in addition, their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were significantly higher than their MIC values. However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the series 
 <bold>9</bold> compounds were close to their MIC values, which make it likely that the promising antibacterial activity of these compounds is due to their cytotoxic properties.
