<p>The mechanism underlying the antiproliferative activity of some antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, may be similar to that underlying antimicrobial activity [

In the case of 8-hydroxyquinoline and its derivatives, the interaction with metal ions, namely copper and iron, and their transportation into cells has been reported as crucial for its antiproliferative activity [

 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives with potent anticancer potential often contain halogen substituents. However, in the present study, nitroxoline exhibited stronger antiproliferative activity against cancer cells than chloroxine and ferron. Previous studies have reported that the underlying mechanism of antitumor activity of zinc pyrithione and sanguinarine involves the inhibition of proteasomal deubiquitinases and microtubule depolymerization, respectively [

All of the above-mentioned alkaloids and related structures revealed increased toxicity to normal intestinal cells in comparison with their antipathogenic effect, which limits their applications in treating bacterial diarrhea. Although there are no studies reporting oral toxicity or toxicity to the digestive system from berberine, chloroxine, and nitroxoline, we suggest that their safety profile should be further examined and the potential protective role of indigenous gut microbiota against these cytotoxic chemicals should be more deeply studied. Zinc pyrithione, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and sanguinarine are not part of any product intended for internal use. Hence, their dose-dependent toxicological profile and oral safety must be carefully elucidated before any consideration for their application for treating infectious diarrhea associated with intestinal cancer [
