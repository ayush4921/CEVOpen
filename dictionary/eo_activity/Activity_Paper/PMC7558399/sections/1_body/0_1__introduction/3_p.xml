<p>As it has recently been proposed, investigations of new antimicrobial agents should be focused on the identification of structures with lowered toxicity to indigenous intestinal microbiota including probiotic bacterial strains. Since there is a common association between dysbiosis and the use of antibiotics, the agents selectively acting against pathogenic microorganisms can prevent the risk of developing diseases, such as chronic bowel inflammation and intestinal carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the composition of the whole gut microbiota comprises a large number of microorganisms forming a complex ecosystem, a preliminary screening of selective antibacterial activity of newly tested agents could be performed by testing the in vitro susceptibilities of particular representatives of each of the three dominant bacterial phyla that can be found in human intestines, and which probiotic function have been described. Among them, we can recognize the strains such as 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. (Actinobacteria), 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. (Firmicutes) and 
 <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> (Bacteroidetes) [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Selective in vitro growth inhibitory effect of a plant-derived compound was for example described in the study of Novakova et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], where anticlostridial effect of 8-hydroxyquinoline (
 <italic>Microstachys corniculata</italic>) was comparably higher than the activities revealed against different strains of bifidobacteria. Chloroxine, the synthetic 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative, is the antimicrobial agent that has also been used as an oral formulation for infectious diarrhea, and disorders of the intestinal microbiota [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In dysbiosis, the increased abundance of 
 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> is positively and negatively correlated with the risk of intestinal carcinogenesis, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The repression of gut microbiota enhances the susceptibility of host intestinal cells to diarrheagenic bacterial infection and chemical-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, novel antimicrobial agents should not exhibit cytotoxic activity against normal intestinal cells [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, quinolone antibiotics were reported to inhibit the growth of both bacterial and eukaryotic cells through the same mechanism and consequently enhance the risk of eliciting cytotoxic response [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, the antiproliferative activity of these agents with selective cytotoxic effects against intestinal cancer cells would be a suitable feature in cases of dysbiosis associated with carcinogenesis. There are limited studies on the anticancer effects of conventional antibiotics. For example, Bourikas et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that ciprofloxacin is potent to inhibit the proliferation of intestinal cancer cell line HT29 in vitro. On the other hand, a strong in vitro antiproliferative activity of plant-derived compounds against various cancer cell lines has extensively been reported, and some are used as a scaffold for anticancer drugs. For example, the alkaloid camptothecin, extracted from the bark of 
 <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic>, is currently used as a cytostatic agent for the treatment of colon cancer [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We, therefore, suggest that the phytochemicals with known in vitro growth-inhibitory activity against some of the diarrheagenic bacteria could potentially exhibit selective cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Amongst them, the anticancer effect has generally been reported for quinoline alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to those earlier mentioned, benzylisoquinoline alkaloid sanguinarine (
 <italic>Sanguinaria canadensis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives ferron [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and nitroxoline [
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] are examples of antimicrobial drugs with potent anticancer activity. Another type of synthetic phytochemical analog with reported antimicrobial and anticancer properties is metal-pyridine derivative complex zinc pyrithione (pyrithione found in 
 <italic>Polyalthia nemoralis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
