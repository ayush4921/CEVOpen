<p>Over the last decades, plant-derived products have become a mainstay in providing novel chemical scaffolds for the development of anti-infective drugs, and therefore antidiarrheal medicinal plants and their bioactive components can be examined first [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the therapeutic effect of products derived from antidiarrheal medicinal plants is not necessarily based on their antimicrobial activity against the causative agents as other mechanisms can be considered important, such as antimotility and antisecretory effects, for their useful applications [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The chance of finding a new plant-derived compound with promising antibacterial activity could therefore be enhanced by the chemotaxonomic approach by examining such novel medicinal plants that are taxonomically related to the species known to bear specific types of phytochemicals with growth-inhibitory effect on diarrheagenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a recent review paper, Kokoska et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] described the in vitro antimicrobial properties and clinical efficacy of plant-derived compounds with their synthetic analogs that are present in products available in the international market as over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and herbal medicines for intestinal infections. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid berberine (e.g., 
 <italic>Hydrastis canadensis</italic>), simple phenol bismuth subsalicylate, the analog of salicylic acid derived from salicin (
 <italic>Salix alba</italic>), and polyphenol tannic acid (e.g., 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp.) were mentioned as examples of the efficient agents with potent activity against some of the gut bacterial pathogens.
