<p>The lack of an effective and safe antimicrobial therapy for diarrheagenic bacterial infections is a global health concern, especially in developing countries for children under the age of five years [

Although mortality associated with bacterial diarrhea is low in developed countries, the increased incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer have also been attributed to gut dysbiosis that can result from chronic intestinal infections [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, infectious diarrhea is treated using conventional drugs belonging to various classes of antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and vancomycin. However, the irrational use of antibiotics, including incorrect dose prescription, has led to the development of drug resistance in several pathogens. Additionally, the applications of conventional antibiotics are limited, especially among children in developing countries, owing to high cost and increased risk of side effects including gut dysbiosis. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel antimicrobial agents for infectious bacterial diarrhea to overcome the limitations of conventional antimicrobial drugs [
