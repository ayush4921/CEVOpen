<p>One representative normal intestinal cell line (FHs 74 Int (ATCC CCL 241)) and two cancer intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 (ATCC HTB 37) and HT29 (ATCC HTB 38)) were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). Normal cells were cultured in Hybri-Care medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 30 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (10,000 units/mL and 100 mg/mL, respectively). The cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (10,000 units/mL and 100 mg/mL, respectively) (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The culture medium was replaced every 2–3 days and cells were passaged every 7 days.
