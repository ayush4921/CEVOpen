<p>Phytochemicals (berberine chloride, 8-hydroxyquinoline, salicylic acid, tannic acid, and sanguinarine chloride) and their synthetic analogs [chloroxine (5,7-dichloroquinolin-8-ol), nitroxoline (5-nitroquinolin-8-ol), ferron (7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid), bismuth subsalicylate, and zinc pyrithione], as well as antibiotics (ceftriaxone sodium, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, tetracycline, and vancomycin hydrochloride), used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Prague, Czech Republic). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) was used to prepare the stock solutions of all test compounds, except those of metronidazole, salicylic acid, vancomycin, and zinc pyrithione, which were prepared using distilled water. Stock solutions of chloramphenicol, tannic acid, and tetracycline were prepared using 96% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). The chemical structures of individual compounds tested are shown in
