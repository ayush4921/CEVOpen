<p>In summary, ciprofloxacin, 8-hydroxyquinoline alkaloids (chloroxine and nitroxoline), tetracycline, and zinc pyrithione exhibited a significant selective growth-inhibitory activity against diarrheagenic bacteria with lowered toxicity to probiotic bacteria in vitro. 8-Hydroxyquinoline, chloroxine, nitroxoline, sanguinarine, and zinc pyrithione also exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect, whereas the antiproliferative action of 8-hydroxyquinoline and sanguinarine were selective to cancer intestinal cells. These findings indicate that 8-hydroxyquinoline alkaloids and metal-pyridine derivative complexes are chemical structures with promising bioactive properties in terms of in vitro selective antibacterial and anticancer activities which could be utilized in future chemotaxonomic investigation of antidiarrheal medicinal plants and their bioactive components. These could be further investigated as possible new chemotherapeutic agents against diarrheal infections and associated intestinal cancer diseases. However, in vivo studies on the toxicity of these compounds with more complex animal models will be needed before their consideration to be used for this purpose.</p>
