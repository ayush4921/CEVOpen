<p>The correlation between biological activities and chemical structures of the tested compounds and their groups (antibiotics, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and related structures) was analyzed using PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00233-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Although the compounds were distributed equally in all quadrants, detailed analysis revealed specific patterns. The closest correlation was observed in the lower-left quadrant between four antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline), which indicated that these antibiotics exhibited strong growth-inhibitory activity against diarrheagenic and probiotic strains but did not exhibit distinct cytotoxic activity against normal and cancer intestinal cells. The second highest correlation observed in the lower right quadrant indicated that zinc pyrithione and 8-hydroxyquinolines (excluding ferron) exhibited selective antibacterial activity against diarrheagenic strains along with strong to moderate cytotoxic activity against both types of tested cell lines. The correlation observed in the upper right quadrant indicated that tannic acid, benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, and ferron exhibited moderate to no antipathogenic effect (with negative SIbs) and overall moderate to strong cytotoxic activity. The upper left quadrant contains the remaining antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin) and both simple phenols with minimal correlation. These agents exhibited moderate to no growth-inhibiting activity against diarrheagenic strains and practically no cytotoxic activity. Whereas all alkaloids are distributed in lower and upper right quadrants indicating their capability to reveal any type of the tested bioactivities, phenols are spread in the right and left upper quadrants which shows their lack of significant antibacterial activity but a certain degree of cytotoxicity. In contrast, antibiotics are concentrated in the lower-left quadrant slightly overlapping the upper left one, therefore they usually display a significant antibacterial effect which is rarely accompanied by cytotoxicity.
