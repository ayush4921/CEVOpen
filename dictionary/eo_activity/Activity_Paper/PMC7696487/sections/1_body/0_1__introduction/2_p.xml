<p>The species 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> belongs to the Piperaceae family, commonly known as cubeba in Arabic and tailed piper in English. This plant grows wild in Java and the Sumatra islands (Indonesia), as well as in southern India, and also grows wild in many other countries of Southeast Asia and in some African countries. The fruit of this plant is well-known for its medicinal properties [

 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruitâ€™s essential oil, in parallel with the search for new powerful chemotype, as well as the originality of this study concerning the correlation between in vitro evaluation of the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> essential oil from fruits with an in silico approach (molecular docking) targeting protein involved in oxidative stress (human peroxiredoxin 5).
