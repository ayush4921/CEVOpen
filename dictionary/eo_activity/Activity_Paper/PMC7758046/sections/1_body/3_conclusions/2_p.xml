<p>In summary, novel piperazine–chalcone hybrids and related pyrazoline analogues were synthesised and six of them were selected at a single dose concentration (10
 <sup>−1</sup> M) by NCI (Bethesda, MD) to test their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer activity against full 60 lines of human cancer cells. VEGFR-2 enzyme inhibitory assay was performed to investigate the mechanism of anticancer activity of the tested compounds. While, all tested compounds demonstrate good inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2, the most active compounds were 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> that have been shown to be able to cause cell cycle arrest during the G2/M process and inducing apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. The present research has led to the discovery of new cytotoxic compounds that target the VEGFR-2. Furthermore, a molecular docking study of selected compounds was carried out and confirmed that compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> exhibited a direct interaction with the VEGFR.
