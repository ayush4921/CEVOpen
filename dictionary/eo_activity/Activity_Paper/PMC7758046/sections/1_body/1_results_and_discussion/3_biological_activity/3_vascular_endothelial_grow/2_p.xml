 </xref>. Therefore, compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold>, 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, 
 <bold>Vf</bold>, 
 <bold>VIa</bold>, 
 <bold>VIb</bold>, and 
 <bold>VIc</bold> were further investigated for their ability to inhibit VEGFR-2 using colorimetric assay of human VEGFR-2 ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> as a reference drug. Results were presented as half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the tested compounds ranged from 0.57 µM to 1.48 µM. Compound 
 <bold>Ve</bold> was the most potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor among the tested compounds with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.57 µM which was comparable to results of 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> that had IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.51 µM. In addition, compound 
 <bold>Vd</bold> showed significant VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.80 µM. These results supported that VEGFR-2 could be a possible target for anti-tumour activity of our tested compounds.
