<p>Compounds 
 <bold>Va–h</bold> were synthesised via the reaction of 4′-piperazino-acetophenone 
 <bold>III</bold> and the appropriate aldehyde (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001">Scheme 1</xref>). The reaction of the chalcone 
 <bold>Va</bold>, 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, and 
 <bold>Vf</bold> and hydrazine hydrate afforded pyrazoline derivatives 
 <bold>VIa–c</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0002">Scheme 2</xref>). The structures of all newly synthesised compounds were confirmed by various methods of spectroscopic analysis, such as 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry.
