<p>Molecular modelling is considered as an important tool to study molecular interactions of certain ligands and binding site of the corresponding protein. The ligandâ€“protein interaction behaviour at the active site was estimated based on the docking score function as implemented in MOE 2015.10

 </xref>. In this study, six active potential anticancer compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold>, 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, 
 <bold>Vf</bold>, 
 <bold>VIa</bold>, 
 <bold>VIb</bold>, and 
 <bold>VIc</bold> were subjected to molecular docking studies using MOE program on the 3D structure of VEGFR using 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold> as reference compound. Binding free energy data obtained after the docking procedure showed that the tested compounds exhibit favourable docked complexes with the active site of target protein. The tested compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold>, 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, 
 <bold>Vf</bold>, 
 <bold>VIc</bold>, 
 <bold>VIb</bold>, and 
 <bold>VIc</bold> exhibited interactions with the VEGFR active site to different extents and the docking score free energy of the tested compounds found to be this order: 
 <bold>Ve</bold>&gt;
 <bold>VIa</bold>&gt;
 <bold>Vd</bold>&gt;
 <bold>Vf</bold>&gt;
 <bold>VIc</bold>&gt;
 <bold>VIb</bold>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Also, the other scoring parameters such as rmsd_refine, E_conf, E_place, and E_refine, indicated that the tested compounds were correctly docked in the biding site as the reference ligand 
 <bold>Sorafenib</bold>.
