  <title>Questions to consider when discussing herbal medicine use with the oncology patient.</title>
 </caption>
 <p>* Are you presently taking/considering taking any dietary supplements or herbal medicinal products?</p>
 <p>* Have you discussed the use of herbal medicine with your oncologist or oncology healthcare professional (pharmacist, nurse, other)?</p>
 <p>* Is the goal of the treatment with herbal medicine to relieve your symptoms and improve quality of life? Is it to “fight” the cancer, prolong life, “strengthen” your immune system, or all of the above?</p>
 <p>* Are you aware of any benefits from the use of herbal medicinal products (treating the cancer, reducing symptoms)? How about the potentially harmful effects of these products (toxic effects, negative herb–drug interactions)?</p>
 <p>* Are you aware of the importance of both the quantity and the quality of the active components of herbal medicinal products? Have you thought about getting advice on this aspect of herbal medicine use?</p>
 <p>* Have you considered consulting with an integrative physician who is familiar with nonconventional medicine, including the use of herbal medicinal products?</p>
 <p>* After addressing the above questions, what are your expectations from the current interaction between us (patient–oncologist/pharmacist/integrative physician)? How would you like me to be of further assistance? Do you feel that I am able/unable to answer your questions about the use of herbal medicine?</p>
