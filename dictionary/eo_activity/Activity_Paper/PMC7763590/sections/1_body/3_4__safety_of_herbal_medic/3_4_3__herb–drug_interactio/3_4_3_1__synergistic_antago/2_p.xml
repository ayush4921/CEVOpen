<p>Herbal products may also inhibit the anticancer activity of chemotherapy agents. An example of this is the herb 
 <italic>Ephedra foemina</italic> (“Alanda”), a herbal treatment for cancer which has become popular among the Arab-speaking population of northern Israel. The Alanda remedy is prepared by boiling water in a pot filled with vines from the locally ubiquitous ephedra plant and then drinking the brewed preparation. In an in vitro study, an XTT assay was used to test the cytotoxic activity of Alanda on two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and SKBR3). While no anticancer activity of the herbal preparation (as measured by IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was detected, it was shown that the addition of Alanda to cancer cells in the presence of the chemotherapy agents carboplatin and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in their cytotoxic ability, by factors of 2 and 4 in the MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines, respectively [
