<p id="Par59">Our study fully evaluated the toxicity effects of PHS on 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, investigated the possible mechanism of the toxicity effects of PHS, and provided pharmacological research paradigm for the study of traditional medicine toxicity. The results will be helpful in understanding the probable toxicity effects of PHS and its underlying mechanism. In addition, the results provided new ideas and methods for the biological evaluation of the toxicity of Chinese medicinal materials.
