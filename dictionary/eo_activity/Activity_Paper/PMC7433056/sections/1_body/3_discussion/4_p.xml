<p id="Par54">Previous studies have indicated PHS possess certain antioxidant activity. Beta-carbolines (harmaline and harmine) may prevent dopamine-induced mitochondrial damage and PC12 cell death through a scavenging action on reactive oxygen species and inhibition of monoamine oxidase and thiol oxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The beta-carboline alkaloids have a significant protective effect against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and paraquat oxidative agents in yeast cells, that their ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals contributes to their antimutagenic and antigenotoxic effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> could prevent symptoms and reduced oxidative stress markers in rats with Parkinsonâ€™s disease induced by 6-hydroxydopamine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our data also suggest that pretreatment with PHS induced resistance properties in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> against damage from both heat-stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and oxidative stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Our data further support the protective effects of PHS on animals. The mechanism to protects against heat resistance needs further study.
