<p id="Par34">HPLC system (Waters, USA) was used to analyze the chemical composition of PHS. The separation was carried out on an Agilent SB-C
 <sub>18</sub> column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) and the mobile phase consisted of methanol (A) and 0.5% ammonium acetate (B). The isocratic elution conditions were 47% (A) and the column temperature was set at 25 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The detection wavelength was set to 325 nm. The injection volume was 10 μL. Comparing the HPLC retention time and all target peaks to the peak hold time of the standard, we determined the major components of the prepared PHS.
