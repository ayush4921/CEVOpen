<p id="Par20">Alkaloids are the main chemical components in PHS, alkaloids could be extracted by the ethanol fraction. After crushing the raw products of PHS, adding 10 times of 95% ethanol ultrasound (540 W, 40 kHz) ultrasonic extraction twice, each time for 1 h, the filtrate was dried after filtration, and the ethanol extract of the raw products of PHS was obtained and preserved at 4 °C.
