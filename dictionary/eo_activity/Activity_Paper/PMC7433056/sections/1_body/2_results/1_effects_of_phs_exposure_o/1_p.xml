<p id="Par36">The analysis method of lethality of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is simple, and the experimental period is short and effective. Lethality is the basis for the analysis of toxicological toxicity using 
 <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Lifespan is an important indicator of the long-term effects of specific toxicants. We assessed prolonged exposure to PHS in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> L4 stage to young adults. After prolonged exposure to the examined concentrations of PHS, compared with the control group, the lethality of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was significantly increased by ethanol extract of PHS at 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 mg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Prolonged exposure to 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mg/mL of PHS significantly reduced the lifespan of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).
