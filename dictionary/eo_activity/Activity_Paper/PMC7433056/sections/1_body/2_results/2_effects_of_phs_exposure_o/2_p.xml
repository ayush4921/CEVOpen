<p id="Par38">The evaluation indexes of reproduction of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> include three aspects: generation time, brood size and number of eggs in the uterus. The generation time is used primarily to investigate the reproductive speed of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Brood size is mainly used to investigate the reproductive ability of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the number of eggs in the uterus can simultaneously examine the reproductive capacity and the physiological function of the ovipositor. In this study, we chose brood size as a reproduction evaluation indicator. We observed that prolonged exposure to 0.25, 0.50 mg/mL of PHS did not significantly influence the brood size of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but prolonged exposure to 1.00 mg/mL of PHS significantly reduced the brood size of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig.
