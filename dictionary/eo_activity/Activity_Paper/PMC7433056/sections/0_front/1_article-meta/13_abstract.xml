  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> L. is a medicinal herb extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). So far, relevant reports on the toxicity of 
   <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> L. seeds (PHS) are hardly available. Especially, we still know little about the in vivo mechanism for PHS toxicity. This study aims to evaluate the toxicity effects of PHS in 
   <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (
   <italic>C. elegans</italic>), investigate the possible mechanism of the toxicity effects of PHS, and provide reference for the pharmacological research of PHS.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">In the present study, the 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> was exposed to 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 mg/mL of PHS in nematode growth medium (NGM) at 22 °C in the presence of food. Lethality, lifespan, growth, reproduction, and locomotion behavior assays were performed to evaluate the toxicity effects of PHS in 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We then determined the mechanism of the toxicity effect of PHS by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay, and oxidative stress resistance assays. The main components of PHS were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">Compared with the control group, the lethality of 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> was significantly increased when they were exposed to the ethanol extract of PHS at 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mg/mL (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and the mean lifespan was significantly decreased (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). We also observed that PHS exposure could induce the toxicity on body length, brood size, and locomotion behavior.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Our study shows that the ethanol extract of PHS exerts obvious toxic effects on 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which would provide new ideas and methods for the biological evaluation of the toxicity of Chinese medicinal materials.
