 <mixed-citation publication-type="other">The handbook is introduced by Nappi C. “Translating Recipes 1: Narrating Qing Bodies”: “The book itself was smaller than a modern passport. It begins with a series of thirty-six recipes for treating myriad illnesses, many of which were broken down into varieties on a common theme. After this, the text opens out into almost forty further discussions of drugs and illnesses, many roughly translated from European-language texts about health and the body.” See
