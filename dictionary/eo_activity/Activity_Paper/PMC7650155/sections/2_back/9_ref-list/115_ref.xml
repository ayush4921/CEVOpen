 <mixed-citation publication-type="other">This information was taken from Aleni (Zhifang waiji;2.68) who has a separate entry on the olive: “Olive: Its oil has a very nice taste and is used for many things. What is called ‘olive’ are the fruits at the head of the a tree; after being ripe, they are entirely used to produce olive oil, which has a very rich taste” (阿利袜:其膏油之類, 味美而用多者, 曰阿利袜, 是樹頭之果, 熟後即全為阿利袜油, 最饒風味). Some scholars are of the opinion that Aleni first invented this Chinese term, as it phonetically resembles the pronunciation “olive”. See Masini F. “Aleni’s Contribution to the Chinese Language”, in Lippiello T., Malek R., eds. “Scholar from the West”. Giulio Aleni S. J. (1582–1649) and the Dialogue between Christianity and China [Monumenta Serica Monograph Series XLII]. Nettetal: Steyler Verlag. 1997;539-554, 545. The information on the olive is also quoted by Chinese scholars of the Qing period, for example, by Wei Yuan in his Haiguo tuzhi (
