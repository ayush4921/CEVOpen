<p id="Par44">Chen Ming draws our attention to the novel 
 <italic>Sanbao taijian Xiyangji tongsu yanyi</italic> 三寶太監西洋記通俗演義, attributed to Luo Maodeng 羅懋登. Scene 86 mentions that the king of Aden presented Zheng He with balsam (阿勃參) as a gift. But the description of this balsam is obviously taken directly from Luo Yuejiong’s 羅曰褧 
 <italic>Xianbin lu</italic> 咸賓錄 (Records on All Guests), preface dated 1591, so that Chen Ming concludes that knowledge and use of balsam during the Ming period was very restricted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. 
 <italic>Xianbin lu</italic> states that “balsam oil is very efficient as an ointment against scabies and sores, but its price is extremely high” (阿勃參油宜塗癬疥大效價极貴) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The information that Zheng He received balsam as a gift is not included in the Aden sections of Ma Huan’s 馬歡 (
 <italic>ca</italic>. 1380–1460) 
 <italic>Yingyai shenglan</italic> 瀛涯勝蘭 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This does not, of course, prove that information from Luo Maodeng was incorrect. Against the background that the balsam was a very valuable product, and in fact originated from the local neighbourhood, it seems, on the contrary, quite possible that the king of Aden presented balsam as a special gift. And one would also wonder where Luo Maodeng should have gotten his information from, if this statement was pure fabrication.
