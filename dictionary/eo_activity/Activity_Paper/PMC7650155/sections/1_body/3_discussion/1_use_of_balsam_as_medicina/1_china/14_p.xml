<p id="Par71">Missionaries not only brought medicinal knowledge and drugs from the New World, the Spanish colonies in America, via Europe or the Pacific and Manila to China and Japan, but also sent prepared medicines to Manila. As Cui Weixiao 崔維孝 has shown, due to the activities of Blasius García (1635
 <italic>–</italic>1699), Franciscan physicians annually sent to Manila great quantities of medicinals and aromatics, such as theriac (
 <italic>jiedu yao</italic> 解毒藥), 
 <italic>Hyacinthus orientalis</italic> (
 <italic>fengxinzi</italic> 風信子), brown sugar (
 <italic>hongtang</italic> 紅糖, 
 <italic>Saccharon Granulatum</italic> Rubrum), rhubarb pills and refined rhubarb, 
 <italic>bálsamo apoplético</italic> (中風香脂藥膏) and others. The hospital in Guangzhou, vice versa, received from Manila substances such as jalap root resin (球根牽牛根莖), 
 <italic>Salvia japonica</italic> Thunb. (鼠尾草), 
 <italic>carthamus</italic> flower (紅花, 
 <italic>Carthami Flos</italic>), 
 <italic>bálsamo</italic> (香脂藥膏), 
 <italic>Pini Resina</italic> essence (松脂精), and 
 <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> (羅望子果) [

Most of these substances were probably shipped via Manila to China across the Indian Ocean, but, as ship records about cargoes and archaeological evidence show, other medicinal drugs were without question shipped across the Pacific.
