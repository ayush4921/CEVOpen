<p>The chelating agents can prevent free radical formation by stabilizing the transition metals in living systems, thereby reducing the damage caused by free radicals [35]. Figure 2 shows the chelating activity of compounds. In 
 <bold>A</bold> series, the highest activity was observed in compound A6 and the lowest activity was observed in compound 
 <bold>A2</bold> . In 
 <bold>P</bold> series, the highest activity was obtained for 
 <bold>P3</bold> and the lowest activity was obtained for compound 
 <bold>P2</bold> . When the concentration of solutions of the test compounds increased from 25 μg/mL to 200 μg/mL, the chelating activity increased from 12.2% to 36.1% for 
 <bold>A6</bold> , 5.1% to 11.7% for 
 <bold>A2</bold> , 16.4% to 45.8 for 
 <bold>P3</bold> , 3.3% to 8.2% for 
 <bold>P2</bold> and 91.5% to 100% for EDTA, respectively. EDTA exhibited better activity than compounds at all concentrations studied.
