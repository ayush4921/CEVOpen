<p>Anthracene-based Schiff base derivatives 
 <bold>A1-A6</bold> were synthesized by the reaction of 1-aminoanthracene with aldehyde derivatives (furan-2-carbaldehyde, thiophene-2-carbaldehyde, 3-hydroxypicolinaldehyde, benzofuran-2-carbaldehyde, benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde and 8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carbaldehyde) in ethanol by the catalysis of acetic acid (Scheme).
