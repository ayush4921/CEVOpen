<p>The geometry optimized structures of the Schiff bases can be seen in Figure 5. Although most of the structures are planar, in some cases anthracene and pyrene moieties are tilted out of plane. Combination of heteroaromatic systems with fluorescent abilities of anthracene and pyrene would potentially create very important metal sensor compounds. Therefore, present systems were investigated in terms of metal coordination capability. Thereafter the optimized geometries obtained and confirmed to be at least a minimum energy structure, vertical transition energies of 
 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>P</bold> series and their metal complexes were computed with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The absorption spectra and oscillator strengths were obtained by the calculation of singlet transitions from the optimized ground state to the excited states by using TD-DFT with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set [39]. Upon application of TD-DFT method we obtained the electronic absorption spectra, including maximum absorption wavelengths.
