<p>Disk diffusion method was employed to test the antibacterial activity of the compounds [43]. Gram– bacteria, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027), 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>pneumophiia</italic> (ATCC 33152) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 10536) and gram+ bacteria, 
 <italic>Enterococcus hirae</italic> (ATCC 10541), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538) and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the present compounds. Sterile antibiotic discs were impregnated with 20 μL of compound and the discs were placed in a nutrient agar poured petri dish inoculated with bacteria. As the negative control, a disc impregnated with DMSO and as the positive control tetracycline (30 μg) and streptomycin (10 μg) discs were used, respectively. The cultures of the bacteria were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, which was followed by measuring the inhibition zone diameters in mm to determine the antibacterial ability of the compounds.
