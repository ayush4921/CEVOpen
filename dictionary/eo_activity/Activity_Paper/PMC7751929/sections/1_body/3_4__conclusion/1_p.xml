<p>As a result, the design and synthesis of novel anthracene- and pyrene-based Schiff base derivatives were described Heteroaromatic aldehydes were reacted with aminoanthracene and aminopyrene, seperately and novel Schiff base derivatives 
 <bold>A1-A6</bold> and 
 <bold>P1-P6</bold> were obtained in very good yields. Free radical scavenging, metal chelating, reducing power, antibacterial and DNA binding ability of newly synthesized compounds were tested. 
 <bold>A</bold> series of compounds showed much better radical scavenging activity than the 
 <bold>P</bold> series compounds. The compound 
 <bold>P3</bold> demonstrated highest metal chelating activity. In 3 antioxidant test systems, the standarts exhibited higher antioxidant activities than the DMSO solution of compounds. In addition, 
 <bold>P3</bold> and 
 <bold>A6</bold> showed antibacterial activity against the bacteria employed and both compounds were very well bound to CT-DNA. The outcomes of this study indicate that, newly studied compounds have DNA binding activity and can be a potential drug candidates for cancer treatment with further modification in their structure in the future.
