<p>Schiff bases belong to a sub-group of imines or azomethines. Their exceptional popularity in organic chemistry can be attributed to their easy synthesis techniques from cheap starting materials and air stability as well. Moreover, a wide range of pharmacological and biological applications add their need of synthesis. Each novel Schiff base derivative received a great deal of attention for the imine (-C=N) bond forming the heart of these molecules, which acts a very important role for bioactivity [1,2]. There have been many published reports in the literature revealing remarkable potential of Schiff bases as antibacterial [3], antifungal [4], anticancer [5], urease inhibitor [6], antioxidant [7,8]. Additionally, their antiglycation activities [9] antiinflammatory [10,11], antitumor [12,13], antiviral [14], antipyretic [15], anti-HIV-1 [16], antiproliferative [17,18] abilities have also been reported. In addition, the presence of nitrogen in the core structure lead them to be used as a chemosensor [19â€“21].</p>
