<p>After the hyperlipidaemia animal model was established, the animals were divided randomly into the following eight groups; a negative control (NC) group (intragastric administration of distilled water), a FEN group (0.02 g/kg), NHJ treatment groups (1, 2 or 4 g crude drug/kg/d) and SHJ treatment groups (1, 2 or 4 g crude drug/kg/d). The rats in the control group were lavaged with pure water and standard food, and the rats in the other seven groups were gavaged with drugs dissolved in water for 8 weeks. The animals were gavaged with a volume of 10 mL/kg once per day. Pentobarbital sodium was used to induce euthanasia after 8 weeks, and 3 mL of blood was collected from the abdominal aorta, kept for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm to obtain serum. The concentrations of TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, SOD and MDA were measured strictly according to the kit instructions (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China).</p>
