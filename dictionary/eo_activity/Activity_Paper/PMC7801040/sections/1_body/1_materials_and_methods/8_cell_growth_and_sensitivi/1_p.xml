<p>The cell growth and sensitivity of HUVECs to the two HJ extracts were assessed using the MTT assay (Rojas-Silva et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Briefly, HUVECs in suspension were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well, and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air at 37 °C. Then, the cells were exposed to varying concentrations of NHJ and SHJ for 24 h. The culture medium was carefully removed and exchanged for fresh medium. MTT solution (5 mg/mL PBS) was then added, and the plate was placed in an optimal atmosphere at 37 °C. The metabolically active cells reduced MTT to blue formazan crystals. After 2 h, the formazan crystals formed were solubilized by incubating cells with DMSO (500 μL). The cell absorbance was read at 570 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). Cell proliferation was quantified as a percentage of proliferating cells compared to that in the control group (untreated cells), which was set to 100%. Each treatment group was analysed in triplicate wells, and each experiment was performed three times. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (the concentrations of the test compound required to reduce cell survival by 50%) were calculated from concentration–response curves and used as a measure of cellular sensitivity to a given treatment.
