<p>Minced beef samples were mixed in a sterile mixer with spices powder (0.5% and 1% of minced beef meat as weight/weight), and the essential oils (0.25% and 0.5% of minced beef meat as volume/weight). Three groups were made from the samples; the first group was treated with either 0.5% or 1% spices, the second group was treated with either 0.25% or 0.5% essential oils, and the third group was kept as a control group. Each sample was packed in polyethylene bags and stored at 4 °C ± 1, and the bacterial count was done at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days.</p>
