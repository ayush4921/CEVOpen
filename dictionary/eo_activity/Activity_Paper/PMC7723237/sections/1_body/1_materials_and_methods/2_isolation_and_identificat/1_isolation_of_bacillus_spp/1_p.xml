<p>Three media were used for the isolation, and identification of 
 <italic>Bacillus species</italic>; nutrient agar (Difco), Mannitol Egg Yolk Polymyxin agar (MEYP) (Difco, USA) (It depends on 1) selective inhibitory agent; polymyxin that inhibit the growth of other bacterial pathogens and contaminants. 2) Indicator systems; mannitol and phenol red, and egg yolk)
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and trypticase soy agar (Difco, USA) (support the growth of a wide variety of fastidious microorganisms).
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Twenty-five grams from each sample have been aseptically weighed and added to 225 mL of peptone water and overnight incubation at 37 °C in a shaker incubator. After 24 hours of enrichment, 0.1 mL of the broth was streaked on nutrient agar, MEYP agar, and trypticase soy agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 hours. The characteristic colonies on MEYP agar are pink in color and were surrounded by a precipitate zone with the same color.
