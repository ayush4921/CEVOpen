<p>Regarding the phenotypic characteristics; 
 <italic>Bacillus oceanisediminis</italic> is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic, motile, catalase-positive, and endospore-forming microorganism. The optimal growth temperature was 37 °C; the optimal pH was 7.0. Also, according to the results obtained from the API 50 CHB/E medium, the characteristics strongly confirmed that the isolate belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>. Concerning the phenotypic characteristics of 
 <italic>Brevibacillus invocatus</italic>; it is a Gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped, strictly aerobic microorganism. The growth at 30 °C is initially slow, with a more rapid increase in growth rate following 24 hours’ incubation; after 3–4 days, the slightly umbonate colonies are 1–8 mm in diameter, with slightly irregular margins. Colonies are brownish yellow, some with a single whitish concentric zone at the margin, and they are butyrous and have silky surfaces; the centers are opaque and the edges are translucent. 
 <italic>Brevibacillus invocatus</italic> is catalase-positive. Nitrate reduction-negative. Casein, gelatin, starch, and urea are not hydrolyzed and indole is not produced) (
