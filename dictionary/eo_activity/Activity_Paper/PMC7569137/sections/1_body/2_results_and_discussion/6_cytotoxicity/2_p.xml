 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A. The GC polysaccharide exhibited growth inhibition as compared to the control samples in HeLa cell lines. The percent inhibition potential was found to be concentration dependent. GC polysaccharides at a dose of 500 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> displayed higher anti-tumor activity (65.33 ± 3.75%; p &lt; 0.05). At two different doses of GC polysaccharide extracts were tested for their hepatoprotective effect on D-GalN induced liver damage in terms of oxidative stress in HepG2 hepatic cell lines. The results exhibited that hepatoprotective activity of GC polysaccharide extract was significant at different dose concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). The GC polysaccharide produced maximum hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 500 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> against D-GalN induced hepatic damage (60.33 ± 3.48%) 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B. The potential anti-mutagenic effect of GC polysaccharides can be described by its competence to reduce free radicals. The potential of GC polysaccharides to restrain the in vitro growth of cancerous cell lines (HeLa and HepG2) was measured by MTT assay. The polysaccharides exhibited concentration dependent cytotoxic activity. The potential of polysaccharides and attached protein moieties to modify large number of immune cells may be due to their structural diversity and variation of these biological macromolecules. Polysaccharides hold repetitive structural features unlike proteins and nucleic acids, joined to each other by glycosidic linkages (
