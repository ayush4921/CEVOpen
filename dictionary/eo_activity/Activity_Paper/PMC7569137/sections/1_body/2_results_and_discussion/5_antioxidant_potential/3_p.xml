<p id="p0095">GC polysaccharide reduction power was very powerful, and the extract's power was increased with sample quality. The plant extract was capable of reducing the most Fe

It is well known that, during any pathological event and/or aging, such as ischemic reperfusion injury, Superoxide anions cause direct or indirect damage to biomolecules by the formation of H2O2, OH and peroxide nitrite or singlet oxygen. Also superoxide was observed to initiate lipid peroxidation directly (

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the superoxide anion radical scavenging potential of GC polysaccharides assessed by PMS-NADH scheme. GC polysaccharides' superoxide scavenging potential has been found to be dependent upon concentration. Additionally, the greater inhibition effect of the extracts of polysaccharides on the formation of the superoxide anions described in this can facilitate them as successful antioxidants. The GC polysaccharide extract half-inhibition concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 31.22 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> though the ascorbic acid IC50 value was 6.76 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. These results indicate that GC polysaccharides possess strong radical scavenging effect on superoxide (

It was found that the GC polysaccharide extract radical scavenging potential to DPPH was lower than that of ascorbic acid, the results indicated that the polysaccharides had proton-giving properties and may possibly function as free radical scavengers or inhibitors, probably act as key antioxidant (
