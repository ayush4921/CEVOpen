<p>The unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of reported MTDLs remain to be the main barrier for further clinical translation of these compounds. Thus, efforts focusing on optimizing oral bioavailability, metabolic clearance, and CNS permeation of lead compounds would be critical in advancing more MTDLs into clinical trials. Moreover, MTDLs that are designed to target different pathological cascades of AD are more likely to be efficient against multifactorial AD in comparison to MTDLs designed against a single pathway of AD progression.</p>
