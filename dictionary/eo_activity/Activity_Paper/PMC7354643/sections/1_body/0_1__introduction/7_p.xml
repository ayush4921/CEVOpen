<p>Neurodegenerative diseases have a highly intricate etiology where many biological factors concur simultaneously at various levels to induce the neurodegeneration. This critical aspect represents a veritable hurdle for the development of disease-modifying drugs able to target the profound causes of neurodegeneration. The failure of “one drug-one target” drug design strategy and the multifunctional nature of neurodegenerative diseases inspired the scientific community to investigate the effectiveness of another drug design strategy called “designed multiple ligands,” “hybrid molecules,” or “multitarget-directed ligands” (MTDLs). This emerging strategy is centered on the development of pleiotropic ligands able to interact at least with two therapeutic targets at the same time. The idea of MTDLs has been largely pursued for the discovery of a more efficacious treatment for AD, and a great amount of structures based on this polypharmacology concept have been proposed [

Some of the most appealing analogues are the result of molecular hybridization, where the combination of multiple pharmacophores should reproduce the activity of the parent compounds while retaining a certain degree of selectivity towards the selected targets. These hybrid structures can be combined (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or Rivastigmine, along with different natural bioactive derivatives such as resveratrol or curcumin [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], although other very interesting structural combinations/modifications have been recently identified. Here, we report the most recent and more interesting examples of newly developed MTDLs which are able to interact and modulate different biological systems and represent potential prototypes for a new treatment of AD.
