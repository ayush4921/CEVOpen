<p>For instance, in AD, abnormal histological changes are characterized by the deposition of 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyloid (A
 <italic>β</italic>) plaques formed out of aggregated A
 <italic>β</italic> fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made of hyperphosphorylated TAU protein (pTAU) [

 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein (
 <italic>α</italic>-syn) accumulated in Lewis bodies [

In ALS, histological studies have shown the presence of aggregates of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS), and repeat dipeptides from noncanonical translation of mutant chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) [
