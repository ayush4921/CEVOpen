<p>Another interesting series of analogues typified by structure 
 <bold>16</bold> [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] possessed a favorable combination of groups, resulting in a dual AChE/BACE-1 inhibitor potentially endowed with chelating ability, thanks to the amidic portions. As a matter of fact, compound 
 <bold>16</bold> was a low nanomolar inhibitor of the two target enzymes (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, AChE = 4.11 nM, BACE − 1 = 18.3 nM). No cytotoxic effect was detected in SH-SY5Y cells up to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, while the balanced lipophilicity, coupled with high membrane permeability, allowed predicting a good brain penetration and metabolic stability. Moreover, the title compound was able to chelate Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, thus having an impact on the concentration of these metal ions and their promoted neurodegeneration.
