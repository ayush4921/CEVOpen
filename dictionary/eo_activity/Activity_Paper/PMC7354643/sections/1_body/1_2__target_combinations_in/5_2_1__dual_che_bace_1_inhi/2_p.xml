<p>Gabr and Abdel-Raziq recently explored rigid analogues of Donepezil for their double activity against AChE and BACE-1 (
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>15</bold> [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] is a combination of features from Donepezil and other BACE-1 inhibitors, such as AZD3839 [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or the simple 2-aminoquinoline ring, which shares with the AZD compound the bidentate interaction in the enzyme active site. The further addition of a double bond to connect the indenone moiety to the rest of the molecule afforded a nanomolar inhibitor of AChE and BACE-1, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.7 nM and 13.1 nM, respectively. Kinetic studies on AChE revealed a concentration-dependent mixed-type inhibition of this enzyme, while the improved activity on BACE-1 confirmed the pivotal role played by the aminoquinoline group. The viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was not affected by concentrations of up to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Moreover, the compound 15 had the potential to be brain penetrant, showing high permeability in the PAMPA-BBB assay, and had considerable metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes.
