<p>The prototypic compound 
 <bold>49</bold> (bearing the CF
 <sub>3</sub> substituent) was the most potent BACE-1 inhibitor of the series, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and it was also evaluated in animal models of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. There was a high percentage of edema inhibition (70%), comparable to the treatment with Diclofenac, while the effects were slightly less marked on chronic inflammation induced by Formalin (58%), compared to Celecoxib as the reference. The memory-enhancing effect was assessed in an AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>-induced AD rat model, where a significant and robust improvement in behavioral tests, such as the elevated plus maze or the Y-maze was observed. AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>-treated animals also showed a significant increase in MDA levels, a marker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Notably, MDA levels were reduced in treated rats while SOD activity was increased, thus suggesting an antioxidant ability of the compound. No detrimental effects were observed on hematological parameters, and the healthy hippocampus region was the most convincing proof of the protection from neuronal cell degeneration induced by the treatment. Moreover, no hemorrhagic damage or lesion was reported in the stomach and intestine of the animals, demonstrating high gastrointestinal safety. This compound represents a valuable example of how the BACE-1 inhibition and anti-inflammatory activity combined together could serve as efficient agents against AD.
