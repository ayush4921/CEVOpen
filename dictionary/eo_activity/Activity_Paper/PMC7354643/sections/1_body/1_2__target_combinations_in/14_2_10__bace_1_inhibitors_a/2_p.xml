<p>Inspired by coumarine, acylguanidine, and cyclic guanidine moieties, different series of compounds have been identified as BACE1 inhibitors, also endowed with antioxidant and metal-chelating activities (
 <bold>46-48</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). Some of them arise from the combination of the phenylimino-2H-chromen core with an aminomethylene-1,2,3-triazole ring (
 <bold>46</bold>), while the use of the 3-hydrazynyl-1,2,4-triazine structure led to the identification of compounds 
 <bold>47</bold> and 
 <bold>48</bold>. The latter also prompted the authors to evaluate the contribution of the 1,2,4-triazine and the 1,2,3-triazole moieties in chelating metals. Compounds with general structure
