<p>The simultaneous inhibition of ChEs and the antagonistic effect on 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>D</italic>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is definitely one of the most promising strategies towards the identification of new MTDLs. NMDA ionotropic receptors are activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and they are permeable to different positive ions, including Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, thus contributing not only to synaptic plasticity and long-term changes but also to the excitotoxicity process [

 <sup>2+</sup> reaches pathological levels, there is a loss of synaptic functions and neuronal cell death, with a progressive cognitive decline. Recently, the activation of NMDARs has been linked to AD-related synaptic dysfunctions [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and the NMDAR noncompetitive antagonist Memantine has been approved as symptomatologic treatment for moderate to severe AD [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The combination of NMDAR antagonism with the inhibitory activity on ChEs may have beneficial or synergic effects on AD symptomatology, as already proven in animal models of AD [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, a fixed-dose combination of Donepezil and Memantine (known as the drug NamzaricÂ®) is now used to treat moderate to severe dementia stages associated with AD [
