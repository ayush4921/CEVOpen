<p>Another series of compounds reported by Marcinkowska et al. merged an 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzylindole-piperazine skeleton with phthalimide- [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] or THA-moieties [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] (
 <bold>34</bold> and 
 <bold>35</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), using carbon tethers with different lengths as linkers. While the indole-piperazine section brought the potential antagonism for 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], indole alone may have antioxidant properties and the phthalimide or THA groups could contribute to ChEs inhibition, thus creating hybrid compounds with a multifaceted activity. In the phthalimide subseries (
 <bold>34</bold>), the new compounds displayed affinity for 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R with 
 <italic>K</italic>i ranging from 21 to 252 nM and a clear correlation of the binding potency with the length of the linkers with phthalimide. Cell functional studies confirmed the antagonistic activity of these derivatives. Moreover, they were micromolar inhibitors of BuChE, with no or slight activity on AChE, and once again shorter linkers performed better than the longer ones, with R=H unsubstituted analogues being slightly more potent than the halogenated counterparts. The antioxidant activity was determined by FRAP assay, where all the compounds showed antioxidant potential starting from 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and some of them had even better activity than the reference ascorbic acid.
