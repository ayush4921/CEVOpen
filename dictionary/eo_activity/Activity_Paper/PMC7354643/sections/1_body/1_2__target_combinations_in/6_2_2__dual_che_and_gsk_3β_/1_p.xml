<p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3
 <italic>β</italic> (GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic>) is a multitasking serine/threonine kinase largely expressed in the CNS. It is involved in several cellular processes and signaling pathways and its dysregulation occurs in the development of different disorders [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> is also related to the pTAU phosphorylation process [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and an increase in its activity correlates with A
 <italic>β</italic> production by interfering with APP-cleaving enzymes [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], leading to neuronal toxicity. Moreover, the overexpression of GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> in transgenic mice is responsible for the development of cognitive deficits, thus making it a validated target in AD pathology [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Over the past decade, GSK-3
 <italic>β</italic> has been intensively targeted and its concomitant inhibition with AChE represents a well-consolidated and efficient approach to address the multifactorial nature of AD, influencing plaque deposition and pTAU hyperphosphorylation.
