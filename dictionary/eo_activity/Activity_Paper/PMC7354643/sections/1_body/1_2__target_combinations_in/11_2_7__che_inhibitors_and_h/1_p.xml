<p>Besides the more classical couplings of ChE inhibitors with the previously described receptor families, other appealing combinations have been recently explored. So far, the histamine H3 receptor (H
 <sub>3</sub>R) has been the focus of numerous researches for the treatment of cognitive disorders [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. H
 <sub>3</sub>R are mainly expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, caudate, and putamen [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and their activation influences the release of different neurotransmitters (including AChE), thus having an impact on brain disorders like AD. For this reason, antagonists of H
 <sub>3</sub>R have been investigated for their potential role in cognitive dysfunctions related to AD [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. As mentioned above, 
 <italic>σ</italic>1Rs also found their place in the context of neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. These receptors are mainly situated in the endoplasmic reticulum where they normally exert prosurvival and antiapoptotic effects, but they can be found in other organelles influencing lipid, protein, and ion trafficking [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Changes in the function or expression of this multifunctional protein have been linked to various diseases, including AD [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and HD. Here is why some examples of ChE inhibitors in combination with H
 <sub>3</sub>R antagonist or 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R agonist activities have been proposed.
