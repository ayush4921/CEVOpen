<p>Kaur et al. identified two series of triazole-based compounds (

 <bold>54</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>) which are able to address four of the major AD hallmarks, including A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation, metal-induced A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation, metal dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. These analogues resulted from the combination of a hydrophobic part, namely the substituted phenyl rings, which are responsible for the contacts with the A
 <italic>β</italic> peptide and the antiaggregation effect, and a metal chelator part, involving the ditriazole moiety, able to modulate copper-mediated A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation and reduce the oxidative stress.
