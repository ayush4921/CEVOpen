<p>Even when not coupled with other enzymatic activities, ChE inhibitors may have a multitarget profile if considering (

 <italic>β</italic> aggregation, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) their disaggregation effect on preformed A
 <italic>β</italic> fibrils, and (
 <italic>iii</italic>) the metal-chelating properties, affecting metal dyshomeostasis and oxidation processes. This combination often resulted in compounds with the potential to be neuroprotective MTDLs.
