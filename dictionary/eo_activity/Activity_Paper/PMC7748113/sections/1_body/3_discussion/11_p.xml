<p>As critical bioactive constituents of plants, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, and alkaloids play key roles in the antibacterial properties of plants. Some of these bioactive compounds inhibit the life processes of microorganisms by altering their biochemical systems, binding their protein molecules, acting as chelating agents, or causing inflammation of the cells
