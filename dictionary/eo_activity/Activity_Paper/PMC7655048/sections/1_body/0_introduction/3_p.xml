 <italic>Schumanniophyton magnificum</italic> Harms (Rubiaceae), commonly known as ‘mgba mmiri’ in Ibo language of Nigeria, is widely used to treat various diseases in African ethnomedicine. The decoction of the stem bark is used in Cameroon to treat dysentery and as a lotion after circumcision (Okogun et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Its stem bark is also used in Congo as an antiseptic for the treatment of gonorrhoea and ulcers. The stem bark extracts are also effective against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Bickii et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and ability of the stem bark aqueous extract to improve fertility has also been demonstrated (Bend et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> is used as a snake bite remedy and as snake repellent in Nigeria. The protective effects of the stem bark extract against snake venom have been demonstrated (Akunyili and Akubue 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Houghton et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). However, while there are claims on its use traditionally for the treatment of snake bite and relieve of pain, there are no scientific reports on the use of its leaves for this purpose. Since local inflammation and pain are important features of snakebite envenomation due to increase in the activities of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> present in the venom (Tonello and Rigoni 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> has potential in inhibiting PLA
 <sub>2</sub> (Mohanapriya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sajon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), this study seeks to investigate and establish a scientific report on the anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> leaves 
 <italic>via</italic> the inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> activity. It also seeks to investigate the nature of compounds responsible for the effects.
