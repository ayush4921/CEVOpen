<p>Inflammation, which is the response of the immune system to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, irradiation or toxic compounds, acts by removing the injurious stimuli and initiating the healing process (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, sustained inflammation can be detrimental to the host as it contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases. Inflammation is mediated by some chemical substances, such as serotonin, histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins (Abdulkhaleq et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Prostaglandins are synthesized as a result of the cleaving of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids through the action of phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> (PLA
 <sub>2</sub>).
