 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase after centrifugation. Shortly, 10 mL of tested samples (5 mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide solution was reconstructed in 100 mL of 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 out of a 96-well microplate and hatched with 50 mL of important intestinal 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase for 5 min before 50 mL substrate (5 mM, p-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside agreed in the alike buffer) was included. The p-nitrophenol free was slow at 405 nm spectrophotometrically (SpectraMax plus384, Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) 5 min after brooding with the substrate. Singular spaces for the test samples were fixed up to exact foundation absorbance where the substrate was altered with 50 mL of buffer. The control sample controlled 10 mL DMSO alongside test samples. The percent enzyme inhibition was calculated as
