<p id="p0215">Antioxidants function via counteracting reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals (
 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2006</xref>). ROS is independent and contains one or more unpaired electrons which can be the result of various exogenous and endogenous effects such as radiation and microbial contamination (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Krishnaiah et al., 2007</xref>). These ROS oxidants can cause lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation leading to mutation (
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Nakabeppu et al., 2006</xref>) and protein oxidation causing degradation, denaturation and loss of function of cell (
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Davies, 2001</xref>). Ascorbic acid, a common antioxidant can scavenge ROS and chelating metals, whereas vitamin E can function by delaying oxidation of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (

 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2004</xref>) and found to be promising against aging, coronary heart disease and cancer (
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">La Vecchia et al., 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">Stephens et al., 1996</xref>). Besides, flavonoids have the ability to donate hydrogen atoms or electrons to demonstrate strong antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Agati et al., 2012</xref>). Flavonoids can also play a pivotal role as antitumorigenic agents in different stages of cancer development and progression of cancer following different mechanisms including induction of apoptosis in tumor cells (

 <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Babu et al., 2013</xref>). In this quantitative test of MEMP, the total phenol content was found 65.27 mg GAE/g. Besides, from the DPPH scavenging test, MEMP revealed remarkable antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.96 μg/mL while standard BHT exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20.07 μg/mL. Furthermore, the brine shrimp bioassay displayed moderate toxicity (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.094 μg/mL) in comparison to vincristine sulfate (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.451 μg/mL). Thus, research concern is increased to evaluate phytochemicals to establish new natural cytotoxic and antioxidant molecules.
