<p id="p0100">To evaluate the antimicrobial property of methanol fractions of 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic>, the disc diffusion method (
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Huys et al., 2002</xref>) was employed. To conduct the susceptibility assay, two antibiotic candidates available in the market were considered as standard drugs: streptomycin (for gram-negative) and amoxicillin (for gram-positive). The zones of the nutrient agar medium plates were pre-inoculated with test bacteria and fungi, whereas sample discs, standard antibiotic discs and the control discs were placed gently and the plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The diameters of the clear zones were measured carefully.
