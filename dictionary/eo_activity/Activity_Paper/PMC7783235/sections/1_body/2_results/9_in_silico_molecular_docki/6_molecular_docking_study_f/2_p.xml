<p id="p0185">The selected compounds were docked with the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> exonuclease I (PDB ID: 1FXX). From the result, it was observed that ovalitenone and pongamol showed the uppermost and lowermost binding affinity to the 1FXX receptor. The ranking of the docking score is: Ovalitenone &gt; Kanjone &gt; Lanceolatin–B &gt; Milletenone &gt; Pongamol. Ovalitenone showed the binding affinity to the 1FXX receptor by binding with the residues (mg501, tyr102, arg165, phe107, thr18, glu17 and tyr16) of hydrogen and hydrophobic bond. The summary of antibacterial docking study has been enumerated in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and the best docking interaction by ovalitenone and 1FXX has been shown in
