<p id="p0025">Computational biology is reflecting a mammoth role as enormous data can be generated and validated by molecular and experimental biologists nowadays through this approach. To establish and investigate drug designing of a newer molecule, execution of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) techniques and molecular docking has been proven as time-efficient as
