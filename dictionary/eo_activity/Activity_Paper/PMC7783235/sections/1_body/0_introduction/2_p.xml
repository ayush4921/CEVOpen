However, analgesic drugs are used to manage the pain, inflammation and categorized as opioids (morphine, fentanyl), NSAIDs and some newer approaches (gabapentin, carbamazepine, ketamine). Besides, glucocorticoids exert response by binding with receptors resulting in increased transcription of anti-inflammatory proteins (e.g., IL-1 antagonist) along with inhibition of activated transcription factors (e.g., NF-ÎºB) (

Though various NSAIDs are commercially available, they exhibit few major side effects including GI ulceration, liver toxicity, kidney disease etc. after prolonged uses (
