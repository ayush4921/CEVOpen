    "<i>Millettia peguensis,</i> popular for its ethnopharmacological uses, was employed to evaluate its different pharmacological properties in this study. The analgesic studies of the plant have been performed by acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced licking tests respectively, whereas the antidiarrheal experiment was done by castor oil-induced diarrheal test. Besides, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, thrombolytic evaluations were performed by DPPH scavenging with phenol content determination, brine shrimp lethality, disc diffusion and clot lysis methods respectively. Moreover, <i>in silico</i> study of the phytoconstituents was carried out by molecular docking and ADME/T analysis. The methanol extract of <i>Millettia peguensis</i> (MEMP) revealed significant biological activity in the analgesic and antidiarrheal test (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to the standards. Antioxidant assay displayed promising IC<sub>50</sub> values (15.96 μg/mL) with the total phenol content (65.27 ± 1.24 mg GAE/g). In the cytotoxicity study, the LC<sub>50</sub> value was found to be 1.094 μg/mL. Besides, MEMP was highly sensitive to the bacteria but less liable to clot lysis. Furthermore, phytoconstituents exposed potential binding affinity towards the selected receptors, whereas the ADME/T properties indicated the drug likeliness of the plant. The outcomes of these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of this plant against pain, diarrhea, inflammation, and tissue toxicity."
