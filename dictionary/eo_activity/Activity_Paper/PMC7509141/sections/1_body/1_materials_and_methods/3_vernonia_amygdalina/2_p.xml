 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> were sourced in a garden at the staff quarters in Kings University, Odeomu, Osun State. The leaf has been identified at IFE-Herbarium of Botany Department, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife with Voucher number. The 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> leaves were dried in the Biochemistry laboratory at room temperature and subsequently pulverized. Thereafter, the sample was defatted in n-hexane using Soxhlet apparatus. The methanol extract used for the study was prepared by extracting the defatted 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> sample for 72 h in 90 % methanol. The resulting mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated extract was obtained on water bath. The paste obtained was freeze dried, weighed and reconstituted in water for subsequent studies.
