<p id="par0045">The major pathological process which causes dopaminergic neurons death in NDs is yet fully understood. Recent scientific findings suggest the involvement of neuro-inflammation, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic mechanisms in NDs pathology [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it is not yet fully elucidated whether one or more of these diseases mediators is responsible for initiating the disease. Building upon this, medicinal plants, their active components and extracts with multiple pharmacological mechanisms such as antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammation are strongly recommended as potential neuroprotective agents.
