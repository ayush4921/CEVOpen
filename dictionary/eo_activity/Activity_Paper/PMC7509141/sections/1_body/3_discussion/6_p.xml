<p id="par0200">In this study, exposure of rats to nitrobenzene induced significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) as marker of lipid peroxidation; and marked increase in NO and MPO as markers of inflammatory respectively in the three regions (cerebrum, cerebellum, and mid brain) of the brain. Neuronal cells are more vulnerable to oxidative stress and inflammation, thus, requires efficient steady supply of potent antioxidants to neutralize the lipid peroxidation chain reaction, which induces free radical damage. Treatment with methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly reverse the increase thus, inhibiting the lipid peroxidation chain reaction and neuro-inflammation in the three regions of the brain examined. These findings corroborate the report of Layer and Gomez-pinilla [
