<p id="par0205">Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system which play a major role in both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system functions including learning, memory, movement, control and modulation of cerebral blood flow [

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>] and thus very important in neurological functions. Acetylcholine level is controlled by Acetylcholinesterase (AchE), an enzyme that hydrolyse the neurotransmitter. Alteration in the activities of AchE may lead to undesirable effect on cholinergic transmission as well as progressive cognitive impairment [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Administration of nitrobenzene to rats cause drastic increase in the level of acetylcholinesterase activity in the three regions (cerebrum, cerebellum, and the mid brain) of the brain examined. Treatment with methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly attenuate this effect by decreasing greatly the activity of this enzyme in the three regions of the brain, especially in the striatum which contribute greatly in the neurodegenerative disorder known as Parkinsonâ€™s disease. This established the ability of the extract to increase acetylcholine level in the synaptic cleft and influence cholinergic neurotransmission.
