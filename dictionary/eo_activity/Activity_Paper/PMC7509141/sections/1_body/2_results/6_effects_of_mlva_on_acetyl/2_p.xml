Exposure of rats to nitrobenzene alone caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in dopamine concentration and elevation in AChE activity in the midbrain, cerebrum and cerebellum of the rats. However, treatment with either MLVA and vitamin E significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reversed the AChE activity when compared with the control and enhance dopamine concentrations in all regions of the brain examined.
