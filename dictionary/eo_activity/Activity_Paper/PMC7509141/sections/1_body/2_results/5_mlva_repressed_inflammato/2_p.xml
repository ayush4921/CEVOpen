<p id="par0155">The effects of MLVA on neuro-inflammation in mid brain, cerebrum and cerebellum of the experimental rats was evaluated by measuring MPO activities and NO concentration level. Rats administered nitrobenzene alone demonstrated a marked increase in NO level and MPO activities in all the brain sections when compared with the control (
