 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">12â€“15</xref> show the histological alterations seen with the light microscope in the hippocampus, midbrain, cerebrum and cerebellum sections of brains of the experimental rats. The cytoarchitecture and morphology of hippocampus, midbrain, cerebrum and cerebellum of rats from control group appeared normal. However, obvious pathological lesions were observed in the hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and cerebrum sections of nitrobenzene group. In cerebellar cortex (
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>), group B show mild degenerative characterized with loss of cells from the purkinje cell layer and gradual loss of cytoplasmic contents, fragmented granule cell layer as well loss of major parts of the neuropil (red arrows). Group E showed a mild similar appearance with A and D group (yellow arrow). In cerebral prefrontal cortex (
 <xref rid="fig0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>), Group B treatment caused some observable degenerative changes in the cortex that was characterized by clustered pyknotic pyramidal neurons that appear with fragmented cytoplasm and condensed nuclei within soma (red arrow). Perineural spaces can be seen surrounding degenerating neurons (red arrows) Axons and dendrites are scarcely appreciable around neurons in this group. Also, nuclear content and cytoplasmic materials are less appreciable. In hippocampus (
 <xref rid="fig0070" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>), group B treatment on the other hand, induced degenerative changes in the hippocampus and was characterised by fragmented pyramidal and granule cell layer. Although group C and E showed slight degenerative changes in line with the morphologic appearance of groups B; their cortical layers are better structured and delineated like group A and D. In midbrain (
