 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the results of behavioural analyses of the general locomotor activities, negative geotaxis, forelimb grip, time of grooming and incidence of faecal pellets in nitrobenzene-induced neurodegenerative rats. Rats treated with nitrobenzene alone demonstrated significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in the total distance travelled, average speed, total time mobile, and turn angle in comparison with control. However, treatment of the rats with either MLVA or Vitamin E showed significant improvement in the motor and locomotor activities evidenced by marked increase in the average speed, total distance travelled, total time mobile and turn angle when compared with untreated neurodegenerative rats. Moreover, Rats treated with nitrobenzene alone exhibited a significant lesser time in forelimb grip test and marked decrease in time of grooming and incidence of faecal pellets than the control. Treatment of the rats with either MLVA or Vitamin E showed marked increase in rat activities on the forelimb grip, time of grooming and faecal pellets when compared with the control.
