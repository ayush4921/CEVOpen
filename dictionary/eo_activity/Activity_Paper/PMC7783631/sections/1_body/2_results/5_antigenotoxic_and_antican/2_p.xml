 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> states, whether 
 <italic>BC</italic> extracts presents genotoxic activity for human lymphocytes and 
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> points out antigenotoxic activity results for 
 <italic>BC</italic> extracts, which states the activity of the

 <sub>2</sub>. According to 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, while 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract caused no tail DNA damage, 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract presented only 0.05% of tail DNA damage, where positive control was the cause of 54% of tail DNA damage. On the other hand, according to 
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract inhibited the genotoxic activity of 50 µM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> as 39% and 55% respectively. Also, 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract presented ~ 30% decrease in tail length for 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract and ~ 45% decrease in tail length for 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
