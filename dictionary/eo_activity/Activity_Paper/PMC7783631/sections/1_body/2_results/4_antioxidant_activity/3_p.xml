<p id="p0100">Antioxidants, which are natural, such as total phenols, tocopherols and ascorbic acid were found to be in the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>BC</italic> in our study. However, folic acid was not detected. The TPC determined for the extract was 23.26 mg GAE.g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The extract was analysed by HPLC for their vitamin content (ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol and folic acid) and the total phenolic content which could cause the antioxidant activity. The data obtained from this analysis were given in 
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol were found in lower amounts (1.87 and &lt; 0.5 µg.g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively) in the extract.
