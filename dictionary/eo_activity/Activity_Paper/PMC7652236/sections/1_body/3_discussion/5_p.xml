<p>In the castor oil-induced diarrhea model, the extract of V. amygdalina leaves at all tested doses significantly delayed the onset of defecation, reduced the number and weight of both wet and total fecal output. The highest doses, 400 mg/kg, significantly delay the onset of diarrhea caused by castor oil when compared with the negative controls and the percentage of inhibition of defecation produced was closer to inhibition produced by the standard drug. Furthermore, the extract displayed a dose-dependent reduction in percentage of weight of wet fecal output (R2 = 0.996, p&lt; 0.05) and weight of total fecal output (R2 = 0.964, p &lt; 0.05). The reduction in the frequency of defecation, the weight of wet stools, and total stools indicate the efficacy of 80% methanol extract of V. amygdalina as an antidiarrheal agent. The results obtained support the report done in Nigeria.
