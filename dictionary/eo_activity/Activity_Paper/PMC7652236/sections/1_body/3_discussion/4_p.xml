<p>In the current study, diarrhea was induced experimentally by using castor oil, as this model is the general model to test the antidiarrheal activities of different substances.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Castor oil causes diarrhea due to poor absorption of its active metabolite, ricinoleic acid, which causes changes in the mucosal permeability, electrolyte transport, and intestinal peristalsis, leading to hypersecretory response and diarrhea.
