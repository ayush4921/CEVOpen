<p>The total tannin content was determined by the modified method of 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Polshettiwar et al. (2007)</xref>. The sample (0.1 mL) was mixed with 0.5 mL of Folin-Denis reagent and 1 mL of 0.5% sodium carbonate (w/v) solution. The mixture was then made up to 5 mL with distilled water. The absorbance was measured at 755 nm within 30 min of reaction. The total tannin in the extract was expressed as the equivalent to tannic acid.
