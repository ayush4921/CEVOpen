<p>The antioxidant potential of spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> against DPPH
 <bold>˙</bold> was evaluated as per previously described procedures by Brand-Williams et al.

 </xref>. DPPH solution was prepared by dissolving 0.024 g DPPH in methanol (100 mL). In 96-well plates, × μL sample and 200-x μL DPPH solution were added. The plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and finally, absorbance was recorded at 517 nm wavelength. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The percent radical scavenging potential was calculated for each compound 
 <italic>via</italic> the following equation: Scavenging effect (%) = {(Absorbance of control − Absorbance of sample)/Absorbance of control} × 100.
