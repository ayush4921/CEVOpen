<p>Observing the aforementioned results for the anti-proliferative activity MTT assay against HepG2 cells, certain structure activity relationships could be concluded. Firstly, we examined the effect of C-5 substitution of the indoline moiety. 5-Br substituted spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6i–6l</bold> displayed more enhanced anti-proliferative activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.3, 9.9, 13.2 and 12.7 µM, respectively) than their corresponding unsubstituted spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–6d</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.9, 21.0, 19.1 and 49.1 µM, respectively), 5-Cl substituted spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6e–6h</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.4, 32.7, &gt;50.0 and 19.9 µM, respectively), and 5-OCH
 <sub>3</sub> substituted spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6 m–6p</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30.6, &gt;50.0, &gt;50.0 and &gt;50.0 µM, respectively), which highlighted that C-5 substitution of the indoline moiety with the large lipophilic Br group is more advantageous for the growth inhibitory activity against HepG2 cells than substitution with smaller lipophilic (as Cl and OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) groups and unsubstitution.
