<p>To investigate the ability of spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> to provoke apoptosis, herein we assessed the expression levels of the hallmark parameters of apoptosis in HepG2 cells upon treatment with 
 <bold>6a</bold> at its IC
 <sub>50</sub> (6.9 µM) (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In this study, exposure of HepG2 cells to spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> resulted in a significant 5.7-fold increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, with concurrent significant down-regulation of the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 by ∼ 42% compared to the control (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Analysing these results declared that spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> boosted the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio nine folds in comparison to the control. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is considered as a decisive value that gives a real insight to the overall pro-apoptotic impact of the examined compound.
