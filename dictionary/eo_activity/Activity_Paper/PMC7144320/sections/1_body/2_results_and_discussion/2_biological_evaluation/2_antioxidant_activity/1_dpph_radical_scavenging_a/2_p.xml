<p>From the obtained results, it was obvious that most of the prepared spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> exhibited excellent to moderate DPPH radical scavenging capacities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> spanning in the range: 28.07 − 113.45 µg/mL. Superiorly, both spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6 m</bold> emerged as the most efficient DPPH radical scavengers with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 29.76 ± 1.82 and 28.07 ± 1.63 µg/mL, respectively, which are 1.6-fold more potent than the standard antioxidant Ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 45.89 ± 2.39 µg/mL). Also, compounds 
 <bold>6c–6f</bold>, 
 <bold>6i</bold>, 
 <bold>6j</bold> and 
 <bold>6 l</bold> showed higher DPPH radical scavenging capacities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 33.43 ± 1.24 − 43.42 ± 3.04 µg/mL) than Ascorbic acid. Furthermore, spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6 h</bold>, 
 <bold>6k</bold> and 
 <bold>6n–6p</bold> displayed moderate antiradical activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 46.29 ± 2.18, 69.25 ± 4.25, 46.29 ± 2.52, 58.82 ± 3.14 and 55.05 ± 3.41 µg/mL, respectively. Contrariwise, compounds 
 <bold>6 b</bold> and 
 <bold>6 g</bold> elicited weak DPPH˙ scavenging activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 113.45 ± 5.59 and 97.47 ± 5.62 µg/mL, respectively.
