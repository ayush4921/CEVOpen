<p>Investigation of the obtained results in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> revealed that the tested spirooxindoles were more effective towards HCC HepG2 cells rather than prostate cancer PC-3 cells, except compounds 
 <bold>6f</bold>, 
 <bold>6 m</bold> and 
 <bold>6n</bold> which caused slightly enhanced growth inhibitory activity against PC-3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.3, 24.3 and 42.8 µM, respectively) than HepG2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.7, 30.6 and &gt;50.0 µM, respectively).
