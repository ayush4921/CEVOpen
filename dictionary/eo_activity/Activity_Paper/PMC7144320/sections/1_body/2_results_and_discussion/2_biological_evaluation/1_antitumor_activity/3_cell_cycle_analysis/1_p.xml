<p>The impact of spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> on the normal cell cycle progression was investigated using flow cytometric analysis of the DNA ploidy in HepG2 cells. Exposure of HepG2 cells to spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> at its IC
 <sub>50</sub> (6.9 µM) for 24 h revealed the ability of 
 <bold>6a</bold> to disrupt the normal cell cycle by decreasing both G0-G1 and S phases by approximately 0.53- and 0.37-folds with respect to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, both Pre-G and G2/M phases of the treated HepG2 cell were significantly increased by 11.9- and 2.1-folds related to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). Alteration of the Pre-G phase and arrest of G2-M phase may imply apoptosis as a potential mechanism for 
 <bold>6a</bold>-induced cancer cell death.
