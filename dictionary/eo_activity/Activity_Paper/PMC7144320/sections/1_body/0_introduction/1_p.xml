<p>In the current medical era much attention has been paid to fight the extreme assembly of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, or superoxide anion, that aggressively interact with natural macromolecules in different tissues by chain process resulting in an oxidative damage

 </xref>. Biological systems have the capability to defend themselves against these ROS 
 <italic>via</italic> enzymes (such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) or by non-enzymatic mechanisms that involve organic antioxidants molecules (such as glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E). These antioxidants are capable of direct scavenging the oxidant species through breaking of oxidation propagation chain reactions or through the generation of hydrogen atom in stoichiometric manner, hence preventing free radical-associated damage
