  <p>Chemical structures of ursolic acid (ULA) (
   <bold>A</bold>) and ursonic acid (UNA) (
   <bold>B</bold>). The only difference between the two molecules is the functional group attached to the C-3 position of ULA and UNA. A Î²-hydroxy group is attached to the C-3 of ULA, while a keto group is attached to the C-3 position of UNA. This difference may lead to dissimilar bioactivities between ULA and UNA, as shown in several studies.
