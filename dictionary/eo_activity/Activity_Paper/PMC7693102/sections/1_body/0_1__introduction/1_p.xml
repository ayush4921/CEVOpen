<p>Historically, plants have long been used to create or obtain medicines to treat a variety of diseases [

 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Plants can generate a wide range of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although the main roles of plant secondary metabolites are defense from enemies (herbivores, microbes, and other competing plants) and transduction of signals to enhance reproduction, these natural products are also beneficial for humans in terms of treatment of numerous human diseases through regulation of cell metabolism. These mechanisms of therapeutic activities of secondary metabolites include modulation of ion channels, neuroreceptors, enzymatic activity, and cytoskeleton assembly [
