<p>Metastasis occurs when cancer cells from primary tumors spread to other organs. Metastasis is often fatal to cancer patients, as it is responsible for approximately 66.7% of cancer deaths [
 <xref rid="B55-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The extracellular matrix (ECM) holds cancer cells to the origin of oncogenesis as a biochemical and biophysical obstacle. For cancer cells to reach out to a great distance throughout the body, the ECM must be destroyed. The ECM is composed of various molecules, such as polysaccharides and proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of proteases that enzymatically digest ECM-composing proteins, such as gelatin and collagen. In addition, MMPs are known to promote cell migration nonproteolytically via their hemopexin domain. Therefore, metastasis of cancer is accelerated by migration and invasion, which can be promoted by MMPs in both enzymatic and nonenzymatic ways [

This antimetastatic effect of UNA is connected with suppressed proteinase activities of gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 through transcriptional regulation. These inhibitory effects of UNA are similar to those of ULA, as ULA also hampered invasion and expression of MMPs in lung cancer cells [
