<p>Biofilm is one of major factors that lowers the efficacy of antibacterial drugs. In a previous study, UNA showed antibiofilm activity of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (82% inhibition at 100 µM), although it did not exert antibacterial activity compared to ULA [

 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM), whereas ULA significantly reduced cell viability (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 µM), indicating that UNA may be developed as a safer antibiofilm reagent [
