<p>Modifications of UNA could be conducted to improve its pharmacological potential. In another work, derivatives of UNA generated by reaction with oxalyl chloride and various phenyl amines inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation of H460 human lung cancer cells, with values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.94 to 15 µM [

 <sub>50</sub> from 0.71 to 10.32 µM), while the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of ULA and UNA were 5.08 and 2.47 µM, respectively [
