<p>Triterpenoids can be synthesized by plants through complicated biochemical pathways [

In plastids of plants cells, pyruvate (C3) reacts with D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to become the isomers isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (C5) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Synthesis of IPP and DMAPP also occurs in cytosol via decarboxylation of mevalonic acid (C6), which originates from the serial condensation of three units of acetyl-CoA [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Condensation reactions of IPP and DMAPP result in the formation of farnesyl diphosphate (C15) and squalene (C30), a precursor of triterpenoids. Several plant enzymes mediate the synthesis of triterpenoids through oxidization, folding, and cyclization of squalene [

Since the only difference between UNA and ULA is a functioning group at C-3, UNA can be semisynthesized by oxidation of ULA. Synthesis of UNA can be accomplished by the metabolism of living organisms other than plants. For example, Gram-positive bacteria

 <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> CGMCC 1.1741 was found to biotransform ULA to generate UNA [

 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> resulted in isolation of UNA [
