<p id="p0225">The role of lipoxygenase in pathophysiology of many inflammatory diseases is important. Previous experimental work showed that secondary metabolites from plants including terpenes, coumarins, flavonoids, and alkaloids showed inhibitory activity against 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. This study revealed the potential of lipoxygenase inhibition by 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> extracts as well as total alkaloids from different parts of plant. Therefore, it might contribute in the crucial search for alternative therapies for inflammation. The enzymes COX-1, COX-2, and LOX have got utmost importance due to the fact that these are important target for discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs (
