<p id="p0210">Inflammation is a common phenomenon which may occur due to the reaction of tissue toward injury. The carrageenan test has long been used as the most acceptable method to investigate new anti-inflammatory drugs (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Just et al., 1998</xref>). Subcutaneous injection of carrageenan induces a biphasic inflammation which is categorized by signs of edema and pain. Pro-inflammatory mediators which include histamine, tachykinins, serotonin, and bradykinin are responsible for the induction. Prostaglandins then initiate the last phase of the edema via the action of COX-2 together with inducible nitric oxide synthase which increases the vascular permeability of vessels causing edema (

 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> was administered to the carrageenan induce inflammation models which pointedly reduce the paw edema treatment procedure. Paw edema inhibition in mice conceivably preventing the pro-inflammatory mediators of edema synthesis and their release at the target site. However, its exact mechanism is still needed to be established properly. Standard drug (Diclofenac) which is a non-selective COX inhibitor which prevents the synthesis of the arachidonic acid metabolites such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, etc. was compared with 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> extract and crude alkaloids which suppressed edema in the same manner as that of standard drug (N.
