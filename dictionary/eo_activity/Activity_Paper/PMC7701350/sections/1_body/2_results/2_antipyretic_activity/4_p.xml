<p id="p0100">Effect of methanol extract of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> stem bark (ZAB) and isolated total alkaloid fraction (ZABA) on pyrexia induced body temperature in mice is presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was noted that ZAB at all doses caused less significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease of body temperature in mice up to 5 h of extract administration as compared to ZAF and ZAL. Similarly, ZABA showed less significant (p &lt; 0.05) lowering of rectal temperature in mice after 5 h.
