<p id="p0155">The crude alkaloids from fruit (ZAFA), leaves (ZALA), bark (ZABA), and root bark (ZARA) were investigated for in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibition assay. The crude alkaloids inhibited the enzyme 5-LOX with IC50 (μg/ml) 15, 69.48, 110 and 115.38 respectively. This shows that maximum inhibitory activity was exhibited by crude alkaloids from fruit extract of
