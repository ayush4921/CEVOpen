<p id="p0160">In a similar way the (ZAFA), (ZALA), (ZABA), and (ZARA) were used in cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitory assay and the respective inhibition in IC50 (μg/ml) was calculated. The respective values were 21, 62, 98, 109.03 μg/ml. Again the crude alkaloids from fruit extract showed very good activity followed by crude alkaloids from leaves extract. Figures
