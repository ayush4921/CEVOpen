<p id="p0080">A Claurus 600 GC-MS, Electron Impact Ionization detector, installed with turbo mass software version 5.4.0 PerkinElmer, USA was used for analysis. Helium was used with flow rate of 1 ml/min as carrier. Column used as Elite 5MS 250 μm internal diameter, 30 m length. The column was coated with 0.25 μm dimethylpolysiloxane (Rtx-1). Auto injector with split of 1:20 was fixed. The mass spectra scan rate was 2.86 scans/second. Injection temperature was set at 250 Celsius. Ionization source was I.E 70 eV. Initial temperature was held at 50 °C for 2 min. The temperature was ramped from 50 °C to 100 °C with a rate of 15 °C/min and held for 1 min. The second ramp was 100–250 °C with the same rate and held for 1 min. And finally temperature was ramped to 300 °C and held for 0.5 min.</p>
