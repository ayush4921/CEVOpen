<p id="Par8">Experiential learning, defined as “learning from life experience” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], is one potential strategy to address limitations in didactic learning. Experiential learning has been reported to be widely used in professional programmes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but its effectiveness has not been proven rigorously in the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], especially in the context of CM education. In our school, field trips are employed as a mean of experiential learning. A field trip is a journey that allows students and teachers to leave the classroom to experience settings away from their normal environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Field trips are sometimes conducted in medical programmes as a direct approach to teaching and learning essential knowledge and activities in medical practice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The studied field trip programme is held in Summer Semester to allow students to recognize and directly in contact with the raw Chinese herbs in the wild that they have previously studied in the “Chinese Materia Medica” course. In addition to this direct experience, the field trip offers students the opportunity to learn about the social and cultural background of CM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both the direct experience and the deepening of background knowledge achieved through experiential learning can help students to deepen the understanding of Chinese herbs obtained in lectures, facilitating a reinforcement loop between experimental learning and lecture-based learning. Despite the appealing benefits inherent to experiential learning, several problems in the current field trip were identified based on feedback on the course design of “Chinese Materia Medica” and its field trip component. Students requested improvements in the learning facilities and assessment approaches of the course. On the other hand, teachers found it difficult to evaluate the quality of students’ participation in the field trip. This was mainly due to the relatively low teacher-to-student ratio, and students tend to scatter around in the field. Teachers were also concerned about whether the expected outcomes (experience and knowledge) were effectively delivered to each student during the field trip. Additionally, students had difficulty reviewing what they have learned during the field trip because the trip required experiencing indigenous Chinese medical herbs in the wild under natural conditions in Mainland China, meaning that the related perceptions and knowledge could be only provided on-site during the field trip. Finally, it was not feasible to evaluate students’ learning outcomes after the field trip. As a result, the knowledge management of this field trip programme as a resource for the school and university was poor, and the teachers, tutors, and students had difficulty providing feedback regarding their respective positions in this system, which limits the establishment of standard assessments of the output of the field trip study programme. There is an urgent need for an improved design of the CM field trip course.
