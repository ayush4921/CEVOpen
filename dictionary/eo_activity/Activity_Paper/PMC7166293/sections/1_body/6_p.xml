<p>W. Ekasari et al. reported the antimalarial activity of various parts of 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Inhibition of heme detoxification was also evaluated by the 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-hematin level. The study revealed that the ethanol extracts of root of 
 <italic>H. annuus</italic> showed promise as a new source for the development of new plant-based antimalarial agent.
