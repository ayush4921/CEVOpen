<p>A paper by A. Widyawaruyanti et al. investigated the effect of formulated 
 <italic>Artocarpus champeden</italic> stem bark extract on parasite growth and immune response of 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>-infected mice in order to explain the mechanism for the antimalarial activity of the plant. The parasitemia, survival time, liver enzymes, and cytokine Th1 (IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) and Th2 (IL-10) levels were determined in infected mice. Results revealed that the plant extract was effective in inhibiting 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> growth and extending survival time. No effect on liver function was observed. The antimalarial effect of the plant could be explained in part by the enhanced production of the proinflammation cytokines, IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>.
