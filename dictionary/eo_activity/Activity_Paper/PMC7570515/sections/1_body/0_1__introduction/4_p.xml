Furthermore, obtaining metabolomic fingerprints has wide applications in natural product research, with many studies reporting on the use of metabolomic analysis for the quality control of medicinal plants, the manufacturing of phytopharmaceutical products [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04130-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and to determine whether unique chemical markers could be identified. Thereafter, these could be utilized as distinguishing characters that could aid in the botanical classification of this plant. Additionally, isolation of compounds from one of the populations was undertaken with the purpose of generating chemical standards that could be employed as biomarkers to define qualitative and quantitative intra- and interpopulation differences. As a proof-of-concept, relative abundance analysis of the purified compounds in the other populations was done. In vitro antimicrobial analysis of these compounds and the extracts from the five populations was conducted using both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and chosen fungi of economic importance to determine the best population in terms of tested antimicrobial activity, as well as to compare the activity of the populations with the isolated compounds.
