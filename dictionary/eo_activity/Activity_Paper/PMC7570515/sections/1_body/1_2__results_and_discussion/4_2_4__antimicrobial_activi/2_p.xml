<p>Plant flavonoids have been reported to exhibit a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and antifungal [

 <italic>D. viscosa,</italic> inhibited the growth of the four tested microbes with MIC values for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> of 3.91 µg/mL, and 7.81 µg/mL for MRSA and 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> The antimicrobial activity of catechin is inconsistent with those reported in other studies [

 <bold>2</bold>), a flavonoid with similar oxygenation pattern with catechin except for the absence of OH groups at carbon 3 and 3′ did not inhibit the growth of any of the microbes tested, confirming the importance of hydroxyl groups in those carbons for antimicrobial activity in flavonoids. Hydroxyls at special sites on the aromatic rings of flavonoids are known to improve their biological activities, whereas methylation of the active OH groups generally decreases such activities [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was similar to catechin (
 <bold>4</bold>) while the Nanyuki extract and hautriwaic acid lactone (
 <bold>3</bold>) were similar to each other in the inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
