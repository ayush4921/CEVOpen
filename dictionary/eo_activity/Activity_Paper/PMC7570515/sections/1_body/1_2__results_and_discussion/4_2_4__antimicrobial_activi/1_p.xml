<p>Many plant secondary metabolites are known to possess a wide range of biological activities such as antifungal, antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and anticancer activities [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> has been reported to possess antimicrobial activity against microbes of economic importance [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Diterpenoids are known to possess antimicrobial and antioxidant potencies [

 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This prompted us to test the antimicrobial activity of the four isolated compounds from this plant against both Gram-positive (MRSA and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), and fungi (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04130-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). On the one hand, of the two diterpenoids isolated, dodonic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited low activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and was inactive against MRSA and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. On the other hand, hautriwaic acid lactone (
 <bold>3</bold>) with a similar structure to dodonic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>), except for the presence of a lactone ring, showed good activity against all the tested microbes. The MIC values for both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were 1.95 µg/mL, MRSA 62.5 µg/mL, and 7.81 µg/mL for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. These results indicate the importance of a lactone moiety in the inhibition of microbial growth [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The report of antimicrobial activity of hautriwaic acid lactone is in agreement with the work of Omosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who found that this compound had good antifungal activity against 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with a MIC value of 7.8 μg/well, probably due to its lipophilic nature.
