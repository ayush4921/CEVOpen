<p>From the extracts, 313 chemicals were present in all the chromatograms assessed, but only 55 compounds were putatively identified and were comprised of phenolics, terpenoids, and saponins, several of which are described here for the first time in 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04130-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Some of the chemicals that were common among the samples include: isorhamnetin, aromadendrin, and chlorogenic acid. The relative abundances of the identified compounds in each population are illustrated in the form of a heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f002">Figure 2</xref>) in which some compounds are found to be more concentrated (light red in color) in specific populations and less concentrated in other collections (light green in color) with regards to their relative abundances.
