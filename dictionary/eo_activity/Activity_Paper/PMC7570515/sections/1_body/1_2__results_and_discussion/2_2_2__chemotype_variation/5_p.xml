<p>The production of specialized metabolites in plants is meant to help plants fight natural enemies, as well as counteract with other forms of natural biotic and abiotic stress including those created through anthropogenic activities such as pollution [

Hypothetically, it is possible that such differences in geoclimatic conditions can lead to variable chemistry that enables the plant to adapt to stress. Certainly, the Nairobi and Narok populations are faced with natural enemies such as browsers (Narok), as well as environmental stress such as pollution (Nairobi population) [
