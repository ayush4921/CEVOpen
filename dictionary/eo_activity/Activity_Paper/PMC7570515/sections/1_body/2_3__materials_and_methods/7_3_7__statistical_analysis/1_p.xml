<p>Three biological replicates and three technical replicates were injected randomly to the LC-MS machine for each test sample. Untargeted analysis of the data was performed using MarkerLynx (part of MassLynx 4.1, Waters, Milford, USA) to generate a matrix of accurate mass and retention time (AMRT) features uploaded to MetaboAnalyst, a free online software platform, to perform the chemometric analysis. Targetlynx, another application within Masslynx, was used to quantify the various tentatively identified metabolites in a relative fashion, against calibration curves established using either catechin or quercetin calibration standards. The principal component analysis (PCA) model with pareto scaling was used as an unsupervised multivariate cluster technique. Pareto scaling increases the contributory effects of low concentration metabolites but does not amplify noise and artefacts linked to metabolomics data [

Interrelationships were revealed through PCA based on three components (MS data, relative abundances, and spatial distribution) for the test materials. The instrument variation was negligible and replicates clustered close to each other. Where members from different sites appeared to cluster together, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed to further separate them. The accurate mass obtained for the molecular ions [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> was used to calculate the possible molecular formula, considering a maximum deviation between observed and calculated mass of 5 ppm. The molecular formula, accurate mass, and MSE fragmentation spectra, were used as entry data for MetFrag β-database analysis [
