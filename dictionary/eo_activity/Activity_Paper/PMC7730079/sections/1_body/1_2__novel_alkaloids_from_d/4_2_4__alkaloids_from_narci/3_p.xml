<p>Jonquailine showed anticancer activity against drug-resistant human tumor models with diverse mechanisms and displayed synergy with paclitaxel. These results and literature data demonstrated that the hydroxylation at C-8 is an important feature to impart the anticancer activity, which is independent from its stereochemistry as both jonquiline and pretazettine showed significant activity, while tazettine, lacking this hydroxyl group, had no activity [
