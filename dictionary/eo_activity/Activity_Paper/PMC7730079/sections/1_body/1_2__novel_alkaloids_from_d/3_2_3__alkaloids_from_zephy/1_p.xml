 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In fact, its organic extract showed potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Fifteen alkaloids were isolated from the whole plant extract and identified as 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylhemeanthidine chloride, 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-5,6-dihydroplicane, 
 <italic>O</italic>-methylnerinine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethoxycarbonylethylcrinasiadine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethoxycarbonylpropylcrinasiadine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-phenethylcrinasiadine 
 <italic>N</italic>-isopentylcrinasiadine, hemeanthamine, 3-
 <italic>epi</italic>-macronine, (+)-tazettine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylcrinasiadine, trisphaeridine, 5,6-dihydrobicolorine, lycorine, and nigragillin. When tested for their cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines and the Beas-2B immortalized (noncancerous) human bronchial epithelial cell line, the 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-5, 6-dihydroplicane, hemeanthamine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-isopentylcrinasiadine, and lycorine showed toxicity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.81 to 13 Î¼M [
