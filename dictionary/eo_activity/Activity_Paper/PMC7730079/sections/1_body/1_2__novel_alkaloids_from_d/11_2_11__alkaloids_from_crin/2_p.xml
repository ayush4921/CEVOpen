 <italic>C. jagus</italic> bulbs. The new alkaloids were extracted together with some already known alkaloids identified as sanguinine, cherylline, lycorine, crinine, flexinine, and the isoquinolinone derivative hippadine [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05621" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cherylline, gigantellinine, crinine, flexinine, and sanguinine inhibited the activity of AChE in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition by sanguinine was remarkably effective (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.83 ± 0.01 μM), while cherylline and hippadine showed weak cytotoxicity at 100 μM [
