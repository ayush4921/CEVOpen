<p id="Par13">Gallic acid revealed the highest docking score − 17.45 kcal/mol, the depiction of the key interactions is displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. The compound revealed an interaction profile better that displayed by HCQ. It is completely trapped in the binding site of the enzyme by a complicated network of strong hydrogen bonding generated by His41, Leu141, His163, Gln189, Thr190, and Ala191, with distances ranging between 1.6 Å to 2.8 Å as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e. Quercetin with a docking score − 15.80 kcal/mol is connected to the enzyme’s residues Gly143, Glu166, Arg188, and Glu189, through strong hydrogen bonding with distances range 1.5–2.8 Å (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Naringin, Capsaicin and Psychotrine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b, and d) are interacting with most of these amino acid residues with potential hydrogen bonding, however, they revealed binding scores − 14.50, − 13.90, − 13.50 kcal/mol respectively, which are much smaller than that displayed by compounds 5.
