<p id="Par15">To combat the life-threatening corona virus infection, several studies are ongoing using antiviral drug therapies. This study will be useful in recent and future for designing novel drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, docking analyses showed that the COVID-19 protease (6LU7) may be inhibited by some compounds from herbal plants, based on the binding energy score, we suggest that these compounds such as; Naringin, Quercetin, Capsaicin, Psychotrine and Gallic acid can be tested against Corona virus and used to develop effective antiviral drugs. These molecules could be utilized for further innovation and development of antiviral compounds against Corona virus. However, further researches warranted to investigate the potential uses of the medicinal plants containing these compounds.</p>
