<p id="Par10">Docking studies were performed by MOE with 10 poses for each ligand (other parameters were kept default). The unnecessary chain was deleted. Ligand interactions were computed for the X-rayco-crystallized protein to reveal the different types of interaction as a validation for the coming docking procedure. The docking was done with the default settings of the MOE–DOCK as following: The scoring function was London d G. &amp; 10 conformers of the ligand were retained with highest and best score by default. The scoring configuration of the ligand–Target complexes was selected on energetic grounds (MM/GBVI); best poses with the lowest binding energy was chosen for each compound. The docking scores, docking binding energy, and chemical structures of selected ligands were then presented. ProTox (Drwal et al.
