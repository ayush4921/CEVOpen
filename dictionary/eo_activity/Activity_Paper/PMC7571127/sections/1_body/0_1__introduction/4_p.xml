<p>To determine the biological properties of DCA and its derivatives and whether they are promising candidate drugs, the ability of these compounds to inhibit SMS activity was analyzed, as was the structure–activity relationship of these compounds in cell-based SMS assays. Furthermore, the effects of DCAs and natural SMS inhibitors on Aβ aggregation were assessed by microtiter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) assays.</p>
