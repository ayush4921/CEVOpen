<p>Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) is a cell membrane-located lipid-metabolizing enzyme, which has been reported to play crucial roles in cell death, proliferation, and migration [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. SMS knockout mice showed a decrease in plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], insulin resistance [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and tumorigenesis [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. SMS activity was shown to be inhibited by the naturally occurring compounds ginkgolic acid, from the leaves of

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and malabaricones A–C and E, from the fruits of 
 <italic>M. cinnamomea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The latter inhibitors may be especially safe, with fewer side effects than other SMS inhibitors, because they were isolated from an edible fruit. Similarly, DCA may directly or indirectly affect SMS activity, regulating cell death and anti-inflammatory activity. Elucidation of the mechanism by which DCA interacts with SMS could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic agents. Moreover, the nontoxic nature of DCA makes it a suitable candidate for further development as a new drug or medicinal supplement.
