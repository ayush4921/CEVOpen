<p>A solution of 6 M NaOH (1.5 mL) was added to a solution of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (27.0 mg, 69.9 μmol) in methanol (1 mL) and THF (2 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 2 h, acidified with 2% HCl, and extracted with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>. The combined organic layer was washed with saline solution, dried over Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and concentrated. The crude residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (4:1) as an eluent, resulting in compound 
 <bold>6</bold> [
