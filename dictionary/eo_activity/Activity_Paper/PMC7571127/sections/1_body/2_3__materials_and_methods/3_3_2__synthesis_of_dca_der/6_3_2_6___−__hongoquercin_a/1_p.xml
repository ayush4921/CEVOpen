<p>A solution of 10% Pd/C (0.028 mmol) was added to a solution of 
 <bold>6</bold> (0.140 mmol) in EtOAc (10 mL) while stirring, and the reaction mixture was further stirred overnight at 40 °C under a H
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The solid was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under a vacuum. The residue was redissolved in hexane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (4:1) as an eluent, resulting in compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (yield 74%) as a white solid. Its structure was confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and ESI-MS and compared with previous results [
