<p>ZS/SMS1 and ZS/SMS2 cells (protein concentration 0.1 µg/µL) were diluted in 20 mM Tris-buffer (pH 7.5) and sonicated. A 1 µL aliquot of each compound at the desired concentration was added to 100 µL aliquots of the cell lysates and the solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A 1 µL aliquot of C6-NBD-ceramide was added to each solution and the solutions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 400 µL of MeOH/CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> [1/2 (
 <italic>v/v</italic>)], and the mixtures were shaken and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The formation of C6-NBD-sphingomyelin was quantified by HPLC determination of its peak area. Inhibitory activity was quantified by a reverse-phase HPLC assay using a JACSO HPLC system, equipped with a PU-2089 Plus and FP-2020 Plus set at λex = 470 nm and λem = 530 nm. A 50 × 4.6 YMC-Pack Diol-120-NP column (5-µm particle size) was used with the mobile phase (IPA/hexane/water) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
