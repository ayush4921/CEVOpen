   <bold>A</bold>) Inhibition of Aβ
   <sub>42</sub> aggregation by DCA, its derivatives, and natural sphingomyelin synthase inhibitors, as shown by incubation of 30 nM QDAβ and 30 µM Aβ with various concentrations of these compounds. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Estimation of EC
   <sub>50</sub> values from inhibition curves, in which the percent SDs of fluorescence intensities were plotted against the concentrations of these compounds.
