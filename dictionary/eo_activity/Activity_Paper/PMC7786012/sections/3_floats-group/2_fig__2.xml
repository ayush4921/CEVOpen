  <p>PPD induced cell death and protective effect of RSE in HaCaT cells.</p>
  <p>(A) To determine cell death, HaCaT cells were treated, with or without various concentrations of RSE treatment before PPD induction. Cell cycle distribution was detected by using flow cytometry, after staining of DNA by propidium idodide. (B) Quantification of cell cycle distribution in RSE or PPD treated HaCaT cells. The analysis was mean of triplicated measurements Â± SD of three separate experiments. **
