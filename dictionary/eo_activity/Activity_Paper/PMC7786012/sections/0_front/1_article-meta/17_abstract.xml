  <italic>para</italic>-Phenylediamine (PPD), a major component of hair dyeing ingredients, can induce allergenic sensitization and exert mutagenic, tumorigenic and cytotoxic effect. In this study, we determined the cytotoxic effect of PPD on human keratinocytes and evaluated the protective effect of 
  <italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M. extracts (RSE) on PPD induced cytotoxicity for the first time. We observed that RSE is a strong inhibitory agent against PPD-induced toxicity in human keratinocytes. The results indicated that RSE pretreatment significantly could suppress PPD induced cytotoxic effects, including decrease of cell viability, accumulation in subG1 phase of cells, and relocation of phosphatidylserine on keratinocytes. Also, we found that PPD caused cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and subsequent activation of caspase and PARP degradation. However, pretreatment of RSE showed preventive activities against PPD induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and ROS production in keratinocytes. In conclusion, the results of present study suggest that RSE was able to protect the skin from several cytotoxic effects of PPD and could be a meaningful material in many industries using PPD.
