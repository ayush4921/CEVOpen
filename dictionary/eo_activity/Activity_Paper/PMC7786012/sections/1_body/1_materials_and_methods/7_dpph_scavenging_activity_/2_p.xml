<p id="par0070">The antioxidant activity of RSE was first determined by measuring the DPPH scavenging ability [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The extract at various concentrations (1–100 μg/mL) was added to 200 μL of DPPH (100 μM) solution. DPPH reaction with an antioxidant capable of hydrogen ion donation reduces DPPH. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 540 nm was recorded using a Gen 5™ UV–vis spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
