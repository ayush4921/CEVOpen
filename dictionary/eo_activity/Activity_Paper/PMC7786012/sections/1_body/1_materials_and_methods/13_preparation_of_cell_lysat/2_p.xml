<p id="par0105">To prepare cell lysates, HaCaT cells treated with previous identical experiment condition were harvested and rinsed with ice cold phosphate buffer saline. And cells were resuspended in PRO-PREP™ protein extraction solution (iNtRON biotechnology, Seoul, Korea), and disrupted by sonication. Protein concentration of each sample was measured by Coomassie Plus™ Assay kit (Thermo scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and an equivalent amount of protein lysate (20 μg) was subjected to precast 4–12 % SDS gradient polyacrylamide gel with MOPS buffer, followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The specific antibodies for caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP and β-actin were used for immunostaining and detection was conducted with a PicoEPD Western reagent kit (ELPIS-Biotech, Daejeon, Korea) according to manufacturer’s instruction.</p>
