<p id="par0085">Flow cytometric analysis of HaCaT cells with or without RSE after treatment of PPD was performed to analyze cell cycle distribution with staining of propidium iodide. Extent of apoptosis was detected with an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) as manufacturâ€™s instructions. Cell cycle distribution profiles and apoptotic cell death were analyzed by using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
