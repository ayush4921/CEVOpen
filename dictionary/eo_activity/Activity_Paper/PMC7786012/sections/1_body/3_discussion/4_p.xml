<p id="par0165">In HaCaT cells exposed to PPD (200 μM) for 48 h, a significant reduction of cell viability with cell morphological change was induced with concentration dependent manner. In the process of hair dyeing, PPD triggers chemical reaction with the coupler reagent under the artificial condition accelerated by hydrogen peroxide. In this experiment, we observed that PPD alone treatment without the coupler reagent for 48 h could decline cell viability of HaCaT cells to 47.4 %, compared to non-treated control. In accordance with cell viability data, the sub G1 phase population meaning apoptotic cells increased after treatment of PPD. Also, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss was detected with cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP following treatment of PPD. This cytotoxic effect may be obtained from auto-oxidation of PPD.</p>
