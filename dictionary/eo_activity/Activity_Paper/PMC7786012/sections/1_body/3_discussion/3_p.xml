The major application site of PPD is skin epidermal layer, but cellular toxicity on keratinocytes in response to PPD has only recently been reported. Recent studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of genes involved in inflammatory response to PPD and cytotoxic effect with induction of DNA damage on keratinocytes against to PPD [
