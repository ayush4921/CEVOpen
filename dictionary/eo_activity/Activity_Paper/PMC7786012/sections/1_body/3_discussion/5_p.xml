<p id="par0170">In this study, we provided evidence that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Rhus semialata</italic> M. (RSE), used as a traditional medicinal plant and in food additives in Korea and China, could protect HaCaT cells from induction of apoptosis by PPD treatment. The most remarkable observation was that RSE pretreatment could prevent PPD induced cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells, with less morphological alteration. Consistent with the above results, subG1 phase cells representing apoptotic cells of PPD with co-treatment of RSE decreased to 24.7 % compared to 68.6 % of PPD alone treated cells. Additionally, results of Annexin-V/PI staining and Hoechst 33,342 staining show that RSE could suppress PPD induced apoptosis. Many previous studies have demonstrated that PPD induced ROS production could be attributable to activation of apoptosis

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our experiment, we determined change of mitochondrial membrane potential by PPD treatment, with or without RSE. As a result, RSE could inhibit the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in PPD treated HaCaT cells. Futhermore, through RSE pretreatment, we have demonstrated that PPD induced generation of ROS, which leads to oxidative stress in many organs, decreased by RSE treatment, and subsequently inhibited activation of caspase cascade.
