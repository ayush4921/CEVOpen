<p id="par0135">To evaluate whether the protective effect of RSE on PPD was mediated by mitochondria dependent pathway, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was determined by flow cytometry used with DiOC
 <sub>6</sub> dye. DiOC
 <sub>6</sub> dye is a cell permeable lipophlic flurochrome dye, sensitive to mitochondria of live cells at low concentration. Significant loss of Δψm in PPD exposed cells were observed, as compared to continuously growing cells. However, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse was decreased with pretreatment of RSE for 4 h. Although, the growing HaCaT cells have only a small number of Δψm losing cells, 53.6 % of the cells lost their mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of PPD. Whereas, mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered in RSE pretreated cells, after being induced with PPD (
