<p id="par0120">To examine whether RSE has protective effect on PPD induced cell growth inhibition on HaCaT cells, cells were pre-incubated for 4 h with RSE before PPD (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) treatment. After 48 h, cell viability was determined by MTT assay. In preliminary assay, we confirmed that RSE has no significant effect on cell viability at 10 μg/mL but slightly decrease in viability at 20 μg/mL. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, the cell number of HaCaT cells treated with RSE from 2.5 to 10 μg/mL, significantly increased compared to PPD treatment alone. Under this concentration, cell viability was not influenced by the presence of RSE. Additionally, we also observed that PPD induced reduction of the number of cells and morphological alteration, were restored with RSE pretreatment under an inverted microscope (
