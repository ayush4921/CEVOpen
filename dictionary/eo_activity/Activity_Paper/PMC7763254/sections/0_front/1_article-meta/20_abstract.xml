 <p>The genus 
  <italic>Tribulus</italic> L. (Zygophyllaceae) includes 12 species, the most important of which is 
  <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> L. This annual herb grows in temperate and tropical climates, and has a rich chemical composition of biologically active substances and chemical elements. Medicinal plants, and the phytopreparations obtained from them, are becoming more and more popular in world practice as they are used to successfully treat human diseases. Their therapeutic effect is due to the presence in them, of a variety of natural compounds and biologically important trace elements, especially in higher concentrations present in higher doses. 
  <italic>T. terrestris</italic> is becoming more and more popular for the treatment of diseases of the human genital area and sexual dysfunctions. The elemental content in the tissues of leaf, flower, and fruit of 
  <italic>T. terrestris</italic> was determined by using multi-element instrumental epithermal neutron activation analysis. For the first time, 26 essential and trace elements were observed in the plant species collected in Russia (from cultivated) and China (wild growing). It was confirmed that the elemental composition of 
  <italic>T. terrestris</italic> grass varies depending on the habitat (geographic zones). The place of growth affects the accumulation of elements by the plant.
