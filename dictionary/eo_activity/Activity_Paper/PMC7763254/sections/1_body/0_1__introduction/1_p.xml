<p>The medicinal value of plants lies in some chemical substances that produce a definite physiological action in the human body. Medicinal plants contain both organic and inorganic constituents. The pharmacological properties of medicinal plants have been attributed to the presence of active chemical constituents that are responsible for important physiological functions in living organisms. The steroidal saponins of 
 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> L. (Zygophyllaceae) are considered the factor responsible for the biological activity of products derived from this plant. Its various parts contain a variety of medicinally important chemical constituents, such as flavonoids, flavonol glycosides, steroidal saponins, and alkaloids. The activity depends on the concentration and the composition of active saponins, which in turn is influenced by the geographical origin of plant material [

 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> in the daily human needs can be considered insignificant. The element determination can be important in controlling the quality of the raw material for standardized extracts (especially heavy metal content) [
