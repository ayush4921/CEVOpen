  <p>Al: aluminum toxicity is a major constraint for crop production in acidic soil worldwide. When the soil pH is lower than 5, Al
   <sup>3+</sup> is released to the soil and enters into root tip cell ceases root development of plant. In acid soil with high mineral content, Al is the major cause of phytotoxicity.

  <p>Cl: chlorine (Cl) occurs predominantly as Cl
   <sup>-</sup> in soil and plant. At adequate levels of supply, Cl improves the yields and quality of many crops, such as onions and cotton if the soils are deficient in this nutrient. When excessive, Cl can be as a major component of salinity stress and toxic to plants.

  <p>K: potassium is one of the most abundant elements in the plant materials. The high concentration of potassium in plants is needed for many essential processes, including enzyme activation, photosynthesis, water use efficiency, starch formation, and protein synthesis. Moreover, K is responsible for regulating osmotic pressure of body fluids, and for maintaining cardiac rhythm, and in constipation. The recommended daily allowance is 550–5625 mg [
   <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but analyzed samples contain from 12,100 to 26,400 mg/kg potassium.

  <p>Ca: in the human metabolism, Ca is known to be an important constituent of bones and teeth, to be participated in the biochemical blood clotting process and to be responsible for proper nerve and muscle function [
   <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is also necessary for the absorption of dietary vitamin B. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 800–1200 mg for adult [

  <p>Sc: the biological role of scandium is poorly known. Under ordinary conditions, the concentration of Sc in plants is very low. It was shown that an increase of Sc in soil may result in both a significant increase of Sc content in the plants and variations in concentrations of essential nutrients in all parts of plants.</p>

  <p>V: vanadium, although essential for growth and chlorophyll formation in unicellular green algae, reveals toxic influences on cell division of 
   <italic>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</italic>, these disturbances arising in the same range of V-concentrations as the known positive effects of the trace metal.

  <p>Mn: manganese is an essential element required for various biochemical processes. It helps in eliminating fatigue and reduces nervous irritability [
   <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The requirement of Mn for an adult is 1.0–5.0 mg [

  <p>Fe: the role of iron in the body and is an essential component of hemoglobin. It facilitates the oxidation of carbohydrates, protein, and fat to control body weight, which is a very important factor in diabetes [
   <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Fe is important because it eliminates phlegm and strengthens the function of stomach. Hence, the daily intake of iron is necessary. The RDA is 10–18 mg [
   <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

  <p>Co: cobalt acts as a preprophase poison and thus retards the process of karyokinesis and cytokinesis. The action of cobalt on plant cells is mainly turbagenic. Cobalt compounds act on the mitotic spindle, leading to the formation of chromatin bridges, fragmentation, and sticky bridges at anaphase and binucleate cells.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>Zn: zinc is essential to all organisms and it is an important trace element having a definite role in the metabolism, growth, and development. It is an essential component of over 200 enzymes having both catalytically and structural roles. Zn deficiency is characterized by recurrent infections, lack of immunity, and poor growth. The RDA for Zn is 15 mg [
   <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

  <p>Se: selenium is a necessary component for healthy reproductive status and it aids in normalizing both testosterone and estrogen levels. Selenium aids in the removal of lipids and phospholipids (vitamin C). It is also involved in the metabolism of glucose, collagen, folic acid, and certain amino acids. Finally, selenium has been proven a powerful anti-carcinogenic supplement inhibiting cancer cells and reducing the risk of several cancers including prostate, breast, and uterine cancers. The requirement of Se for an adult is 0.02–0.2 mg/day [
   <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The selenium concentration in the plant samples analyzed ranges from 0.08 to 0.12 mg/kg.

  <p>Rb: rubidium has no known biological role but has a slight stimulatory effect on metabolism, probably because it is like potassium. The two elements are found together in minerals and soils, although potassium is much more abundant than rubidium. Plant will adsorb rubidium quite quickly. When stresses by deficiency of potassium some plants, such as sugar beet, will respond to the addition of rubidium.</p>

  <p>Sr: strontium (Sr) is not an essential element to plants; however, high soil-to-crop transfer factors (TFs, concentration ratios between crop and soil) of this element are often found because calcium, in the same element group as Sr, is an essential element for plants.</p>

  <p>Mo: molybdenum is essential for most organisms and occurs in more than 60 enzymes catalyzing diverse oxidation-reduction reactions. Mo is also a component of coenzyme that is essential for the activity of xanthine oxidase, sulfite oxidase and aldehyde oxidase [

   <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It acts as a detoxification agent in the liver as a part of the sulfite oxidase enzyme and it possibly retards degenerative diseases, cancer, and aging.

  <p>Ba: because it forms insoluble salts with other common components of the environment, such as carbonate and sulfate, barium is not mobile and poses little risk.</p>

  <p>REEs: rare earth elements (REEs) content is one of the main factors that affect four kinds of functions of herbal medicine [
   <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The optimum concentration of some REEs can promote the growth of medicinal plants efficiently. As can be seen from the analytical results, there are differences in content for different REEs in plant samples. Most of the concentration of REEs in studied plants are below the maximum permissible levels (MPL), but content of Eu in all samples higher than value in “Reference value”.
