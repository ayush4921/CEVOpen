 <italic>L. javanica</italic> naturally occurs in central, eastern, and southern Africa. Alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, iridoids, and triterpenes have been identified from the plant [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>L. javanica</italic> can be attributed to phenolic compounds such as apigenin 7, which was highly active against 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, these results give credence to the use of the species' infusions against bacterial infections including campylobacteriosis.
