<p id="Par24">The 83 voucher specimens that were identified with their vernacular names by the participants, corresponded to 63 different plant taxa. Nomenclature follows ‘The Plant List’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] except for the species of 
 <italic>Stachys cretica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lesbiaca</italic> Rech. Fil. (that is not found in ‘The Plant List’) and 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic> L. (an unresolved case in ‘The Plant List’). These two taxa follow Strid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Dimopoulos et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In most cases, the correspondence between a vernacular and scientific name is on a one-to-one basis. However, there are instances where a plant vernacular name is assigned to more than one plant species, sometimes even belonging to different botanical genera and families (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
