<p id="Par14">During two field trips, knowledgeable WMP harvesters were located by asking local people or reaching out through the social media Greek group “Friends of old metropolis of Lemnos” with a large number of members and close relevance to Lemnos’ cultural, environmental, and farming issues. The sample development stopped at 16 informants (nine female and seven male) since a saturation point had been reached, as there was very little new information coming out from the last five interviews and no more knowledgeable WMP harvesters could be identified. Respondents’ ages varied from 32 to 78 years, with an arithmetic mean of 57 years. Fifteen of the respondents were permanent residents on the island, with periods of residency from five to 72 years, and an arithmetic mean of 23 years, while one was a regular summer-visitor for the last 50 years and permanent resident prior to that. Twenty-five percent of the informants were non-natives, meaning that they have no ancestral connection with the island of Lemnos.</p>
