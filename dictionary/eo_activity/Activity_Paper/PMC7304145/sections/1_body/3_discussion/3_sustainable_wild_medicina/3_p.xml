<p id="Par74">Regardless if harvesting was a scheduled or spontaneous activity, the harvesters paid attention to collecting plants at the appropriate developmental stage and preferably from sites with certain climatic and soil conditions that support the required high-quality characteristics. Especially

 <italic>T. capitata</italic>, 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic>, 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> were cited as plant taxa that need to be collected during the phase of flower maturity or flower fading. This condition decreases the ecological impact of plant removal as it allows longer periods for pollination [
