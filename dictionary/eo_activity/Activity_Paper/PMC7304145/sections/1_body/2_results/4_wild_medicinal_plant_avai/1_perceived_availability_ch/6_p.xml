<p id="Par59">Livestock farmers were blamed for the frequently practiced pastureland burning specifically in areas where 
 <italic>Sarcopoterium spinosum</italic> (L.) Spach is dominating, in order to boost the pasturelandâ€™s grass development in the years to follow. These areas usually host 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic>, the populations of which are also burned in this process. Since this species presents slow-growth rates, its population cannot recover under the pressure of heavy grazing and other highly competitive and fast-growing plant species (e.g., 
 <italic>S. spinosum</italic>).
