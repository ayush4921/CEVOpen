<p id="Par43">Other factors that came up as strong determinants while deciding on a harvesting site were the quality and maturity of the targeted plant species depending on the regional microclimate, soil conditions, and the orientation of the potential slope for harvesting. Areas of the island that receive little rainfall and present dry weather conditions (northern part) are preferred for aromatic WMPs like 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Respondents stated that under such circumstances, these plants develop higher amounts of essential oils and demonstrate higher quality organoleptic characteristics like more intense taste and stronger smell. On the contrary, areas with higher rainfall and humidity levels (Kaspakas, Aghios Demetrios, Katalako, and mainly the southern parts of the island) are preferred for wild leafy greens and asparagus. As explained, wet conditions boost the plantsâ€™ vegetative growth and promote the development of softer and tastier plant tissues like leaves.
