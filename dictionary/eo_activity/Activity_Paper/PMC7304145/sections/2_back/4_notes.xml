 <p>The Mediterranean Institute for Nature and Anthropos (MedINA), supported by its main partner the Agricultural University of Athens, is currently coordinating the project “Terra Lemnia” on Lemnos island. “Terra Lemnia” is part of the Mediterranean Strategy of the MAVA Foundation, under M6 Outcome Action Plan 'Promoting sustainable land-use practices', which deals with the loss of biodiversity by the abandonment of cultural practices. Travel and accommodation costs for DP’s fieldwork on the island of Lemnos were covered by MedINA in the framework of the “Terra Lemnia” project.</p>
