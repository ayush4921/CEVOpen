<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the world at an alarming rate and with lack of specific drugs and vaccines. The increasing mortality and morbidity rates necessitate the urge to discover and develop potential cure against the virus and the comorbid conditions. The best knowledge of medicinal plants has always been a savior that offer therapeutic effect with less side effects. Emerging data suggest that COVID-19 patients with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and pulmonary diseases are more susceptible with increased mortality when compared to general populations (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These subgroups of COVID-19 patients with associated comorbidities are due to higher expression of ACE-2 and DPP4 proteins that aid more viral entry and replication (Zou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Currently, no specific therapies for COVID-19 are available and investigations regarding the treatment of COVID-19 are lacking. There have been several attempts to check if existing solutions and compounds that could be repositioned for COVID-19 (Zou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The plant derived secondary metabolites and compounds have reported to possess antiviral properties. Therefore, this study focuses on the evaluation of outcome in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 flavonoids and triterpenoid such as quercetin, catechin, oleanolic acid and hederagenin from
