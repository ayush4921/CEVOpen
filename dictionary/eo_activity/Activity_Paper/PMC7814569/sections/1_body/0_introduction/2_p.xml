 <italic>Momordica dioica</italic> is a perennial dioecious climber creeper plant belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It has many nutritional and disease combating properties still it is an underutilized plant which needs to be explored to justify its therapeutical roles. All the parts of plant have been reported for secondary metabolites that includes alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, saponins, phenolic compounds and flavonoids (

The roots have reported for anti-diabetic, anti-viral, immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, antiseptic, anti-ulcerative, antitoxic, anti-perspirant, anti-hemorrhoidal, bowel infection reducer and skin softening properties. Stearic acid, steroids like α-spinasterol octadecenoate, α-spinasterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, oleanolic acid, gypsogenin, hederagenin and triterpenoids like 3β-O-benzoyl-6-oxo-ursolic acid, 3β-O-benzoyl-11-oxo-ursolic acid, 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl hederagenin, 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl gypsogenin, 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl gypsogenin were identified in the methanolic extract of roots of this plant (Talukdar &amp; Hossain,

Based on literature survey, the flavonoids such as catechin &amp; quercetin and phyto-steroids such as oleanolic acid and hederagenin have shown anti-viral and antidiabetic potentials that can serve as potential natural drug candidates against coronavirus (Hastantram et al.,
