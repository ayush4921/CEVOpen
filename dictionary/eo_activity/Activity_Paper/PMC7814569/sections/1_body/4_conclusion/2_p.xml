<p>The metabolites considering as oral drugs were also screened for its virtual ADME properties. Among the metabolites, the triterpenoids hederagenin and oleanolic acid showed the best results of binding interaction with the viral macromolecules but according to 
 <italic>in silico</italic> ADME predictions they both are relatively less efficient. This efficiency can be assured and experimented with strategies using wet lab analysis. The quercetin metabolite is best in terms of both analysis parameters such as binding affinity and drug likeness behavior. The reference drugs showed comparatively very less binding affinity toward viral proteases. Therefore, these compounds can be employed as therapeutic alternatives and can be utilized for further development of multitargeting drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infections. The present work may be used as a template for future discovery and development of novel multitargeting compounds against the viral disease. To the best of our knowledge, this study of potentially inhibiting properties of 
 <italic>M. dioica</italic> toward coronavirus viral and comorbid proteins is novel.
