<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction studies using fluorescent quenching results have suggested the compounds had varied range of interactions with target viral proteins. The best interactions were observed with the quercetin with the spike (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.052 ± 0.03 µM) and DPP4 proteins (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.057 ± 0.02 µM) comparatively less interaction with main proteases (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.062 ± 0.02 µM) and RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase proteins (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.082 ± 0.03 µM) when compared to positive controls remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. Compared to remdesivir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.092 ± 0.03 µM), quercetin had excellent interaction with RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase proteins and might be efficient inhibitor than standard remdesivir drug (

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.032 ± 0.01 µM), spike protein (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.065 ± 0.02 µM), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.071 ± 0.05 µM) and main protease (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.093 ± 0.02 µM). Other compounds hederagenin and oleanolic acid had moderate level of interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins (
