<p>The BOILED-Egg (brain or intestinal estimated permeation predictive model), which is an intuitive graphical plot of the functions of lipophilicity and apparent polarity as described by the parameters WLOGP (atomistic octanol-water partition coefficient) and TPSA (topological polar surface area), respectively, was used to predict passive intestinal absorption and brain permeation of the compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0013">Figure 13</xref>). Compounds located in the yellow region (yolk) have a high probability of BBB penetration while those in the white region have the propensity for passive absorption through the GI tract. Out of the four metabolites, Catechin, Quercetin and Hederagenin have predicted to have good Gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorption. In spite of having good binding affinity to all the viral proteins as well as proteins with comorbidities, Oleanolic acid does not even lie in the white portion of the BOILED-egg which means Oleanolic acid predicted to get poorly absorbed in the GI tract (Quimque etÂ al.,
