<p>Through 
 <italic>in silico</italic> docking studies, the four natural ligands and three control drugs were analyzed for their binding affinity to the main protease (6LU7). The obtained binding affinities are Catechin (−6.7 kcal/mol), Quercetin (−6.6 kcal/mol), Hederagenin (−8.0 kcal/mol), Oleanolic acid (−8.5 kcal/mol), Favipiravir (−5.7 kcal/mol), Hydroxychloroquine (−5.3 kcal/mol) and Remdesivir (−6.4 kcal/mol) (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The triterpenoids oleanolic acid and hederagenin showed the highest affinity to the protease. The hederagenin was properly positioned between Arg131, Thr199, Leu286 and Asp289 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">6</xref>). The Arg131 and Thr199 shared hydrogen bonding with Hederagenin. While the Oleanolic acid was positioned between Arg131, Thr199, Tyr237, Leu272 and Leu286. The residues Leu272, Tyr237 and Leu286 share alkyl and pi-alkyl interaction with oleanolic acid while Thr199 and Arg131 shared hydrogen bonding. The amino acid residues are Arg131, Thr199 and Leu286 are common in both the cases, since the compounds show structural similarity and both of them belong to same class of plant metabolites. These ligands showed potentially high biological activity as compared to the control drugs in terms of binding affinities. The amino acid residue interactions at the binding site and the docked pose of binding of natural ligand or control drug to the protease.
