<p>Molecular docking was conducted on the ligands using the AutoDock 4.2.6 (Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and AutoDock Vina (Trott &amp; Olson, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) to get insight into their binding preferences within the active site of the receptor. The amino acids in the active site of the macromolecule was selected and the grid box was used to obtain the X, Y and Z coordinates. Using the protease. pdbqt file, ligand pdbqt file and the X, Y and Z coordinates, binding affinity was determined using AutoDock Vina (Trott &amp; Olson, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On the basis of binding energies, the potency of selected natural compounds was compared to the control/reference drugs. The 3 D structure of the protease-ligand interaction and the 2 D structure of the molecular interaction were then visualized using AutoDock tools, PyMol 2.4 and Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer (2020).
