<p>The high-resolution three-dimensional crystal structure of 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7), RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71), S protein with ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J) and MERS-CoV with human DPP4 (PDB ID: 4L72) were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is an archived database for the three-dimensional crystal structures of biological macromolecules, worldwide. The macromolecule was prepared using AutoDock MGL Tools 1.5.6 by deleting the water molecules and adding polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges. The protein file was saved in the pdbqt format for further analysis.</p>
