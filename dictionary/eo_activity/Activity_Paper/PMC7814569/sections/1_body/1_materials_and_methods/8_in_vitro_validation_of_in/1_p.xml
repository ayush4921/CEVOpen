<p>The phytocompounds in this studies such as Quercetin (117-39-5), Catechin (7295-85-4), Hederagenin (465-99-6), Oleanolic acid (508-02-1), Remdesivir (30354), Favipiravir (T-705), Hydroxychloroquine (747-36-4), Mpro-3CL Protease from coronavirus SARS-COV-2 (SAE0172), recombinant DPP4 (D4943) and recombinant spike protein S1 &amp; S2 (S-ECD) protein (SAB5700592), was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. The recombinant RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (MSB7135958) was purchased from MyBioSource Ltd. The protein-compounds interactions were studies by spectrofluorimetric assay at 280 nm excitation and emission at 290 nm at room temperature. Briefly, the protein at the concentration of 100 nm was incubated at different concentration of compounds ranging from 0.005 to 1 µM for 5 min at room temperature in 96-well plates. After 5 min, the plate was read at 290 nm emission that was excited at 280 nm. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of compounds was calculated using the linear regression curve from dose-response studies.
