<p>ADME of the selected natural ligands is studying the pharmacokinetic properties of the ligands when function in the bodily system. It is the study of what body does to the drug. The computational prediction of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of ligands were done using SwissADME software (Daina et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Lipinski’s ‘rule-of-five’ which analyzes the biochemical features of a drug that may influence its absorption and permeation across cell membranes. Lipinski’s criteria states that for a compound to exhibit drug likeness, at least three of the following criteria must be fulfilled such as no more than 5 hydrogen bond donors, no more than 10 hydrogen-bond acceptors, molecular mass less than 500 Daltons, an octanol-water partition coefficient or lipophilicity (log 
 <italic>P</italic>) that does not exceed 5. Since all the numbers in these conditions of the rule are multiples of 5, hence the rule is called Lipinski’s rule of five.
