<p>Dioscorin is the main storage protein of the Dioscorea tuber, accounting for approximately 90% of extractable water-soluble proteins [

 <xref rid="B153-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Yam tubers contain two dioscorin proteins, dioscorin A and dioscorin B, encoded by genes that share about 69% sequence similarity [

 <xref rid="B155-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Using Raman spectroscopy, Liao et al. [
 <xref rid="B155-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>] showed that the secondary structure of dioscorin A (molecular weight [MW] ~ 33 kDa) of 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> L. is mostly of alpha-helix whereas that of dioscorin B (MW ~ 31 kDa) belongs to anti-parallel Î²-sheet. The authors also highlighted that the major amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, tryptophan and cysteine) microenvironment exhibited a clear difference between dioscorin A and B [
 <xref rid="B155-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. An earlier study by this group of authors on the secondary structure of dioscorin of three yam species (
 <italic>D. alata</italic> L., 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>purpurea</italic> and 
 <italic>D. japonica</italic>) reported the similarity in molecular mass across the three species. However, they observed dissimilarity in the amino acid composition and secondary structure of dioscorin between
