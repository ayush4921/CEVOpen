 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species have been identified as a possible source of phenols as well as phenolic acids (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B183-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] evaluated the total phenolic acids of two yam species (
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>D. hamiltonii</italic>) using an HPLC system. Their findings reported the presence of total phenolic acid in both yams; however, the content in 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> (297.3 mg/mL) was almost double that of 
 <italic>D. hamiltonii</italic> (158.2 mg/mL) which contributed to the significantly better antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune regulation effects of 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> compared to 
 <italic>D. hamiltonii</italic>. Among the phenolic acids detected in the two yam species, syringic acid was recorded the highest in both yams [
 <xref rid="B183-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Similarly, a study profiled the phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> andreported the presence of ferulic, sinapic, caffeic and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and vanillic acid [
 <xref rid="B184-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. An earlier study reported phenolic constituents in 10 yam cultivars from five species highlighting the prevalence of these compounds in 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> when compared to other species (
 <italic>D. cayenensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. dumetorum</italic> and 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic>) irrespective of the cultivar [
 <xref rid="B185-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. The phenolic concentration of 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic> (12–69 mg catechin/100g) was the lowest among the five species and Graham-Acquaah et al. [
 <xref rid="B186-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>] reported a similar range (20–37 mg catechol/100 g) in two cultivars of 
 <italic>D. rotundata.</italic> The latter authors observed a significant variation across tuber sections. In one 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic> cultivar (
 <italic>Puna</italic>), the order of concentration of phenol in the sections were head &gt; mid-section &gt; tail, whereas the head and mid-section of 
 <italic>Bayere fitaa</italic> cultivar had a similar phenol concentration but significantly higher than that of the tail section [
 <xref rid="B186-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Similarly, Padhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B177-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] found significant variation in the phenol content (2.1–9.62 mg/g dry weight) of various yam species (
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>D. pubera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. hamiltonii</italic>, 
 <italic>D. pentaphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>D. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>D. hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>D. wallichii</italic>), with a significantly higher concentration in 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> compared to other species.
