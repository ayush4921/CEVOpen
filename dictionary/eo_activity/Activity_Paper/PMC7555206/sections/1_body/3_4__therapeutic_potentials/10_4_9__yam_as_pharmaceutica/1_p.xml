<p>Although much effort have been shown on the importance of yam starch in relation to food, limited attention has been given to its other potentials such as an excipient for the pharmaceutical industry. Zuluaga et al. [
 <xref rid="B329-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">329</xref>] highlighted that yam starch could be used as a pharmaceutical excipient for tablet and capsule formulation comparable to potato starch, with further potential as thickening agent. Nasipuri [
 <xref rid="B330-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">330</xref>] reported yam starch as an efficient binder/disintegrant in tablet formulations containing both soluble and insoluble organic medicinal substances. Studies have shown that 
 <italic>D. dumetorum</italic> and 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> starches are highly compressible and form tablets with acceptable crushing force. Both species possess small granule size, large specific surface, volume-surface mean, surface-number mean and spherical symmetry. These qualities imply better performance as an excipient especially with respect to product process and better homogeneity of mixes when compared with starches from 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic>, with larger granules and high amylase content [

 <italic>D. roundata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> can be used for tablet formulations where faster disintegration and dissolution is desired [
