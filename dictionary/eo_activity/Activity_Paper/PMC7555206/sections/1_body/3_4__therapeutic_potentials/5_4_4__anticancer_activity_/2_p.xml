<p>Plants with steroidal saponins have exhibited anticancer effects [

 <xref rid="B281-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>,
 <xref rid="B282-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>] and these bioactive compounds are abundant in different 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species. According to Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B283-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>], deltonin exerts an apoptosis-inducing effect, which may correlate with ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the activation of the ERK/AKT signaling pathways, thereby suggesting deltonin as a potential cancer preventive and therapeutic agent [
 <xref rid="B284-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. Cytotoxicity studies using steroidal saponins from 
 <italic>Dioscorea collettii</italic> var. 
 <italic>hypoglauca</italic> showed they were active against human acute myeloid leukemia under in vitroconditions [
 <xref rid="B285-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. In an anticancer drug screen by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, protoneodioscin, a furostanol saponin compound isolated from 
 <italic>Dioscorea collettii</italic> var. 
 <italic>hypoglauca</italic>, exhibited cytotoxicity effects against most cell lines including leukemia, central nervous system, colon, prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B227-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. It is interesting to note that no compound in the NCI data base shares a similar cytotoxicity pattern to those of protoneodioscin, thus indicating a unique anticancer pathway. The polysaccharide of RDPS-I purified from the water extract of Chinese yam tuber exerted a significant inhibition on the cancer cell line of melanoma B16 and Lewis lung cancer in mice in-vivo [
 <xref rid="B286-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. Another study by Chan and Ng [
 <xref rid="B279-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>] investigated the biological activities of lectin purified from 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic> cv. Nagaimo. The authors observed after 24 h treatment the inhibitory role of lectin on the growth of some cancer cell lines including nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2 cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells and breast cancer MCF7 cells, with IC50 values of 19.79 μM, 7.12 μM and 3.71 μM, respectively. Through the induction of phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial depolarization, it has been revealed that 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic> lectin can evoke apoptosis in MCF7 cells [
 <xref rid="B279-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. Furthermore, diosgenin has been reported to significantly inhibit the growth of sarcoma-180 tumor cellsin vivo while enhancing the phagocytic capability of macrophages in vitro, thus suggesting that diosgenin has the potential to improve specific and non- specific cellular immune responses [
 <xref rid="B287-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>]. The anticancer mechanism of action for diosgenin may be attributed to modulation of multiple cell signaling events including molecular candidates associated with growth, differentiation, oncogenesis and apoptosis [
