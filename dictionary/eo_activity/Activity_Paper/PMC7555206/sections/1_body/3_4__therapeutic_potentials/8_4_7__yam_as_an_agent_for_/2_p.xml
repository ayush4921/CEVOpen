 <italic>D. alata</italic> leaves and roots examined on mouse spleen and bone marrow cells showed the ability of stimulating proliferation on both cells thereby significantly increasing the cell concentrations [

 <italic>D. alata</italic> powder prevented loss of bone mineral density and improved bone calcium status, however, the uterine hypertrophy was not stimulated [

 <xref rid="B311-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>] investigated the in vivo effect of ethanol extract of 
 <italic>D. spongiosa</italic> on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in rat. Their findings revealed that 
 <italic>D. spongiosa</italic> extract inhibited glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and improved the bone tissue metrology, BMC, BMD and biomechanical indicators. In addition, the authors observed a repair of the microscopic changes of the cancellous and trabecular bones. Based on the changes in the biochemical indexes, these effects were linked to the ability of the yam extract to inhibit excessive bone transition and bone resorption [
