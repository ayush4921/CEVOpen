 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species provide safety nets as foods and conventional and unconventional medicine during famine and endangered periods. Yam constituents such as flavonoid, diosgenin and dioscorin, tannin, saponin and total phenols places them as good food source of bioactive compounds to consumers [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, exploitation of the rich diversity within the 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> genus may lead to extinction if proper steps are not taken in terms of advocacy and conservation. This will directly result in loss of this potential source of active compounds for the pharmaceutical industry as well as constituting a huge genetic loss with respect to crop improvement and breeding. Rational and sustainable use is highly encouraged within the array of wild species. Sensible utilization of this diversity entails understanding species availability, ease of access, possibility of preservation, replanting and establishment of priorities in respect to its optimal pharmaceutical use [

 <xref rid="B335-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">335</xref>]. The understanding of the pharmacologically active compounds within 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> diversity will assist in standardizations and analysis of formulations [
 <xref rid="B334-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">334</xref>]. The gaps in knowledge of chemical composition, ecological factors and geographical spread of diversity and environmental impacts as relates to chemical biodiversity and plant variability need to be urgently addressed.
