<p>Further in vivo study is highly encouraged with respect to oxidative stress and antioxidant activities using purified compounds isolated from yam species. For most developing and poor countries, it is imperative to diversify into functional foods, including from 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species. These can be consumed on a regular basis thus serving both nutritional and medicinal purposes. These plants, often in the wild, can be targeted for increased production and conservation. The local populace should be enlightened on the consumption values which directly can lead to reduction in the cost of health care while leading to improved diet. However, due to the huge demand by pharmaceutical industries and agencies, most wild 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species are threatened in their natural habitat. The indigenous knowledge and therapeutic potential of most of the 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species is fast eroding as the situation worsens with increasing urbanization, industrialization and over-exploitation. Efforts toward developing comprehensive information on the therapeutic use, dosage and chemical compounds implicated in the treatment of diseases should be accelerated. Most significant is the ascertaining of the safety level and toxicity profiling of these compounds found in undomesticated yams. This will help ease burden in the rural communities that solely depend on these traditional medicine as health remedies. For instance, due to the high cost of steroid based pharmaceuticals in the management of womenâ€™s health disorders, the alternative reliance on herbal remedies is the preferred option to treat hormonally regulated health situations in most impoverished communities. Thus, there is need to provide sufficient empirical scientific basis to support the traditional use of the diversity inherent in the yam crop for hormone therapy related treatment.
