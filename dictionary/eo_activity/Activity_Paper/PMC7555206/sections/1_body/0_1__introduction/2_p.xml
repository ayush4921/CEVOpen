<p>Across different ethnic communities and geographic regions, diverse species of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> have been adopted within different habitation as a food source due to the high nutritional benefits and therapeutic values toward treatment and cure of certain health problems [

Whilst yam is one of the most important staple root and tuber crops worldwide, it is still classified as an orphan crop because it is highly underutilized and receives little investment or/and research attention toward crop improvement. Yam plays a significant role in food security, medicine and economy in the developing countries. Its importance places it as the fourth most essential and utilized root and tuber crop globally after potatoes (
 <italic>Solanum</italic> spp.), cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic>) and sweet potatoes (
 <italic>Ipomoea</italic> spp.) and the second in West Africa after cassava [

 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is evident in annual global production, especially in West Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01304-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In 2018, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reported a worldwide production of approximately 72.6 million tons over 8.7 million hectares of harvested area at a yield rate of 83515 hg/ha, with Africa contributing 97.1% of global production [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].Remarkably, among the African nations, three countries (Nigeria—67.4%, Ghana—11.1%, Côte d’Ivoire—10.3%) in the west recorded the highest proportion of production, although the production increase (85.1% between 2000–2018) in Africa is attributed mainly to the increase in the area of yam field into marginal lands and non-traditional yam growing areas [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> originated in Asia and is the most globally cultivated yam species, 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic> represents a great significance in respect to production volume in the West of Africa, followed by 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. cayenensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Statistics have shown evidence of an annual production increase of yam between 2011 and 2018 in several countries on the African continent including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, South Sudan and United Republic of Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This could be ascribed to its serving as a major food source and cash crop, thus, combating malnutrition, food insecurity and poverty. In addition, the significance of yam in the cultural, social and religious environment of West Africa cannot be overemphasized [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Its symbolism as king of crops is manifested in its use in ceremonies such as those for fertility and marriages, as well as an annual festival held to celebrate its harvest. Importantly, the cultural and linguistic diversity that cuts across West Africa has no influence on the beliefs, social values and religious practices attached to the yam crop.
