<p id="p0215">Furthermore, fractionation and purification of 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> extract resulted in isolation of an alkaloid, lycorine which was assessed as an 
 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV component. The compound with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.7 ± 1.2 nM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 14980.0 ± 912.0 nM in cytotoxicity assay. Lycorine was found to inhibit viral replication at a concentration that is lower than that of glycyrrhizin. The results suggested that the phytochemical compound lycorine is a promising candidate for the development of new 
 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV drugs in the treatment of SARS (Li et al., 2005c).
