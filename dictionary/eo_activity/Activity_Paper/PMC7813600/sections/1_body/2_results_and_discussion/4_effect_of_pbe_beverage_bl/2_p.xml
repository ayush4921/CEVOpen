<p>Administration of PBE or beverage blends, particularly those with cocoa powder incorporation (CHPBE-1 and CHPBE-2), induced a potent protective effect on both livers and kidneys. Indeed, significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) increases in GSH was observed in the livers (0.65 mg/mL for CHPBE- 1 and 0.63 mg/mL for CHPBE-2) and kidneys (0.75 mg/ mL for CHPBE-1 and 0.79 mg/mL for CHPBE-2) of treated rats. These results suggest that plantain bulb based beverages have potential to increase biosynthesis of GSH or reduce oxidative stress.
