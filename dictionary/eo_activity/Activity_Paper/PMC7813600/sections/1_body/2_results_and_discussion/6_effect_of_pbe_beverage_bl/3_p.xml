<p>To conclude, this study showed that PBE and beverage blends possess significant blood glucose lowering potential, which may be mediated through α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities inducing hypoglycaemic properties. Furthermore, the blends are protective against STZ-induced liver and kidney damage by promoting increased levels of endogenous enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant enzyme activity. The beverages showed more pronounced effects in restoring levels of oxidative stress markers in livers and kidneys. Reduced lipid peroxidation (low TBARS levels) alongside improved antioxidant status (elevated endogenous antioxidant systems) may be important mechanisms for preventing diabetic complications. Our findings suggest that plantain bulb beverage blends, particularly CHPBE-2, could serve as functional herbal beverage for controlling hyperglycaemia and associated complications.</p>
