<p>Significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) decreases in CAT and SOD activities were observed in both liver (95% and 92%, respectively) and kidney (95% and 90%, respectively) homogenates from untreated diabetic rats (STZ-IND) compared with NC rats (

Diabetes decreases antioxidant enzyme activities as a consequence of overwhelming oxidative stress that results from glucose autoxidation, protein glycation, and lipid peroxidation; this oxidative stress may also depress the activities of the endogenous antioxidant protection system (
