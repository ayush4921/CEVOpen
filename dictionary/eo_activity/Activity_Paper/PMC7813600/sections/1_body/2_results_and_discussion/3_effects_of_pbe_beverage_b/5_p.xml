<p>In addition, SOD activity was significantly affected by diabetic status (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and 2D</xref>); significantly lower levels of SOD activity was observed in liver and kidney homogenates of STZ rats (1.86 to 0.18 U/L) compared with NC rats (0.50 to 0.04 U/L). Reduced SOD activity might be due to increased utilization of SOD in scavenging free radicals. Conversely, administration of the PBE beverage blends over the 14 day treatment period restored SOD activity in diabetic rats to levels similar to those of NC rats, especially those administered CHPBE-2 (0.51 and 1.38 U/L in liver and kidneys, respectively). In a previous study,

 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Shodehinde et al. (2015)</xref>, which showed that plantain based diets improve antioxidant status of STZ-induced diabetic rats. The effect was credited to the rich polyphenolic compounds, which exhibit antioxidant and antidiabetic properties.
