<p>Upon treatment with PBE beverage blends, there was significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) upregulation in CAT and SOD activities. Treatment of diabetic rats with plantain bulb beverage (CHPBE-1; CHPBE-2) blends augmented the activity of CAT. Samples containing PBE promoted endogenous enzyme activity in the organs evaluated, with significant increases in CAT activity observed in liver (11 to 18-fold) and kidney (11 to 13-fold) homogenates (
