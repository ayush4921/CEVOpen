<p>The average food intake of the rats ranged from 20.05 g to 32.61 g. The NC group had the highest food intake, whereas the negative control group (STZ-induced and untreated) had the lowest (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The low food intake observed for the negative control group may be related to their disease state, which may have caused a reduction in appetite. Among the different treated groups, there was no significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) in food consumption compared with the STZ-IND group. Body weight of the NC group was increased (by 9.48 g) at the end of the experimental period (weight gain of 4.84%), while average body weight of diabetic-induced/untreated group decreased by 4.15%.
