<p>Fresh bulbs (corm) of mature plantain plants was harvested from a private plantation in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The outer layers of the bulbs were removed to expunge adhering soil matters, washed, cut into small pieces, and crushed mechanically using a sugar cane crushing machine at room temperature. The mash (pulp) was then filtered through a muslin cloth to extract the juices. Cocoa powder [1% (3 g) or 2% (6 g) cocoa powder] was added to 300 g of plantain corm juice with an equal amount (30 g) of honey, and the mixture was uniformly mixed together with an electric blender. The blend was freeze-dried and the lyophilized blend was stored in glass vials in a freezer (−18±2°C) until analysis.</p>
