<p>Oxidative degradation of lipids in the liver and kidneys was determined by measuring the concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in tissue homogenates by following the method of 
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Ohkawa et al. (1979)</xref>. Tissue homogenate (100 μL) was mixed with 200 μL of 8.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 500 μL of 0.8% thiobarbituric acid, and 500 μL of acetic acid solution (2.5 M HCl, pH 3.4), and heated at 100°C for 1 h. The absorbance was read at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer.
