<p>The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> (20 g; InterPharm Co., Seoul, Korea) was separated by silica gel thin-layer column chromatography (CC) using CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>–MeOH (1 : 0 to 0 : 1, v/v) as a gradient solvent system with an RP-18 column (YMC gel ODS-A, 12 nm, S-150 
 <italic>μ</italic>m; YMC Co., Japan), yielding fractions F1–F10. Fraction F2 (3 g) was further subjected to silica gel CC using hexane-acetone (1 : 0 to 0 : 1, v/v) to afford subfractions F2.1–F2.7. Fraction F2.2 (1.2 g) was then subjected to reversed-phase CC with MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1 : 1 to 0 : 1, v/v) as a solvent system to yield compound 1 (532 mg). Fraction F2.5 (0.8 g) was purified by reversed-phase CC with CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (3 : 2 to 1 : 0, v/v), resulting in the isolation of compound 2 (258 mg). Fractions F8 and F9 (3.2 g) were combined and subjected to silica gel CC using gradient mixtures of CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>–MeOH–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (7 : 3:0.3 to 6 : 4:0.5, v/v/v) to obtain subfractions F8.1–F8.7. Fraction F8.5 (1.0 g) was chromatographed over ODS-A (120 g) using an isocratic solvent system of MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O (7 : 3, v/v) to yield compound 3 (351 mg). Thin-layer chromatographic analysis was performed on the Kieselgel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> (silica gel, 230–400 mesh, 0.25 mm layer thickness; Merck, Germany) and RP-18 F
 <sub>254s</sub> (Merck) plates, visualized under ultraviolet light (254 and 365 nm) and 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid spray, and then heated (120°C, 5 min). The compounds were identified by one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic spectra recorded on a UNITY INOVA 400 MHz FT-NMR instrument with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter.
