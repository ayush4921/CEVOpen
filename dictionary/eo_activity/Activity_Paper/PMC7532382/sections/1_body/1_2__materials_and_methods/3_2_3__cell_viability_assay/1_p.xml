<p>The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to evaluate cell viability according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The cultured cells were then treated with each compound at various concentrations (0.78–200 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). After 48 and 72 h of incubation, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of CCK-8 reagent was added to the cultured cells, which were then incubated for another 4 h; the absorbance of the sample was measured at 450 nm on a VICTOR3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the dose-response curve using GraphPad software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
