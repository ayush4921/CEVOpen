<p>Cell migration potential was evaluated using a wound-healing assay, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, the cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (3.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) containing plastic inserts (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for the generation of a wound field and incubated for 24 h. After removing the inserts from the wells, the cells were exposed to 10 Gy 
 <italic>γ</italic>-irradiation using a 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs 
 <italic>γ</italic>-ray source (Atomic Energy of Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) at a dose rate of 3 Gy/min. The irradiated cells were incubated with each compound at various concentrations (2.5, 5, and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). Images were analyzed at 0 and 24 h using an AE31 microscope (Motic, Hong Kong).
