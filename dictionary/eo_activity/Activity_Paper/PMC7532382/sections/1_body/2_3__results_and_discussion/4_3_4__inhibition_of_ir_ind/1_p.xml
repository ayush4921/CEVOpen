<p>The wound-healing assay was performed by treating the cells at the noncytotoxic concentrations of compounds 1–3 (2.5 or 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) and then exposing to 10 Gy IR. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, compounds 1–3 decreased the covering rate of the width of the scratch created in a dose-dependent manner, which was confirmed by quantification of cell migration. These findings indicated that compounds 1–3 can inhibit IR-induced A549 cell migration at a noncytotoxic concentration.
