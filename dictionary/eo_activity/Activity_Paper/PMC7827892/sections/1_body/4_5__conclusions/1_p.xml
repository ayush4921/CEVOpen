<p>Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys were extensively demonstrated to have various health benefits to multiple diseases and systems. Clinical trials, especially in wound healing, showed the superior benefit of Tualang honey as a wound dressing over conventional dressing. However, clinical trials using Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys are still needed to add to the results because convincing effects are still yet to be finalised. In addition, the mechanism of action of these honeys was not clear, especially in human studies, thereby leaving an area to be discovered. In comparison, Tualang and Gelam honeys have been well researched compared with Kelulut honey. Thus, future studies may focus more on the potential benefit of Kelulut honey. This study also revealed that Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honey has excellent preclinical potential in multiple diseases and physiological systems that could steer future research to thoroughly explore honey as an efficient and proven superfood to be optimised for the benefit of humanity.</p>
