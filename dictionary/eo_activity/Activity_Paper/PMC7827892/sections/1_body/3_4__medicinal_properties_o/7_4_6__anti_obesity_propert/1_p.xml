 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00197-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. Supplementation of Kelulut honey yielded a higher reduction in body mass index (BMI), the percentage of body weight gain, adiposity index, and relative organ weight in a high-fat diet-induced obese rat model than that of orlistat, an anti-obesity drug [

Meanwhile, another study has shown that Kelulut honey could prevent changes, such as high omental fat mass, serum triglyceride, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressures, adipocyte area and adipocyte perimeter, caused by metabolic syndrome-induced rats [
