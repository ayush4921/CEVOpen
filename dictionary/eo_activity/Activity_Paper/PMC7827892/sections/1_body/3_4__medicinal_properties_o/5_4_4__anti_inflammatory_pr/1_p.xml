<p>Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00197-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> provides a summarisation of their anti-inflammatory properties and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00197-f004">Figure 4</xref> provides the pathway illustration. Gelam honey inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), TNF-α and IL-6 in carrageenan-induced acute paw oedema in rats. In this study, Gelam honey’s anti-inflammatory effect was similar to that of the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin [

The author claimed the phenolic compounds in Gelam honey to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B96-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. A study by Hussein et al. (2013) demonstrated Gelam honey’s inflammation inhibitory effects by attenuating NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and inhibiting IκBα degradation, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators, including COX-2 and TNF-α [

For instance, the intravenous injection of Gelam honey inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia in rats through the induction of heme oxygenase-1 and the inhibition of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10), NO and high-mobility group protein B1 [

Besides, treatment with Gelam honey in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced organ failure rat showed protective effects on organs by improving the organ blood parameters, reducing the infiltration of neutrophils and decreasing the myeloperoxidase activity and mortality compared with non-treatment. Thus, Gelam honey may have a therapeutic effect in protecting organs during inflammatory diseases [

 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory properties of Gelam honey were further proven in two studies using asthma-induced mice and rabbits. Both studies reported that Gelam honey administration via oral gavage in mice and aerosolised Gelam honey in rabbits reduced airway inflammation by reducing the inflammatory cell [

 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Gelam honey-treated mice show similar improvement with the dexamethasone-treated group in terms of epithelium thickness, number of mast cells and mucus expression [
