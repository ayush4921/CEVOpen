<p>The combination of Gelam honey and ginger potentiated the anti-cancer effect of 5-fluorouracil against HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells by reducing proliferation and increasing apoptosis [

In a separate study, Gelam honey combined with 5-fluorouracil also provided a synergistic cytotoxic effect against human adenocarcinoma colon cancer HT-29 cells. The combined treatment showed a significantly higher cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induction on HT-29 cells than the stand-alone treatment with Gelam honey and 5-fluorouracil [

 <sup>ink4a</sup> and cyclin D1 genes and subsequently initiated cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. However, pre-treatment with Gelam honey caused downregulation of these genes in irradiated HDFs. Gelam honey treatment caused cells to progress to the S phase with fewer cells in the G0/G1 phase, whilst apoptosis was inhibited [

Another study showed that Gelam honey inhibited the proliferation of HT 29 colon cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and apoptosis and suppressing inflammation [

In vitro studies have successfully revealed the anti-cancer properties of Gelam honey or in combination with ginger and their potentiating effect toward 5-fluorouracil. Thus, human studies using Gelam honey as a supplement to 5-fluorouracil should be conducted to prove the anti-cancer benefit of Gelam honey toward liver, colorectal and colon cancer cell lines as discussed above.
