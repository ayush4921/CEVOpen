<p>Tualang honey has been reported in several studies to exert a neuroprotective effect through its antioxidant properties. In a study of kainic acid KA-treated rats, pretreatment with Tualang honey reduced the KA-induced neuronal degeneration in the piriform cortex but failed to prevent the occurrence of KA-induced seizures. In addition, KA-induced rats showed increased locomotor activity and hyperactivity, which were attenuated by Tualang honey pretreatment [

A recent study reported that Tualang honey pretreatment significantly attenuated an increase in lipid peroxidation level and decreased the total antioxidant status level induced by KA treatment in the rat cerebral cortex. These findings indicated that pretreatment with Tualang honey has therapeutic potential against KA-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration through its antioxidant effect [
