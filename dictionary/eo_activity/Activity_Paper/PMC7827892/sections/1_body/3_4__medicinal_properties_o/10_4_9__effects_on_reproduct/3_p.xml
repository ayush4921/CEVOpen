<p>In the male reproductive system, Tualang honey at a dose of 1.2 g/kg/day is the most effective dose to alter the male reproductive parameter as it significantly increased epididymal sperm count [

In response to impaired sexual behavior and fertility, Tualang honey was revealed to have a protective effect against cigarette smoke-induced impaired sexual behavior and fertility in male rats by significantly increasing intromission and ejaculation and increasing mating fertility indices [

In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, Kelulut honey treatment prevented sperm and testicular oxidative damage by improving sperm quality and increasing the spermatozoa and spermatogenic cells [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. One possible mechanism is the anti-oxidative properties that are mostly attributed to the phenolic and flavonoid contents of honey. For support, Budin et al. (2017) reported increased SOD and GSH activities and decreased PC and MDA levels in sperm and testis of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [
