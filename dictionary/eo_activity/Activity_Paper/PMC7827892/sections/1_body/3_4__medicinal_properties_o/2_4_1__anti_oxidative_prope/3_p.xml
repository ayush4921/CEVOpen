<p>Other studies have also explored the antioxidant capacity of Tualang honey. In animal study, Tualang honey was reported as having a hypoglycemic effect with reduced elevated MDA levels. It restored SOD and CAT activities in the pancreas of diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], suggesting the hypoglycemic effect of Tualang honey through its anti-oxidative effect on the pancreas. By contrast, another study using glibenclamide- and metformin-treated diabetic rats yielded no significant thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and CAT effects except that in GPx. However, the authors reported that a combination of glibenclamide, metformin and Tualang honey significantly up-regulated the CAT activity, down-regulated the GPx activity and reduced TBARS [

These findings suggested that Tualang honey potentiates the effect of glibenclamide and metformin to protect diabetic rat pancreas against oxidative stress and damage. Another study on diabetic rats revealed that Tualang honey ameliorated oxidative stress in kidneys of diabetic rats [

However, a study investigating the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Tualang honey in alkali injury on the eyes of rabbits did not find any significant difference between the Tualang honey-treated group and the group who underwent conventional treatment in terms of inflammatory feature and antioxidant status [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consistent with the previous findings, Ahmad et al. (2017) reported the anti-oxidative properties of Tualang honey in a human study. The authors stated that consumption of 1.5 (high dose) and 0.75 (low dose) g/kg of Tualang honey demonstrated a comparable response in increasing antioxidant activity (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and suppressing oxidative stress (MDA and ROS) in female athletes. The time-course effect of Tualang honey that provides optimal antioxidant activity and oxidative stress protection was between 1 and 2 hours after its consumption [
