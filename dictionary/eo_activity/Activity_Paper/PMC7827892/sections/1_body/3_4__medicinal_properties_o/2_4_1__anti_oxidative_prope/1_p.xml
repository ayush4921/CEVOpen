<p>One of the most well-known benefits of honey is its anti-oxidative property. In this review, the most positive medicinal effects of Malaysian honey were attributed to its antioxidant properties. A plethora of studies regarding the antioxidative characteristic and pathways of Tualang, Gelam and Kelulut honeys are summarised and illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00197-f002">Figure 2</xref>, respectively. Two studies reported that Gelam honey reduced oxidative damage by reducing DNA damage and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level of young, middle-aged and aged rats by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities [

Another study showed that the combination of Gelam honey and ginger provided a better antioxidant effect than Gelam honey or ginger alone, as evidenced by the significantly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, reduced MDA level, increased (reduced glutathione) GSH level and increased GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio in diabetic rats [

Gamma irradiation to HDFs decreased SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) gene expression levels and enzyme activities, whilst treatment with Gelam honey increased both parameters [
