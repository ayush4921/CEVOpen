<p>Tualang honey was found to have intermediary glycemic index values of 65 Â± 7 [

 <xref rid="B112-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Wahab et al. (2018) suggested a differential effect of honey on glucose metabolism for short- and long-term use. [

(2019) supported a prior claim that the ingestion of Kelulut honey daily for 30 days has no significant effect on fasting glucose and fasting lipid profile in patients with impaired fasting blood glucose [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The authors suggested short-duration ingestion of Kelulut honey as the factor for the insignificant result. By contrast, one in vivo study showed that supplementation of Kelulut honey for the last 35 days in a 16-week high-carbohydrate high-fructose diet fed in rats decreased the fasting blood glucose compared with non-supplemented control [

Future studies should extend knowledge on the anti-diabetic properties of Tualang honey on patients with diabetes to reinforce the anti-diabetic ability of Tualang honey, as the animal studies discussed above [

 <xref rid="B108-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] have successfully proven that Tualang honey possesses anti-diabetic effect in animals.
