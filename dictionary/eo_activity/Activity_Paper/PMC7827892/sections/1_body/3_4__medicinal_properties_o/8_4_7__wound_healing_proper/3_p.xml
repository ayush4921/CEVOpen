<p>Gelam honey has also been demonstrated to have wound-healing properties. A study reported that Gelam honey-dressed wounds healed faster with less scab and only thin scar formations than the untreated, saline-treated and intrasite gel-treated full-thickness excisional wounds in rats [

They found that the application of Gelam honey hydrogel dressings significantly increased wound closure and accelerated the rate of re-epithelialisation compared with control hydrogel and OpSite film dressing in deep partial-thickness burn wounds in rats [
