<p>Gelam and Tualang honeys have been found to contain 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> with anti-microbial activity against multiple antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The anti-microbial compounds found were stable to heating, proteolytic enzyme treatment and pH adjustments [

A study comparing the anti-bacterial effects of topical gentamicin, topical Tualang honey and a combination of the two on pseudomonas-induced keratitis in rabbit eyes showed similar clinical and anti-microbial effects in all groups [
