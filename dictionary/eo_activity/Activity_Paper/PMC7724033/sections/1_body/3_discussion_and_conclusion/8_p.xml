Consequently, the serum level of conventional antiviral agents administered to COVID-19 patients may be affected by concomitant administration of herbal supplements. Such pharmacokinetic interactions may increase serum level and adverse effects, or decrease serum concentration and clinical response, both of which can have life-threatening outcomes in patients.
