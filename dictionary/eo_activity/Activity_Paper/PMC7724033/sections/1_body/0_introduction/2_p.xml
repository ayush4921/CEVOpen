<p>Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known through manuscripts by Persian scientists such as 
 <italic>The Canon of Medicine</italic> by Avicenna and 
 <italic>The Great Continens</italic> by 
 <italic>Rhazes</italic> (

One of the main approaches in the primary and secondary treatment of diseases in TPM is to protect the four body humors, which are blood, phlegm, bile, and melancholy, from infection (

Many types of infections or the so-called “humor infections” with different clinical manifestations have been described in TPM manuscripts and textbooks, some of which have similar features to that of SARS-CoV-2. One of the pathological conditions explained in TPM for the humors is “humor excitation” which is equivalent to the activation of inflammatory pathways (
