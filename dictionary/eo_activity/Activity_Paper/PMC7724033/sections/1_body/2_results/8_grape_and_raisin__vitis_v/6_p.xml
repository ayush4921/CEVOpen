<p>The inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum-dependent apoptosis was also involved in the nephroprotective effects of grape in diabetic nephropathy (

 <italic>via</italic> the reduction of caspase enzymes, an important category of participants in apoptosis, as well as inhibition of endothelial and inducible forms of NOS. The potency of 100 mg/kg of the grape extract was equal or higher than the same dose of N-acetylcysteine as the positive control (
