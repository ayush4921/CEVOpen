<p>In a virtual screening considering influenza A virus vRNA promoter, as well as an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation, procyanidin, a major component of grape extract, revealed significant antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2012</xref>). Grape seed extract has shown inhibitory effects on HCV replication 
 <italic>via</italic> suppression of virus-induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 overexpression. It has also shown a synergistic effect by co-administration with conventional anti-HCV medicines including telaprevir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir (

 <italic>via</italic> reducing the expression of several mucin MUC genes in the airway epithelium. Interestingly, this effect is in line with the lung protecting properties of grape as described in TPM, by cleaning the pathological viscous pulmonary mucosa (
