<p>Clove has demonstrated modulatory effects on the function of murine white blood cells and macrophages damaged through inflammation/oxidative stress damage (

Clove extract and its major ingredient, eugenol, have shown an anti-inflammatory effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage in macrophages. No statistically significant difference was observed between eugenol (100 μg/well) and dexamethasone (10
