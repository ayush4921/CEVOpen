<p>Rhein, another anthraquinone structure of rhubarb, has shown protective effects on RSV-induced lung infection 
 <italic>via</italic> modulation of the host inflammatory response, evident from the reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3. NLRP3 inflammasome is a downstream protein complex of the NF-κB pathway, activating caspase-1 and consequently, apoptosis. It should be mentioned that rhein at a dose of 120 mg/kg showed similar efficacy to 46 mg/kg of ribavirin (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models of pulmonary fibrosis, emodin caused a decrease in α-smooth muscle actin and collagen production. Furthermore, the compound reduced TGF-β1-dependent phosphorylated Smad2/3, a pro-fibrotic mediator inhibiting fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts (

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, another TGF-β1-dependent stimulator of fibroblast activation, as well as HSP-47, a collagen-specific heat shock protein and an indicator of pulmonary fibrosis, were also decreased by emodin, further showing its antifibrotic activity (

 <italic>via</italic> the inhibition of NF-κB activity and the prevention of lung fibrosis. Moreover, this compound could reduce ovalbumin-induced autophagy and inflammation (

 <italic>via</italic> nasogastric tube for one week. In comparison to the control group, the adjuvant rhubarb administration could significantly improve oxygenation. Additionally, it could decrease the extravascular lung water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2017</xref>), confirming the results of the preclinical studies in a clinical setting. It should be noted that no identification process was considered for rhubarb and thus, it is not clear which species of the plant were used in this trial (
