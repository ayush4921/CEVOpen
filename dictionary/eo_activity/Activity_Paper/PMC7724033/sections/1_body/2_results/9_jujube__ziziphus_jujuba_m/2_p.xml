<p>Betulinic acid, a triterpene constituent of jujube fruit, has shown antiviral activity against influenza A virus both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. At the concentration of 50 μM, betulinic acid showed a 98% inhibition of virus cytopathic effects; while it was not toxic for the host cells. Despite the remission of symptoms in the infected animals, no significant change was observed in viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokines (except for IFNγ). Thus, further mechanistic investigations are needed to establish the antiviral properties of this compound (
