<p>Chicory is also demonstrated to have immunomodulatory activities. In the animal model of ethanol-induced immunotoxicity, chicory increased both circulating leukocytes and the weight of lymphatic organs, showing an improvement in immune system function (

Thus, aside from the direct immunomodulatory effects of chicory, the presence of such prebiotics in this plant may also have a modulatory effect on normal flora. The indirect protective effect of chicory against pathologic conditions can be hypothesized in future studies.
