<p>Garlic aqueous extract could effectively ameliorate pulmonary interstitial alveolitis and macroabscesses in lung damage (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Mohi El-Din et al., 2014</xref>). In LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation, oral administration of S-allylmercaptocysteine could dose-dependently inhibit lung damage. The effect of 60 mg/kg of S-allylmercaptocysteine was equal to or higher than 500 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine (positive control), showing a high potency. This compound could suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing macrophage and neutrophils infiltration into BALF, inhibiting NF-κB activation, and improving endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Furthermore, Nrf2 and its downstream signals, HO-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a cytoprotective mediator in oxidative damage, were increased by S-allylmercaptocysteine (

In addition to animal studies, aged garlic extract (garlic soaked in alcohol) has represented beneficial properties in reducing the number and duration of symptoms in subjects with cold/flu. These results also showed an improved proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and γδ-T lymphocytes in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (
