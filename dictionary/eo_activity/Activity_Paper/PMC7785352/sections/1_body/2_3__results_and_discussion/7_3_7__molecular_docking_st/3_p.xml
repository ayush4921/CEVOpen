<p>In recent years, molecular docking simulations have become an important tool for understanding the interaction mode and the structure-activity relationships of ligands with receptors. The in silico research results of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were in agreement with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> data and the enzyme kinetic study 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The integration of enzyme activity, kinetics, and molecular docking studies provided principle insights into the molecular basis underlying ligand binding affinity and
