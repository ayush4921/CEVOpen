<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity assay was determined according to the reported method with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, extract and four fractions were dissolved in methyl alcohol at concentrations ranging from 62.5 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, which were prepared to mix with a methyl alcohol solution of DPPH (0.2 mM, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) on a 96-well plate. After that, shaken gently and stood at room temperature for 30 min, the optical density (OD) 517 nm in each well were determined by a microplate reader. Triplicates of each sample were run, and the mean values were calculated. Ascorbic acid was chosen as positive control. The percentage inhibition (%) for each sample was calculated by the following formula:
