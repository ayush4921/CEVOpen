<p id="p0015">Phytochemicals of plant origin are natural compounds that are non-nutritious but are essential for normal human physiological processes (
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Rezaeian et al., 2015</xref>). These compounds are found in plants, food, or food their products and they serve as natural antioxidants (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Koleva et al., 2002</xref>). Natural antioxidants are safe and they can protect the cells’ macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids from the oxidative damage caused by free radicals from various biochemical reactions that occur in the body (
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Kampa and Castana 2008</xref>). A reaction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with macromolecules induces apoptosis that could consequently lead to several physiological, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Floyd and Hensley 2002</xref>). For normal cellular processes, there must be a redox balance between the human’s antioxidant defense mechanism and ROS that are produced during cellular processes in the body. For example, continual stress conditions increase energy consumption from high metabolism processes, which consequently favours ROS generation in the body. This process consequently produces an imbalance or a shift in equilibrium between intracellular antioxidant and ROS, which results in oxidative stress, and perhaps causes oxidative damage to cells, tissues, and organs (

Different kinds of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, steroids, phenolic acids, tannins, ascorbic acid, tocopherols, glycosides, and saponins have been reported to exhibit antioxidant activities thus increasing prospects for their usage in the treatment of human chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, hepatitis, etc. (
