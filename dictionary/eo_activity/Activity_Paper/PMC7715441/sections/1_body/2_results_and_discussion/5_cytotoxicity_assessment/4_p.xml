<p id="p0140">The use of HeLa cell lines has an added advantage of discovering an anticancer property of a plant, as such; it was observed in this present study that 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> extracts exerted effective cytotoxicity effect at concentration low as 1.23 µg/mL, little or no HeLa cells viability. As aforementioned, 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family that is known to comprise a variety of alkaloid compounds that are toxic (
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Van Wyk and Gericke 2000</xref>). Besides, natural products are well recognized as sources of cytotoxic molecules (
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Gullett et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, cytotoxicity results observed in this study could be attributed to the presence of alkaloid compounds. Our findings followed a similar trend to the report of 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Adewusi et al. (2012)</xref> on the cytotoxicity effect of a crinine alkaloid from 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> methanol extract on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). The GCMS analysis of the crude extracts showed the presence of alkaloid compounds such as buphanine, buphandrin and crinamidine that are known to have a cytotoxic effect against cancerous cells such as human leukaemic MoLT-4 cells (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Zvetkova et al., 2001</xref>). Not only from 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic>, but also from amaryllidaceae alkaloids isolated from 
 <italic>Crinum augustum</italic> and 
 <italic>Crinum bulbispermum</italic> have been reported to exhibit cytotoxic activity on cancerous cells (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Zvetkova et al., 2001</xref>). Based on the present study and literature review undertaken, 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> has been shown to contain alkaloid compounds that possess and exert toxic effects on cancerous cells. As a result, further studies on cytotoxicity effects of studied extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> against other cancerous cells would be necessary to further validate their anticancer property.
