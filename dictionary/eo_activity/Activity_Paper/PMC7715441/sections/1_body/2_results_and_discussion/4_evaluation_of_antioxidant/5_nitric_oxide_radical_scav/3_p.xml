<p id="p0115">In the present study, all the studied extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb revealed notable radical scavenging activity with a dose-dependent pattern (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Ethanolic bulb extract had the highest inhibiting activity at the concentration of 0.8Â mg/mL, followed by acetone extract at 59% and chloroform extract at 54.09%. The effective nitric oxide inhibition displayed by plant extracts used in the present study indicates 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> may be of considerable interest in preventing health problems caused by excessive production of nitric oxide. 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref> stated that acute inflammation is one of the pathological features found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and during this process, large amounts of nitric oxide are thought to be the causative agents of such neuropathology. Nitric oxide has been reported to be implicated in inflammation, cancer, and other pathological conditions (
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Choudhari et al., 2013</xref>). From these findings, 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> emerges as a source of bioactive compounds with potential as an effective nitric oxide radical scavenging agent.
