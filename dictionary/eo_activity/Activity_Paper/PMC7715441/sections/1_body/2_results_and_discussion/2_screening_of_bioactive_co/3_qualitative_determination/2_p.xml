<p id="p0075">In this study, the appearance of yellow and brown turbidity in all the crude extracts qualitatively confirmed the presence of alkaloids, and our results agree with the report of 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Tonisi et al. (2020)</xref>. In the same vein, the findings of 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Sasikala and Sundaraganapathy (2017)</xref> also corroborate with our study findings where alkaloids were observed to be part of the constituents of hydroalcoholic extract of Ipomoea aquatic by the appearance of a yellow and reddish precipitate. Thus, the findings of the present study as well as those gleaned from the literature support the view that 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> is comprised mostly of alkaloids.
