In cancer research, plant EO represent an attractive source of new anticancer compounds that have potential therapeutic applications in chemoprevention. Considered to potentially be more effective than traditional cancer treatments, EO selectively interact with various pathways and cellular mechanisms in a manner that may create synergistic results (
