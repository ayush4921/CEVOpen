 <italic>Tarchonanthus camphoratus L.</italic> (family 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic>) is found in a wide range of environments (e.g., Africa and Arabia), has a grayish appearance, and can grow to be about six meters in height (
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Van Wyk et al., 1997</xref>). Its leaves have been traditionally used to relieve bronchitis, asthma, headaches, inflammation, and abdominal pains (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Amabeoku et al., 2000</xref>). The essential oil found in 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> displays a wide variety of biological properties (e.g., antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, insecticidal) (

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Ireri et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Aiyegoro and Van Dyk, 2011</xref>). Oxygenated sesquiterpene and monoterpenes have been documented to be the major constituents of the 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> essential oil (TCEO) (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Other phytochemical investigations on the 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> have detected the presence of reducing sugars, saponins and tannins (
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Van Wyk et al., 1997</xref>). The cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> that has been grown in different regions, using different cell lines has also been reported (

 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). According to our literature survey, only some alkaloid and flavones were isolated and characterized from 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> grown in Saudi Arabia by 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Bishay et al. (2002)</xref>. However, no report was found regarding the chemical constituents, cytotoxic and apoptosis effects of the essential oils of 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> grown in Saudi Arabia have been published. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the chemical profile of the TCEO using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, while exploring its anticancer activities.
