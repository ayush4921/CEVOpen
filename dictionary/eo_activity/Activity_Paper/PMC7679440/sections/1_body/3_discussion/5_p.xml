 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Nanyonga et al. (2013)</xref>, EO from 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> grown in South Africa displayed cytotoxic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 100 μg/ml against human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). The cytotoxic effects of EO taken from 
 <italic>T. camphorates</italic> grown in Yemen have been reported against colon cancer cells (HT29) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 84.7 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Our results showed that TCEO had stronger cytotoxicity in terms of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against different cancer cells. These differences between IC
 <sub>50</sub> values could be attributed to a quantitative variation of chemical constituents among these oils, as well as cancer cells used, and the duration of treatment.
