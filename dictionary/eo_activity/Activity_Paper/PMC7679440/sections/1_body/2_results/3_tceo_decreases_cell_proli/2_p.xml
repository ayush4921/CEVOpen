<p id="p0065">The cytotoxicity of cell lines treated with TCEO for 48 h are presented in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The TCEO exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in all cell lines after 48 h of incubation. The calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for all tested cells are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was shown that inhibitory effect of TCEO was particularly observed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.5 μg/mL), indicating that TCEO was more cytotoxic in MCF-7 cells compared to the other cell lines. We therefore chose to focus on breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells as cell line models in this study.
