<p id="p0075">To further examine whether apoptosis had been induced in MCF-7 cells, an annexin V-FITC staining assay was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, treatment of MCF-7 cells with 12.5 and 25 µg/ml of TCEO showed increases in the amount of early apoptosis (from 1.2 ± 0.14% in the control to 2.2 ± 0.21% and 3.6 ± 0.28%, respectively). A remarkable increase in late apoptotic cells was also observed (from 1.8 ± 0.21% in the control to 13.1 ± 0.7% with p &lt; 0.05, and 36.2 ± 2.8% with p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Thus, the antiproliferative impact of TCEO on MCF-7 cells could be correlated with induction of apoptosis.
