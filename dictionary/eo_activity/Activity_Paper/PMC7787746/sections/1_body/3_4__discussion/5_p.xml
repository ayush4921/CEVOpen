<p>Hyperglycemia is a well-known triggering factor for oxidative stress and ROS production in hepatic tissues [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress are regularly elevated in liver tissues of diabetic animals. The generated free radicals attack essential molecules in the cellular membrane lipid bilayer leading to lipid peroxidation, which increase the level of TBARS, markers for lipid peroxidation. Moreover, GSH levels were estimated, in the present study, as it is a well-documented endogenous antioxidant molecule. Glutathione is a tripeptide that has two forms: the reduced GSH form, which scavenges free radicals, and oxidized GSSG form. The ration between the two forms determines the redox status in biological tissues. In hepatic tissue diabetic animals, TBARS values were increased, while GSH levels were reduced indicating oxidative cellular damage. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activities, which support the cellular functions and prevent the oxidative destructions, were reduced in hepatic cells. SOD catalyzes the transformation of oxygen radicals (O

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. CAT hydrolyses H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in to water and oxygen. GPx, GR, and GST enzymes help in the process of glutathione antioxidant defense against free radicals. They catalyze the transformation of two GSH molecules to GSSG, which is associated with reduction of one H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> molecule to two water molecules. It should be noted that oxidative stress initially increases the antioxidant enzymes activities as a defensive cellular mechanism [
