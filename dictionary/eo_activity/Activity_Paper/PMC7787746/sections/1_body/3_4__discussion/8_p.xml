<p>In the present study, 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> markedly corrected the hepatocellular degeneration and inflammatory response to hyperglycemia. Moreover, 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant enzymes capabilities. The antioxidant effects of the traditionally used plant were reported previously. Results of Mothana et al' study revealed that methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> possesses significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Other pharmacological effects demonstrated by 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> in the same study were antinociceptive and antipyretic effects [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic>, which are flavonoids in nature, including quercetin 3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside, and quercetin 3-O-b-L-arabinopyranoside [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moderate antitrypanosomal effects of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> extract were also documented in another study [
