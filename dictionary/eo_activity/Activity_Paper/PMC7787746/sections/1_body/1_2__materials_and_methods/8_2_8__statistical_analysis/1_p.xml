<p>The mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of each group was statistically compared to all other groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). The statistical variability between groups was considered significant when 
 <italic>p</italic> values were ≤0.05. GraphPad Prism software, version 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), was employed as statistical software.
