<p>Experiments on PC3 cells have shown that, whereas aqueous and ethanol extracts had strong cytotoxic activity, chloroform extracts were devoid of such activity [

 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The same authors also found that pre-treatment with protease leads to an almost complete loss of effect, which indicates that a protein is responsible for this activity [

A rodent model of prostate cancer (AT6.1) showed that i.p. administration in SCID mice of an active fraction corresponding to a molecular weight of about 40,000 Da (at a low dose of 5 mg/kg, once every three days) resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume as compared with the non-treated animals [

 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This was also supported by the caspase-3 increase in cells treated with the fraction and the flow cytometric analysis, which suggested that the fraction causes cell cycle arrest (in the G0/G1 phase), triggering then apoptosis [
