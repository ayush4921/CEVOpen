<p>In a study comparing (among others) the ethanol and aqueous extracts obtained from leaves and stems of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> (agar disc diffusion method), inhibition zones were detected only for the ethanol extract and only on 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus flavus</italic> (Gram-positive), and the Gram-negative 
 <italic>Morganella morganii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B142-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Another study also reported no inhibitory effect on several microbial species of an aqueous extract [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It has been suggested that inhibition zones smaller than 9 mm should be considered inactive, those ranging between 9 and 12 mm, moderately active, those ranging between 13 and 18 mm, active, and those larger than 18 mm should be classified as very active [
 <xref rid="B136-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B143-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Since, in this study, all inhibition zones were less than 9 mm in size [
 <xref rid="B142-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>], the ethanol extract should also be regarded as virtually inactive. A. Brantner and J. Grein (1994), though, reported inhibition zones of around 11 mm on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for an aqueous extract prepared from the aerial parts of the plant [
 <xref rid="B140-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. A methanol extract produced inhibition zones of 15 mm for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, and of 20 mm for 
 <italic>Enterobacter fecalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] (i.e., the extract could be considered active and very active, respectively, on these microbial species).
