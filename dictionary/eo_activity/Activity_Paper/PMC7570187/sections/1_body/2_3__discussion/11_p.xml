<p>The data provided in this review lead us to suggest that this poorly studied species may have similar pharmacological effects like 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., because it belongs to the same genera and the probability that they share the same active compounds, although perhaps in different proportions. So its pharmacological properties can be better, or just the opposite.
