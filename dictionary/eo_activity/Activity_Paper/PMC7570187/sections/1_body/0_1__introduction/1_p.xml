<p>Myrtales is an order within the classification of terrestrial green plants (Viridiplantae-Streptophyta) [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Lythraceae family (from the order of the Myrtales) is composed of herbs, shrubs and trees that are mainly recognized for their flaky bark, crumpled petals from the bud (when emerging out of the rim of the calyx tube of the sepals), leaves oppositely paired, seeds with multi-layered outer integuments, and the fruit is usually a capsule [

 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Lythraceae family comprises 31 genera including the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is quite surprising as the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera has previously been assigned to the monogenic 
 <italic>Punicaceae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the results of numerous molecular and morphological investigations revealed the close relationship of the genera 
 <italic>Punica</italic> with the Lythraceae family [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previously it was considered a monogenic Punicaceae family that contains only one genera, 
 <italic>Punica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to Pliny, the name 
 <italic>Punica</italic> was given by the Romans, referring to the city of Cartago, in Tunis (Punic, Phoenician, Carthaginian), from where the best pomegranate (from Latin “
 <italic>pome</italic>” witch means apple and “
 <italic>granate</italic>” meaning many seeded) arrived in Europe. The genera 
 <italic>Punica</italic> contains two species, 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Punica protopunica</italic> Balf., [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Initially, 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. was known as 
 <italic>Malum punicum</italic>, the apple of Cartago, but later, Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) chose the current name, with a specific epithet of 
 <italic>granatum</italic>, which means granular [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Punica protopunica</italic> Balf. was first described by the Scottish botanist Isaac Bayley Balfour (1853–1922) during his arboreal and botanical expedition in 1880, and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1882 [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> is native to the region that covers territories from a part of Iran to northern India [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Wild 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. types have their natural distribution in central Asia from Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, to northern India, and this region is considered the center of origin of pomegranate [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Later, the pomegranate was distributed to the Mediterranean, East Asia, America and South Africa, and this distribution originated the genetic diversity of the pomegranate [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], on the other hand, 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is endemic to the Socotra archipelago (located between the Arabian sea and the Guardafui channel in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of the Horn of Africa) [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this context, the objective of this review was to compile the available information on the 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. species (morphology, distribution, cultivation, vulnerability, uses), including its antioxidant capacity and the medicinal properties, to make it known and allow a wider use of this forgotten wild species.
