<p>The antiviral activity of the methanolic and aqueous extracts of twenty-five medicinal plants including 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. fruit and leaves, were evaluated in two in vitro models (unreported concentrations) by Mothana et al., [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], one with MDCK cells with type A influenza virus and the other with Vero cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 was more sensitive than type A influenza against the extracts evaluated. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. was anti-influenza virus A = 75.7 µg/mL and anti-HSV-1 = 5.8 µg/mL. The species was not considered by the authors as a plant with potential for the development of antiviral drugs.
