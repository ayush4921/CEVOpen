<p>Balfour, the discoverer of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., described it as “trees with branches, often thorny; elliptic leaves round sheath, oblique; below the oblong, obtuse flower bracts; obovate petals; joined carpels, horizontal basal tone center spiral. From Socotra, a new species that abounds and grows on the peninsula” [

Additionally, Balfour wrote: “In general habit, it is not unlike the pomegranate, but its leaves are larger and coarser, and it wants the delicate character of the foliage of that species. The flowers, too, are somewhat smaller, and their turbinate base is more angular. The fruit is very much less in size” [

 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. has morphological differences compared to 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L.; it has larger, narrower leaves, different foliage, continuous flowering, and smaller, pink (not red) flowers. The fruit of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is round, pommel-shaped, with a maximum diameter of 3 cm and a characteristic yellow-greenish or red-brown color when ripe, is smaller, evergreen, with white seeds and less sweet than 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. [
