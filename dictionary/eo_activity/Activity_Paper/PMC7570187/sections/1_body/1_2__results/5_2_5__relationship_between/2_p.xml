<p>Recently, Youssef et al., [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] analyzed genetic diversity and the relationship between 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. and eleven accessions of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. (from Egypt, MÃ©xico and Yemen), using the following molecular markers: (1) amplified sequence-related polymorphism (SRAP); (2) amplification polymorphism of the target region (TRAP); (3) amplified intron-directed polymorphism (ITAP); and (4) sequence analysis of the 
 <italic>pgWD40</italic> gene (involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis). It was found that the relationship between accessions of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic>, grouped by regions, was approximately 90% similar, while, evidently, the degree of genetic variation was altered within of each region. However, these markers revealed the relationship between 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> at 33% similarity. ITAP, TRAP and SRAP generated a total of 719 bands, of these, 193 were specific for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., and 234 bands were shared between both species. The pgWD40 gene analysis showed 100% identity between 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. accessions and 98% with 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. Phylogenetic analysis of the WD40 sequences of species, including both species of the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera confirmed the relationship between 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., supporting the hypothesis that 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. could be an ancestor of 
 <italic>P granatum</italic> L.
