<p>There is a wide range of possibilities for studying this species. In biomedical sciences, more information is needed on the effect of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. on human health. In vitro and in vivo models in various pathologies are necessary. It is suggested to delve into the mechanisms of action of the species in each pathology studied. Studies of the chemical composition and evaluation of its bioactive compounds (tree and especially of the fruit) are necessary, and compare these results with the composition of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. Clinical studies are considered necessary to corroborate the effects reported in traditional medicine, once it has been reported that there is no toxicity. It is suggested to use other compound extraction methods and the use of high, medium and low polarity solvents.
