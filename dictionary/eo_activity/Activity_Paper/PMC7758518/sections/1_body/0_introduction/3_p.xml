 <italic>Bignoniaceae Juss</italic>., endemic plants of South America distributed in tropical areas throughout the world (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez, 2011</xref>). Some species of this family are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, rheumatism, and colds. Additionally, its anti-malaria and antimicrobial activity have also been reported by

 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers. The extracts of this flower could be a potential sustainable alternative as an antimicrobial component and solution of oxidative stress problems in other organisms.
