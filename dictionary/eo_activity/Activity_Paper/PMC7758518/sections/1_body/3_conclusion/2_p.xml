 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> flowers represent a source of polyphenolic compounds, showing that methanol and aqueous extracts have high antioxidant activity. Furthermore, both extracts showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance over gram-positive bacteria. The antioxidant and antibacterial results obtained in this work raise the possibility of using and revaluing 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> flowers as a source of compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical, food, medical, cosmetic, and agricultural sectors. The findings of the present study justify deeper research on the applications of the 
 <italic>J.Â mimosifolia</italic> flower as an antimicrobial of natural origin.
