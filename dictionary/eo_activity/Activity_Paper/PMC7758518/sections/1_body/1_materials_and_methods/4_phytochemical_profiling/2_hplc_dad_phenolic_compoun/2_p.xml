<p id="p0035">Analyses of phenolic compounds were performed on an Alliance 2695LC system (Waters) equipped with a 2998 diode array detector (DAD) set at 220–540 nm detection range, and a Symmetry C18 reverse phase column (100 × 4.6mm) (Waters). The eluent was a mixture of solvent A (water acidified with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile grade HPLC). A 30 μl volume of the phenolic extract was filtered through a 0.4 μm pore diameter syringe filter prior injection. Elution gradient was 5%–40% (B) from 0 to 18 min, 40%–90% (B) from 18 to 20 min and 90% (B) from 20 to 24 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and 35 °C. Individual compound identification and quantification was obtained by comparison of retention times and using a calibration curve of pure standard.</p>
