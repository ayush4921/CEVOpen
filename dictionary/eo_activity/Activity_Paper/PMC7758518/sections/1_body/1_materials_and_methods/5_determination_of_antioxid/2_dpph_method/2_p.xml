<p id="p0045">DPPH antioxidant capacity (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was determined with the methodology described by 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Williams (1995)</xref> and modified by 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fukumoto and Mazza (2000)</xref>. The experiments were performed in triplicate. An absorbance of 520 nm was used at a time of 30 min. The results were expressed as the percentage of antiradical activity (
 <italic>%ARA</italic>) based on the following formula: 
 <italic>%ARA = [(A.Control)–(A.Sample)/A.Control]∗100</italic> where 
 <italic>A.Control</italic> represents the absorbance of the DPPH solution and 
 <italic>A.Sample</italic> represents the absorbance of the sample with DPPH solution.
