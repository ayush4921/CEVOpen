<p id="p0125">The methanol extract showed greater antimicrobial activity with a range of 17.66–28.33 mm of inhibition halo, compared to the aqueous extract with a range of 8.66–16.33 mm) for all the evaluated microorganisms. On the other hand, the gram-positive microorganisms presented a larger diameter of the inhibition halo compared to the gram-negative for both methanol and aqueous extracts. The most susceptible gram-negative bacterias were 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (22.66 ± 1.52 mm) for methanol and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (11.33 ± 3.51 mm) for aqueous extracts. These results show that 
 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> extracts could be a potential resource to avoid resistance to antibiotics, a recurrent health problem, principally in gastrointestinal diseases caused by toxins of these bacteria. For gram-positive, the most susceptible were 
 <italic>B. ceureus</italic> (28.33 ± 3.51 mm) for methanol and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (16.33 ± 3.51 mm) for aqueous extracts. Species of the genus 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> are part of the folklore and ethnobotanical practices in certain areas of South America. The flowers of this tree are used as medicinal treatments and have been attributed with anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, and anti-cancer properties (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al. (2015)</xref> reported an inhibition halo of 96.9% and 96.6% on 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus,</italic> respectively, using an ethanol extract of leaves of 
 <italic>J. oxyphylla</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zatta et al. (2009)</xref> evaluated the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Jacaranda decurrens</italic> leaves against 25 strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections, showing significant inhibitory activity. On the other hand, 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> is part of the traditional medicine in Ecuador, used to purify the blood and treat venereal diseases (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Solís, 1992</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hendra et al. (2018)</xref> evaluated nine metabolites isolated from 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> flowers, including phenylethanoid β-D-glucopyranose, a new compound, which did not presented inhibitory activity against on 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella penumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> at a low concentration (32 μg/ml). Furthermore, the results of the present work coincide with the results of 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Rojas et al. (2006)</xref>, which reported inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and
