<p id="p0140">In particular, part of the antimicrobial activity has been attributed to the phenolic compounds present in the extracts from plants. Studies on the chemical components presented in

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2017)</xref> indicated that the most common compounds that act as antimicrobials include the members of the flavonoids family which are activated and/or synthesized in the presence of biotic and abiotic stress. On the other hand, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al. (1987)</xref> showed that the presence of hydroxyl groups in 3 ′, 4′ and 5′of the B ring and in C3 influences the antimicrobial activity of flavonoids. Data corroborated by 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. (1996)</xref> demonstrated a relationship between the structure and antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria using methylated flavones, and that the most active were those with hydroxyl groups at C-5 and C-7 and three substitutions at ring B.
