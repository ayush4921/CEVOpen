<p>We present the prospective therapeutic potential of the aqueous extracts of Tea (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>) and Haritaki (
 <italic>T. chebula)</italic> against SARS‐CoV‐2 based on 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease activity inhibition. These herb extracts contain a plethora of molecules researched to have anti‐viral, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant properties, and other beneficial health effects. In the current scenario of pandemic, an expedited evaluation of bioactive constituents is required to establish the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 property of these herbs. Moreover, larger randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled multicenter clinical trials should be conducted before incorporation of these herbs as a prospective therapeutic option.
