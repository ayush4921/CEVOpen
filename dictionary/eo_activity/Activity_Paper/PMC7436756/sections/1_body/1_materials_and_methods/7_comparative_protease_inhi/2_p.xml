<p>To decipher the difference in efficacies to inhibit the viral protease by universally used Tea, we compared the enzymatic inhibition for Green Tea as wells as Black Tea mentioned above using the 10 Î¼M of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> at varying concentrations of Tea. Moreover, we have analyzed the effective protease inhibition by both tea with Haritaki. All the parameters like substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor concentrations were kept constant during the reactions.
