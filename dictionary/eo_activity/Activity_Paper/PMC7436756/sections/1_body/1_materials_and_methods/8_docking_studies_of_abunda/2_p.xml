<p>The crystal structure PDB 6LU7 of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was taken from the RCSB databank. The active site prediction was performed using the metaPocket2.0 server and the best hit near to catalytic site having His41 and Cys145 was fixed. This was used for site‐specific docking using ParDock software. The 3‐dimensional structures of active compounds present in the medicinal plants were taken from the PubChem database. The docking results were analyzed based on binding energy and binding poses.
