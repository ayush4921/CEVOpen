Oral administration of the formulation for 2 months showed visible alleviation of ataxia symptoms including vertigo and titubation. Motor function was also observed to be improved, as indicated by the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). At 1 year after treatment discontinuation, the patient experienced a relapse in ataxia symptoms, although re-administration of the formulation alleviated the deteriorating symptoms. However, the patient relapsed a second time after another 15 months after treatment discontinuation, which was again alleviated by the treatment [

Although the mechanisms of Zhengan Xifeng Tang on SCA6 were not identified from these studies, it was suggested that the positive effects may be attributed to the antioxidant and anticonvulsant activity of the herb formulation [
