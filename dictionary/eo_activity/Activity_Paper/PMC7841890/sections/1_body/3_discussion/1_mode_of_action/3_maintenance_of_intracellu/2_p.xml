<p id="Par71">A study by Huang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] investigated the positive effects of EGb 761, a standardised extract of 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, in in vitro models of SCA17 using HEK 293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant TATA-box binding protein (TBP), and an in vivo transgenic mouse model overexpressing TBP. Pre-treatment with EGb 761 (20 μg/mL) for 1 h restored cellular calcium homeostasis and suppressed calcium influx, as indicated by reduced calcium green fluorescence intensity. Additionally, there was a reduction in calcium-dependent pro-apoptotic marker expressions, including calpain 2, BAX, caspase 3 and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP), as detected by Western blot analysis. Intraperitoneal injection of EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) in transgenic mice demonstrated improved motor function by rotarod test. Moreover, EGb 761 prevented the disruption of calbindin integrity, as indicated by immunohistochemistry analysis [
