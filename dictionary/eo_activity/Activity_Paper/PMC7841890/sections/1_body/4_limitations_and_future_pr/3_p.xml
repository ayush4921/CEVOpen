<p id="Par76">It is worthy to emphasise that HA is a rare genetic disorder with severe survival outcomes; hence, development of translational models of human-specific HA is rather limited. Studies of innovative treatment with small sample size by individual laboratories should by no means be substituted by multi-centre pre-clinical mouse studies. Nevertheless, the limitations of such smaller studies should be clearly defined by differentiating between proof-of-concept studies and pre-clinical testing studies.</p>
