<p>Mpro, one of the best characterized drug targets of SARS-CoV-2, is essential for polyprotein processing (translated from viral RNA) that enables viral replication and gene expressions. The catalytic dyad His41 and Cys145 is essential for substrate hydrolysis. Thus, compounds inhibiting the active site of this protease are expected to prevent replication and transcription of viral components (Das et al.,

In general, SARS-CoV-2 makes an entry into host cell through ACE2 receptors and it is mediated by receptor binding domain of homo trimeric spike glycoprotein. The crystal structure of spike protein in complex with human ACE2 receptor revealed that residue Ser19, Gln24,Thr27, Phe28, Asp30, Lys31, His34, Glu35,Glu37, Asp38, Tyr41, Gln42, Leu45, Leu79, Met82, Tyr83,Asn330,Lys353, Gly354, Asp355, Arg357 and Arg393 of human ACE2 interacted with residues Ala475/Gly476, Ala474/G476/Asn487, Phe56/Tyr473/Ala475/Tyr489, Tyr489, Lys417/Leu455/Phe456, Leu455/Phe456/Glu484/Tyr489/Phe490/Gln493, Tyr453/Leu455/Gln493, Gln493, Tyr505, Tyr449/Gly496/Gln498, Gln498/Thr500/Asn501, Gly446/Tyr449/Gln498, Gln498/Thr500, Phe486, Phe486, Phe486/Asn487/Tyr489, Thr500, Gly496/Asn501/Gly502/Tyr505, Tyr502/Tyr505, Thr500,Gly502, Thr500, Tyr505, respectively, of spike glycoprotein (Wang et al.,

However, spike protein and ACE2 receptor showed no significant inhibition. In case of ACE2 drug target, only Thr27 (hotspot residue) of ACE2 had interactions with bioactives (Veeramachaneni et al.,
