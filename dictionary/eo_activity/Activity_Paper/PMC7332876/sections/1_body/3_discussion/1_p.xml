<p>Siddha, one of the oldest traditional systems of medicine in India, has been shown to be effective in treating respiratory-related infections (Ram et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Several natural bioactives isolated from medicinal plants of Siddha system are reported for antiviral property against respiratory viruses. It is thus likely that these compounds may exert an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Adeoye et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Oliveira et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Hence, in the present study anti-COVID-19 drug candidates were identified from Siddha medicinal plant, with special attention to NKC combination plants, due to its antiviral, immunostimulant and immunomodulatory activities (Kavinilavan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The potent anti-COVID-19 drug candidates were screened from 47 bioactives, among them 5 (Orientin, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid and Magnoflorine) bioactives had potential interactions with all drug targets (mentioned in the present study). All these drug candidates exhibited strong affinity towards the target site of the receptor molecule with high binding energy. The top scoring receptor-ligand complex was stabilized by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals and electrostatics interactions (Chen &amp; Kurgan, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These interactions are indeed prerequisites for biological functions and successful drug developments. Moreover, the top two scoring ligands Cucurbitacin E and Orientin were further substantiated through 20â€‰ns MD simulation studies.
