<p>The multiple pharmacological effects exhibited by these components strongly suggest that these phytochemicals would certainly find their way into the arsenal of antiviral drugs. Moreover, the active components Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Magnoflorine, Cucurbitacin, Piperine, Palmatine, Stigmasterol, Andrographolide, Sitosterol and 2-monolinolenin were FDA approved drugs. Hence, these phytochemicals can be further taken for preclinical studies to treat COVID-19 infection (Lobo-Galo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The docking studies expounded with MD simulation and binding affinity analyses strongly suggest that the compound Cucurbitacin E and Orientin are promising drug candidate to combat COVID-19 infections. However,

In conclusion, consumption of NKC will helps in developing an immune response, elimination of toxins from the system, soothes the body and improves the overall health condition.
