<p>The WHO estimates that, 80% of population from underdeveloped realm rely mostly on the traditional medicines. In addition to this, WHO listed around 21,000 plants which are known for their therapeutic potential around the world among which 2500 varieties are found around India including 150 species with large scale commercial usage (Shukla et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In India, Siddha is one among the three traditional medical systems practiced and the other two being Ayurveda and Unani. In Siddha medicine Nilavembu Kudineer Chooranam (NKC) has been recommended for the preclusion and control of all the types of viral infectious diseases. NKC is an herbal formulation comprising nine varieties of plant materials viz. Nilavembu (
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>), Vetiver (
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic>), Vilamiccam ver (Plectranthus vettiveroides), Santanam (
 <italic>Santalum album</italic>), Pei pudal (
 <italic>Trichosanthes dioica</italic>), Korai kizhangu (
 <italic>Cyperus rotandus</italic>), Chukku (
 <italic>Zingeber officinale</italic>), Milagu (
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic>) and Parpatakam (
 <italic>Mollugo cerviana</italic>) (Kavinilavan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). NKC has been reported to have therapeutic applications such as antiviral, antipyretic, antibacterial, antiulcer, antioxidant, analgesic etc (Jain et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). On the other hand, it has also been stated to act as an immunostimulant and immunomodulant which enhances the host immune system and modulates the defence response that helps to protect the complications of infections (Kamalarajan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Nakkeeran et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ramanathan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Previously, NKC has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of dengue and chikungunya (Anbarasu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mattummal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In fact, Government of Tamil Nadu have taken initiatives in supplying decoction of NKC to patients visiting the primary health care centres and also promoted the drink for prevention and control of morbidity level during outbreak of viral fever (Ramanathan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Owing to their medicinal properties and specifically antiviral potential, the present study aims at investigating the therapeutic efficacy of active components of NKC and natural constituents from other known medicinal plants (
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Anethumsowa</italic>) which are also used as combinations to treat respiratory diseases. Phytomolecules from the components of NKC and the aforementioned medicinal plants against the two major viral targets spike glycoprotein and protease and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the entry point for viral encounter were examined with the prospects of identifying potential drug candidate(s) against COVID19 infection. Thus, ethnomedicines identified from the study through 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches can combat the global health crisis instigated by SARS-CoV-2 (Abdelli et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Elfiky &amp; Azzam, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Elmezayen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Enayatkhani et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Enmozhi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>; Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sarma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sinha et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Unlike modern medicines, the antique herbal remedies do not possess side effects, indeed they establish natural resistance to alleviate the viral infection by boosting the immune system. Thus, the main objective of the study is to identify a potent phytocompound as inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 drug targets from vintage medicinal plants through computational investigations.
