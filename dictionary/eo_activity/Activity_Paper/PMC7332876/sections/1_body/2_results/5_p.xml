<p>Bryonolic acid formed a strong interaction with the receptor binding sites of main protease with a binding energy score of −81.0 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and dock score of −91.63. Bryonolic acid formed two hydrogen bond interactions with Arg188 and Gln189. Further conformational interactions such as carbon hydrogen bond interaction was observed with Ser139 and His163, alkyl interaction with Tyr118, Cys145, His163 and Met49 and pi-alkyl interaction with His41, His163, His172 and Met165 which stabilized the binding of the bryonolic with Mpro. The van der Waals and H-bond interaction energy was −74.25 and −6.71 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Bryonolic acid docked with spike protein reported −80.57, −63.9, −60.37 and −3.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>as docking, binding, H-bond and van der Waals energies, respectively. Key interactions between Bryonolic acid and spike protein includes one conventional hydrogen bond with Tyr28 and pi-alkyl interaction with Phe58. Interaction with ACE2 receptor was found to have a docking score of −80.99, binding energy score of −65.6 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and van der Waals and H-bond interaction score of −54.032 and −11.596 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Energetic contributions to the ligand include conventional hydrogen bonds (four bonds with Glu22, Thr27, Gln89 and Asn 90) and pi-alkyl (Leu29 and Lys94) interactions.
