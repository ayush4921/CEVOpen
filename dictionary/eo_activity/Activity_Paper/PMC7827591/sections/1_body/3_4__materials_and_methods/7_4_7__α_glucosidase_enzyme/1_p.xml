<p>The method for determining α-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory activity has been previously described by Hamid et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with slight modifications. The reaction mixture consisted of a 10 µL sample extract, 50 µL phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 7), 25 µL 4-nitrophenyl α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, 0.01 M substrate in phosphate buffer (pH 7), and 25 µL α-glucosidase enzyme (0.1 U/mL α-glucosidase solution in 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 6). The mixture was added to a 96-well plate, and the plate was agitated slowly for 5 min. After being homogenized, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction process was stopped by adding 100 µL of sodium carbonate. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm in a microplate reader. The following equation was used for the determination of α-glucosidase inhibitory activity according to antioxidant activity.
