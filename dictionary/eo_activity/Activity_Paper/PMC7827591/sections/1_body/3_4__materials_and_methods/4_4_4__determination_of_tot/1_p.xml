<p>The total phenolics content was determined using the method described by Margraf et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with slight modifications. Approximately a 20 µL sample was transferred to a 96-well microplate (Costar
 <sup>®</sup>, Washington, DC, USA), which was followed by the addition of 110 µL of Folin–Ciocalteu and 70 µL sodium carbonate (0.01 M). After vortexing, the sample mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 750 nm. Phenolics content was expressed as gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/g) by using a calibration curve of gallic acid (y = 0.0091x − 0.0123, with R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9982).
