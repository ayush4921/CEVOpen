<p>The flow rate from the delivery system was adjusted at 0.3 mL/min, the autosampler temperature was maintained at 10 °C, and the sample injection volume was 0.5 µL. The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) acetonitrile. A linear gradient elution program was applied as follows: 0–1.5 min (5% B), 1.5–9 min (5–10% B), 9–13 min (10–20% B), 13–17 min (20–28% B), 17–23 min (28–78% B), 23–26 min (70–95% B), 26–29 min (95% B), and 29–32 min (5% B). The total run time was 32 min, with relative abundance 0–100 and MS full-scan type (100–1500) in positive and negative mode.</p>
