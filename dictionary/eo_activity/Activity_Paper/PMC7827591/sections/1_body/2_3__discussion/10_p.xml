<p>Interestingly, from this study, the active compounds are not always derived from the most abundant compounds found in the extract of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species. Other functional groups are also present in the chemical compounds from cycloartane triterpene (curculigosaponin G, H, and I), i.e., hydroxyl groups at the positions C–3 and C–11, and a double bond at C23=C24. It has been pointed out that the double bonds at C24=C25 of the tetracyclic triterpenoids have an essential role as antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitors [
