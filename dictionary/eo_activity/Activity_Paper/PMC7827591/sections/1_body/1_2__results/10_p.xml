<p>The PLS model was made from each spectral/chromatogram data variable (FTIR and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) and the biological activity assay. LV-1 and LV-2 values in the PLS model for antioxidant activity are 92% and 3%, and for α-glucosidase inhibition, they are 90% and 6%, respectively. The negative value of the PLS U score (factor-1) in the x-y relation outliers plot shows a strong contribution of each sample to the antioxidant (A) and α-glucosidase inhibition (B) activities (

 <sup>−1</sup>) and I (1384.795 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) with negative values and regression coefficients (BW) are −7.23 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and −7.90 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, respectively. These peaks indicating the stretching vibrations of the C–O group (OH, COOH) and the bending vibrations of the O–H (phenol) group could have a major contribution to antioxidant activity. Meanwhile, the peaks in the area of O (975.914 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) and N (1024.131 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) with the smallest regression coefficients (BW) −5.91 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and −3.52 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, respectively, indicate the stretching vibrations of the C–O group (trans disubstituent) and the bending vibrations of the C–H (alkenes), as well as the bending vibrations of the C–C group (cyclohexane). The three latter groups might have a major contribution to the inhibition of the α-glucosidase.
