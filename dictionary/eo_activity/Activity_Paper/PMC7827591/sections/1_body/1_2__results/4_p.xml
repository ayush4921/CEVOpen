<p>All samples of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species used in this study showed a specific FTIR spectrum profile, especially in the fingerprint region. The FTIR spectra derived from the ethanol extract of plant parts with the highest phenolic content are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00042">Figure S1</xref>. At 3300 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, the broad absorption bands indicated a stretching vibration from the O–H group. All samples of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species show the broad absorption band at a similar wavenumber. A stretching vibration at 3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was identified as C–H (sp
 <sup>2</sup>), which corresponds to the benzene ring, and a similar band was detected in all samples. However, the intensity of the absorption peak at 3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> (LOBM), leaves of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> (LLSP), and petiole of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> (PLSP) samples was higher than that of the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> (ROBM) and the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> (RLSP) samples. The absorption band at 2800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was related to the stretching vibration of C–H (alkane), and it was only observed in LOBM, LLSP, and PLSP samples. In the area of fingerprint wavenumber (1800–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), only the absorption band in the range of 1152–1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was considered as C–O bending vibration. The absorption band in this range (1152–1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) was detected in all samples, but the rhizomes of both 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species manifested the highest intensity.
