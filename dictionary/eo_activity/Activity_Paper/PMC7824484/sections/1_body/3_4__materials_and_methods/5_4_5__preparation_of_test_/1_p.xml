<p>1 g carbopol was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water at 40–50 °C with 0.2 g propylparaben sodium and 0.5 g methylparaben sodium by stirring. The solution was kept overnight, and the addition of 50 mL of distilled water was done. Stirring was continued with the addition of 10mL of propylene glycol and 5 ml of ethanol. Two to three drops of triethanolamine were added and stirred until the gel was formed at pH 7.0. For the formulation of 5% hydrogel, 5 g of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> n-hexane seed extract was mixed with 95 g of gel, whereas 10% hydrogel was formulated using 10 g of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> n-hexane seed extract and 90 g of gel.
