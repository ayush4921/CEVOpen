<p>In the incision wound model both 5% and 10% hexane hydrogel were compared with control and standard, i.e., 5% povidone-iodine and the tensile breaking strength of both 5% hexane hydrogel (152 g) and 10% hexane hydrogel (156 g) were significantly higher in comparison to control (96 g) and standard (115 g) (
