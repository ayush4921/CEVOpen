<p>Hydrogels offer many advantages which included providing a necessary moist environment to the wound area, also acts as an excellent carrier for the topical application of various substrates and their sole release over some time. With all the information and studies on hydrogel formulation, it is noticeable that the hydrogels can be regarded as a suitable candidate to promote wound healing. In the presented study, we have prepared a hydrogel formulation with 5% and 10% hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> seeds. Consequently, the proper hydrogel spreading would assist in the uniform administration of the gel to the skin. Additionally, based on our results, our formulated herbal gel contributed to a faster wound healing compared to the negative control group. Various studies on the formulation of hydrogel using hexane extracted also supported our choice of study [
