<p id="p0020">Besides TB, there are other Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens that have acquired noxious drug resistance. These pathogens are often responsible for the hospital- and community-acquired infections including and not limited to methicillin-resistant

 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> among others [

Such emerging drug-resistant pathogenic strains are usually not sensitive to the first-line of antimicrobial therapy, thus forcing the use of a second- and third-line treatment option. Besides narrowing the available treatment options, the adoption of second- and third-line classes of drugs is often associated with severe adverse effects [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This further highlights the need for concerted effort in prospecting for novel formulations that are active against emerging, re-emerging, and drug-resistant pathogenic strain.
