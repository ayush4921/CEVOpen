<p id="p0085">Even though the crude extract concentrations were in the range of 10
 <sup>4</sup> times higher than the standard antibiotic controls, methanolic crude extract showed a remarkable antitubercular activity, that compared with the activity of the positive control. Since the active components in the crude extract could have comprised only a fraction of the total extract used, we reasoned that further purification would allow enrichment of active molecules in extract fractions. Therefore, we hypothesized that extract solvent fractionation would result in enhanced activity, and possibly at a lower concentration.
