<p id="p0145">The findings from this work demonstrate that 
 <italic>A.Â pluriseta</italic> root extract fractions have robust selective antitubercular activity. The extract fractions, especially the ethyl acetate and methanolic fraction, provide a potential source of novel, antitubercular lead candidate(s). GC-MS analysis revealed an abundance of fatty acid esters, which we strongly associated with demonstrated antitubercular activity. Further work is required to isolate pure compounds, test their specific molecular targets, with a view of deciphering the mode(s) of action.
