<p id="p0040">The root samples were mechanically size-reduced, air-dried in the dark at 23 ± 2 °C to a constant weight, then ground into a fine powder using an electric miller (Retsch SR 200, Haan, Germany). In order to mimic the traditional preparation method, a portion of the sample powder (50 g) was subjected to cold extraction in distilled water with occasional shaking, after which the extract was lyophilized. A similar portion was macerated twice in 200 mL methanol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 48 h, pooled and filtered using Whatmann 1 filter paper. Excess methanol was evaporated from the filtrate using a rotor evaporator (Laborota 4000 efficient, Heidolph, Germany) and the extract stored at -20 °C until use. Fractionation of the 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> extract was performed using organic solvents of increasing polarity. Fifty grams of root powder was macerated in 200 mL of petro ether with intermittent shaking for 48 h. Subsequently, the material was filtered through Whatman number-1 filter paper. The residue was additionally re-extracted using the same fresh solvent for 48 h, and after that, the two filtrates pooled together. The resulting marc was air-dried and further extracted with dichloromethane solvent followed by ethyl acetate, and methanol solvent, using the same procedure carried out for petroleum ether. Organic crude extract and solvent fractions were concentrated and reconstituted into appropriate stock solution with 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) but diluted appropriately so that the final DMSO in the test sample is 1% DMSO. Water crude extract was reconstituted in physiological saline, which served as its negative control.
