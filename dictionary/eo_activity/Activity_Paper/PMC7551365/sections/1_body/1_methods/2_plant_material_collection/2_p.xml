<p id="p0035">We used the ethnopharmacological approach to identify the plant used in this study. The information on its herbal use and preparation among the Mbeere community of Embu County, Kenya, was gleaned from community herbal practitioners and further confirmed from documentation by Riley and Brokensha (1988) in 
 <italic>The Mbeere in Kenya (ii), Botanical identity and use</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We collected the plant root materials in an open community field. The plant is not among the endangered species, and therefore no prior permission was sought before sample collection. The sampling was carried out within 0°46′27.0″S 37°40′54.9″E; -0.774156, 37.681908 of GPS co-ordinates. A botanist authenticated plant sample identity at Egerton University, Kenya, where voucher specimen number NSN2 was given and deposited.
