<p id="p0050">MTB was revived in Lowenstein Jensen slants under previously adopted standard conditions [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and later subjected to BACTEC MGIT 960 system (BD Biosciences, New York, USA) for antitubercular activity assays [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. BACTEC MGIT 960 system is a fully automated, high volume, a non-radiometric instrument that undertakes continuous monitoring of culture growth. Growth supplement (0.8 mL) containing a combination of oleic acid, dextrose, bovine albumin, and catalase was added to five 7 mL BBL™ MGIT™ tubes labeled GC (growth control), STR (streptomycin), INH (isoniazid), RIF (rifampicin), EMB (ethambutol) to provide essential substrates for the rapid growth of MTB. MTB suspension in 0.1 mL Middlebrook 7H9 broth adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard with 10 mL sterile physiological saline was aseptically transferred into each BBL™ MGIT™ tube and incubated at 37 °C. One hundred microliters of BBL™ MGIT™ SIRE (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol) prepared aseptically following the manufacturers' instructions were added into corresponding labeled BBL™ MGIT™ tube followed by addition of 0.5 mL of 1% MTB suspension. Streptomycin at 1.0 μg/mL, rifampicin at 1.0 μg/mL, ethambutol at 5.0 μg/mL, and isoniazid at 0.1 μg/mL were used as the positive controls whereas 1% DMSO (for solvent extract, and solvent extract fractions), and sterile physiological saline (for water extract) were used as negative controls. The protocol was repeated using crude extracts at 1.0 g/mL (for screening purposes) in place of SIRE and solvent fractions tested at concentrations ranging from 50 to 6.25 μg/mL for petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and methanol, and 25 to 3.125 μg/mL for ethyl acetate to determine the MTB minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
