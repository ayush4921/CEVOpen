Briefly, 50 μL of varying fraction concentrations (3.9–500 μg/mL petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and methanol; 1.95–250 μg/mL ethyl acetate) were added into 100 μL of nutrient broth held in a sterile 96-well plate followed by addition of 50 μL test organisms adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard. All concentrations were tested in triplicates at 37 °C for 24 h. A negative control containing 1% DMSO in nutrient broth was included in column 11, while column 12 checked the capacity of the media to support the growth of the test organism. In order to evaluate the microbial growth in each well, 40 μL of 0.2 mg/mL 
 <italic>p</italic>-iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT, Sigma) were added and incubated for 30 min. Formation of a pink-red color depicted growth while persistent clear coloration denoted growth inhibition. The lowest solvent fraction concentration that exhibited color change was considered as the MIC. MMC was determined by aseptically streaking a loopful of broth from wells that exhibited no color change onto sterile nutrient agar and SDA for bacteria and fungi, respectively, and thereafter incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration that exhibited no growth was considered as the MMC [
