<p id="p0140">Additionally, using GC-MS, we identified two abundant fatty acid alkyl esters in methanolic solvent extract fraction; 2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester-hexadecanoic acid (2-palmitoylglycerol) and 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester-octadecanoic acid (glyceryl monostearate); (
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> and Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We speculate that these fatty acid alkyl esters are associated with the observed bioactivity of this extract fraction. In fact, previous studies have reported antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities of naturally occurring and synthetic fatty acid alkyl esters [

 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Although the relationship between structure and antimicrobial activity of various fatty acids and their ester derivatives remains elusive, it is speculated that the inhibitory effect is greatly influenced by the number and presence of double bonds [
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Mechanistically, fatty acids and their ester derivatives (FAED) act by interfering with the vital fatty acid synthase-I (FASI)- and FASIII-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Furthermore, FAED and long-chain alkanes, by acting as exogenous mimics of microbial cell wall and membrane fatty acid derivatives, have been suggested to interfere with the cell membrane and wall biochemistry thus inducing an antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it is necessary to isolate individual pure compounds and test their activity individually and/or in combination. Taken together, we show that
