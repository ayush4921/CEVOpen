<p>This powerful activity would be related to high phenolic compounds of this fraction after loading on the column. These compounds were introduced as potent XO inhibitors. There have not been reported XO inhibition activities of this fraction yet. Wedler et al. showed that polyphenol-enriched fraction was a potent tyrosinase inhibitor. As this enzyme has a role in oxidative stress and oxidative damages, new XO inhibitors, particularly natural inhibitors, are really considerable in recent research studies [
