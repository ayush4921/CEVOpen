<p>Nowadays, there is a great demand on consumption of antioxidant as chemopreventive agents, so isolation and detection of potent antioxidant is the first step to produce new supplements. So, in the next step, it is necessary to develop and apply chemical techniques to characterize the chemical structure of compounds which are responsible of these biological effects. This step is our research limitation, but it can be a really important approach for valorization of rose waste since this characterization can reveal the potential of rose wastes which is still unexploited.</p>
