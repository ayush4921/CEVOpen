<p>The alpha-amylase assay of the tested compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>) was conducted according to the standard method with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a 96-well plate, the reaction mixture containing 50 μL of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH = 6.8), 10 μL alpha-amylase (2 U/mL), 20 μL of varying concentrations of sample (100–31.2 μg/mL), and standard. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C before the addition of 1% soluble starch (10 μL) and further incubated for another 30 min. A color reagent DNS (100 μL) was added and boiled at 95 °C for 15 min. The change in color was read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a multiplate reader. The results are the mean of three independent studies and calculated as percentage inhibition as stated below:
 <disp-formula>Percentage inhibitory activity (%) = (1 − A/B) × 100</disp-formula> where, A is the absorbance in the presence of test substance, and B is the absorbance in the presence of phosphate buffer (control).
