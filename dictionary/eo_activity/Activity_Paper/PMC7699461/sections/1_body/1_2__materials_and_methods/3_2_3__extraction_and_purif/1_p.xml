<p>The fresh plant material (855.1 g) of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> was grounded and extracted with 2.5 L of methanol at ambient temperature (25 °C) for 48 h. The methanol extract was filtered and then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C to produce 64.62 g (5.6%). The crude extract (62 g) was subjected to a silica gel column (25 × 18 cm) and eluted using a gradient of hexane and ethyl acetate in order of raising polarity. Sixty-two fractions were collected and combined based on their thin layer chromatography (TLC) similarities to produce 17 main fractions labeled I–XVII.
