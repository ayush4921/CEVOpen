<p>The method of Cao and Prior (1998) was employed to measure oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and as reported in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The method measures the scavenging potential of compounds against the decomposition of peroxyl radical of 2,2-azobis (2-amino-propane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) as peroxyradical (ORAC 
 <sub>ROO</sub>
 <sup>•</sup>). The antioxidant capacity of a compound is a measure of the fading fluorescence of a probe (fluorescein) using the area under the curve (AUC) plot in relation to a control blank. The florescence of the probe was programmed to be measured at every two minutes for 2 h after the addition of AAPH at the excitation wavelength and emission set at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The ORAC results were estimated following a regression equation (Y = a + bX + Cx
 <sup>2</sup>) between Trolox concentration (Y in μM) and the net area under the fluorescence decay curve (X). ORAC values were expressed as μM Trolox equivalent (TE)/mg of test sample.
