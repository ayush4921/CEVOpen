<p>Validation of docking protocol accuracy was done by redocking the co-crystallized ligand back into the binding site of alpha-glucosidase. Docking methodology was found to be reliable as the re-docked pose overlapped almost totally with the experimental orientation. This indicates that AutoDock Vina on PyRx re-docked the co-crystallized ligand, with a very high accuracy, back into the binding pocket of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase.</p>
