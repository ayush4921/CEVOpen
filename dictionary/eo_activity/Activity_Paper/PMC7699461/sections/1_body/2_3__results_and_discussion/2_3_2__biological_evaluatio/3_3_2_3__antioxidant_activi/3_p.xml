<p>The antioxidant activity of the isolated compounds of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> was investigated by assessing their FRAP, TEAC, and ORAC activities. The results demonstrated excellent antioxidant activity for 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>1,</bold> and 
 <bold>3,</bold> respectively, with ORAC (25.79 ± 0.01; 23.96 ± 0.01; 23.94 ± 0.02) mM TE/g; 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> as FRAP (3.92 ± 0.002; 1.52 ± 0.002) mM AAE/g; and 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> as TEAC (3.19 ± 0.003; 2.06 ± 0.003) mM TE/g. The crude extract of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> exhibited moderate antioxidant activity when tested on ORAC (4.45 ± 0.01 mM TE/g), TEAC (723.9 ± 6.4 mM TE/g), and FRAP (393.7 ± 2.3 mM AAE/g) as showed in

The antioxidant prowess of the isolated compounds are comparable with the standard (EGCG) used in this study with FRAP (7.53 ± 0.005 mM AAE/g), TEAC (4.15 ± 0.02 mM TE/g), and ORAC (3.98 ± 0.00 mM TE/g). Therefore, the activity of 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>1</bold> is associated to the presence of the ortho-dihydroxyl groups located on the aromatic ring, serving as hydrogen atom transferring agent to peroxyl radicals, whereby, stabilizing/neutralizing them and inducing to a stable radical [

Our findings also indicated that the higher the number of hydroxyl groups in these phenolic compounds, the higher the antioxidant activity is. The highest bio-activity demonstrated by rosmanol can then be justified by the fact that it contains three free hydroxyl groups compared to carnosol that has only two. Rosmanol and 7-methoxyl rosmanol share the same chemical structure framework, but the difference in the activity exhibited should be explain by the fact that the substitution of the hydroxyl group in 7-methoxyl rosmanol might be responsible of the decrease of the activity observed. The structure–activity relationship (SAR) displayed that the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C-7 by the methoxyl group is directly linked to the bioactivity demonstrated. Although, the antioxidant capacity of carnosol is high because of the highly stressed lactone ring, which might be opened during the process of chemical reaction, leading to a rise in conjugation and formation of 
 <italic>p</italic>-quininoidal structure. In 7-methoxyrosmanol, antioxidant activity is less compared to that in carnosol and rosmanol, possibly due to the presence of a methoxyl group at position C-7, which is responsible for the hydrophobicity characteristic in the compounds.
