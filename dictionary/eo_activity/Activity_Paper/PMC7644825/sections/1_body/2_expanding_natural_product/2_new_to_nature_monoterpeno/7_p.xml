<p>Overall, the impressive array of pharmaceutical properties and the availability of a well-studied class of halogenases targeting direct precursors has provided the motivation and the means for more extensive new-to-nature integration of halogens into MIAs, relative to other plant medicinal alkaloids. The first production of an unnatural MIA in yeast has also already been reportedâ€”
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenworth et al. (2015)</xref> have reported semi-synthesis of 10-hydroxystrictosidine from yeast-derived 5-hydroxytryptamine and chemically synthesized secologanin. The principle challenge of achieving this was to engineer production of sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor for the mono-oxygenase activity yielding 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is not naturally produced in

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenworth et al., 2015</xref>). This highlights the fact that a major challenge when microbially refactoring plant biosynthetic pathways is still often producing sufficient amounts of non-native cofactors or building blocks. A number of other significant challenges also remain, not least the enduringly low yields of microbially refactored plant biosynthetic pathways and the lack of structural information relating to enzymes downstream of strictosidine. It will therefore be some time before halogenated MIAs can be microbially produced at scale. A more attainable goal will be to produce sufficient quantities for bioactivity testing, and this would be a significant step toward unlocking the derivative space surrounding these fascinating compounds.
