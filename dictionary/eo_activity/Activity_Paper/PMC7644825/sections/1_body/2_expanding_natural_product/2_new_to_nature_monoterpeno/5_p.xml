<p>In addition to the ever-expanding repertoire of halogenase substrate specificities, a recent study elegantly demonstrated that these halogenases can be used in combination with a tryptophanase for biosynthesis of a halogenated indole (

 <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived tryptophanase (TnaA) to convert this into a halogenated indole, which could then be converted, with varying efficiencies, to chloro-indican
