<p>In parallel to these studies, a number of engineering efforts to expand substrate and product promiscuity of MIA enzymes have been undertaken. This is significant because it means that many of individual parts are already defined and ready to be combinatorially tested in microbes. Engineering to improve MIA pathway turnover of substrate analogs was first reported more than 10 years ago with the rational engineering of strictosidine synthase, through introduction of point mutations, to accept analogs of secologanin with methyl ester and vinyl positions (

 <italic>R. serpentina</italic> strictosidine synthase homolog was found to improve promiscuity for tryptamines with substitutions at positions 5 and 6 of the indole ring, which the wildtype enzyme does not readily accept (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Loris et al., 2007</xref>). Following this, two further 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> strictosidine synthase homolog mutants (V214M and F232L) were designed to improve promiscuity for tryptamine derivatives, and the authors subsequently observed evidence of previously unobserved brominated MIAs (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt et al., 2007</xref>). Significantly, this study also noted that the expense of purchasing chemically synthesized brominated strictosidine analogs limited the scope of the study. This expense, contrasted with the utility of chlorine and bromine in targeting site-specific cross-coupling reactions and tryptophan’s ubiquity as a synthetic building block, has driven significant interest in the more cost effective semi-synthesis or 
 <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of halogenated tryptophan using tryptophan halogenases (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Frese and Sewald, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Latham et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fejzagić et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Both of these approaches are viable for the more efficient production of halogenated variants of MIAs and MIA precursors. For example, a recently identified promiscuous tryptophan synthase is able to combine halogenated indole with serine to yield enantiopure samples of fluorinated, chlorinated, brominated and iodinated tryptophan (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). This enzyme could facilitate the introduction of halogens into the MIA pathway by feeding halogenated indole. Due to its lack of chirality, halogenated indole is significantly cheaper to synthesize than halogenated tryptophan and is therefore a far more attractive feedstock. This consideration of different feedstocks is particularly relevant for the introduction of fluorine into alkaloid scaffolds because only one, relatively poor, enzyme has been identified as being able to catalyze fluorination (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">O’Hagan and Deng, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, the introduction of bacterial tryptophan halogenases that target the indole ring of tryptophan can facilitate 
 <italic>de novo</italic> production of chlorinated and brominated MIAs.
