<p>The promiscuity of early-stage BIA pathway enzymes was also recently investigated in one pot,

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). This study identified a promiscuous tyrosine decarboxylase that accepted fluorinated, chlorinated, brominated and iodinated tyrosine analogs and observed production of six non-natural BIAs, including a fluorinated analog of (S)-norcoclaurine, when this enzyme was included in the cascade. The halogenated tyrosine used in this study was purchased commercially. However, stereoselective enzymatic synthesis of fluorinated tyrosine analogs has been reported from fluoro-phenols, which are non-chiral and significantly cheaper, using tyrosine-phenol lyases (
