<p>However, despite considerable interest and a number of engineering studies targeting individual enzymes (

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>), there has yet to be a systematic study aimed at optimizing pathway production of new-to-nature analogs of plant medicinal alkaloids. The complex chemistries of natural products that make halogenation so useful for targeting cross-coupling reactions (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chung and Vanderwal, 2016</xref>). Where it is possible chemically, this requires expensive catalysts (palladium) and elemental halogen, which is both toxic and energetically expensive to produce (
