<p>Of the numerous halogenases, the flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) have been a focus for biotechnologists, due to their high substrate- and regio-specificity, and their ability to function independently of carrier proteins that bind the substrate. A subgroup of FDHs targeting the indole moiety of tryptophan are the most well studied group of FDHs, due to the prevalence of indole as a building block in both biology and synthetic chemistry (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dhuguru and Skouta, 2020</xref>). Mechanistically, these tryptophan halogenases are similar to haem-dependent haloperoxidases and vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases in that they form a hypohalous acid (HOX) intermediate. However, unlike these other halogenases, the tryptophan FDHs do not release the HOX intermediate into solution. Instead, the HOX molecule moves through a 10 Å internal tunnel to the active site, where the halide is transferred, via a conserved lysine (

Thus, this mechanism avoids the spurious halogenation associated with free HOX and achieves specific halogenation in a single step, compared to the 4–5 steps required for synthetic production of halogenated tryptophan. Indole moiety-targeting FDHs halogenating positions 5, 6 and 7 of the indole ring have been identified (

Other common alkaloid building blocks also lack specific halogenases. However, more flavin-dependent halogenases continue to be discovered and characterized (
