<p>The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, as the largest and highest plateau on Earth, possesses unique climate characteristics: alpine hypoxia, less precipitation, low humidity, osmotic stress and high incident radiation, which involves the plants and soil on the plateau in extreme harsh environmental conditions such as low temperature, anoxygenous, prolonged UV radiation and oligotrophic (

Accordingly, the actinomycetes living in it may represent novel species and develop unique physiological adaption mechanism, ultimately yield bioactive compounds. However, the cultivable soil actinomycetes in this unique habitat remain relatively unexplored except for the preliminary survey on the

Thus, we had isolated and characterized actinomycetes from near-root soils of different plant communities, which distributed in two geographically diverse alpine habitats along an altitudinal gradient (2200 – 4200 m at the Laohu Ditch site; 5018 – 5130 m at the Gaize County area) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, aiming to explore the phylogenetic and physiological diversity of the cultivable actinomycetes.
