<p>Moreover, the physiological heterogeneity of some 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates was detected on the Tibetan Plateau. For example, 13.7% of the total 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates related to 
 <italic>S. cavourensis</italic> frequently occurring at different plant communities across five altitudes on the Laohu Ditch, and 32% of the total isolates in the Gaize County area affiliated with 
 <italic>S. griseus</italic> across four sites, exhibited distinct physiological capabilities. Most notably, with the same taxonomy according to the 16S rDNA sequences, isolate QZGYEb4 from 5020 m on the Gaize County area showed diverse antimicrobial activity and phenotypic traits from its counterpart QLS36 from 2200 m on the Laohu Ditch. The study of marine actinomycetes also found that though nearly or fully identical 16S rDNA sequences to known terrestrial organisms, the actinomycetes still have signs of adaption to their marine environment (
