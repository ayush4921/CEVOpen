<p>It has been demonstrated that actinomycetes in extreme environments are capable of yielding antagonistic bioactive compounds (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sivalingam et al., 2019</xref>). Twenty nine actinomycetes from the Laohu Ditch and thirteen from the Gaize County area, respectively, exhibiting antimicrobial activity against four kinds of pathogenic microorganisms, were all screened from

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barakate et al. (2002)</xref> presented that 14 and 68% of the 131 streptomycetes from plant rhizospheric soils showed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, respectively. Several researchers had reported antimicrobial activity of actinomycetes against various pathogenic microorganisms from other unique habitats. Thirty nine actinomycetes recovered from the Antarctic soils, of which, fifteen displayed antagonistic activity against clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (
