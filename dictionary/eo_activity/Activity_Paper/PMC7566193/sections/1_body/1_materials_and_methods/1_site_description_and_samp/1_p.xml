<p>The Laohu Ditch, located in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, is characterized by distinct vertical distribution of plant communities, from desert and desertification grassland (2200 m), mountain grassland (2800 m), alpine bushwood (3350 m), alpine meadow (3800 m), to alpine cold-desert (4200 m). The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranged from 73.3 mm (2200 m) to 279.4 mm (4200 m), and the mean annual temperature (MAT) was from 8.1°C (2200 m) to – 5.3°C (4200 m) (offered by Qilian Mountains Station, State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences). The area of Gaize County underlain by permafrost in the central Tibetan Plateau, is distinguished by its high elevation (&gt;5000 m) and unique plant communities adapting to this low temperature, anoxia and strong UV habitats. The MAT in the area of Gaize sampling sites was approximately 0°C with monthly mean temperature - 12.1°C in January and 12.8°C in July, and the MAP was approximately 150 mm year
