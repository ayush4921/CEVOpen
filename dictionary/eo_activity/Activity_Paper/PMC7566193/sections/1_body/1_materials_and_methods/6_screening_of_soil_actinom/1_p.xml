<p>All the 128 soil actinomycetes were examined qualitatively for the production of organic acid, H
 <sub>2</sub>S and extracellular enzymes including lipase 1, lipase 2, and lipase 3, amylase, protease, urease, catalase. Each isolate was inoculated on the center of the respective substrates such as tween 20 (lipase 1), tween 40 (lipase 2), tween 80 (lipase 3), starch (amylase), gelatin (protease) amended agar plates separately and incubated for 7â€“14 days at room temperature, the plates directly detected by clearing zones around the colonies were regarded as positive for enzyme activity (
