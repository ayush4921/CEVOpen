<p>For further phylogenetic analysis, the sequenced 16S rDNA of the 128 isolates were matched with those in a public database using the EzBioCloud tool, and the nearest representative gene sequences of related type strains were downloaded then aligned with the isolated sequences using Clustal W program. Phylogenetic trees of the isolates were constructed by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tamura and Nei, 1993</xref>) with bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>) performed in the MEGA X package, and then the trees were edited by Evolview
