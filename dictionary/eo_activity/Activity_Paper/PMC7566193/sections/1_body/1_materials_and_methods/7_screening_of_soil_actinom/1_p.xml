<p>All the 128 soil actinomycete isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity by agar overlay method as described by 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anand et al. (2006)</xref> with minor adjustment. Spore suspensions of actinomycetes were inoculated on Gao’s No. 1 medium and cultured at 20°C ± 1 for 7 days, then overlaid with 5 ml of soft nutrient agar (0.6% agar) containing 500 μL of overnight growing culture of the tested microorganisms, including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922 representing Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC25923 representing Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC66415 representing yeast-like fungi and a clinical isolated 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain representing freshly pathogenic multi-resistant bacterial strain. The overlaid plates were then incubated at 28°C for 24 h and the clear inhibition zone around each isolate was recorded as positive for antimicrobial activity (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh and Mathivanan, 2009</xref>). Plates with the same medium simultaneously inoculated with the tested human pathogens but without actinomycete isolates were maintained for controls.
