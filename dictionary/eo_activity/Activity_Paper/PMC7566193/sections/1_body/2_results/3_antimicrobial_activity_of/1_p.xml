<p>The antimicrobial activity varied among the actinomycetes as shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Among 78 actinomycete isolates from the Laohu Ditch, 29 isolates (37.2%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against the human pathogens. Of which, 2, 19, 14, 1 isolates demonstrated antimicrobial activity against

 <italic>coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic>, and

 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, respectively. In addition, 7 isolates showed antimicrobial activity against two of the four human pathogens. And the 29 antagonistic actinomycetes were all screened from 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, they were widely spread in distinct phylogenetic clusters from 12 plant communities at different altitudes. Noticeably, 51.4% of the tested isolates (35 in total) from near-root soils of two medicinal plants (
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. and 
 <italic>R. quadrifida</italic> Fisch. &amp; C.A. Mey) demonstrated antimicrobial activity, which comprised 62% of the total antagonistic isolates.
