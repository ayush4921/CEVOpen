<p>Among 50 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates from the Gaize County area, more than half of the isolates produced catalase, lipase 2, urease, protease, H
 <sub>2</sub>S. Amylase, lipase 3, lipase 1, pigment and organic acid producing isolates accounted for 46, 46, 24, 28, and 30% of the total isolates, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> organic acid and lipase 1 producing isolates occurred across four plant communities except for 
 <italic>Stipa purpurea</italic> Griseb. at 5020 m and 
 <italic>Kobresia pygmaea</italic> C.B. Clarke at 5100 m, respectively. The other eight were found in all of the five plant communities, with discrepancy in proportion and variety.
