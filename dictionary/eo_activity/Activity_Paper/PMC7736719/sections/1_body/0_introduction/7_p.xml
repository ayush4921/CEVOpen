Based on the background, the aim of this study was to analyze the information on medicinal plants used by the traditional healers in Papua Island based on the results of RISTOJA, especially in malaria treatment. This information is expected to be further explored and developed to bring better innovation in malaria drugs, which would be beneficial in overcoming the problems with disease resistance.
