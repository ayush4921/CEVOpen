  <italic>Crassocephalum crepidioides</italic> (Benth.) S. Moore. has been used to treat small wounds by minority people in Lam Dong, Vietnam. However, there has been no scientific evidences about its wound healing activity. This study is aimed at evaluating the wound healing activity of 
  <italic>Crassocephalum crepidioides</italic> hydroethanolic extract via its antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities and healing capability on a mouse excision wound model. 
  <italic>Crassocephalum crepidioides</italic> hydroethanolic extract (CCLE) at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day reduced the wound closure time about 3.5 days, compared to vehicle treatment. The granulation tissue on day 7 after surgery from the treated group showed a 2.8-fold decrease in the density of inflammatory cells, 1.9-fold increase in the fibroblast density, and a higher number of blood vessels. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA expression level of NF-
  <italic>κ</italic>B1 and TNF-
  <italic>α</italic> mRNA in CCLE-treated wounds decreased by 4.6 and 3.3 times, respectively, while TGF-
  <italic>β</italic>1 and VEGF were found to increase by 3.3 and 2.4 times, respectively. Our experimental data provided proofs of 
  <italic>Crassocephalum crepidioides</italic> leaf wound healing activity due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, wound contraction, and angiogenesis effects.
