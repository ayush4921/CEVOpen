<p>Male Albino Swiss mice (
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) were purchased from Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute, Vietnam. Mice were kept in laboratory conditions for a week (25°C, with 12 hours of light–dark cycle) and have free access to water and food during the experiment process. The mice (weighing 25 ± 2) were anaesthetized with ketamine (Troy Laboratories) 80 mg/kg and xylazine (Troy Laboratories) 10 mg/kg. To create a wound, the dorsal surface was shaved and then cleaned with ethanol 70%. The excision wound (12 mm: diameter) was made with a biopsy punch (Medax). The mice were divided into 3 groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Each mouse was topically treated everyday with 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of CCLE 50 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, dissolved in DMSO 5%, Tween 20 5% mixture, which is, respectively, equivalent to 50 mg/kg/day (mg/kg/d) and 10 mg/kg/d of CCLE. In the control group, each mouse was treated with 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMSO 5% and Tween 20 5% mixture in the same way. Photos were taken on the days 4, 8, and 12 after surgery. The wound area was measured by ImageJ 1.50b software. The wound closure rate was calculated by the following formula [
