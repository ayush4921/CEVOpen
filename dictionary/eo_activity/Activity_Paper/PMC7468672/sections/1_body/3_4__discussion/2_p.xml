<p>CCLE showed anti-inflammation in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay on macrophage cell line RAW 246.7 induced with LPS. It also reduced the density of inflammatory cells in granulation tissues in 7-day-old wounds, combined with a reduced mRNA expression level of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1. NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> are important markers for the inflammation level [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is an important proinflammatory cytokine. NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1 was also reported to be in a direct ratio to the inflammatory level in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A high level of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> has been reported to inhibit the wound reepithelialization and the formation of myofibroblast and 
 <italic>α</italic>-smooth muscle actin (
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Overinflammation may lead to a delay or failure to heal and may turn into a chronic wound [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The decrease in the inflammatory level at the middle and late stages, as well as the decrease of the inflammatory markers, including TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B1, has been widely considered as a good signal of the healing process [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results suggested that CCLE might improve the wound healing process via its anti-inflammatory activity. Akinpelu et al. (2019) have proven that water extracts of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves had anti-inflammation activity via red blood cell membrane stabilization [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Bello et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also found that methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> had anti-inflammatory activity by lipoxygenase inhibition.
