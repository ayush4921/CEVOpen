<p>Sedentary beekeeping is the kind of beekeeping practiced by a traditional beekeeper or agri-beekeeper who leaves his hives in the same place and does not move them throughout the year. The bee's harvest radius in this type of beekeeping does not exceed 2-3 kilometers. This limits the production of the apiary. On the other hand, pastoral or transhumant beekeeping aims to move hives from site to site from 50 km to 500 km depending on the rate of flowering in melliferous regions [

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) varies according to the species; it spreads over the whole year from January until December. All beekeepers interviewees in this study are professional, and these conditions favor transhumance practices for them.
