<p>In order to facilitate data collection for this study, 132 beekeepers were interviewed using a questionnaire focused on information about the beekeeper: gender, education level, age group, and duration of experience; information on the apiary: the number of hives, the amount of honey produced annually/hive, and other apicultural products provided by each beekeeper, as well as the prefecture or the province in the region Fez-Meknes preferred by the beekeeper for installing their apiary; and information on the honey plants that exist in each prefecture and province of the Fez-Meknes region: we asked beekeepers to give us a list of melliferous plants. Thus, we collected data on the information about the apicultural importance of each plant listed. The vernacular name of the plants was given by the beekeepers, and the scientific name was identified following Bellakhdar and Aafi et al. [
