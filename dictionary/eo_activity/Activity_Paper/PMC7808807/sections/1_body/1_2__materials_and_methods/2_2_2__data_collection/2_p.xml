<p>Registration of all plant species observed by beekeepers was carried out throughout the year in the nine prefectures and provinces represented by the Fez-Meknes region. Each source has been identified by its vernacular name, scientific name, and botanical family. The average date of the flowering period of each plant and the apicultural value as a source of nectar and/or pollen, resin, and honeydew were recorded.</p>
