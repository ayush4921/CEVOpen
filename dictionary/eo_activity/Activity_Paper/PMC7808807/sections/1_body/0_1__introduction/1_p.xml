In order to cover its nutritional and preventive needs, the bee collects substances including nectar, pollen, oil, and resin from plants that are highly attractive to them and also exudates of plant-sucking insects to produce honeydew where the hive products are reflected through the quantity and quality of the pollinated plants. These melliferous plants vary from one area to another depending on the biotic, climatic, and ecological factors [
