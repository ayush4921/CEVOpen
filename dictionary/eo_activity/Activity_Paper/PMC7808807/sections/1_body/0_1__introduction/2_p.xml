<p>Bees search for melliferous plants not only in forests, grasslands, ruderal, and marshy vegetation but also in agrophytocenoses, such as orchards, vineyards, rapeseed, sunflower, and alfalfa crops, or in medicinal plant plantations and aromatics [

As pollinators, bees are useful as samplers of the environment in which they are conserved and have been used as bioindicators of ecosystem's health. Bees in search of food can cover up to eight kilometers of radii for pollen, nectar, and resinous plant substances [

To establish a detailed mapping of melliferous plants in Fez-Meknes, we conducted a questionnaire for professional beekeepers that set up their hives in the prefectures and provinces of the region. The objective of this study is to determine the richness of the Fez-Meknes region in melliferous plants and to highlight the state of beekeeping favoring the development and evolution of the bee sector.
