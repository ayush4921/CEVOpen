However, cross-cultural medicinal ethnobotany and patterns of plant knowledge have not yet been investigated in the region. Doing so could highlight the salient medicinal plant species and show the variations between communities. This study aimed to determine and discuss the similarities and differences of medicinal ethnobotany among people living in highland pastures on both sides of the Georgia-Turkey border.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">During the 2017 and 2018 summer transhumance period, 119 participants (74 in Turkey, 45 in Georgia) were interviewed with semi-structured questions. The data was structured in use-reports (URs) following the ICPC classification. Cultural Importance (CI) Index, informant consensus factor (FIC), shared/separate species-use combinations, as well as literature data were used for comparing medicinal ethnobotany of the communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">One thousand five hundred six UR for 152 native wild plant species were documented. More than half of the species are in common on both sides of the border. Out of 817 species-use combinations, only 9% of the use incidences are shared between communities across the border. Around 66% of these reports had not been previously mentioned specifically in the compared literature. Only 33 species have similar use reports in both countries, most important of which are <italic>Plantago major</italic>, <italic>Urtica dioica</italic>, <italic>Picea orientalis</italic>, <italic>Anthemis</italic> spp., <italic>Sambucus ebulus</italic>, <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, <italic>Helichrysum rubicundum</italic>, <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic>, <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> var. <italic>hamata</italic>, <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>, <italic>Tussilago farfara</italic>, <italic>Helichrysum plicatum</italic>, <italic>Rumex crispus</italic>, <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic>, and&#x000a0;<italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>. More than half of species reported in each country were found to have more than one part of the plant valued for medicinal use. The most common way of using plants medicinally in both countries is drinking the water infusion of aerial parts with flowers. Based on CI index value, two-thirds of the salient 15 genera in both countries have use reports in at least seven medicinal use categories. While the most cited category with highest FIC is digestive in Georgia, it is skin category in Turkey. Patterns of medicinal plant knowledge among studied communities appear to be connected with more than one cultural factor, in particular ethnolinguistic diversity, cultural background, and access to multilingual written folk and scientific literature, or probably a combination of various factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Considering the regions&#x02019; floral similarity, common historical-cultural contact, and similar livelihood strategies of the communities, shared ethnomedicinal knowledge across the Georgia-Turkey border is quite low. Even though the impacts of accessing multilingual folk and scientific literature are likely to be significant, the factors that shape the medicinal plant knowledge patterns of the communities are shown to be variable among species, needing further research into intracultural diversity and socio-economical conditions, as well as the political history across the border.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medicinal ethnobotany</kwd><kwd>The Caucasus</kwd><kwd>Medicinal plants</kwd><kwd>Transhumant people</kwd><kwd>Cross cultural research</kwd><kwd>Border ethnobotany</kwd><kwd>Georgia</kwd><kwd>Turkey</kwd><kwd>Biocultural conservation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ilia State University</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011099</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par9">The mountains of the Western Lesser Caucasus are part of the Caucasus Hotspot, one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This hotspot harbors around 7000 vascular plant species, around 25% of which are endemic to the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, it is known to be a home to high linguistic, genetic, and ethnic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, various travelers and researchers have been impressed by the diversity of language and ethnicity of the region, calling here &#x0201c;the mountain of tongues&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Despite this, the lack of information on plant resources in ethnographic studies in particular has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well the lack of studies on the relationship between mountains, biodiversity, and cultural diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More effort to document and protect traditional knowledge and practices in mountainous areas has been called for, to sustain continued social-ecological health and wellbeing of humanity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Recent studies conducted in Georgia (Sakartvelo) reveal a noteworthy ethnobotanical knowledge of people living in various regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

However, apart from a number of ethnobotanical studies published in certain parts of the Western Lesser Caucasus region, little ethnobotanical knowledge has yet been systematically documented in the mountains around Turkey-Georgia border. For instance in Turkey, two general surveys conducted in some parts of Artvin province report the medicinal ethnobotany of 20 plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A recent survey conducted in a national park in Artvin also states medicinal knowledge of 37 plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The neighboring province of Ardahan is another ethnobotanically least studied area of East Anatolia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

On the Georgian side, medicinal folk knowledge of at least 27 rare and endangered medicinal plants were recorded for the Samtskhe-Javakheti region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, around 40 medicinal plant species were listed in a systematic ethnobotanical study in Samtskhe-Javakheti region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study of folk usage of medicinal plants in Adjara reported knowledge relating to 194 plant taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Recent studies conducted in Europe highlight the significance of cross-cultural and cross-border ethnobotanical research to fully understand the factors that shape plant knowledge and uses by communities living closely under similar environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The region witnessed various wars, migrations, and deportations and several kingdoms, empires, principalities, and countries succeeded until the current day. The variety of ethnolinguistic groups inhabiting the area include Turks, Georgians, Armenians, Kurds, Azeris, Laz people, Hemshins, and Russians, with small-scale agriculture and relatively large-scale livestock farming as the main economic activities. Nearly all participants in this study were transhumant, maintaining an agro-pastoral way of life. Highland pastures, referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>yayla</italic>&#x0201d; in Turkey, are known as &#x0201c;<italic>mta</italic>&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;ialagi&#x0201d; (iala) in Georgia.

Firstly, over 150 potential highland pastures were identified between altitudes of 1600&#x02009;m and 2500&#x02009;m within the study area, using Google Earth. Later, possible research locations were selected from among those settlements according to a number of geographical barriers (mountains, rivers, lakes, passes) that would help identify high diversity of floral and cultural characters. By attempting to reach people who had maintained their agro-pastoral transhumance lifestyle, it was expected that these people would have been in contact with a variety of vegetation types during regular seasonal migrations, thus having a relatively strong living memory of traditional knowledge and practices related to wild plants.</p><p id="Par18">In the summer of 2016, 2&#x02009;weeks of non-systematic preliminary fieldwork were conducted, with the undertaking of informal interviews in 20 highland pastures and villages in Georgia and Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Over the following two summers (2017&#x02013;2018), a total of around 90&#x02009;days of systematic fieldwork were carried out during the period of transhumance (approximately June 15&#x02013;September 15), visiting 102 highland pastures, 65 in Turkey and 37 in Georgia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During that time, 119 participants were interviewed, 74 in Turkey (41 female; 33 male), and 45 in Georgia (28 female; 17 male). The mean ages of participants were 57 and 58 respectively in Georgia and in Turkey.</p><p id="Par19">Official research and plant collection permits were obtained from the Ministry of Forest and Water Affairs (Issue date-no: 09/02/2018-E.8919), as well as from the Scientific Research and Ethical Committee of Artvin &#x000c7;oruh University in Turkey (Issue date-no: 14/02/2018-E.2708). Ilia State University in Georgia was informed, and necessary official scientific research and travel permits were obtained from the Department of Land Border Protection of the Border Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.</p><p id="Par20">Initial investigation considered the flora in different vegetation zones (forest, meadow, wetlands, steppe, rocky areas) en route to and in the vicinity of each selected highland pasture. This process took around 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;h for each highland pasture. This reconnaissance involved the identification of wild plants, where possible to species level, in which photographs and a minimum of three samples were collected for each. This had a dual purpose, firstly to be able to show participants for them to identify plants they would talk about, and secondly to prepare herbarium voucher specimens for later detailed identification.</p><p id="Par21">The research team was composed of three or four people. The first (female) and second (male) authors were always involved in the interviews, with a translator&#x02014;either male or female. Throughout the study, the first author was always the principal interviewer. In Turkey, the interviews were conducted directly in the Turkish language, while in Georgia, interviews were in Georgian, Russian, or Turkish. The majority of the interviews in Georgia were performed with the help of translators who spoke Georgian, Russian, and English, either as a mother tongue or as a second language. Interviews were later translated into English. Two weeks before the fieldwork, the translators were provided with information and terminology relevant to the research. Information relating to the purpose of the study was given to all participants and their free, prior informed consent&#x02014;for interviewing, recording, photographing, and/or publishing their knowledge&#x02014;obtained orally from each at the beginning of their interviews. All interviews conformed to the International Society of Ethnobiology&#x02019;s Code of Ethics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The obligations of the Nagoya Protocol also being considered, it was approved that &#x0201c;the right of use and ownership of any traditional knowledge of all informants remains with them, and that any use of the information except for scientific publication, requires the additional consent of the traditional owners, and consensus on access to benefits derived possibly later use&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">A snowball technique was used to find participants who held significant traditional knowledge regarding wild plants and their usage. The majority of the participants were elderly transhumant people. Each was interviewed individually, for an average of 2&#x02009;h, with semi-structured questionnaires. Usually, the person&#x02019;s relatives and neighbors also contributed to the interview. The first author took notes directly in a notebook during all interviews. Depending on participants&#x02019; wishes, audio or video recordings were made of the interviews. Information about plants collected from the wild was documented, specifically with data regarding (1) their folk names in different languages and dialects, (2) collection time and place, (3) parts used for medicinal purposes, (4) processes of preparation and administration, and (5) source of the plant knowledge. In addition, observations were made and photos taken in byres, cellars, and other relevant places whenever possible so as to document unmentioned uses and also observe living ethnobotanical practices.</p><p id="Par23">Initially, participants were asked to discuss points about wild plants that immediately came to mind (~&#x02009;15&#x02009;min). Then they were shown fresh plants and asked to identify the vernacular names and usage of the plants (~&#x02009;45&#x02009;min). Depending on the weather and participants&#x02019; willingness, a &#x0201c;walk around the house&#x0201d; was undertaken to observe wild plants in the proximity (~&#x02009;15&#x02009;min). To confirm previous information and to gain further learning about various plants, participants were shown an illustrated plant catalog, including 400 plant species from the flora of the region (~&#x02009;45&#x02009;min.).

Ethnobotanical interviews and data analysis focused on &#x0201c;wild&#x0201d; (non-cultivated) plants native to the study area. For instance, species such as <italic>Malus domestica</italic>, <italic>Prunus x domestica</italic>, <italic>Morus alba</italic>, <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic>, etc. were excluded from the study since they are either widely cultured or exotic. Although they are also cultivated, <italic>Corylus avellena</italic>, <italic>Juglans regia</italic>, <italic>Ribes rubrum</italic>, etc. were included as they are native to the area or have run wild and become naturalized. There was no focus on or promotion of exotic plant species or unconventional (introduced) knowledge related to them. This choice was made not only for logistical reasons but also because even though exotic plants may somewhat enrich local ethnobotanical knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], there are also documented adverse effects on local biodiversity, ecosystem services and local community livelihoods as well as cultural diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Furthermore, participant knowledge and perceptions of plant collecting places were used to decide which species qualified as &#x0201c;wild.&#x0201d; Based upon these criteria, a total of 152 wild plant species were included in the analysis.</p><p id="Par28">Firstly, the number of species mentioned on both sides of the Georgia-Turkey border were compared using Venn diagrams.

The CI index of this family in Georgia is more than threefold that of Turkey. Significant differences in CI are also noted at the species level.

The small CI index value of <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> in Georgia may be due to the fact that it has a narrow distribution and low abundance in Georgia. However, as far as observed, this species has a relatively wider distribution and high abundance in Turkey. Another possible and more plausible explanation is that the particular medicinal use of this species in Turkey, especially in Ardahan, could be related to similar cultural background and unique ethnomedicinal knowledge of the people living there. The frequent use of <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> roots as medicinal tea in this province is an uncommon medicinal use, which has so far rarely been cited in the literature in Turkey. One previous report was from &#x000c7;&#x00131;ld&#x00131;r, Ardahan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] within the area of this study, while a further two more reports were from the nearby region, in Erzurum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

Actually, <italic>Mentha</italic> is a widely known, reported, and used plant species as a food additive in the study area, in Turkey. Therefore, its low medicinal CI value could be related to its less known specific medicinal properties.

Thus, its unique medicinal use knowledge recorded in Georgia might be attributed to cultural background as well as to the remedies written in the literature, especially in ancient traditional medical books. Indeed, when participants were asked about the origin of their ethnomedicinal knowledge, although most in Georgia referred to their elders&#x02019; knowledge as a primary source, some also acknowledged their primary school education and others recalled Russian botanists who had conducted research in the region. Furthermore, several referred to the fifteenth century Georgian book &#x0201c;Karabadini,&#x0201d; which had formerly been known as &#x0201c;Ustsoro Karabadini,&#x0201d; the first almanac of medicinal remedies and medicinal knowledge, written by Kananeli Karaba in the tenth century.

Some also made a reference to Russian medicinal plant guidebooks and web pages. In contrast, no similar examples was mentioned by participants in Turkey, whose sole source of plant knowledge was their elders and people around.

Although the species is homogeneously distributed across the study area, and used across the border in various ways (material, construction, fuel), the greatly contrasting high medicinal CI values in Georgia and very low CI values in Turkey might be associated with cultural background of the communities as well as participants&#x02019; in Georgia accessing medicinal knowledge in multilingual literature sources.

Thus, this study area still maintains clear medicinal knowledge and practices regarding wild plants. Indeed, more than half of the distinct ethnomedicinal usage of wild plants documented in this study have not been reported in the Caucasus literature before. The majority of this plant knowledge is still present, partly in use or at least harbored in memories. However, especially in Turkey, many of the reported uses are no longer implemented in practice, only remaining in the memory of elders who still maintain their traditional agro-pastoral transhumant lifestyles.</p><p id="Par80">What is striking is the fact that, despite environmental and floral similarity, common historical/cultural contact, and similar livelihood strategies, at the present time, shared ethnomedicinal knowledge/use across the border is unexpectedly low, forming less than 10% of the reported ethnomedicinal use incidences. It seems that patterns of medicinal knowledge in the study area are connected with multiple cultural factors, in particular ethnolinguistic diversity, cultural background, and access to multilingual written folk and scientific literature. These factors are shown to be variable among species. Due to its complex nature, while a generalized definite conclusion cannot be drawn, access to multilingual literary sources seems to be one of the most relevant driving forces to account for the medical plant knowledge patterns in the study area. To better understand the underlying factors and driving reasons for the shared and separate plant knowledge among different communities on both sides of this international border, future studies should consider cultural diversity (language, ethnicity), socio-economic conditions, as well as the political histories of each community. Restricting the comparison unit to a single plant genus, with structured questions may provide a more rigorous approach to the evaluation of patterns and dynamics of ethnobotanical knowledge. Most importantly, to identify factors that shape medicinal plant knowledge in such a multicultural area, strong collaboration between local people, botanists, ethnologists, ecologists, pharmacologists, linguists, anthropologists, and sociologists is essential for future research in the field of ethnobotany.</p><p id="Par81">A number of practical implications related to medicinal wild plants have emerged from this study. Firstly, unique and shared plant species and their use knowledge documented in this study could encourage further phyto-pharmaceutical research for the development of natural botanical-based pharmaceuticals and phytotherapy practices. It is hoped that these will contribute to the health, well-being, and livelihood of these communities, in the Caucasus and worldwide. Secondly, Georgia&#x02019;s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014&#x02013;2020) has a recommendation for restoring traditional knowledge of local peoples related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use, to be integrated into their legislation and national strategies by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In Turkey, a recent Project of the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs has also taken a valuable step toward documenting biodiversity-based traditional knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. As the links between traditional knowledge and the conservation of biodiversity receive increasing attention from the scientific community worldwide, ethnobotanical knowledge and practices related to plant resources in mountainous regions along the Georgia-Turkey border might contribute to future cross-border action plans and policies for plant conservation and management of vegetation resources. It is hoped this will add value to the development of functional models for biocultural diversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable uses of natural resources in the Caucasus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
