 <title>Funding</title>
 <p>In Georgia, Ilia State University partially funded the fieldworks of this study for three summer seasons (2016–2017-2018). GIZ Georgia also partially supported the fieldworks in 2017 as a scholarship to first author, Ceren Kazancı. Authors and people in crowd funding contributed to the rest. In Turkey, funding support for this study was provided from crowdfunding, the authors’ own budgets and the first authors’ parents. The funding sources did not have a role in the writing of the paper or the decision to submit the paper for publication.</p>
