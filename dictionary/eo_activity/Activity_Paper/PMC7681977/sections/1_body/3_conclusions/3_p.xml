<p id="Par81">A number of practical implications related to medicinal wild plants have emerged from this study. Firstly, unique and shared plant species and their use knowledge documented in this study could encourage further phyto-pharmaceutical research for the development of natural botanical-based pharmaceuticals and phytotherapy practices. It is hoped that these will contribute to the health, well-being, and livelihood of these communities, in the Caucasus and worldwide. Secondly, Georgia’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014–2020) has a recommendation for restoring traditional knowledge of local peoples related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use, to be integrated into their legislation and national strategies by 2020 [

As the links between traditional knowledge and the conservation of biodiversity receive increasing attention from the scientific community worldwide, ethnobotanical knowledge and practices related to plant resources in mountainous regions along the Georgia-Turkey border might contribute to future cross-border action plans and policies for plant conservation and management of vegetation resources. It is hoped this will add value to the development of functional models for biocultural diversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable uses of natural resources in the Caucasus.
