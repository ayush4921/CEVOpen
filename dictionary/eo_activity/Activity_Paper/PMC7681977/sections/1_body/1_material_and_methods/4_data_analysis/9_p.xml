<p id="Par34">In the case of this study, although the CI values of each species (CI
 <sub>s</sub>) were calculated separately (see in Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) instead of comparing only CI
 <sub>s</sub>, attention was paid to the Cultural Importance of each plant genus (CI
 <sub>g</sub>: total value of CI
 <sub>s</sub> in the same genus) to reveal the more versatile genera. Besides, the cultural importance of each family (CI
 <sub>f</sub>) was computed by summing CI
 <sub>g</sub> values for all genera of the same family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These approaches will reduce the risks of under or over estimation of the CI for certain plant species due to misidentification of very similar species and subspecies; this would also compensate for possible effects of different folk taxonomic classifications among participants. It is known that closely related plant species share common natural products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], whose type of usage may also clump phylogenetically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].
