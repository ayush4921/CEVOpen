<p id="Par20">Initial investigation considered the flora in different vegetation zones (forest, meadow, wetlands, steppe, rocky areas) en route to and in the vicinity of each selected highland pasture. This process took around 2–3 h for each highland pasture. This reconnaissance involved the identification of wild plants, where possible to species level, in which photographs and a minimum of three samples were collected for each. This had a dual purpose, firstly to be able to show participants for them to identify plants they would talk about, and secondly to prepare herbarium voucher specimens for later detailed identification.</p>
