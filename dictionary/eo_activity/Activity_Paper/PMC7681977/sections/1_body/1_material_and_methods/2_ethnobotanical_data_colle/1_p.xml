<p id="Par17">To restrict the focus of the study on the ethnobotanical knowledge of transhumant people, more than two-thirds of the fieldwork was conducted in highland pastures along the Georgian-Turkish border. Firstly, over 150 potential highland pastures were identified between altitudes of 1600 m and 2500 m within the study area, using Google Earth. Later, possible research locations were selected from among those settlements according to a number of geographical barriers (mountains, rivers, lakes, passes) that would help identify high diversity of floral and cultural characters. By attempting to reach people who had maintained their agro-pastoral transhumance lifestyle, it was expected that these people would have been in contact with a variety of vegetation types during regular seasonal migrations, thus having a relatively strong living memory of traditional knowledge and practices related to wild plants.</p>
