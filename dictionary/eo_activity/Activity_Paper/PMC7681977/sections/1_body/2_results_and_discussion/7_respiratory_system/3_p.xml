<p id="Par63">Another treatment reported only in Georgia, to be good for asthma, bronchitis and lung diseases is a jam made of young seed cones and pollen cones and also pollen cones mixed with honey. Indeed, during fieldwork in Georgia, the sale in local bazaars of fresh 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> cones and pollens as a medicine was frequently observed, traders inviting shoppers to taste their pollen. One participant offered jam made of young seed cones of 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>. This events revealed the continuing existence of a living traditional phytomedicine heritage in Georgia. In contrast, no participant in Turkey gave any clue of similar traditions related to 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>. In fact, most were astonished to hear of the usage of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> cones as a jam. Although the species is homogeneously distributed across the study area, and used across the border in various ways (material, construction, fuel), the greatly contrasting high medicinal CI values in Georgia and very low CI values in Turkey might be associated with cultural background of the communities as well as participants’ in Georgia accessing medicinal knowledge in multilingual literature sources. The high regard of local people for the Russian name, “sosna,” for 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> might be a reflection of multilingual literature on medicinal knowledge in Georgia. Similary, the leaves of 
 <italic>Tussilago farfara</italic> has a wide range of uses in respiratory diseases (cough, bronchitis, asthma, lung diseases) in Georgia but in Turkey it is not reported in this research, even though it was widely reported in the literature [
