 <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic> is another important species for digestive problems with similar cultural importance in each country. Jaundice is the only illness mentioned for its use in Turkey. Participants frequently called it “
 <italic>sarılık ağacı</italic>” which literally means “the tree of yellowness” in Turkish. Similarly, it is frequently said to cure jaundice and liver-associated diseases in Georgia. Drinking of or/and bathing in a water decoction of 
 <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic> branches are the common mode of applications for jaundice in both countries. Using roots, bark, and also fruits had been previously noted for treatment of jaundice in Georgia [

 <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic> root, and licking the root of 
 <italic>Berberis vulgaris x crateagina</italic> for curing jaundice in this province were mentioned in several studies [
