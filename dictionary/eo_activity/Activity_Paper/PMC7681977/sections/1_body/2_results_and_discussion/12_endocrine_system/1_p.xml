<p id="Par71">Diabetes is the most commonly mentioned disease in both countries. It constitutes 69% of the endocrine reports in Georgia and 77% of them in Turkey. 
 <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp. (
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>mrytillus</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>arctostaphylos</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic>) and 
 <italic>Satureja spicigera</italic> are the most important species used for the treatment of diabetes in Georgia, while in Turkey, 
 <italic>Crataegus</italic> spp. (
 <italic>C. monogyna</italic>, 
 <italic>C. azarolus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pentagyna</italic>) and 
 <italic>Sorbus aucaparia</italic> are the most important species. Aerial parts of 
 <italic>Satureja spicigera</italic> mixed with yoghurt is eaten or water infusion of the aerial part is drunk in Georgia. On the other hand, water infusion of young branches of both 
 <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp. with leaves is a widespread application employed for the treatment of diabetes by participants in Georgia, with one report of the eating of their fresh fruits. The same details, especially for 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>arctostaphylos</italic>, were also mentioned in several studies from Georgia only [

 <italic>mrytillus</italic> was mentioned in the same ways in Turkey, with fruits or/and leaves of

 <italic>mrytillus</italic> having been reported for diabetes around the study area, and in general in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey [

 <italic>Crataegus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Sorbus aucuparia</italic> are recorded as the common treatment for diabetes in Turkey and, although uncommon, the same use is also reported in Georgia. The utilization of 
 <italic>Sorbus aucuparia</italic> against diabetes has not been previously reported in/around this particular study region either in Turkey or in Georgia although its antidiabetic uses were reported in several sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Crataegus</italic> spp. (C
 <italic>.</italic> azarolus var. 
 <italic>pontica</italic>, C
 <italic>.</italic> monogyna, C
 <italic>.</italic> pentagyna) have not been mentioned as antidiabetic in the cited references (Table S
