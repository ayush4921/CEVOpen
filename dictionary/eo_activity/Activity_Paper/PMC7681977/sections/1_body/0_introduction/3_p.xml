<p id="Par11">Recent studies conducted in Europe highlight the significance of cross-cultural and cross-border ethnobotanical research to fully understand the factors that shape plant knowledge and uses by communities living closely under similar environmental conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Differences in cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, language, medicinal belief systems, religion) are proposed to be significant factors affecting varying concepts of medicinal knowledge within such communities in Europe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the influence of USSR Pharmacopedia, especially for post-Soviet countries is discussed [

Similarly, the impact of “official” sources from Soviet times on traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge was investigated in a study in Armenia, which identified a “new tradition,” which they suggest has indirectly promoted the enrichment and preservation of phytomedicinal knowledge and traditions [
