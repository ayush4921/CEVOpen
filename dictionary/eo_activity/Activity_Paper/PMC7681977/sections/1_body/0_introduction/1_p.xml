<p id="Par9">The mountains of the Western Lesser Caucasus are part of the Caucasus Hotspot, one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This hotspot harbors around 7000 vascular plant species, around 25% of which are endemic to the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, it is known to be a home to high linguistic, genetic, and ethnic diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, various travelers and researchers have been impressed by the diversity of language and ethnicity of the region, calling here “the mountain of tongues” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, several researchers highlight the significance of mountainous regions worldwide not only for biodiversity but also for biocultural diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], “the diversity of life in all its manifestations: biological, cultural, and linguistic” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite this, the lack of information on plant resources in ethnographic studies in particular has been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well the lack of studies on the relationship between mountains, biodiversity, and cultural diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More effort to document and protect traditional knowledge and practices in mountainous areas has been called for, to sustain continued social-ecological health and wellbeing of humanity [
