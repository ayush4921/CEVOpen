<p>Cytotoxicity of the three most active extracts determined by LDH leakages from the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is presented in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The table shows that 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild), 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam, and 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extracts-mediated hLDH release was concentration-dependent (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Comparing the three extracts, 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC seems to cause more LDH leakage. The 
 <italic>Alstonia boonei</italic> (De Wild) extract caused the least release of LDH (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Based on the percentage LDH leakage, IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using the regression curve. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values estimated were 7.58 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 7.65 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 3.46 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for extracts 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild), 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam, and 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC, respectively. All the three extracts were active and selectively toxic to the parasites than mammalian cells with selective toxicity indices ranging from 93 to 209 (
