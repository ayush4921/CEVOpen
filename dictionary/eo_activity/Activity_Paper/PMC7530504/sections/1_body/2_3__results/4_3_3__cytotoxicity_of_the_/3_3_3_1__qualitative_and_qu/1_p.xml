<p>The results of exposure of PBMCs to extracts are presented in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Undamaged cells have their nuclei intact without comet tails or diffused DNA as in the negative control panel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), whereas damaged cells have different appearances (Bâ€“F). This includes unwinding or distortion of DNA in the cells. 
 <italic>Alstonia boonei</italic> (De Wild)
 <italic>, S. siamea</italic> Lam, and 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extracts had the highest comet score of 3, and the percentage DNA in the comet tail seen was 75% for 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> and 70% for 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam of DNA in the comet tail (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Extract 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild) recorded 65% DNA in the comet tail.
