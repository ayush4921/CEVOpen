<p>In conclusion, the 
 <italic>Alstonia boonei</italic>, 
 <italic>Senna siamea</italic> Lam, and 
 <italic>Acanthospermum hispidum</italic> extract showed good antiplasmodial activity which warrants further investigations to ascertain their usefulness as good antimalarial agents. It will, therefore, be useful to carry out activity-guided fractionation studies to identity the antiplasmodial active phytoconstituents in the extracts for further development.
