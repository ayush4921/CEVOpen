 <italic>Morinda lucida Benth</italic> and 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> L extracts separately showed relatively low antiplasmodial activity 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> Even though this is in agreement with an earlier report [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it contrasts sharply with others [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The difference in the current and the earlier reports might be due to the solvent used in the extraction as it has been well documented that plants might show no activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species when extracted with polar solvents but exhibit extensive antimalarial/antiplasmodial activity when they are extracted with organic solvents such as ether or chloroform [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This situation may be due to the polarity of the bioactive agent and, hence, its solubility in solvents with varying polarities. The current data, together with that from Chithambo and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], therefore, suggest that the main antiplasmodial agent in these plants might be more soluble in organic solvents than polar ones such as water. Comparatively, the 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> extract showed a more effective growth inhibitory effect on the two strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites than the rest of the extracts. The high level of antiplasmodial activity of this extract against both strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> agrees with earlier findings [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] by Sanon and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
