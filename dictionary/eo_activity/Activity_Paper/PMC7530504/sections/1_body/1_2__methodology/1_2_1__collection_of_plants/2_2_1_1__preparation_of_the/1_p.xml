 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam, 
 <italic>M. lucida</italic> Benth, 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>, 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> L, 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC, and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf were washed thoroughly with potable water, followed by distilled water, and air-dried at room temperature. For standardization purposes, 200 g of each sample was weighed and boiled in 800 ml distilled water for an hour to obtain the extracts. The aqueous extracts were collected and centrifuged twice at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove particulate materials. Each of the supernatants was, then, freeze-dried in a Hepto Power Dry LL3000 machine (Jouan Nordic, Denmark) and stored in a dedicated refrigerator until later use. Twenty milligrams (20 mg) of each of the freeze-dried plant extract was reconstituted in one millilitre of sterile distilled water (1 ml) to obtain a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Each of the solutions was filtered successively through membranes of 0.45 
 <italic>µ</italic>m pores and 0.22 
 <italic>µ</italic>m pores (Millipore Corp., Bedford) in a laminar flow biosafety cabinet. Two-fold serial dilutions of each of the plant extracts were prepared to start from 833.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml to 6.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml in a parasite culture medium (RPMI 1640, L-glutamine, Gentamycin, and Albumax). All dilutions, including that of artesunate which was used as the positive control, were prepared fresh on the day of the assays.
