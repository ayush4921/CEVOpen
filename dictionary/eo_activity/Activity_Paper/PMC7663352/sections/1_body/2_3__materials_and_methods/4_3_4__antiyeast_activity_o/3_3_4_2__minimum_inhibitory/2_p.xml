<p>The microplate bioassay was used to study the antiyeast activity of EOs. The 24-well plates were prepared by dispensing into each well 1.8 mL of Malt Extract broth and 0.2 mL of yeast inoculum with a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. An aliquot (20 µL) of each EO (with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 µL/mL) was transferred into a well. Negative controls were prepared adding only 20 µL of DMSO to ME medium. The microplates were sealed and incubated on a plate shaker (100 rpm) at 28 °C for 48 h. The yeast growth was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm.
