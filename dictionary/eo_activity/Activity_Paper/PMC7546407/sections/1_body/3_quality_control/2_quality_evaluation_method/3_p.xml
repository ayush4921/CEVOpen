<p>The determination to index components is a significant part of the quality control of TCM, with the determination of the content of one or several active ingredients being used as the evaluation standard for the quality control of TCM. At present, the main chemical components of TDG are flavonoids, phenolic acids, steroids, polysaccharides, and so on. With certain biological activity, all of these compounds may be used as indicators, but the related research is lack of systematicness. In this paper, we collate the relevant literature in recent years and list literature in

 </xref>. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to reflect the inherent quality of TCM as a whole with single index component, while fingerprint can reflect the quality of TCM more objectively with the characteristics of systematization, characteristic, stability, which is regarded as a quality control evaluation method of TCM. 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2016)</xref> establish fingerprints of chloroform parts of TDG from different origins and identify 15 peaks, of which three peaks are identified as quercetin, kaempferol-3-O-neohsperidin, and β-sitosterol. Combining principal component analysis and cluster analysis, the results show significant difference in the overall pattern of leaves and roots. Tests use ultra-high performance liquid chromatography to establish finger-prints of 41 batches of

There is no obvious difference in the various types of chemical components, and the main difference is the content of their chemical components (

With the expansion of the research scope, the complexity of fingerprint data has been increased, so is the difficulty of subsequent data analysis. Therefore, multivariate statistical methods have been applied to data analysis. HPLC fingerprints of TDG are collected and combined with different pattern recognition methods. Compared with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF) is a method using multiple classification trees to distinguish and classify data. Based on a mathematical model, three origin samples could be effectively distinguished in RF. Among the 18 common peaks, three of them have made outstanding contributions to different habitat sample differentiation (
