<p>Fatty acids are part and parcel in TDG. Nowadays, a variety of fatty acids and volatile oils have been identified in TDG, mainly including lacceroic acid (65), succinic acid (66), palmitic acid (67), oleic acid (68), linoleic acid (69), stearic acid (70), myristic acid (71), margaric acid (72), pentadecylic acid (73) and methyl linolenate (74), psoralen (75), camphor (76), 2, 3-butanediol (77), hexanoic acid (78), benzyl alcohol (79), benzeneethanol (80), phenol (81), 6, 10, 14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (82), cumene (83), diphenylamine (84), arachidic acid (85), linolenic acid (86), azelaic acid (87) (
