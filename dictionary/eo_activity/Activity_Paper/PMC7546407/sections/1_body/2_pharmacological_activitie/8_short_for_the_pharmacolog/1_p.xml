<p>According to existing reports, this event that TDG has a good anti-tumor activity was confirmed. The possible anti-tumor mechanisms involved in this action can be divided into the following five sectors. First, TDG can induce apoptosis of tumor cells, thereby achieving anti-tumor effects. And this process, mainly involved in the apoptosis pathway includes the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway, which ultimately leads to the occurrence of apoptosis. For instance: In the extrinsic death receptor pathway, TDG may be connected with the related protein expression (Fax/FasL, FADD) on the surface of liver cancer cell membranes, after binding to this protein receptor, it forms a complex, which affects the increased expression of some proteins in the caspase family and eventually leads to apoptosis. In the mitochondrial signaling pathway, TDG can promote the secretion of cytochrome C, further lead to the cleavage of PARP, and which affects the function of mitochondria. At the same time, TDG also can affect the Bcl-2 gene family Bcl-2 family proteins and MAPK pathway. These changes ultimately result in DNA damage and promoted cell apoptosis (

Second, TDG can improve immune function by increasing the production of immune-related factors and affecting the function of T lymphocytes. Third, TDG will reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and inhibits tumor vascular growth. Fourth, TDG can eliminate free radicals produced in tissues or cells due to external factors and prevent chronic diseases and cancer caused by oxidative damage. Five, TDG can inhibit the proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of tumor cells, which may be involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Studies on the antioxidant activity of TDG have mainly found that TDG may change local MDA levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, and the expression levels of related factor proteins. However, few studies have been carried out on anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects, antiviral effect, hepatoprotective effect, immunomodulatory effects of TDG. TDG has been discovered about the complex biological activities they displayed, some mechanisms of action of TDG remains unclear and demands further inspection.
