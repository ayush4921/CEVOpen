 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2008)</xref> make research on the effect of ethyl triacetate fraction (EAF) isolated from TDG on the immune function of ICR mice. The results prove that EAF isolated from TDG is able to increase the mouse spleen lymphocyte transformation induced by concanavalin A (ConA), the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in dose-dependent manner, as well as significantly enhancing the ability of macrophages to phagocytose India ink. These findings suggest that the mechanism of this extract might be related to elevate levels of serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and strengthen the effect of mononuclear–macrophage phagocytosis. In addition, 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2020)</xref> make use of multiple analytical methods to characterize the chemical element of a purified polysaccharide extracted from the aerial part of TDG. The experimental results show that the aerial part of TDG is composed of galacturonic acid (GalA), glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), and rhamnose (Rha), and it has an average molecular weight of 66.2 kDa. By establishing the yeast-induced hyperthermia mice models, the authors find that the aerial part of TDG may be related to the concentration of PGE2, cAMP, and IL-6 in serum with notable antipyretic effect. In addition, the spleen index, thymus index, and the number of spleen cells enhance with the increase of the aerial part of TDG concentration in H22 tumor-bearing mice. After the addition of TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 in LPS-induced cell model, the cytokine level decrease, indicates that the aerial part of TDG may compete with TLR4 in interacting with TLR4 to regulate the production of cytokines, thereby regulating immune function and achieving anti-tumor activity. In one study, different TDG tuber extracts could promote the up-regulation of pore-forming protein (PFP), Granzyme B (GrB), CD107a, and IFN-γ expression on NK cell surface, and the best effect is obtained by boiling boiled sugar (
