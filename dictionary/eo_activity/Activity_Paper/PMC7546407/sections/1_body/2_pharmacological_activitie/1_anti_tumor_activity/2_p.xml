<p>Nowadays, many studies have shown the anti-tumor effect of TDG. Earlier tests show that TDG extract has a significant inhibitory effect on A549 cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is positively related to the concentration and duration of the drug, and might be related to the expression of BcL-2 gene (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Lu, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the extract of TDG has a certain inhibitory effect on the tumor in S180 tumor-bearing mice. As a result, only after the intervention of the high dose group, it finds that T lymphocyte subpopulations and antioxidant indexes are significantly changed and these findings suggest that the anti-tumor mechanism of TDG may be related to the improvement of immune function and activation of the antioxidant pathway (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). A study shows that ethanol extract of TDG in a certain concentration range (1 to 625 μg/ml) could inhibit the proliferation of A375 cells in a dose-dependent relationship, and affect its tyrosinase activity and Synthesis of melanin (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Li and Peng (2014)</xref> discover that TDG extract can induce apoptosis of human cervical cancer Hela cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. As shown by continuous researches, different extraction parts have certain influence on the anti-tumor activity of the extract but with different effect. 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. (2005)</xref> compare various extracts from TDG through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments of liver cancer cells HepG2 and primary rat hepatocytes, namely ethyl acetate part, n-butanol part, petroleum ether part, and water soluble part. The effect of the extracts from different parts on normal cells is smaller than that of tumor cells, and the ethyl acetate-soluble portion takes a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of human liver cancer cells HepG2. Different extraction sites may have a certain inhibitory effect on tumor cells, so the study has found that the anti-tumor active positions in TDG are chloroform and petroleum in view of tumor suppression rate (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Ji, 2011</xref>). Moreover, related studies also exhibit that ethyl acetate TDG extract has obvious anti-tumor effects, with its molecular mechanism possibly involved in immune-related factors and pro-apoptotic proteins (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). Above all, preliminary studies have shown the effect of TDG on anti-tumor. 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al. (2015)</xref> develop gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to analyze the chemical constituents of petroleum ether fraction of TDG, and then find that petroleum ether fraction of TDG inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis of HeLa cells in dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. The mechanism may be triggered by intrinsic apoptotic pathway indicated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and extrinsic apoptotic pathway indicated by the activation of caspase-8. In another study, ethylene extract of TDG has certain cytotoxicity to liver cancer cells, which may be caused by the induction of S phase arrest and apoptosis of HepG2 cells, then, subsequent shows that ethylene extract of TDG induces apoptosis of HepG2 cells by triggering the mitochondrial caspase-dependent intrinsic pathway rather than the death receptor (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2016c</xref>). On this basis, the same extract about the previous sentence from TDG inhibits the proliferation and colony formation of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, while regulating apoptosis 
 <italic>via</italic> the Caspase family and Bcl-2 gene family signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). These findings all demonstrate that ethylene extract of TDG has a better inhibitory effect on tumor cells, but the mechanisms involved are not entirely consistent. However, none of these authors have proved the specific medicinal ingredients and there is lack of positive control. The anti-proliferative activities of four extracts (CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>, EtOAc, n-BuOH, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O) are compared through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The results show that CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> extract has the highest activity, with 10 compounds which are further isolated. Preliminary studies have displayed that that resveratrol and kaempferol exhibit obvious inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-435S cells (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), which need to be further studied to provide strong evidence.
