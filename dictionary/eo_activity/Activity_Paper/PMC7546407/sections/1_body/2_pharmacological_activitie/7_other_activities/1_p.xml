<p>In addition to the above pharmacological activities, a recent study shows that a water-soluble polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 93307 Da, named THP, is extracted from TDG. THP has exhibited strong hypoglycemic activity in the alloxan induced mouse model, with its treatment being discovered to promote the activity of antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT) and reduce the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), while THP could restore the structure of pancreas and therefore affect insulin release, as it may be a natural candidate for the treatment of diabetes (

 <italic>via</italic> anion exchange chromatography with a molecular weight of 77.98 kDa. The structural analysis of the compound show that THDP-3 is composed of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose, with a molar ratio of 1.0:1.3:2.5:2.3:3.1. The same is that both THDP-3 and THP have obvious hypoglycemic effects. Experimental results indicate that THDP-3 may be able to regulate the expression of glucokinase, ampactivated protein kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, of which involving in glycogen metabolism pathway. These new findings suggest that THDP-3 can promote glycogen synthesis and inhibit gluconeogenesis (

 <sup>5</sup> Da by adopting the enzyme-ultrasonic assisted extraction (EUAE) method. The treatment of TDGP-3 could increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the liver at a dose of 300 mg/kg, and lowers blood lipid levels (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) and MDA in the liver (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Ru et al., 2019a</xref>). These effects suggest that TDGP-3 can effectively reduce blood lipid and antioxidant activity. The molecular target mechanisms combined with the hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering activities of the polysaccharides of TDG are not delved into by researchers. Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. (2018)</xref> develop a preparation method to obtain safe and non-toxic oligosaccharides in TDG with an extraction rate of 1.586%, and anti-tumor pharmacological experiments are found 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to improve intestinal flora and protect the gastrointestinal tract and so on. The investigation has suggested that TDG polysaccharide could inhibit the growth of E. coli and possessed prominent antibacterial activity. 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2019)</xref> employ a method of metabolomics combined with HPLC/MS and find that TDG’s polysaccharide interferes with the conversion of F6P to FBP and inhibits the E. coli’s proliferation. 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al. (2020)</xref> explore the protective mechanism of TDG leaves extract against ACR induced toxicities in HepG2 cells and 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>). They find that TDG leaves attenuated ACR induces HepG2 cytotoxicity and prevents HepG2 cells from oxidative stress induced by ACR 
 <italic>via</italic> regulating Akt/mTOR/FoxO1/MAPK signaling pathway. Five main compounds are identified from TDG leaves, among which 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CA) is proved to be part and parcel in improving the toxicity of ACR in TDG leaves. Furthermore, TDG leaves improves survival rate, viability, growth and development ability, and anti-oxidative stress ability of N2 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. According to qRT-PCR analysis, TDG leaves could upregulate the expression of antioxidant related genes by influencing transcription factor DAF-16. It is discovered that TDG extract can inhibit the proliferation of leukemia K562 cells. By promoting the high expression of the tumor suppressor gene P53 and the low expression of the oncogene C-myc, the dual effects of inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis are demonstrated (

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Wang C. et al. (2019)</xref> isolate 39 kinds of compounds from the extract of TDG, among which kaempferol and apigenin exert remarkable inhibitory activities against soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Based on the structure analysis of the compound, the number of OH groups in the benzene ring of the tested compounds may contribute to the increase in sEH inhibitory activity, and the sugar unit in the flavone glycoside is unfavorable for efficient inhibition of NO production. Both sEH and iNOS are related to the function of blood vessels, meanwhile, kaempferol and apigenin may act as dual inhibitors of sEH and iNOS. It can be seen from these studies that TDG is conducive to treating cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanism of this effect needs to be further studied to provide evidence for.
