<p>Our structural study focused on bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids 2-nortiliacorinine, tiliacorine and 13′-bromotiliacorinine against the targets PknB and DprE1. These bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids isolated from 
 <italic>Tiliacora triandra</italic> roots, which are used in Thai cuisine, were very effective in suppressing 59 isolated MDR-TB strains with MICs in the range of 1.5–6.25 µg·mL

Tiliacorine, with the lowest binding energy, formed two hydrogen bonds with the residues Tyr94 and Phe19 of PknB. However, both nortiliacorinine and 13′-bromotiliacorine only formed one stable hydrogen bond with Gly97 and Tyr94 (
