 <italic>α</italic>-cubebin, a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan, has been isolated from several species in various families, such as Aristolochiaceae, Myristicaceae, Rutaceae, and Piperaceae [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is known to act as an insect antifeedant, as was noted with 
 <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], as well as being anti-tubercular [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, α-cubebin displays only moderate activity against several mono- and multi-drug-resistant isolates of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (MICs ranging 50–100 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Interestingly, it does not display cytotoxicity against LLCMK2 fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], suggesting that α-cubebin could merit derivatization to make it a better drug lead. α-cubebin exhibited a low binding energy value when docked to Pks13 and interacts with some of the key residues within Pks13 as the drug inhibitor I28. Additionally, unlike I28, α-cubebin has been predicted to bind to the protein tyrosine phosphatase B (PtpB) of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This suggested that α-cubebin had some unique distinct binding characteristics with the 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteome compared to 128. The information of 
 <italic>α</italic>-cubebin’s binding site will facilitate the optimization of this compound towards greater efficacy and selectivity.
