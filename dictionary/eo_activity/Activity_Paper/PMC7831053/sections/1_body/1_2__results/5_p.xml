<p>For ClpP1P2, InhA and PanK, there was a clear tendency for molecules with a higher topological polar surface area to have more favorable binding energies. This is due, in part, to the low binding energies of quinones against these three protein targets (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00475">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Higher MW appeared to have lower binding energies against ClpP1P2, InhA, DprE1, PanK and PknB. In this higher MW category of natural product, lower binding energies, usually lower than the control inhibitor, were mostly seen with triterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids (

The NP with more favorable binding energies did not exhibit distinctive partition coefficients as indicated by xLogP values. For PanK, DrpE1 and PknB, a higher number of H-bond acceptors (maximum of 8) was associated with lower binding energies. No similar trend was seen for the number of H-bond donors (
