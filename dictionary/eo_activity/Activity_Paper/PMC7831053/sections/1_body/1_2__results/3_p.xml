<p>The average of MW presented by conventional anti-TB drugs [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (358.5 g·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) contrasted with our NPs that typically had lower binding energies (MW &gt; 500 g·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, the number of H-bonds acceptors of the NPs matched those of H-bonds acceptors of conventional anti-TB drugs [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the majority of which were below 10 H-bonds acceptors. The same is observed with the number of rotational bonds, since 88% of conventional anti-TB drugs have less than 10 rotational bonds [
