<p>The predicted interactions of tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine and 13′-bromotiliacorine with DprE1 were also visualized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Again, the interactions for all these NPs appeared to nearly superimpose. These showed better binding energies against DprE1, −12.7, −10.9, and −10.3 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, than the benzothiazinethione drug control BTZ043 (−10.1 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). The binding of DprE1 to tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine and 13′-bromotiliacorine, is stabilized by several non-covalent interactions. The LigPlot+ analysis shows that key van der Waals interactions with the residues Trp230, Val365, Lys367, Lys134, Tyr415, His132, Pro116, Ile131, Ala417, Lys418, Arg58, Thr118, Trp16, Tyr60, Gly117 and Tyr314 are responsible for the low binding energies of these structures with DprE1.
