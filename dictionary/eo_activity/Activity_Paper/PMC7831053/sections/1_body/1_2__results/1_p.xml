<p>A total of 53 NPs with reported anti-mycobacterial activity (≤100 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were selected [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00475-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These were subjected to a series of in silico predictions to assess their “druggability” and suggest their targets. The 53 NPs were organized into chemical classes and then assessed for their individual binding energy against established antimicrobial target proteins, ClpP1P2, DprE1, InhA, KasA, PanK, PknB and Pks13, which were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB). For ease of comparison, the binding energies associated with all groups of studied NPs against each mycobacterial target are given as box-plots and compared to the binding of the known anti-TB drug hit for each protein (
