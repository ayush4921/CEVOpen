<p>Apart from the D and MD-fractions, other polysaccharide fractions have also exhibited anti-tumor activity. As reported by Bie et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the polysaccharide GFP-A, isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, was able to inhibit the proliferation of human colon cancer HT-29 cells in vitro, with 180 μg/mL as the most effective concentration. Li and Liu reported that the polysaccharide fraction GFP-4, extracted from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, showed an inhibitory effect on human lung cancer cells at 4 °C. The inhibitory effect became lower after heat treatment at over 30 °C due to structural changes [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> could regulate gene expression involved in the apoptosis of breast cancer cells so that cell proliferation was inhibited and the cell cycle was blocked [
