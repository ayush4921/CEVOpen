<p>Immunomodulation is the most well-known effect of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> components and has been confirmed by many studies. These immunomodulatory components have been shown to enhance the actions of macrophages and many other immune-related cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> components could increase the secretion of cytokines, which are signaling molecules, including interferons (IFN), interleukins (IL), tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and lymphokines with antiproliferative activity, causing apoptosis and differentiation in tumor cells, thus further increasing the efficiency of immune-related cells.
