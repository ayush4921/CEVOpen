<p>Apart from the D-fraction, other polysaccharide fractions with immunomodulatory activity have also been isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. Ishibashi and coworkers isolated insoluble and a high-molecular-weight soluble forms of Grifolan (GRN) from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, both of which can activate macrophages through triggering cytokine secretion to produce TNF [

 <xref rid="B100-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Similarly, Mao et al. observed increased levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β and nitric oxide (NO) in the serum with the dosage of polysaccharide GP11 from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, suggesting the activation of macrophages and the stimulation of tumoricidal activity [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was associated with the activation of cell-mediated immunity resulting from the induction of macrophage proliferation, increasing levels of IL12, IL2, IFN-γ and TNF-α, as well as enhancement of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes [

The GFP fraction isolated by Meng et al. promoted the production of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α, and also effectively enhanced the proliferative activity of fibroblasts, contributing to strong immune-stimulating activity [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> presents the common testing methods and potency indices of immunomodulatory effects. In vitro testing is usually performed with cytokine production evaluated based on ELISA and macrophage activity by MTT assay.
