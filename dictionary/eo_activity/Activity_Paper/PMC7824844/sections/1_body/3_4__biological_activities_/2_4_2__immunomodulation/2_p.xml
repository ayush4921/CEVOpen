<p>Polysaccharides have been recognized as the major immunomodulating components of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. The D-fraction, in addition to its direct antitumor effect as mentioned previously, is also a major polysaccharide fraction of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> with significant immunomodulatory activity. Kodama and coworkers suggested that the D-fraction could activate NK cells through upregulating their expression of TNF-α and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) proteins. Meanwhile, the D-fraction were also able increase macrophage-derived IL-12, which further activated NK cells, implying that the D-fraction could provide long-term tumor-suppressive effects [

Further investigation by Kodama et al. found that the application of the D-fraction could reduce the effective dosage of the chemotherapeutic agent, mitomycin-C (MMC) by increasing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of immunocompetent cells. It could also reduce the immunosuppressive activity caused by MMC [
