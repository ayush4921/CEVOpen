<p>The effects of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> on lipid metabolism regulation and anti-hypertension have been shown in many reports. Kubo and Nanba found that with the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body as the feed, the triglyceride, cholesterol and phospholipid levels in the serum of rats were suppressed by 30–80% compared with those of the control group of animals. Meanwhile, the weight of the extirpated liver was also 60–70% lower than that of the control group, and the corresponding cholesterol excretion ratio in feces increased by 1.8 times with 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> treatment, further demonstrating that 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> treatment helped improve lipid metabolism and inhibit increases in liver lipid and serum lipid after the ingestion of high-fat feed [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> were lowered compared with those of the control group (50 g/kg cellulose powder), and the fecal cholesterol excretion was significantly higher compared with the control group [
