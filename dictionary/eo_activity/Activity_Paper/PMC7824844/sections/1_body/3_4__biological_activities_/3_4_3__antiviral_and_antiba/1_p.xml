<p>There have been a number of studies reporting the beneficial effects of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> in the treatment of viral infections, including those caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), enterovirus 71 (EV71), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mayell and coworkers reported a study on patients with chronic hepatitis B. The results showed that patients who took 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body polysaccharides showed positive signs, specifically a higher recovery rate compared with the control group [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> could fight against HIV through several pathways, including direct inhibition of HIV, stimulation of the natural defense system against HIV and a reduction in vulnerability to opportunistic infections [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> could hinder EV71 viral replication, suppressing genomic RNA synthesis and protein expression, and thus could be used as a promising therapeutic compound for EV71 treatment [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> by Gu et al., has also shown anti-viral effects. It significantly inhibited HSV-1 replication in vitro and reduced HSV-1 induced symptoms such as blepharitis in a murine model [
