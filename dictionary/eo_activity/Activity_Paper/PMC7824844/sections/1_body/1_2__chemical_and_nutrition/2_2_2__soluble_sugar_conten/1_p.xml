<p>The content of soluble sugar within 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is mostly determined by the method described in the research work of Ajlouni and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the total sugar content in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is higher in the fruiting body (90–190 mg/g) than in the mycelium (70–90 mg/g). The content of total sugar in the fruiting body of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is also superior to some edible mushrooms such as 
 <italic>Lactarius glaucescens</italic> and 
 <italic>Craterellus odoratus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which may be one of the reasons for the good taste of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> also shows variations in both total soluble sugar content and individual sugar content among different 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> samples, which may be attributed to factors such as cultivation period and cultivation environment. Trehalose, a disaccharide that comprises two molecules of glucose, is the major sugar component of both the fruiting body and mycelia of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Compared with the amount in the mycelium (40–60 mg/g), the fruiting body contains more trehalose than the mycelium, around 50–160 mg/g in dry weight. In addition to trehalose, the fruiting body also contains glucose and mannitol, whereas the mycelium has glucose and mannitol, together with arabitol and fructose.
