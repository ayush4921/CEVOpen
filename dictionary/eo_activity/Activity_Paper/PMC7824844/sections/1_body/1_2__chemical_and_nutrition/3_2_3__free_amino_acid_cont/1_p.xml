<p>The content of free amino acids in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was quantitatively measured by the method described in the research work of Mau and coworkers using HPLC [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Results regarding the free amino acid content of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> are exhibited in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The total free amino acid content in the fruiting body of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is around 15â€“60 mg/g in dry weight, which is higher than that in many other edible mushrooms, such as 
 <italic>Dictyophora indusiata</italic> and 
 <italic>Tricholoma giganteum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The mycelium of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> contains a relatively higher total free amino acid content in comparison with the fruiting body. There is also a great variety of amino acids in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. There are around eighteen kinds of free amino acids, including essential amino acids such as L-histidine and L-methionine, in both the fruiting body and the mycelium of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, indicating that 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is an excellent source of amino acids.
