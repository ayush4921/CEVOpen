 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is delicious, with a sweet and umami taste, which is mainly attributed to its high trehalose, glutamic and aspartic amino acid and 5′-nucleotide content [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Due to its delicious and special taste, 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is not only used as a food ingredient, but also as a food-flavoring substance in dried powder form. Apart from its high nutraceutical value, 
 <italic>G. fondosa</italic> is reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological effects. 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was first discovered to have antitumor activity in the 1980s from hot water extracts of the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The major bioactive components were found to be β-glucans [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The D-fraction, a β-glucan complex with about 30% protein, was first discovered by Nanba’s group in the late 1980s [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since then, the D-fraction has been widely studied and gradually developed into commercially available complementary medicines and healthcare products. In addition to the D-fraction, there are many other bioactive polysaccharide fractions that are obtained from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, such as the MD-fraction [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], X-fraction [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Grifolan [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], MZ-fraction [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and MT-α-glucan [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The different polysaccharide fractions isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> possess various bioactive effects such as immunomodulation [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], antivirus [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and anti-inflammation [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have attributed or linked the health and therapeutic effects of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharides to their capacity for modifying gut microbiota, microorganisms that play an important role in human health and diseases. In particular, gut microbiota play a role in maintaining immune homeostasis, which may have a connection to the antitumor effects of polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The regulation of gut microbiota composition by 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharides has also been suggested to contribute to the treatment of metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], indicating their potential for preventing or treating hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Apart from polysaccharides, other molecular fractions isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting bodies or mycelial biomass have shown promising medicinal values as well. For instance, the protein components of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, including glycoprotein, have shown anti-tumor [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], immune-enhancing [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and anti-viral effects [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, other small biomolecules in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> have been found to possess health benefits such as anti-inflammation [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], hypoglycemia [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and antioxidation [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
