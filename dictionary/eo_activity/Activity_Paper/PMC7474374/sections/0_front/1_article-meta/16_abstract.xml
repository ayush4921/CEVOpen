  <title>Objective</title>
  <p> This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the latex of three species members of 
   <italic>Jatropha</italic> (
   <italic>J. curcas</italic>, 
   <italic>J. gossypilofia</italic> Linn., and 
   <italic>J. multifida</italic>) against 
   <italic>methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL-) producing 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and ESBL-producing 
   <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia,</italic> carbapenemase-resistant 
   <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CRE)-
   <italic>E. coli, K. pneumoniae</italic>-carbapenemase (KPC), and carbapenemase-resistant 
   <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (CRPA).

  <title>Method</title>
  <p> The antibacterial activities were calculated based on the inhibition zones using the Mueller–Hinton agar diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using Mueller–Hinton broth in a microdilution method, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using blood agar plate. </p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> The latex of 
   <italic>Jatropha</italic> showed antibacterial activities against the MRSA and CRPA. All latex of 
   <italic>Jatropha</italic> appeared to have the antibacterial activities against MRSA and CRPA in the diffusion method (20.4–23.7 mm and 12–15 mm), MIC (0.19–6.25%, and 25%), and MBC (0.39–12.5% and 50%). Phytochemical screening of latex indicated the presence of flavonoids.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p> The latex of 
   <italic>J. curcas</italic>, 
   <italic>J.</italic> g
   <italic>ossypilofia</italic> Linn., and 
   <italic>J. multifida</italic> has the potential to be developed as antibacterial agents, especially against MRSA and CRPA strain, but further in vivo research and discovery of the mode of its action are required to shed the light on the effects.
