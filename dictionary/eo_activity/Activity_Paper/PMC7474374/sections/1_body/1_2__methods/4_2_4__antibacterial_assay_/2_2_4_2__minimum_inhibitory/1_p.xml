<p>The MIC of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> latex was determined using Mueller–Hinton broth microdilution [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MIC determination was performed by a serial dilution technique using 12-well microtiter plates. MHB (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was placed into the well/plate and 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> latex (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) in the dilution series. 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L bacterial cell suspensions were placed in each well/plate. Microplates were incubated aerobically at 35 ± 2°C for 16–20 h. The lowest concentrations without visible growth completely inhibited the bacteria (MIC) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not allow any growth [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The MBC of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> latex was determined following the methods described by [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with slight modifications. Wells were subcultured using a 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L inoculating loop on to a 5% sheep BAP at (35 ± 2)°C for 16–20 h incubation.
