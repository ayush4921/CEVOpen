<p>The total albumin and total protein levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) showed significantly different in the toxic rat-induced paracetamol group compared to healthy, silymarin, and 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> treated rat groups as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figures 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4</xref>. The administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract with a dose of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg and silymarin 200 mg/kg can inhibit the increase of paracetamol intoxication. The levels of total albumin and total protein in the rat groups treated with extract and silymarin were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the hepatotoxic rat group. Moreover, 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract with doses of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg was not significantly different compared to the healthy rat group (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Thus, it can be concluded that the administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extracts in all doses can significantly recover total albumin and total protein levels in rat serum to inhibit the effects of paracetamol intoxication.
