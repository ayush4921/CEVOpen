<p>The total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) showed a significantly increase in the toxic rat-induced paracetamol group, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. The administration of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract with a dose of 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg and silymarin 200 mg/kg can inhibit the increase of paracetamol intoxication. The levels of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin in the rat groups treated with extract and silymarin were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the hepatotoxic rat group. Moreover, the total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels of rat groups treated with 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract in doses of 600 and 900 mg/kg were not significantly different compared to the healthy rat group (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
