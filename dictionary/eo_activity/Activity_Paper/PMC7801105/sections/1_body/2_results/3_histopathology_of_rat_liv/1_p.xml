<p>The histopathology of rat livers from 6 groups was done by observation under an electron microscope with 10x magnification. It can be seen that rat liver cells in healthy control were having a similar appearance with 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extracts of 3,00,600 and 900â€‰mg/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, rat liver cells in hepatotoxic control and silymarin control showed similar patterns that dominated with red colours in the cells, indicating damaged cells caused by paracetamol intoxication (

 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extracts reversed the hepatic lesions caused by paracetamol intoxication to a large extent.
