<p>This assay is based on the ability of the sample to reduce DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) as the stable free radical agent. A total of 10 mg of sample was dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and vortexed. DPPH sample (100 mL) was loaded into a 96-well microplate, incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The control of 100 mL of ethanol solution was added in 100 mL of DPPH. Subsequently, the measurement was done in 517 nm at a time interval of 5 min, starting from 0 to 30 min using ELISA Reader. The power of antioxidants measured as the decreasing DPPH solution absorbance by the addition of the sample solution (Sembiring et al.
