<p>The antioxidant power of the 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> methanol extract in this study was also higher (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31.25 ppm) than reported in the previous study where IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> ethanol extract was 36.70 ppm (Penu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Antioxidant activity expressed by IC
 <sub>50</sub> is a value of the extract concentration that can capture 50% of free radicals. The smaller amount of IC
 <sub>50</sub> indicates the higher antioxidant activity, thus effective as a free radical scavenger. Bioactive compounds become powerful antioxidant agents if they have IC
 <sub>50</sub> value less than 50 µg/mL, strong if IC
 <sub>50</sub> is 50–100 µg/mL, moderate if IC
 <sub>50</sub> is 100–150 µg/mL, and weak if IC
 <sub>50</sub> value within 151–200 µg/mL (Setha et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> extract was categorized as a powerful antioxidant agent (31.25 µg/mL), but weaker than quercetin control (3.52 µg/mL).
