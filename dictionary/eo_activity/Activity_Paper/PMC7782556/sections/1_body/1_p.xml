<p>Genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method from five grams of 
 <italic>Apocynum venetum</italic> fresh leaves collected in Keziertuoan, Jinghe County, Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, China (N44.4440; E82.1680). Voucher specimen (Chen et al. 2019062401) was deposited in the herbarium of Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University (SYS). The genome sequencing was performed in Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform producing 150 bp paired end reads. High-quality reads were assembled into contigs via the de novo assembler SPAdes 3.11.0, using a k-mer set of 93, 105, 117, 121 (Nurk et al.

 <italic>A. venetum</italic> cp genome protein coding genes annotation was conducted using CpGAVAS (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) while tRNA genes were annotated in tRNAscan-SE v2.0 (Chan and Lowe
