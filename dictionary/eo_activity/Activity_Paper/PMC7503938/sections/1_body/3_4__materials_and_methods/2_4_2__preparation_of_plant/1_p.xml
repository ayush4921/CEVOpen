<p>The 
 <italic>D. benthami</italic> Prain samples were initially air-dried and then powdered. The powdered plant material was passed through a 40-mesh screen prior to use. This powder was then suspended in 80% ethanol (1:10 drug to solvent ratio). The filtrate was collected three times at every four-day interval for a total collection period of 12 days. The extracts were concentrated, suspended in deionized water and sequentially partitioned with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol to obtain different fractions such as petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. The dry extracts were stored at −5 °C in the dark until further use.
