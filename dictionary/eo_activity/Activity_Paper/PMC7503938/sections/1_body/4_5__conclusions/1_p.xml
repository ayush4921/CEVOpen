<p>In summary, a new pyranocoumarin was isolated from ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>D. benthami</italic> Prain and was identified as RA. This study was the first to use the SWISS ADME predictor, PASS online servers and the target-fishing method to elucidate the drug likeness, possible biological activity and mechanism of action of RA. The results of the study predict that RA binding shows more abilities to possess better antineoplastic, Topo I inhibitory, anti-angiogenesis and anti-free radical activities, which were reported as the bases of anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, the related in-vitro activities of RA were tested to validate the target fishing results. This serves as the reason why some targets and pathways were associated with cancer, as RA may influence tumor progression through PTK(Syk/Src)-RAS-PI3K/Akt-NFÎºB. Overall, this study provides a systematic and visual overview of the possible molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of RA for the treatment of cancer.
