<p>The cholinesterase inhibitory activity was assessed by the spectrophotometric method of Ellman et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As the source of acetylcholinesterase enzymes, mouse brain homogenate was prepared as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Centrifugation (2000 g, 10 minutes) of EDTA (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL)-treated human blood led to the separation of plasma (supernatant), which was utilized as the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme source for determining butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Spectrophotometric observation of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide by acetylcholinesterase was performed as the final act of the assay. 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of enzyme solution was first blended with 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the test sample and kept for 20 minutes at 37°C. Just after adding Ellman's reaction mixture (3.5 mL; 0.5 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, 1 mM DTNB) in a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM), absorbance (405 nm) was recorded continuously for 5 minutes at a 1-minute interval. A blank reaction was estimated by taking saline in place of the enzyme, and a control reaction was also assessed by substituting the inhibitor with saline. Donepezil was used as a reference standard. The following formula was used to calculate the percentage inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity:
