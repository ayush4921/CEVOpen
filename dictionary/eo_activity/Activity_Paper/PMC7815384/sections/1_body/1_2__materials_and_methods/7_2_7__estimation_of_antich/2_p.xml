<p>For butyrylcholinesterase inhibition assay, the same Ellman's method as mentioned above was followed except that the enzyme solution was 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L and butyrylthiocholine iodide was used instead of acetylthiocholine iodide. Galantamine was taken as a reference standard. The butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (% inhibition) was calculated utilizing the same formula as mentioned above for acetylcholinesterase activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for each plant extract were calculated from the graph plotted as percent inhibition against concentration using nonlinear regression analysis.
