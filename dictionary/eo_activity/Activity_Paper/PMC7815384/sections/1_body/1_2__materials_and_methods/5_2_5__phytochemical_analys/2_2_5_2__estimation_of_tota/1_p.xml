<p>FCR (Folin-Ciocalteu reagent) was employed for estimating the total phenolic content of various extractives of

 <italic>fluctuans</italic> as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 0.5 mL of plant extract or solution of reference compound at various concentrations was added to 2.5 mL of 10% FCR and 2.5 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution. The resulting solution was kept at 25°C for 20 minutes, and the absorbance was measured at 760 nm. Gallic acid was utilized as a reference standard. The total phenolic content was calculated from the standard gallic acid graph and presented as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g of dried extract.
