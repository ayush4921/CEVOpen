<p>Because the level of acetylcholine gradually declines in AD, which appeared to be correlated with the impairment of cognition and memory, inhibitors of cholinesterases that elevate the endogenous level of acetylcholine have been accepted as the first-line pharmacotherapeutics for treatment [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Acetylcholinesterase is the major cholinesterase in the brain that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and shows higher specificity toward acetylcholine. The 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>fluctuans</italic> extracts were examined for inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase at different concentrations by Ellman's colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Along with the test extracts, a reference acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, which is highly selective for acetylcholinesterase than butyrylcholinesterase [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], was used in this study, and its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was found to be 5.05 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The results revealed the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties of all four extracts. The highest inhibition was found from the chloroform extract followed by the ethyl acetate extract and petroleum ether extract with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 83.90, 167.67, and 758.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The aqueous extract had a relatively weak activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The activity of the extracts was remarkable when compared with the other medicinal plants such as

 <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic>, 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Convolvulus pluricaulis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>, which are used traditionally to enhance memory and relevant to AD treatment [
