<p>Phenolics and flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are widespread in fruits and vegetables. These compounds have many proven health benefits. Phenolics exert antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals. They are reported to prevent oxidative stress associated with AD through antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Flavonoids are also considered potential natural antioxidants with the ability to scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species. They contain conjugated ring structures and hydroxyl groups, which are believed to play a functional role in antioxidant activity. Flavonoids from various natural sources exhibit multiple pharmacological activities including inhibition of cholinesterase and aggregation of amyloid-
