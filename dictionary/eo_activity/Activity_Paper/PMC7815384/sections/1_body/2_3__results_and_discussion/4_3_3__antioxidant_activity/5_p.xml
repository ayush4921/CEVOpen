<p>Increasing pieces of evidence suggest a linear relationship between the polyphenolic content and the antioxidant activity of plant materials [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Phenolics and flavonoids from natural sources have also been found to inhibit cholinesterase enzymes. Thus, correlations were tested between phytochemical contents and cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant activity. The results have been presented in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A significant correlation was observed between phenolic content and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.953), DPPH radical scavenging (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.999), and reducing power (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.999), while a moderate correlation was seen between phenolic content and acetylcholinesterase inhibition (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.874) and flavonoid content and cholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.590-0.674). These results suggest an association of phenolics and flavonoids with the inhibition of cholinesterase as well as antioxidant activity.
