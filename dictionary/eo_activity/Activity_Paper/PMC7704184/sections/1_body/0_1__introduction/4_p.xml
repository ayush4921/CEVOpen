<p>Generally, gout is treated with some medications to lower the level of the serum urate by the inhibition of the xanthine oxidase in the liver. Among those treatments, we have febuxostat and allopurinol [

 <italic>Colchicum autumnale</italic> is another kind of gout therapy [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, these drugs have various side effects. For example, allopurinol causes nephrolithiasis, renal toxicity, liver necrosis, and allergic reactions [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Morocco is characterized by flora diversity, and it contains 4200 species in which 800 are considered therapeutic herbs [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The medicinal plants of this country have been used traditionally to treat several complications as gout. In fact, several plants were reported in pharmacopeia as antigout products, and most of them have shown experimentally this activity. Although, these plants remain underexploited and require other studies in order to confirm this effect and to identify different molecules responsible for this beneficial effect. Therefore, in this review, we have summarized information about medical treatment and plants that are used for gout management in Morocco with the aim to valorize the Moroccan bioresources. For this reason, we have been consulting various English publications in PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, published between 1991 and 2019.
