<p>The main cause of hyperuricemia is the unbalance between the production and excretion rate of uric acid. Purines principally degraded by a hepatic enzyme named xanthine oxidase are involved in the appearance of hyperuricemia. A high-purine diet that leads to purine metabolism raise, excessive alcohol consumption, and tumor lysis syndrome associated with the alteration of a large number of cells, contributing to the increased uric acid production. Indeed, a reduction in excretion and rising reabsorption of uric acid causes hyperuricemia. Furthermore, uric acid transporters are required in uric acid renal handling which consists of tubular reabsorption/secretion and glomerular filtration. In fact, reabsorption-related proteins include generally glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), and urate anion transporter 1 (URAT1). However, secretion-related transporters include OAT1, OAT3, multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [
