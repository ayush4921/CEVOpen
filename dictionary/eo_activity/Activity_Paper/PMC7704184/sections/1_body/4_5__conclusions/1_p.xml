<p>The present work showed that gout is treated with different methods used to block and inhibit uric acid secretion. The first strategy adopted by Moroccan people is based on medication uses which are associated with several adverse effects. However, the second method is more safe as it focused on the utilization of plants and their constituents that take an important place in Moroccan phytotherapy. In fact, this review classifies 23 species that have used traditionally in Morocco to treat gout and have shown experimentally significant xanthine oxidase inhibition: 
 <italic>Ailanthus altissima, Artemisia herba-alba, Capparis spinosa</italic> L
 <italic>., Caryophyllus aromaticus</italic> L
 <italic>., Citrullus colocynthis</italic> L

 <italic>., Lavandula angustifolia, Melissa officinalis</italic> L

 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L
 <italic>., Smilax officinalis., Smilax medica Schltdl. and Cham., Smilax syphilitica, Smilax aristolochiifolia Mill., Smilax febrifuga Kunth., Smilax regelii Killip and C.V. Morton, Smilax aspera L., Solidago virgaurea</italic> L
 <italic>., Thymus vulgaris</italic> L
 <italic>., Urtica dioica</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. However, several studies are needed to valorize these plants in order to use them to manage and maintain gout disease.
