<p>Several phytochemical studies have reported the presence of alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and tocopherols in 
 <italic>C. spinosa</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] that may act as xanthine oxidase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Fruits and leaves parts of this plant have shown the presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, particularly caffeic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, coumarin, ferulic acid, kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, resveratrol, rutin, syringic acid, and vanillic acid which possesses an important xanthine oxidase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Furthermore, the roots are characterized by the presence of capparispine, cadabicine 26-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside, capparispine 26-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside, stachydrine, and 3-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2-methyl-4H-1,4-benzoxazine-4-carbaldehyde [
