 <italic>Capparis spinosa L.</italic> is the plant that has shown the highest inhibitory effect on xanthine oxidase activity than the other plants. The chloroform and ethyl acetate aerial part extract have shown a lower value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> (0.023 and 0.09 mg/mL, respectively), followed by chloroform extract of root (0.32 mg/mL), which means that these extracts are characterized by a potential activity on xanthine oxidase effect [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay corresponds to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic reactions of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. It allows to investigate directly the effect of plants on the xanthine oxidase inhibition activity. These studies do not require the use of a high number of animals in tests. However, it does not take into account the bioavailability of the principles active agents. Therefore, in vitro analysis is not enough and must confirmed by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays; using the different experimental animal models of gout.
