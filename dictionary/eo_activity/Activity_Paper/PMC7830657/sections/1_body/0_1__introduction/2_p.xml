<p>In recent decades, many researchers have conducted phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>A. Herba-alba</italic> in several countries [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The terpenoid sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine, mainly found in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic>, is responsible for its medicinal properties [

 <italic>A. Herba-alba</italic> plants in Eilat and Judian desert region of Israel [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The monoterpenes and α- and β-thujones were dominant in Jordanian populations but sabinyl acetate, germacrene D, α-eudesmol and caryophyllene acetate were also identified [

 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus plants were reported to have antibacterial activity against some pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Very recent investigations from Egypt revealed two new antimicrobial compounds (metabolites), namely 1,3,8-trihydroxyeudesm-4-en-7α,11βH-12,6α-olide and 5-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-7-methoxy-6H-benzopyran-2-one from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Aforementioned researches evaluated basic phytochemical profile of the 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts, however, individual compounds responsible for the medicinal effects have not been extracted, and their characteristics are still to be documented.
