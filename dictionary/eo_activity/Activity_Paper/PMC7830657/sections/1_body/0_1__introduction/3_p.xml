<p>Thus, the aim of this study was to extract the fractions of different phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>Artemisia herba- alba</italic> (Wormwood) growing in Iraq by chromatographic methods, namely column chromatography (CC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against bacterial pathogens using the disc diffusion assay and TLC bioautography assay for checking the inhibitory effect of extracted phenolic compounds. The novelty of this study is that it describes for the first time use of Soxhlet apparatus for the extraction of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> plant.
