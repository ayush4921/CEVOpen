<p>Saponin (triterpenoid saponins) originated from 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> (Molina: widely found in Peru, Chile, and Bolivia) and differs from saponin with a yucca origin (steroidal saponins), and is mainly used as an adjuvant in veterinary vaccines [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Saponins are one of the phytochemical compounds in the yucca and Quillaja plants that consist of two parts: one is hydrophobic (a lipophilic nucleus, namely, the sapogenin) and the other is a hydrophilic carbohydrate side chain(s) or oligosaccharides, which explains the surfactant ability of these compounds [

Saponin binds with cholesterol in an insoluble compound that results from a lipophilic bond between the hydrophobic parts of saponins (sapogenin) and cholesterol (hydrophobic steroid or triterpenoid nucleus) in a stacked micellar aggregation, thus inhibiting the recycling of entero-hepatic cholesterol [

Yucca phenolic constituents include two stilbenes with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials, where the first is yuccaol A, B, C, D, and E (trans-3,3’,5,5’-tetrahydroxy-4’-methoxystilbene) and the second is resveratrol (trans-3,4’,5 tetraxydroxystilbene) [
