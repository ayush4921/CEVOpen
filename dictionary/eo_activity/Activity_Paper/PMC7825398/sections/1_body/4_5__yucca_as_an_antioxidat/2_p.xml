<p>A limited number of studies on the use of yucca and its products as an antioxidant in aquaculture have been done (
 <xref rid="animals-11-00093-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In this context, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] recorded an improvement in the total antioxidants capacity (TAC) of mirror carp (
 <italic>C. carpio</italic>) with the dietary incorporation of YSE, particularly at 400 mg/kg diet. Furthermore, all fish groups that received YSE showed lower malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to the control group; meanwhile, no significant alteration in SOD was found with YSE supplementations. Moreover, the relative expressions of mRNA of CuZn-SOD, CAT, GPx1a, and Nrf2 were increased with YSE inclusion, in contrast to the mRNA relative expression of Keap1 compared to the control group. Regarding Nile tilapia, Abdel-Tawwab et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported higher activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx, and a lower MDA value with YSE + yeast (
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) water additives at 1.0 g/L (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, Bae et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found that feeding olive flounder (
 <italic>P. olivaceus</italic>) on diets with Yucca meal at 1.5 mg/kg diet improved SOD and myeloperoxidase (MPO) compared to the control group. Furthermore, Amoah et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported an enhancement in SOD of juvenile Amur catfish (
 <italic>S. asotus</italic>) that were fed diets with 0.4% SG, 0.05% YM, 0.05% BG, and 0.05% SG + BG compared with the fish fed the control diet. In addition, Angeles Jr. et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported higher survival rates following a hypoxia challenge trial in Nile tilapia that were fed diets with 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> extract by 11% and with extracts mixture of 150 mg/kg 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> + 150 mg/kg 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> by 22% as compared to the control.
