<p>Moreover, Gaber [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] examined the full substitution of fish meal protein in the control group (FMC) with the meal of soybean, cottonseed, sunflower, or linseed supplemented with YSE on the growth of Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) with an initial weight of 14.2 Â± 2.9 g for 6 months. The results of the YSE supplementation with plant-protein-based diets exhibited growth performances that did not differ (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) from that of fish fed FMC + YSE while differing (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the control and linseed meal (LSM) diets. All groups fed diets with YSE showed a higher apparent protein digestibility coefficient, whole-body protein content, and lower whole-body lipid content compared to the control. Moreover, El-Saidy and Gaber [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] examined the dietary supplementation of graded levels of 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> powder (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, or 1500 mg/kg diet) on 
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic> that were about 16.82 g (initial body weight). The results of the 30-week feeding trial showed that 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> supplementation at levels of 750 or 1000 mg/kg diet enhanced the final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), SGR, FER, and PER compared to the control group. Fish groups that received diets with yucca exhibited a higher apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of protein and lipid.
