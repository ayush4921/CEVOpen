<p>In addition, Kelly and Kohler [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] investigated the impact of a feeding regime with YSE (0, 0.01, or 0.1 g/kg diet) on the growth performance of post-yolk-sac and juvenile channel catfish (
 <italic>I. punctatus</italic>). After the 12-week feeding period, post-yolk-sac channel catfish fry fed the YSE had the highest weight gain compared to the control. Furthermore, Francis et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] tested the dietary supplementation (0, 150, or 300 mg/kg diet) of a saponin mixture on common carp (
 <italic>C. carpio</italic> L.) with a 19 g initial weight for 8 weeks. The highest weight gain and protein utilization were observed with 150 mg/kg compared with other groups. The best results for the FCR and metabolic growth rate were with the 150 mg/kg supplementation. In addition, Francis et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] studied the incorporation of a Quillaja saponin (QS) mixture at the level of 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg in the diets of tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) for 14 weeks. The results of the tilapia performance that showed the highest weight gain, average values for energy retention, and apparent lipid conversion were in the group supplemented with 300 mg/kg.
