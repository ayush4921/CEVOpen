<p>Furthermore, Elkhayat et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] studied the responses of European seabass (
 <italic>D. labrax</italic>) with an initial weight of 5.00 ± 0.5 g to YSE supplementation at concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 g/kg diet. The results of the 45-day feeding trial showed amelioration in weight and FCR, particularly at the level of the 1.00 g/kg diet. Likewise, Njagi et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] examined the effect of dietary Yucca meal (YMS) at levels of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% on the growth of Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>, 3.8 ± 0.05 g) for 10 weeks. The results of this trial showed an improved growth performance and whole-body protein content with 0.1% YMS compared with the control. In addition, Angeles Jr. et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the impact of a 6-week feeding trial with 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> and/or extracts at the level of 150 mg/kg diet on Nile tilapia’s (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>, 1.9 ± 0.08 g initial body weight) growth and survival rate. The growth results of the fish group fed an extracts mixture of 150 mg/kg 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> + 150 mg/kg 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> were significantly higher compared to the control groups. However, no differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in survival rates was found between the groups. Consistent with these results, Güroy et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] performed a 12-week feeding trial to determine the impact of YSE (0, 0.075, 0.1, or 0.15%) in a practical diet on the growth of striped catfish (
 <italic>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</italic>, initial mean weight 1.78 ± 0.05 g). The dietary incorporation of YSE at a high level of 0.15% improved the SGR and decreased the FCR.
