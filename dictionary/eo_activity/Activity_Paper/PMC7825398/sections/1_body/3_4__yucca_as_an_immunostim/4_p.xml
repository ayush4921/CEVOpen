<p>Regarding Nile tilapia, Abdel-Tawwab et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported an improvement in blood profile (increasing serum total lipids, total protein, albumin, and globulin, and decreasing aspartate aminotransferase, uric acid, and creatinine) in response to YSE and/or the yeast 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a water treatment. Moreover, Njagi et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found an improvement in the immunity of Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) in terms of plasma LYZ activity, respiratory burst activity (NBT), and resistance against 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> with the addition of YMS at the level of 0.1% and linked the obtained results to the ability of saponin to form immunostimulatory complexes. Furthermore, Amoah et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] evaluated the impact of the dietary additives of 0.4% Song-gang
 <sup>®</sup> stone (SG), 0.05% Yucca meal (YM), and 0.05% β-glucan (BG) on the innate immunity of juvenile Amur catfish (
 <italic>Silurus asotus</italic>) with an initial weight of 4.95 ± 0.05 g for 8 weeks. The results of the lysozyme activity were higher in fish fed the SG, YM, and SG + BG diets than those of fish fed the control diet. All experimental groups showed no adverse impacts in terms of blood health. Similarly, Güroy et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] concluded that the dietary incorporation of YSE at a high level of 0.15% improved some hematological parameters of striped catfish (
 <italic>P. hypophthalmus</italic>). Moreover, Fayed et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that the presence of YSE in water improves the blood profile and immunity of European seabass juveniles in terms of white blood cells count (WBCs), red blood cells count (RBCs), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocytes, and neutrophils, as well as plasma LYZ activity, particularly at a high level of yucca extract (0.75 mg/L). Similar results were obtained by Reham et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] for Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>, 51 g initial weight) hematology following a YSE implementation in water for 93 days.
