 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], tremendous efforts are requested from primary animal protein producers (poultry, livestock, and aquaculture sectors) to guarantee sufficient protein amounts at low cost [

Recently, food security agencies have called for limiting the usage of antibiotics and chemotherapies in poultry, livestock, and aquaculture production due to their negative impact on natural immunity, either in the animals or the human body and their hazardous environmental risks [
