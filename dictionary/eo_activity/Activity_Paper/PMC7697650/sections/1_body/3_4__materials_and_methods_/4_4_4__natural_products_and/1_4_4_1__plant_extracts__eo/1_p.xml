 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00790-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), kuraridin and emodin, were obtained from the library of KIST Gangneung Institute of Natural Products. Except for 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> cassia (L.) J.Presl (BEA585A1), extracts were prepared by heat reflux extraction performed with a 10-g dried plant and 0.1 L ethanol for 2 h, twice. The ethyl acetate extract of BEA585A1 was obtained by fractionation with ethyl acetate from the water extract of dried bark of cinnamon, prepared with water reflux for 2 h. Essential oils (clove, cinnamon bark), pure phytochemicals (eugenol, trans (E)-Cinnamaldehyde, and baicalein), and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of the plant extracts and EOs were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). Antibiotics were dissolved as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Ciprofloxacin and erythromycin were dissolved in 0.1 N HCl and 70% ethanol, respectively. Gentamicin and tetracycline were dissolved in water, while nalidixic acid was dissolved in DMSO. The solutions of antibiotics were filter-sterilized before being used.
