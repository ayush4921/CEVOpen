<p>For 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains, the MIC values for extracts were from 200–800 µg/mL, with 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> being the most active against all the four strains (MIC: 200 µg/mL). The MIC value for the other extracts was 400 µg/mL, except for 
 <italic>Mentha canadensis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Salvia plebeia</italic> R.Br. against CJ–CI, which had higher values (MIC: 800 µg/mL). The MIC values for EOs, pure phytochemicals, and ERY were the same for both CJ–RS and CJ–CI. In contrast, CJ–CI showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline while CJ–RS was sensitive to all antimicrobials (
