<p>The isolates from chicken were sensitive to erythromycin and gentamicin, but they were resistant to quinolones and tetracycline. The mutations in 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A and 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The tested NPs were active against both antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains. Effective NPs can be exploited by the food processing industry and poultry farms to control foodborne pathogens. There is a need to understand the mode of action of these NPs before they are used in clinical settings.
