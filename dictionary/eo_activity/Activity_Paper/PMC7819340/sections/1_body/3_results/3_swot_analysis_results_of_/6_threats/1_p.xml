   <p id="Par94">Legislative and regulatory restrictions related to CBMP in Ukraine can considerably reduce their availability for patients, as well as the investment appeal of potential markets. However, a non-regulated or poorly regulated market, the CBD-products market in particular, can initiate distribution of low quality products, aggressive promotion and consumers cheating on actual cannabinoids content and other negative after-effects (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2019</xref>).

   <p id="Par95">Despite the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) recommendations to transfer cannabis, cannabis resin, extracts and tincture of cannabis, as well as of THC and its isomers to less regulated Schedule of the 1961 Convention, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs has not yet taken a positive decision on this issue (Walsh et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>). This factor plays a negative role in liberalization of medical cannabis in Ukraine on the part of state policymakers.

   <p id="Par96">The lack of one-for-all approach to regulate the world cannabis products market, including the medical cannabis market (for instance, the definition of maximum allowable THC rate in various countries is based rather on political decisions than on scientific ones) (Clark et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). Each country independently chooses approaches to regulate medical cannabis flow: the majority considers Conventions’ requirements, and some states which legalized cannabis for recreational purposes (Canada, Uruguay, some states of the USA) even contradict them.

   <p id="Par97">Foreign registered medicinal products containing both herbal and synthetic cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabiximols, nabilon, CBD) are usually characterized by a high cost which can influence their economic availability for Ukrainian patients (Aliekperova 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). Besides, the CBMP market belongs to emerging markets which is characterized by enhanced activity with intellectual property (Hahn 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). This allows Big Pharma to strengthen their competitive positions, which will have a negative effect on the development of a domestic market (Prohibition Partners 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>). Thus, starting with the early 1990s, pharmaceutical giants like AbbVie, Sanofi, Merck, GW Pharmaceuticals started the process of patent covering of the results relating to cannabinoids’ effect on a human organism (Reuters Graphics

   <p id="Par98">Considering a low availability of opioid analgesics in Ukraine because healthcare specialists (physicians, pharmacists) are not ready to prescribe and dispense them in a necessary quantity for patients, there are risks relating to medical cannabis too (Institute of Analysis and Advocacy 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). These risks include health professionals having lack of motivation, necessary knowledge, skills and qualification concerning these preparations. An insufficient evidence base is another risk factor in prescribing preparations of medical cannabis.

   <p id="Par99">The existence of illicit cannabis market in Ukraine threatens development of the medical cannabis market, especially at initial stages: established channels and distribution system, more affordable prices, obtaining the product without prescription, absence of bureaucratic procedures, etc. However, without a systematic approach to drug policy it is impossible to give up a ‘total ban’, according to recommendations of the International Commission of Drug Policy (Global Commission on Drug Policy 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>).
