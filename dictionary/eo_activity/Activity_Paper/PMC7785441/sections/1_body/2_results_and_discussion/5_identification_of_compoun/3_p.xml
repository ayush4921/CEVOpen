<p id="p0150">After comprehensive survey of literature it was known that these organic compounds were not earlier reported from leaves, flower and root extracts of 
 <italic>B. Variegata</italic>, therefore our claim for first time investigation of these compounds from flower of extracts of 
 <italic>B. Variegata</italic> is strongly justified. Hence according to our results presence of biologically important organic compounds in 
 <italic>B. Variegata</italic> is a good proof for the use of this extract in folk medicines against human disorders (

 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>40</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) is a very important organic compound that is not reported largely from plant extracts but scientists believed this compound have very important role to prevent many human disease. Fatty acids reduce oxidative stress by playing an important role in the functionality of liver cells during injury (
