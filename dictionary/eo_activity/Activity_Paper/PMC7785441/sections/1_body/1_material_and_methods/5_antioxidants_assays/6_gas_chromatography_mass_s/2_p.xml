<p id="p0080">GC–MS model QP2010 (Shimadzu®) equipped with following specifications; RTx- 5MS capillary column (cross bond 5% diphenyl – 95% dimethylpolysiloxane), film thickness (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and carrier gas (helium) in split less inject mode @ 250 °C. Provisions of column include 1.2 ml/min flow rate @ linear velocity mode, oven temperature programmed@150 °C for 1 min and then at 4 °C /min to 150 °C for10 min. Volume of injection (0.2 µl), 50:1 split ratio and injector temperature (275 °C) with N2 carrier gas (1.0 ml/min).A mass spectrum was operated at 70 eV electron ionization in SIM (Selected Ion Monitoring) manner and ions were taken (
