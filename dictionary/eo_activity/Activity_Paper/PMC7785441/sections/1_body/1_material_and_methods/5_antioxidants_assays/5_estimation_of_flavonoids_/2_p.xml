<p id="p0075">HPLC analysis was performed via Shimadzu HPLC system (Tokyo, Japan) specified with C18 column (250 × 4.5 mm, 5 m), gradient pump with detector (UV/Visible). Biocompounds were extracted by different mobile phases (Acetonitrile &amp; 0.1% phosphoric acid with the ratio of 36:64), and the taken volume of injection was 20 µl. Quercetin from the samples was quantified at 285 nm per flow rate (1 ml/min). The standard used in above analysis was Quercetin and all the measurements were taken in triplicates.</p>
