<p>Muliyah 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] conducted an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic>’ stem as a proposed mechanism for its antidiarrheal activity. Antibacterial activity was assayed on the Gram-negative bacilli 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and the Gram-positive cocci 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> following the well diffusion approach. Samples of different concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/mL) were tested, using the solvent 10% dimethyl sulfoxide as the control and the antibiotic tetracycline as a positive control. All concentrations of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic>’ stem extracts showed antibacterial activity against both 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, with the later more sensitive than the former (i.e., has larger inhibition zone).[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Moreover, Guzman and Padilla[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have reported the quorum sensing inhibitory activity to the methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves against the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic>, with minimum quorum sensing inhibitory concentration (MQSIC) of 500 mg/mL as compared to the positive control (
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> extract), which have shown MQSIC of 125 mg/mL.
