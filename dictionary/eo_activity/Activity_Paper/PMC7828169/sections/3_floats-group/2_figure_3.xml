  <p>Effect of argan leaves extract (ALE) on melanogenic enzymes TYR, TRP1, and DCT expression level, determined by Western blot analysis. Western blot bands (
   <bold>A</bold>) and the corresponding densitometric values (
   <bold>B</bold>) are presented. B16 melanoma cells were treated without (Control) or withα-MSH (0.2 µM) or ALE (30 µg/mL) and incubated for 72 h. Values are mean ± SD derived from three independent experiments; different letters on the histograms indicate significant difference between treatments (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (ANOVA Tukey’s test). The protein bands intensities of TYR, TRP1, and DCT were obtained using Li-COR Software.
