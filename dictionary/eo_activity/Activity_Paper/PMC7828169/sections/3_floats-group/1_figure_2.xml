  <p>Melanin content and cell viability of argan leaves extract (ALE)-treated or α MSH-treated B16 cells. Cells were treated without (control) or with α-MSH (0.2 µM) or ALE (10, 20 and 30 µg/mL) for 48 h and 72 h. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Melanin content of the cells treated with ALE. Cells treated with 0.2 µM α-MSH served as a positive control. The synthesized melanin and total number of cells were measured as described in Materials and Methods. The bar graph indicates the melanin content (left-hand y-axis) while the line graph indicates cell viability (right-hand y-axis). The results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; different letters on the histograms indicate significant difference between treatments (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (ANOVA Tukey’s test). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Photograph of extracted melanin pellet from B16 cells treated without (control) or with α-MSH (0.2 µM), or ALE (10, 20 and 30 µg/mL). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Images of B16 cells treated without or with ALE or α-MSH (400× magnification).
