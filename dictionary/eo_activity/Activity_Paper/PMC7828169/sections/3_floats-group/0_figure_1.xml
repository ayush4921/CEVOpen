  <p>Cytotoxicity of argan leaves extract (ALE) on B16 cells. Cells were incubated with ALE at different concentrations (1, 2, 10, 20, 100, and 200 µg/mL) for 48 h. Values represent the percentage of cell proliferation relative to the control, expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. * Statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) versus the non-treated control (ANOVA, Tukey’s test).
