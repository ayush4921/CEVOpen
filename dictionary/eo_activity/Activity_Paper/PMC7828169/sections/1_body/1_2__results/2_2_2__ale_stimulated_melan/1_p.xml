<p>The melanin content of ALE-treated cells was significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity, compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00371-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Melanin content in B16 cells treated for 72 h with 10, 20, and 30 µg/mL of ALE was increased by 65%, 83%, and 101%, respectively. When compared to the positive control, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which increased the melanin content in melanoma cells by 58% vs. control, ALE at 20 and 30 µg/mL had higher melanogenesis stimulation activity. The color of the melanin pellet from ALE-treated B16 cells clearly showed that the melanin content was markedly increased by ALE (
