<p>The results of different antioxidant assays showed that ALE exhibited important 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) free radicals scavenging activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.508 ± 0.016 mg/mL, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.373 ± 0.001 mg/mL, respectively) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00371-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This antioxidant activity of ALE, however, is still lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or ascorbic acid. The ability of ALE to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form was also evaluated. The reducing power of ALE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.316 ± 0.001 mg/mL) was higher than that of BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.354 ± 0.011 mg/mL), while ascorbic acid showed higher activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.070 ± 0.011 mg/mL). The β-carotene bleaching assay was used to estimate the inhibition of linoleic acid’s peroxidation by ALE and the results showed that ALE exhibited significant lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.679 ± 0.070 mg/mL), which was lower than that of BHT.
