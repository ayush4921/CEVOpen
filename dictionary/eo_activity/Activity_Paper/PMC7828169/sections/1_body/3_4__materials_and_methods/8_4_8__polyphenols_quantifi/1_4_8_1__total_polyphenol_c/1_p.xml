<p>Total polyphenol content (TPC) of ALE was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the method of Catalano et al., with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, ALE (0.1 mL) was dissolved in distilled water (3.9 mL). Folinâ€“Ciocalteu reagent (0.1 mL) was added to the solution and allowed to stand for 3 min. After the addition of 1 mL of a 20% anhydrous sodium carbonate solution (

Total polyphenol content was determined using a standard curve prepared with tyrosol. The results are expressed as mg of tyrosol equivalents (TYE) per gram of dry matter (DM).
