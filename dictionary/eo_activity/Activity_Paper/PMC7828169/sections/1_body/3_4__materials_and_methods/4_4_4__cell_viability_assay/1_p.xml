<p>Cell viability and proliferation were investigated using MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In brief, after seeding and incubating the B16 cells in 96-well plates at 3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well for 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing ALE at various concentrations (1, 2, 10, 20, 100 and 200 µg/mL). After incubation for 48 h, 10 µL MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added. The plates were then covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 6 h. SDS (10%) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Powerscan HT, Dainippon Pharmaceuticals USA Corporation, NJ, USA). Blanks, containing only medium, MTT, and SDS were used to correct the absorbance. The absorbance of the control cells was set as 100% cell proliferation.
