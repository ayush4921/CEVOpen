<p>There are some limitations that should be considered when comparing results of these studies with regard to the content and composition of polyphenols in argan leaves and their antioxidant activity. The synthesis of the secondary metabolites by plants is an ingenious strategy used by plants to control their environment and to adapt to biotic and abiotic conditions [
