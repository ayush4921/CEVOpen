<p>Crushed powdered leaves of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> (1 g) were subjected to extraction. The extraction was conducted by sonication. The powdered leaves were immersed in 30 mL of methanol–water at various ratios (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and allowed to sonicate for 30 min. Subsequently, the extracts were filtered using Whatman filter paper No.1. A rotary evaporator was used at 40 °C to remove the solvent. To clear any residual solvents, the extracts were then freeze-dried and stored at −80 °C. For this study, a total of 20 samples were prepared (4 replicates for each of the 5 separate extracts).
