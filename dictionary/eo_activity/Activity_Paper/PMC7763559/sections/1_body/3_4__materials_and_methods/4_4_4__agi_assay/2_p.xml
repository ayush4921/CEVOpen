<p>The sample was prepared following the same preparation protocol for quercetin. While the negative control was prepared by replacing the sample with DMSO. A total of 10 µL of the samples, quercetin and DMSO; 100 µL of 30 mM phosphate buffer and 15 µL of 0.02 U/µL AG enzyme were transferred into 96-well plate. A blank was prepared following the same protocol but without the enzyme. The samples and the blank mixture were both incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then treated with 75 μL of PNPG, followed by addition of glycine (pH 10) and another incubation time of 15 min at room temperature to stop the reaction. The absorbance reading was recorded at 405 nm by the microplate reader (Tecan Nanoquant Infinite M200, Männedorf, Switzerland). The inhibition percentage was obtained from the following equation:
 <disp-formula>Inhibition activity (%) = [(A
  <sub>control</sub> − A
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A
  <sub>control</sub>] × 100%
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where, the absorbance of the negative control is A
 <sub>control</sub>, and the absorbance of a sample or positive control is A
 <sub>sample</sub>.
