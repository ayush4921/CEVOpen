<p>The method reported by Javadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was followed with minor modifications. Quercetin (2 mg in 1 mL DMSO) and 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-nitrophenyl-
 <italic>ρ</italic>-D-glucopyranosidase (PNPG, 6 mg in 20 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) were used as the positive control and substrate, respectively. The yeast, glucosidase, was used in this study under the consideration that its substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and optimum pH are similar to the mammalian glucosidase [
