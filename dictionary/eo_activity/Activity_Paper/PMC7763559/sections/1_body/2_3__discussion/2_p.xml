<p>The loading scatter plot obtained using OPLS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) pinpointed three putative compounds correlating to the AGI activity of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves. The presence of these compounds in this plant had not been recorded elsewhere; thus, this study reports it for the first time. The presence of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> has been reported by Sutradhar et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], who isolated it from the methanol and water extract of 
 <italic>Sida cordifolia</italic>. Linn. aerial sections. This compound was reported to possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in an animal model [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although no research has been performed on the anti-diabetic effect of this compound, the plant (
 <italic>S. cordifolia</italic>) that is rich in this compound has been shown to ellicit both hypoglycemic and antioxidant activities [
