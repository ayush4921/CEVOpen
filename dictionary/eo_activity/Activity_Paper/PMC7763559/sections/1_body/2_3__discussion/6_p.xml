<p>The 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isomaltase is made up of 589 amino acids. It consists of three domains, namely domain A (1–113 and 190–512), domain B (114–189) and domain C (513–589) [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. There are three catalytic residues ASP215, GLU277 and ASP352, which are situated on the side of the C-terminal of domain A [
