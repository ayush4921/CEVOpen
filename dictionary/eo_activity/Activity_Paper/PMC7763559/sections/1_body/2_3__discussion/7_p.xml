<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> showed higher binding affinities than ADG, but slightly lower binding affinities compared to that of quercetin. Good binding affinity of these compounds to the active site of the enzyme was indicated, which is the same site used by ADG [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among the seven residues that are involved in the binding of ADG towards the AG enzyme, three residues (ASP352, GLH277, and ARG442) were involved in the interactions with compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, however, no active site residues of the control ligand interacted with compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. This might explain the difference in the binding affinity (0.7 kca/mol) between compound 
 <bold>1</bold> and compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. It is anticipated that once the enzymeâ€™s active site is blocked, the enzyme is unable to break down carbohydrates, resulting in lower quantities of glucose absorption and eventually lower blood glucose levels [
