 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition (AGI) activity of five extracts of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves at the assay concentration of 10 µg/mL. The highest AGI activity (93.1% inhibition) was shown by 100% methanol, followed by the 25% methanol extract with an AGI activity of 73.5% inhibition. However, the AGI activity of the 25% methanol was not statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from 50% methanol (61.6% inhibition). The AGI activity of 50% methanol and water extract (61.2% inhibition) was not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but was lower than that of the 25% methanol extract. The lowest AGI activity was shown by the 75% methanol extract (48.5% inhibition). The AGI activity of the different 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extracts exhibited the following trend: 100 &gt; 25 &gt; 50 &gt; 0 &gt; 75% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> methanol extract.
