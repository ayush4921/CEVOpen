<p>The Y-axis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f002">Figure 2</xref>A represents the variation explained by the calibration model, while the R
 <sup>2</sup>(cum)progression is the degree of variation that can be explained by each of the components. The variation was calculated as a cumulative score and thus, described in a progression manner. The OPLS model produced four principal components (PC), explaining 91% of the total variation (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). PC1 explained the largest variation of the samples (58%), while PC2, PC3, and PC4 represented 16%, 29%, and 33% of the sample variation, respectively. The difference between the R
 <sup>2</sup>Y and Q
 <sup>2</sup>Y of all the PCs in this study was not larger than 0.3, confirming the validation of this multivariable calibration model, according to Eriksson et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another validity evaluation of this model was performed through the analysis of the regression coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) between the predicted and actual AGI activities of the samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The R
 <sup>2</sup> value obtained was 0.91, indicating the validity of this model since it was higher than 0.90 [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The permutation test showed that the R
 <sup>2</sup>Y and Q
 <sup>2</sup>Y intercept values of this model were lower than 0.4 and 0.05, respectively, confirming that this calibration model was valid [
