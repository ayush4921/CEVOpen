<p>All of the three identified compounds exerted greater binding affinity towards the enzyme than that of the control ligand. Among the three identified compounds, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> showed the highest binding affinity towards the enzyme, with -10.00 kcal/mol. It also had a higher binding affinity value when compared to quercetin (−8.4 kcal/mol). In contrast, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> showed binding affinities of −8.3 and −7.6 kcal/mol, respectively, which are lower than that of quercetin. The superimposed 3D docking visualization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) describes the predicted binding site of the three identified compounds, quercetin, and the control ligand (ADG) in the enzymatic protein. According to the figure, all compounds are predicted to bind at domain A of the enzyme, where the catalytic site is located. The same site is also occupied by ADG and quercetin, suggesting that a similar inhibition mechanism might be followed by the identified compounds.
