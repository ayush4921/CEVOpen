<p>In the docked complex of compound 
 <bold>3</bold>–AG enzyme, the hydroxyl moiety of the aromatic ring of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> showed interactions with HIS280 and GLU279 residues through hydrogen bonding at distances of 2.78 Å and 2.58 Å, respectively. The aromatic ring of the phenolic and the aliphatic moieties of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> were observed to involve pi–pi t-shaped and pi–alkyl interactions with TYR158. On the other hand, ASP352 and protonated ASP215 showed a pi–anion, and ARG442 showed a pi–cation interaction with the aromatic segment of compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. Furthermore, the aromatic moiety of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> also interacted with the TYR72 residue through a pi–pi t-shaped interaction. ARG315 interacted with the alicyclic moiety of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> through two alkyl interactions at a distance of 4.50 Å and 3.84 Å (
