<p>Molecular docking was performed on the three compounds that were identified using LC-MS based metabolomics to identify a potential binding mode of the compounds that could justify their inhibitory activity. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05885-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the binding affinities of the control ligand, the detected bioactive compounds and the standard competitive inhibitor (quercetin) towards the AG enzyme. A control docking procedure was performed using the co-crystallized control ligand, alpha-D-glucose (ADG) in order to validate the docking parameters, while quercetin was used as a comparison with the identified compounds. In this work, the complex with a more negative value (i.e., stronger binding affinity) is considered as the best-docked complex. The re-docked ADG was found to bind with 3A4A in a manner identitical to its crystallographic configuration. The value of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the re-docked ADG was found to be 0.633 Å, suggesting that the chosen docking parameters are able to reproduce the crystallised conformation. The docking parameters are considered to be acceptable if the RMSD value of the redocked ligand, with respect to the crystallised one, is less than 1.5 Å [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The control docking showed that the control ligand exerts a binding affinity of −6.0 kcal.mol towards the enzyme. Seven amino acid residues (ASP352, GLH277, ASH215, HIE112, ASH69, ARG442, HIE351) were involved in the hydrogen bond interactions with ADG. For quercetin, it exerts the binding affinity of −8.4 kcal/mol. The binding is assisted by two residues (ASH215, GLH277) via a hydrogen bond and three residues (PHE303, ASP352, and ARG442) via other types of interactions.
