<p>Three models have been used to test the antimalarial effect of the plant, one model being the four-day suppressive test. This test evaluates the potential schizontocidal activity of test compounds [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and using this model, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Leonotis ocymifolia</italic> had a maximum suppression of 41.4% at 800â€‰mg/kg. Compounds that reduce parasitemia load by 30% or more are considered as having schizontocidal activity against malaria [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By this standard, the hydroalcoholic extract of the plant can be considered to be active in its schizontocidal activity against malaria. In this test, maximum parasite suppression was achieved by positive control (chloroquine). The significantly lower parasitemia suppression by the extract compared to the positive control could be due to low level of active compound(s) associated with the crude nature of the extract [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The higher doses of the extract, compared to the negative control, had resulted in significantly higher survival time. This relationship of dose-versus-survival time may be related with the higher degree parasite suppression which, hence, resulted in mitigation of its deleterious pathologic consequences [
