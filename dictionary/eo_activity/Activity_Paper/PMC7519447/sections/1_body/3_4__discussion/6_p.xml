<p>Weight decrement is another typical symptom of malaria and has been associated with decreased food intake, disturbed metabolic function, and hypoglycemia [

The extract was able to decrease, albeit not significant, the level of parasitemia compared to negative control. This failure to prevent weight reduction may be related with saponins and tannins that the plant contains saponins are known to hinder protein utilization by inhibiting digestive enzymes such as trypsin and/or by forming saponin-protein complexes Similarly, tannins, through formation of protein-tannin complexes, may have diminished nutrient utilization and reduced food intake [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is similar with the findings of other plants such as 
 <italic>Dodonaea angustifolia</italic> seed extract [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]and 
 <italic>Calpurnia aurea</italic> leaf extract [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]where these plants had significant parasitemia suppression but were unable to prevent the drop of weight.
