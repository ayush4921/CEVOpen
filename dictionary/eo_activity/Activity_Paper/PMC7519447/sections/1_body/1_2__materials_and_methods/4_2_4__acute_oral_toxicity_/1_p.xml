 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Five female albino mice were used for the test. All animals were fasted for 3 h before and 1 h after the administration of the extract. First, one animal was administered 2 gm/kg. Since no death was observed within 24 h, additional four animals were added and administered the same dose. The animals were observed continuously for 4 h with a 30 min interval whether they show hair erection, tremors, convulsions, salivation, lacrimation, diarrhea, lethargy, and reduction in feeding as well as mortality and then followed for 14 consecutive days with an interval of 24 h.
