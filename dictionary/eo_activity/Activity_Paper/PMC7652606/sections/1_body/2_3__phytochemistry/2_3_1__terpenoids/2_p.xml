<p>Naturally occurring triterpenoids from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> usually possess a carboxylic group at the C-28 position, along with the additional hydroxy or carboxylic or epoxy at various positions. Noticeably, there have been several compounds, in which an intramolecular ester (lactone) functionality can be observed (
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>21</bold>). Besides that, three lupane-type triterpenoids (
 <bold>23</bold>â€“
 <bold>25</bold>) and two unusual megastigmane derivatives (
 <bold>73</bold> and 
 <bold>74</bold>) were also isolated and structurally elucidated (
