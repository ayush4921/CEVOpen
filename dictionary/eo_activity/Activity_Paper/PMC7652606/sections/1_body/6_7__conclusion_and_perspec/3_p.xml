<p>Antiviral activities of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> also showed very promising results in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> setups, especially against influenza viruses (H1N1 and H9N2), which supported the traditional use of the plant against influenza. However, further animal and clinical studies are required before any clinical recommendation is made. Besides that, further pharmacological studies should focus on bioactivities of triterpenoids, phloroglucinols, and other flavonoid derivatives, which are also the major constituents of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> with undiscovered bioactive potentials.
