 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract and its major compound, DMC, were also investigated for pharmacological properties in various bioassays. The most noticeable bioactivities that should be mentioned are anticancer, antiviral, and antidiabetic activities. DMC showed potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines via different mechanisms of action. In addition, DMC was found to reverse the drug-resistant abilities of cancer cells and significantly improve the anticancer effects of well-known drugs, such as 5-FU, doxorubicin, and Taxol. Some research groups successfully exploited the simplicity of the C-methylated chalcone backbone to synthesize analogues for significantly improved anticancer activities. This approach can be considered a promising direction for novel anticancer agent discovery.
