<p>Compound 
 <bold>35</bold> was first isolated and structurally elucidated by Ye et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with moderate anticancer activities. In order to shed light on the structure-activity relationship of bioactive chalcones from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>, Zhuo et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] proposed a concise synthesis of 3′-formyl-4′,6′-dihydroxy-2′-methoxy-5′-methylchalcone (
 <bold>35</bold>) and its series of B-ring-modified analogues from 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone. The results showed that the analogue with bromide substitution at C-4 on B-ring exhibited a significant improved antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 10.8 ± 0.9 to 20.2 ± 1.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, which was 10 times more potent compared to the lead compound (
 <bold>35</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another synthetic study, Wang's group dealt with the hydrophobic nature of DMC, which made the compound barely soluble in water, leading to the limited application for future clinical use. The authors synthesized a series of DMC analogues with different ionizable groups, which improved significantly hydrophilic properties of the DMC scaffold, as well as anticancer activities against various types of cancer cells [
