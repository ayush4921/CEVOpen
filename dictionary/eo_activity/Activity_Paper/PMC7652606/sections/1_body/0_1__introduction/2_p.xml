<p>In the period of 2002–2019, phytochemical studies have identified a total of 86 natural compounds from leaves and flower buds of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic>. The main components of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> were determined as oleanane-and ursane-type triterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], C-methylated flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and polycyclic phloroglucinols [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Of these, C-methylated chalcones were considered as major and pharmacologically responsible constituents of this medicinal plant. 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> crude extract and its major constituent, 2′, 4′-dihydroxy-6′-methoxy-3′, 5′-dimethylchalcone (or DMC), were also examined in a variety of pharmacological assays. To a certain extent, some pharmacological effects explained the medicinal uses of this plant in folklore medicine, such as antiviral [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, other interesting bioactivities were also discovered, such as anticancer [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] properties, which greatly contributed to the potential clinical application of this plant.
