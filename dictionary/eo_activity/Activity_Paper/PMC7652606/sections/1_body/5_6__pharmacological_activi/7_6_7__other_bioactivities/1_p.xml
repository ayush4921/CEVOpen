<p>The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> was found to improve the contraction of isolated rat heart, specifically increasing the contractility and reducing the contractile frequency pattern. A follow-up molecular experiment demonstrated that 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> water extract inhibited Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump activities in a dose-dependent manner, which can explain the observed positive inotropic effects of the extract. The negative chronotropic effects were determined to relate with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPases, which eventually decreases the heart rate. The study suggested that the underlying mechanism of cardiotonic action of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> is more complex than that of ouabain, a well-known cardiac glycoside [
