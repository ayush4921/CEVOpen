<p>The antiviral properties of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> and its phenolic components were also investigated. Oh's group conducted bioactivity-directed isolation to identify the responsible compounds from 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> flower buds by H1N1 neuraminidase inhibition assay. The most active compounds in H1N1 neuraminidase (wild type) assay were identified as C-methylated flavonoids with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8.15 ± 1.05 to 93.77 ± 5.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Interestingly, when tested on H274Y-mutant type (oseltamivir-resistant type), these compounds exhibited 2.46–7.00 times more potent, which was opposite to the oseltamivir case. Kinetic studies also revealed the underlying mechanism of these compounds as noncompetitive inhibitory mode [

 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> leaves were also found to inhibit the enzymatic activity of influenza neuraminidase. Noticeably, besides the C-methylated flavonoids, glycosides (
 <bold>45</bold> and 
 <bold>47</bold>) were also active against neuraminidase [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A phloroglucinol-focused fractionation with the direction of QTOF/MS on 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> leaves led to the isolation of four novel phloroglucinol compounds (
 <bold>82</bold>–
 <bold>85</bold>). Among them, cleistoperlone A (
 <bold>82</bold>) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects on HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type-1) in a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.50 ± 1.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and SI &gt;13.33 [
