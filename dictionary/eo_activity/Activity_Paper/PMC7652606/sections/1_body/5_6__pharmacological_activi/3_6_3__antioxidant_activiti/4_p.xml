<p>With the very high content of phenolic compounds, 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract has shown potent antioxidant effects in various bioassays. The fruit extract showed its renal protection from cadmium intoxication in the rat model while DMC was found to protect endothelial cells and hepatocytes from H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced injuries. Since antioxidant activity is related to a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective activities, the potent antioxidant activity may provide research ideas and directions for exploring other pharmacological effects of the plant and its constituents.
