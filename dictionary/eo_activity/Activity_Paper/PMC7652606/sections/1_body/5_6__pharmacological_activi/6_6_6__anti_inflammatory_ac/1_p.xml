<p>The major component, DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>), was studied for its anti-inflammatory activities in multiple pathways. DMC was found to downregulate the expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> (tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic>), IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> (interleukine-1
 <italic>β</italic>), IL-6 (interleukine-6), and HMGB1 (High mobility group box 1), and reduce their production time- and dose-dependently in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. The detailed mechanistic study indicated that DMC suppressed the secretion of HMGB1, blocked the translocation of nucleocytoplasmic HMGB1, and interfered with the PI3K-PDK1-PKC
 <italic>α</italic> signaling pathway [

 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract and DMC were also shown to attenuate LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the production of inflammatory and proinflammatory mediators and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in macrophages. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments showed that the oral administration of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> extract (100–200 mg/kg) reduced the mortality rate of experimental septic mice (60–80% survival rate), compared to 80% mortality rate in the control group. Histopathological examination also revealed the extract (200 mg/kg) ameliorated the swelling of the alveolar wall, alveolar congestion, and hepatic tissue damage in the experimental mice [
