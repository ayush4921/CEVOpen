<p>However, there does exist inconsistency among reported data on cytotoxicity of DMC in the same cancer cells from independent pharmacological studies [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The variation in IC
 <sub>50</sub> may be due to the differences in the evaluation methods. Currently, the most common method for cytotoxicity measurement is the MTT assay, which was applied to identify the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of DMC in a study by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, Chailungka et al. used the TCA method, in which treated cells were trypsinized and resettled in the new culture plates before the TCA measurement [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consequently, a more complicated process may result in differences in IC
 <sub>50</sub> identification. Furthermore, the concentration of DMSO is also an issue. Since DMSO was reported to expose cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in certain cell lines [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], therefore, the differences in DMSO concentration used as a negative control in different measurement methods may also cause the variety of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of DMC in the cytotoxicity assay.
