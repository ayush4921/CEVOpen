<p>Multidrug resistance is one of the major challenges for the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Noticeably, cotreatment of DMC (

In the xenograft model, DMC (20 and 40 mg/kg) potentiated the anticancer effects of doxorubicin, which was evidenced by 47.0 and 70.0% reduction of the tumor weight, respectively. The underlying mechanism was through the attenuation of MDR1 gene expression and the reduction of intracellular P-glycoprotein [
