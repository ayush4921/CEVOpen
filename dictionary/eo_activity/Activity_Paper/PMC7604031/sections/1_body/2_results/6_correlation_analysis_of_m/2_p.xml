<p id="par0150">The above results demonstrated that the eight medicinal active ingredients exhibited increasing or decreasing trends changing with storage time after crushing the fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> at room temperature. To investigate whether there exist correlations among the changes of active ingredients, we further conducted correlation analysis on the contents of different active ingredients. The results showed that there was significant negative correlations between the contents of baicalin and baicalein (correlation coefficient: -0.815, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A), as well as the contents of wogonoside and wogonin (correlation coefficient: -0.998, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B), indicating that there exists mutual conversion between baicalin and baicalein, and between wogonoside and wogonin. The contents of baicalein and wogonin increase significantly with the extension of storage time, while the contents of baicalin and wogonoside decrease significantly. On the contrary, the contents of scutellarin and scutellarein (
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>C) have a very significant positive correlation with correlation coefficient as high as 0.95 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;  0.0001). The contents of several other ingredients were relatively low, and the correlations among them were not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt;  0.05). These results suggested that the secondary metabolism in fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> had not been stopped after crushing, and there were still mutual transformations among different components.
