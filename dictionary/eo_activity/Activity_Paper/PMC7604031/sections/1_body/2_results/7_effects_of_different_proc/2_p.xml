<p id="par0155">In recent years, the market demand for the raw medicinal materials of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> is growing, with the development of pharmacological studies (
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, pharmaceutical enterprises mainly focus on how to obtain the maximum contents of active ingredients in medicinal materials. In this study, six different post-harvest treatments were designed and used to systematically reveal the effects of different processing treatments on the contents of eight medicinal active ingredients (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). The results showed that the contents of four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) under 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatments were significantly higher than those of the other four treatments (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.05), indicating that the active ingredients in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> lost considerably after softening treatment by steam. The contents of the other four medicinal active ingredients were all lower than 0.06 % (corresponding to 0.6 mg/g), which were significantly lower than those of the four main active components in roots (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.05). Among the six different treatments, the contents of baicalin were all higher than 10 %, which was in accordance with the standard of the Pharmacopoeia. The highest content was observed in 
 <italic>D</italic> treatment (134.54 mg/g), followed by 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatment (129.48 mg/g). The contents of baicalin and wogonoside of 
 <italic>D-S-C</italic> treatment were the lowest (104.09 mg/g and 18.27 mg/g, respectively). Collectively, the above results suggested that pharmaceutical companies should adopt appropriate processing treatments according to the characteristics of medicinal materials, since the active ingredients were significantly influenced by processing methods. For instance, the crushing process after direct drying (
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatment) is very suitable for improving the yield of active ingredients. In addition to the 
 <italic>D-S-C</italic> treatment (cutting after drying and softening), the 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic> treatment (killing enzyme by steam after cutting, and then drying the slices) is a potential processing method for the industrial production of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>.
