<p id="par0160">Recent studies have revealed that there exists conversion among different active ingredients in plants, and only one active ingredient is difficult to reflect the quality and stability of medicinal materials (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). Accordingly, in the latest release of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, it is stipulated that the total content of baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin should not less than 13.5 % for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2020</xref>). In this study, the total content of four main active ingredients in the root of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> treated with six different processing treatments was further analyzed (
 <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> ). The results showed that the total content of the four main active ingredients of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> roots under 
 <italic>D</italic> treatment was the highest (166.47 mg/g), followed by that of 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatment (163.15 mg/g), which was much higher than the standard of 13.5 % (corresponding to 135 mg/g) stipulated in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020) (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2020</xref>). For 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> roots under 
 <italic>D-S-C</italic> treatment, the total content of the four main active ingredients decreased to 125.33 mg/g, which was below the minimum requirement of 13.5 % by the Pharmacopoeia. The total contents of the four main active ingredients under 
 <italic>D-S- C-D</italic>, 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic>, and 
 <italic>S- C-D</italic> treatments were 153.88 mg/g, 155.64 mg/g, and 151.29 mg/g, respectively, which were all lower than those of 
 <italic>D</italic> treatment (16.6 %) and 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatment (16.32 %), but were higher than the minimum requirement of 13.5 %. Collectively, the above results indicated that different post-harvest processing treatments had significant effects on the total contents of medicinal active ingredients of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. Specifically, the 
 <italic>D-S- C-D</italic> treatment can be adopted for the medicinal materials used in traditional formulations of Chinese medicine, while the 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatments can be used in industrial production since neither of the two treatments significantly reduce the total content of four main active ingredients in medicinal materials. Compared with 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>C-D</italic> treatments, the total content of the four main active ingredients under 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic> treatment significantly decreased. Nevertheless, the traditional processing treatment (
 <italic>D-S- C-D</italic>) requires four steps including drying, softening, cutting, and drying treatment, which is considered to high consumption of energy and time. In contrast, the 
 <italic>C-S-D</italic> treatment with energy conservation and high efficiency is a potential processing technology to be further studied in the future.
