<p id="par0145">In traditional processing methods, the roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> are dried after harvesting, and then softened by steam or boiling water, which is convenient for further cutting. However, this process takes a long time and consumes energy. Moreover, the contents of effective active ingredients in the slices will decrease once the dried roots are softened with steam or boiling water. It is not clear how the active ingredients change after the fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were cut to slices and then placed at room temperature for different times. In this study, the fresh slices of roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were stored for different times at room temperature, and then the contents of active ingredients were determined after drying and comminuting. The results showed that the contents of baicalein (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A), wogonin (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B), and chrysin (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E) gradually increased with the extension of storage time at room temperature, reaching the maximum of 0.39 mg/g, 12.67 mg/g and 1.67 mg/g, respectively at about 25 h. Compared with those at 0 h, the contents of baicalin (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A), wogonoside (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B), and scutellarin (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C) all decreased significantly with the extension of storage time, but were observed with a repeated fluctuation at different storage time. Comparatively, the two active ingredients apigenin (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D) and scutellarein (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C) had relatively low contents with a gradually increasing trend, reaching a maximum of 0.053 mg/g and 0.091 mg/g, respectively, at storage time of 25 h. The above results indicated that the contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and scutellarin in the slices of fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> will significantly reduce as the storage time increases, but the reduction of fresh-cutting was significantly lower than that of fresh-crushing.
