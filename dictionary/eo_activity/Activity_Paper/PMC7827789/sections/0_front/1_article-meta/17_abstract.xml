 <p>Natural populations of 
  <italic>Gentiana asclepiadea</italic> L., located at two mountainous sites, were HPLC-analyzed regarding the contents of six representative secondary metabolites. The contents of swertiamarin (SWM), gentiopicrin (GP), sweroside (SWZ), mangiferin (MGF), isoorientin (ISOOR), and isovitexin (ISOV) were determined in six populations (three per study site), and separately for aboveground and belowground plant parts. PCA showed a clear separation of four groups according to the contents of the analyzed secondary metabolites. Out of six analyzed compounds, five were present in all samples and only one (SWZ) was found in Golija populations (belowground parts) but not in Vlasina populations, and its presence can be indicative of the geolocation of populations. Clear separation of groups was mostly affected by the different contents of chemical compounds in plant parts (aboveground versus belowground) and by the differences related to population origin (higher content of SWM and GP in belowground parts of individuals from Vlasina populations and higher content of MGF and ISOOR of individuals from Golija populations). The results of this study contribute to the spatiochemical profiling of 
  <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> populations and a better understanding of inter- and intrapopulation variability of pharmacologically important compounds.
