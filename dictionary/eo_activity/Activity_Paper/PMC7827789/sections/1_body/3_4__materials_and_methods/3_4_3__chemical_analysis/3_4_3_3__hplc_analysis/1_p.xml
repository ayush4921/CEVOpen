<p>Chromatographic analysis of the secondary metabolites was carried out on an Agilent series 1100 HPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies, Waldronn, Germany) with a DAD, on a reverse-phase Zorbax SB C-18 (Agilent, Newport, Delaware, USA) analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size) thermostatted at 25 °C. Prior to HPLC analysis, the extracts were filtered through nylon syringe filters (Captiva syringe filters, 0.45 µm, 13 mm, Agilent Technologies). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (1%,

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, samples of belowground and aboveground plant parts were separated as follows: 98–90% A 0–5 min, 90–85% A 5–17 min, 85% A 17–20 min, 85–70% A 20–30 min, 70–0% A 30–39 min, and 0% A 39–42 min. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. The injection volume of samples was 5 µL; the detection wavelengths were set at 260 and 320 nm. The quantification of secondary metabolites was done using the external standard method by preparing calibration standards ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/mL and recording the calibration curves at 260 nm for secoiridoids and flavonoids, and at 320 nm for xanthone mangiferin. The results are presented as milligrams per gram of dry weight (dw).
