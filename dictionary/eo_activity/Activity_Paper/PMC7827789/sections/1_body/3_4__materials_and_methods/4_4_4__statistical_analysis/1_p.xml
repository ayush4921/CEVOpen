<p>A total of 516 numerical data points related to 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> were analyzed: two mountainous sites (V—Vlasina and G—Golija) × three populations (V1, V2, V3; G1, G2, G3) × two plant parts (A—aboveground and B—belowground) × seven (eight) elements (from seven to eight plants per population) × six secondary metabolites (SWM, GP, MGF, SWZ, ISOOR, and ISOV). The choice of statistical tests was made based on preliminary verification of conditions for the application of the majority of the parametric tests: normal distribution (chi-square test, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05) and the equality of variances (Levene’s and Batlett’s tests, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). After the transformation (y’ = log10 (y + 1), y = original data value), the data fulfilled the abovementioned conditions. To determine differences between the mean values of localities (fixed factor), populations, and plant parts (random factors), we used nested ANOVA, a very common analysis in ecological studies (levels of random factors are similar but not identical to each other). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out with log-transformed data in order to determine the trends, structure, and relationships of properties and grouping of individuals. Visualizing the groups of samples with boxplots enhanced our understanding of the original (nontransformed) data and helped us to make comparisons across groups. Statgraphics Plus (version 5.0; Statistical Graphics Corporation, The Plains, VA, USA), Statistica (version 10, Stat. Soft. Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA, 2011), and Addinsoft XLSTAT software (free trial version) were used.
