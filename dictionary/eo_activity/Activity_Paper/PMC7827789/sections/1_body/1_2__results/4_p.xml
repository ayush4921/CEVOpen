<p>The separation of 86 elements by different plant parts is clear, as the aboveground plant parts are grouped on the right part of the figure (Golija top right and Vlasina bottom right) and the belowground plant parts are grouped on the left part (Vlasina top left and Golija bottom left) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The red ellipse encompasses elements that contain SWZ, and these are belowground parts from populations G1, G2, and G3 (G1B, G2B, and G3B). The yellow ellipse encompasses elements with the higher content of SWM and GP and these are belowground part populations V1, V2, and V3 (V1B, V2B, and V3B) (the only exception is element nine, which is poorly represented in the plane of the first two axes). A dark-green ellipse encompasses elements with the higher content of MGF and ISOOR and these are aboveground parts from populations G1, G2, and G3 (G1A, G2A, and G3A). A light-green ellipse encompasses elements with the lower content of SWM and GP and these are aboveground parts from populations V1, V2, and V3 (V1A, V2A, and V3A).
