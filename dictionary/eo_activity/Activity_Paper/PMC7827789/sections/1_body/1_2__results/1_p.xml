<p>HPLC analysis of 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> plants revealed the presence of six major compoundsâ€”secoiridoid glucosides swertiamarin (SWM), gentiopicrin (GP), and sweroside (SWZ); xanthone mangiferin (MGF); and two 
 <italic>C</italic>-glucoflavones isoorientin (ISOOR) and isovitexin (ISOV). Aboveground and belowground plant parts contained varying contents of these compounds. Gentiopicrin was detected as the most abundant compound in all analyzed samples. Chromatograms of above- and belowground plant parts with identified peaks of secondary metabolites are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f001">Figure 1</xref> (Golija) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f002">Figure 2</xref> (Vlasina). The contents of six analyzed secondary metabolites (mg/g dry weight (dw)) in above- and belowground plant parts from Vlasina and Golija populations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f003">Figure 3</xref>.
