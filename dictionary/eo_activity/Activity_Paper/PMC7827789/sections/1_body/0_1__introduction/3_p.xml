<p>High-altitude (over 1000 m) medicinal and aromatic flora deserve special attention due to their richness in valuable secondary metabolites, which become more abundant with increasing elevation [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The distribution of herbaceous mountainous flora is determined by specific topography, mountains’ directional extensions, slope, soil type, vegetation cover, and so forth. [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The high mountainous habitat is characterized by a set of environmental conditions, namely, temperature (including day–night temperature ranges), precipitation, insolation and UV radiation, duration of vegetation season, day length, and clear sky conditions, which together contribute to plants’ adaptive response regarding both primary and secondary metabolism [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among the numerous environmental influences that have a synergistic impact on plant growth and reproduction, UV-B radiation is considered to be the most important factor for photosynthetic production and secondary metabolism. Under field conditions, plant biomass accumulation and phenophase shifting occur continually throughout the whole growing season, despite the negative effect of UV-B radiation on the photosynthetic apparatus [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of energy produced in photosynthesis is required to acclimate and restore the damage caused by UV-B to photosynthetic pigments and cellular metabolism [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Light environment adaptation (UV-B radiation adaptation) at the secondary metabolism level is indicated by the enhancement of biosynthesis and aggregation of protecting UV-B compounds, namely, flavonoids (with strong free-radical scavenging potential) and sinapate esters (capable of absorption in the wavelength range from 280 to 340 nm) [
