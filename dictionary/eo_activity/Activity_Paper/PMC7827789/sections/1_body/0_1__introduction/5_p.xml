<p>Eco-biochemical studies of natural populations are important for understanding speciesâ€™ responses to specific site conditions in high-altitude environments, while plant-part-related differences provide further information on specific environmental drivers that are predicted to cause ecophysiological and metabolic adaptations. This research aimed to assess geographic variability, interpopulation variability, and plant-part-related differences in natural populations of Willow gentian based on the contents of six representative secondary metabolites.</p>
