<p>Other important external drivers for biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites are the attraction of pollinators, which decrease both in diversity and activity in high altitudes [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and intensive herbivore pressure, considering that plant-eating insects have limited food choice to complete their life cycle [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00140" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. High levels of biologically active secondary metabolites (potentially poisonous) in high-altitude habitats also contribute to shaping the community structure, as certain plant species are avoided by grazers. Low palatability (and in higher amounts toxicity) of gentians is an important grazing indicator and the cause for their increased abundance from the Neolithic period, as revealed by pollen records [
