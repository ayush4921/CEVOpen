<p>Results of qualitative analysis explored different phytochemical constituents like alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, steroids and triterpenoids in the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. grandiflorum</italic> leaves extract (
 <xref rid="table1-1559325820959563" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results of quantitative analysis revealed the total flavonoid (241.8 ± 11.18 µg CE/g dry plants material) and phenolic contents (1010.72 ± 12.49 mg GAE/g dry plants material) in current study and the mean ± SE (Standard error of mean) are given in

Free radical scavenging potentials determinations are very important parameters to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of medicinal plants. Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) Assay, Phosphomolybdenum, DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant potential of hydroethanolic plant extract and the results represented in
