<p>Results of hemolytic assay revealed that the %age (percentage) hemolysis of plant extract is significantly negligible as compare to positive control (Triton-X) shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1559325820959563">Figure 1C</xref>. To evaluate the blood and semen thinning effect of hydroethanolic extract clot lysis activity was measured using human clotted blood. Results revealed that Streptokinase (SK; 100 µL) incubation with clot for 90 min at 37ºC dissolve the 73.6 ± 7.7% clot while on the other hand only 3.65 ± 0.35% clot lysis was observed in clots treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and significant (p &lt; 0.001) thrombolytic activity of hydroethanolic extract of plant (44 ± 5.2%) was observed (
