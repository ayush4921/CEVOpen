<p>The finding of bacterial endophytes inhabiting medicinal plants and their potentiality as bioinoculants to improve the growth behavior of other plants were recorded by researchers. AlKahtani et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that out of 13 bacterial endophytes inhabiting the leaves of two medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Fagonia mollis</italic> and 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic>, the five most potent endophytic strains were utilized as an inoculant to improve the maize plant growth. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that the wheat plant growth was improved due to inoculating their seeds with bacterial endophytes isolated from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic>. Clearly, the bacterial endophytes obtained in the current study possess various plant growth-promoting traits; hence, these bacterial endophytes could be used as bio-inoculants to improve and enhance the growth performance of other plants.
