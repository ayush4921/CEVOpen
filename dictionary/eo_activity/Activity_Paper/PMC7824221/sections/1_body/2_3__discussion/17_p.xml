<p>Another strategy used via endophytic bacteria to promote plant growth is ammonia production and solubilization of phosphates [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Endophytic bacteria that produce beneficial metabolites for the plant, including ammonia, can prolong the root and shoots of the plant, as well as increase the fresh weight of the inoculated plant [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Interestingly, all tested bacterial species in this study had the capacity to producing ammonia with varying degrees. We propose that bacterial endophytes could produce ammonia from chains of amino acids through proteolytic activity where ammonia is the result of the hydrolysis of amide nitrogen, or by the initial proteolytic breakdown of the molecule followed by deamination, as was reported for
