<p>Wide screening techniques include culture-based and non-specific methods for determining the association and understanding the relationship between plants and endophytes. In this direction, the characterization of plant-related endophytes would be beneficial for biotechnological applications of these microbes in different sectors, such as biofertilizers. Microbial endophytes enhance plant growth either directly or indirectly through various mechanisms, such as the synthesis of plant hormones, particularly IAA, phosphorus solubilization, salt tolerance, or abiotic stress amelioration, producing ammonia or hydrolytic enzymes as well as inhibiting phytopathogenic microbes [
