<p>Therefore, we expect that studying the phosphate-solubilizing endophytes could benefit plants as these endophytes may colonize plant roots and aid in the mobilization of soil non-soluble phosphate. In this study, out of seven tested endophytic bacteria, four strains (57.2%) have the potentiality to solubilize tri-calcium phosphate, forming a clear zone on pikoviskaya agar media ranging between 5.6 ± 0.4 and 9.8 ± 0.8 mm. Endophytic bacteria 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. PI-8 and PI-10 possess the highest efficacy in ammonia production and the solubilization of phosphate. Therefore, these bacterial endophytes can be used to enhance plant growth and decrease the addition of chemical fertilizers, as shown in greenhouse experiments.
