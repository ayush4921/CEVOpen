<p>Another vital trait assessed in the present study was the antagonistic activity of isolated bacterial endophytes against three different plant pathogenic fungi. All tested bacterial isolates had antifungal activity against

 <italic>P. ultimum</italic> with varied inhibition percentages (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00076-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This phenomenon could be related to different mechanisms, such as pathogenesis, producing active compounds that inhibit fungal growth, or competition between endophytes and pathogen around nutrients [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] reported that the endophytic microbes can protect plants against pathogens by different indirect and direct mechanisms. The direct mechanisms include antipiosis, the secretion of lytic enzymes, the production of different phytohormones, phosphate solubilization, forming siderophores, competitions, and use of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC).
