<p>Chitinase activities could promote plant growth through biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi through hydrolysis of chitin in the fungal cell wall [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This phenomenon could explain the efficacy of these endophytic bacteria for the in vitro antagonistic activity of phytopathogenic fungi. In the same line, Hallmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that the extracellular enzymatic activities of endophytic microbes improved the induced systematic resistance in the plant. The hydrolytic enzymatic activities of these endophytic bacteria could increase the degradation of protein and polysaccharides, and thus can be useful in industrial sectors [
