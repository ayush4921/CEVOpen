<p>The current study proposes that the endophytic bacteria associated with 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> plants are inoculants with potential PGP properties. Therefore, in this study, we mainly aimed to isolate, identify, and characterize the supposed endophytic bacteria associated with 
 <italic>P. incisa,</italic> which inhabits the naturally arid conditions of the Saint Katherine Protectorate. Plant growth-promoting traits of these endophytic bacterial isolates, such as enzyme production, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and ammonia production, phosphate solubilization, and antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi were evaluated to determine their impact on the growth performance of maize plants as an important economic crop.
