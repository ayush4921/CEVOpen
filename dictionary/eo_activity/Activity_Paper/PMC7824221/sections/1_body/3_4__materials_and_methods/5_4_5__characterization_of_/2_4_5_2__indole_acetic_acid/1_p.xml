<p>The potency of the identified isolated bacterial endophytes for IAA production was quantitatively assessed, where the bacterial strains were inoculated in nutrient broth (NB) media amended with 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of L-tryptophan or without tryptophan and incubated at 35 °C ± 2 for 7 days in shaking incubator (150 rpm). A total of 5 mL of each culture was aspirated from the fermentation broth and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; 1 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 1 drop of orthophosphoric acid and 2 mL of Salkowski’s reagent (300 mL concentrated sulphuric acid, 500 mL distilled water, 15 mL 0.5 M FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and incubated in the dark for 30 min. Development of pink color indicated IAA production; the optical density was measured at 530 nm using a Spectrophotometer (Jenway 6305 UV spectrophotometer, 230 V/50 Hz, Staffordshire, UK). The amount of IAA produced was estimated by a standard IAA graph [
