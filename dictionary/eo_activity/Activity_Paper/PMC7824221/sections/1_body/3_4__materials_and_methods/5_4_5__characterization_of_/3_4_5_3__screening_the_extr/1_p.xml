<p>The production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes by bacterial endophytes was investigated using the agar diffusion assay method. The different extracellular enzymes including amylase, protease, xylanase, cellulase, chitinase, and catalase enzymes were assessed. A mineral salt agar media (MSA; containing g/L: NaNO

After that, the inoculated plates were incubated for 48 h at 35 ± 2 °C and flooded with specific reagents after incubation periods to visualize halos around the bacterial growth. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
