<p>Ammonia production was analyzed using the qualitative method of [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Bacterial isolates were tested for the production of ammonia in peptone water. Freshly grown cultures were inoculated in 10 mL peptone water and incubated for 72 h at 35 °C. Nessler’s reagent (1 mL) was added to each tube as a colorimetric reagent for ammonia production. The color change to faint yellow indicated the minimum ammonia production, while the color change from deep yellow to a brownish color indicated the maximum ammonia production.
