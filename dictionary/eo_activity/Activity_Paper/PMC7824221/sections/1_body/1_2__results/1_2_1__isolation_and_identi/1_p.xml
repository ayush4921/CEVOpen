<p>In this study, 15 bacterial isolates, encoded PI-1 to PI-15, were obtained from healthy leaves of 
 <italic>Pulicaria incisa</italic> collected from Wadi al-Zwatin, Saint Katherine, South Sinai, Egypt. These bacterial endophytes underwent morphological, physiological, and biochemical identification according to standard keys. The data showed that the obtained bacterial isolates belonged to two different phyla, namely, proteobacteria (33.3%) and firmicutes (66.6%).
