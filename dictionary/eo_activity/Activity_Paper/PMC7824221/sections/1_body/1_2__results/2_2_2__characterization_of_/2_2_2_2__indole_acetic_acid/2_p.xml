<p>The bacterial strains 
 <italic>Brevibacillus brevis</italic> PI-5 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 showed the maximum IAA production (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001), recording 19 ± 0.3 and 23 ± 2 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. However, the addition of L-tryptophan at different concentrations to the growth media significantly increased the IAA production (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001). Analysis of variance showed that, by increasing the tryptophan concentration from 1.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 5.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, the IAA productivity increased from 14 ± 1.0 – 27 ± 1.7 to 21.7 ± 0.8 – 47 ± 2.0 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The endophytic bacterial isolates 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 exhibited the highest IAA production in media amended with tryptophan and produced 47 ± 2.0 and 40.7 ± 1.6 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, after 14 days.
