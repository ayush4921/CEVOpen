<p>Determination of TPC was performed by adopting the procedure of Singleton and Rossi [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Extract (20 µL) was mixed with Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) reagent (Merck, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, Lyon, France) (90 µL) and kept for 5 min before adding sodium carbonate (90 µL). Gallic acid as a positive and pure ethanol (extraction solvent) as a negative control were used. Absorbance was recorded at 630 nm with microplate reader. By using the following formula, the total phenolic production was estimated: TPP (mg/L) = TPC (mg/g) × DW (g/L).
