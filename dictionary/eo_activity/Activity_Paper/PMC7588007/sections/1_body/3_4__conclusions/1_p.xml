 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. cv ‘Thai Basil’ is a widely used herbal medicinal product, particularly due to its accumulation of a pharmaceutically important metabolite, including rosmarinic acid and chicoric acid. Here, a protocol is proposed for the effective production of leaf-derived callus cultures of Thai basil with sustainable and elevated productions of both biomass and antioxidant phenolics. We proved that plant cell and tissue culture technologies can be applied routinely to Thai basil as an important, sustainable and low-cost biomass source for the production of high-value antioxidant compounds. MS basal medium with BAP:NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L) yields a maximum biomass accumulation (both fresh weight (FW): 190 g/L and dry weight (DW): 13.05 g/L) as well as enhanced phenolic (346.08 mg/L) production. HPLC quantification analysis confirmed high productions of both chicoric acid (35.77 mg/g DW) and rosmarinic acid (7.35 mg/g DW) under this optimal callus culture conditions. Antioxidant potential, assessed using both in vitro cell-free and in vivo cellular antioxidant assays, revealed maximum in vitro antioxidant activity with both DPPH (93.2% of radical scavenging activity) and ABTS (1322 µM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) assays for the corresponding extracts. In vivo cellular antioxidant activity assay confirmed this effective protection against oxidative stress with an effective inhibition of ROS and RNS production conferred by the corresponding extract. Under optimal conditions, compared to commercial leaves, the extracts of callus showed higher production of chicoric acid, and similar levels of rosmarinic acid, associated with higher antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, considering the large production capacity of this biological system, suitable for continuous biomass and antioxidant phenolic productions, can be further expanded in the future with the use of cell suspension cultures growing in bioreactors, we anticipate that it could have a great potential for possible nutraceutical applications.
