<p>The cellular antioxidant assay confirmed the interest of natural antioxidant from plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the past decade, natural antioxidants have generated increasing interest due to their possible use as an alternative to potentially hazardous synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in various food preparations and their possible use as nutraceuticals [
