<p>Antioxidant activity was also evaluated in vivo through the ability of the extract to inhibit the formation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS) using a cellular antioxidant assay (

Maximum inhibition of the ROS/RNS production (56.4%) was measured with extract from callus grown on medium with BAP and NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L), while minimum production inhibition ranging from 17.5% to 27.4% was recorded for extracts from calluses grown on media supplemented with BAP alone (
