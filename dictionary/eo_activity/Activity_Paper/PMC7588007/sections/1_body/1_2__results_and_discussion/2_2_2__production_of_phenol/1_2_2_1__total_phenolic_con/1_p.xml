<p>In response to BAP combined with NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L), calluses yielded a maximum total phenolic content (TPC) of 132.6 mg/g DW. On the contrary, BAP alone, whatever the concentration applied, resulted in a lower TPC ranging from 42.5 to 70.8 mg/g DW. We noted that for each BAP concentration used, the addition of NAA increased TPC. Minimum TPC values ranging from 21.8 to 37.0 mg/g DW have been detected for GA
 <sub>3</sub> treatments (0.25â€“10.0 mg/L). In addition to GA
 <sub>3</sub>, NAA also stimulated the accumulation of total phenolics. Interestingly, higher TPC was obtained in extracts from in vitro callus cultures grown under optimal PGRs conditions as compared to the extract from commercial leaves of Thai basil (
