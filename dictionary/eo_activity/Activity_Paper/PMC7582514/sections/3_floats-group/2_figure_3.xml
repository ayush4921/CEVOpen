  <p>Ginsenoside transformation pathways during physical processing. Unstable malonyl ginsenosides may be demalonylated into corresponding ginsenosides; the sugar moiety attached to the C–3, C–6, or C–20 of major ginsenosides may be deglycosylated to produce minor ginsenosides; Dehydration may occur at C–20 and the resulting double bond is formed either between C–20 and C–21 or between C–20 and C–22, leading to positional and geometric isomerism.</p>
