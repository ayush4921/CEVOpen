<p>The enzymatic fermentation method produces ginseng products of greater purity with fewer by-products, and employs a short reaction cycle than the other methods for processing ginseng [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Different enzymes play a different role in hydrolyzing ginsenosides. Unlike microbial conversion methods, enzyme conversion methods can be performed at higher temperatures according to the enzyme characterization. Several commercial enzymes, such as Rapidase, Econase CE, Viscozyme, Ultraflo L, and Cytolase, have been used to ferment red ginseng extracts. The results indicate Rapidase and Cytolase can not only significantly increase the total amount of ginsenosides, but can also deglycosylate ginsenosides to Rg3 [

 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In addition, when five commercial enzymes were added to white ginseng extract for 60 h, the major ginsenosides were transformed into Rg3, F2, and CK. Cytolase PLC5 was selected as the most effective enzyme among enzymes tested because of the greater production of CK from WG extract [

In addition to the above enzymes, β-glucosidase, β-glycosidase, pectinase, cellulose, and naringinase have also been utilized for enzymatic conversion of ginseng. Pectinase, β-glucosidase, and β-glycosidase react with ginseng to produce CK [
