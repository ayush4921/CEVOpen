<p>Alkaline hydrolysis is a method used to degrade ginsenosides under conditions of high temperature, high pressure, and high pH [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Two new dammarane-type triterpenes, namely ginsenoslaloside-I and 20(
 <italic>S</italic>)-ginsenoside-Rh1-60-acetate, together with twelve known compounds (including PPT, PPD, Rh16, Rh3, Rh1, F4, and Rk1) were isolated from the alkaline hydrolysate of total saponins after refluxing with 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Total saponins in ginseng stems and leaves were hydrolyzed in a 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide aqueous solution suspended in a boiling water bath for 8 h, and a new compound, 20(
 <italic>R</italic>)-ginsenoside Rh19, was isolated and identified [
