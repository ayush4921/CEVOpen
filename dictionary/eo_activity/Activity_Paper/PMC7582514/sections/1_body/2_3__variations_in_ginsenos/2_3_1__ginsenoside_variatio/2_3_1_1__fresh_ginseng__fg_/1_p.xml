<p>White ginseng (WG) is produced by air-drying fresh ginseng (FG) in sunlight until it reaches low water concentrations (â‰¤12%), and is a commonly consumed product available in herbal markets. Major ginsenosides are abundant in both ginsengs with a slightly difference in content of each ginsenoside. In addition to the major ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, and Rg1), another important group of natural ginsenosides, the malonyl ginsenosides, are also present in both FG and WG. Malonyl ginsenosides contain a malonyl residue attached to the glucose unit of the corresponding major ginsenoside, such as Rb1, Rb2, Rc, or Rd, to form malonyl-Rb1, malonyl-Rb2, malonyl-Rc, or malonyl-Rd; the modified ginsenosides are unstable and can demalonylate to form the corresponding ginsenosides upon processing [

The ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, and Rb2 are abundant in fresh ginseng; however, the concentrations of Rb1 and Rg1 are increased in WG [
