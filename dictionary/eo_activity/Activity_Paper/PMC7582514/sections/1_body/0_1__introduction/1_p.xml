<p>Herbal products are widely used in medicine, food production, and other fields due to their various active compounds and beneficial effects. In addition to the well-known active proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, and flavonoids, saponins are also very important active substances in herbs. Saponins belong to the group of plant glycosides widely distributed in more than 100 families of both wild and cultivated plants and in some marine organisms [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Saponins consist of a polycyclic aglycones attached to one or more hydrophilic (water-soluble) sugar side chains. The hydrophobic (fat-soluble) aglycone moiety, which is also called sapogenin, is either a steroid (C–27) or a triterpene (C–30) [

 <italic>Leguminosae,</italic> or 
 <italic>Panax</italic>). Triterpenes belong to a large group of compounds arranged in four-(Dammarane) or five-ring (Oleanane) configurations of 30 carbons [

 <italic>Panax</italic>. The ginsenosides identified to date are classified as the protopanaxatriol type (PPT), protopanaxadiol type (PPD), oleanolic acid type (OA), ocotillol type (OT), C17 side-chain varied (C17SCV), and miscellaneous subtypes according to their known structures (

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The PPD type consists of an aglycone with a dammarane skeleton and sugar moieties attached to the β-OH at C–3 and/or C–20. The PPT type consists of an aglycone with a dammarane skeleton and sugar moieties attached to the α-OH at C–6 and/or β-OH at C–20. The oleanane group consists of OA and OT types: The OA type consists of a pentacyclic structure with an aglycone oleanolic acid such as ginsenoside Ro; the OT has an epoxy ring at C–20, and includes majonoside R2 and the pseudoginsenoside F11 (p-F11) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the substituents within the C17 side chains often undergo oxidation, reduction, cyclization, and epimerization, contributing additional diversity in ginsenoside chemical structure [
