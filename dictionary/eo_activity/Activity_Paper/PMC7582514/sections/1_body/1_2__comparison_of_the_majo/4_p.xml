<p>In addition to the above well-recognized 
 <italic>Panax</italic> species, several species of the genus 
 <italic>Panax,</italic> such as 
 <italic>P. bipinnatifidus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sokpayensis</italic>, flourish in the Himalayan region. Tung et al. (2011) reported that ten OA-type saponins were isolated from 
 <italic>P. bipinnatifidus,</italic> including bifinosides A–C, CS–IVa, pseudoginsenoside RP
 <sub>1</sub> and RT
 <sub>1</sub>, stipuleanoside R1 and R2 [

 <italic>P. bipinnatifidus</italic> compared with 
 <italic>P. sokpayensis</italic> (containing Rg1, Rg2, Re, Rd, Rb1, and Rb2), although Rc has not been detected in either 
 <italic>Panax</italic> species [
