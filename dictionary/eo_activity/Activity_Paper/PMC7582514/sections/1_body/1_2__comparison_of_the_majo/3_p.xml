<p>In addition to 
 <italic>P. ginseng, P. notoginseng,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic>, the activity and ginsenoside composition of several other species available worldwide have also been investigated. 
 <italic>P. japonicas</italic> Meyer (Japanese ginseng or Ye-sanchi, wild grown throughout Japan and the south of Yunnan province, China) has been used to promote the functional activity of the stomach and as a tonic, antitussive, anti-inflammatory, and hemostatic agent. Several reports have indicated that ocotillol type saponins (Yesanchinosides) and majonoside R2 were the major compounds in 
 <italic>P. japonicas,</italic> and major ginsenosides (Rc, Rg1, Rd, and Rb3) and notoginsenosides (R1, R4) were also present [

 <italic>P. vietnamensis</italic> (Vietnam ginseng, a wild ginseng species found at Mount Ngoc Linh in Central Vietnam) with similar activity to 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, is used for enhancement of physical strength and treatment of many diseases. The main saponins of 
 <italic>P. vietnamensis</italic> were not only ginsenoside Rb1, Rd, Re, and Rg1, but also OT saponins (majonoside R1, R2, and vinaginsenoside R1 and R2). In addition, majonoside R2 is present at high concentrations in 
 <italic>P. vietnamensis</italic> and appears to be responsible for its remarkable pharmacological effects, and is used to distinguish 
 <italic>P. vietnamensis</italic> from other species [

 <italic>P. zingiberensis</italic> is widely used in folk medicines in China and Myanmar to strengthen the immune response and provide cardiovascular protection [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It exhibits anticancer activity and prevents platelet aggregation because of the presence of a large number of OA-type ginsenosides, such as ginsenoside Ro, chikusetsu saponin-IV (CS-IV) and CS-Iva; PPT-type ginsenosides (Rg1, Re, and F3) are also present in 
 <italic>P. zingiberensis</italic> at higher concentrations than the PPD-type ginsenosides [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Zingibroside R1 has also been detected in 
 <italic>P. zingiberensis</italic> and has a structure similar to the OA-type ginsenoside Ro, although it lacks glucose at the C28 position [

 <italic>P. stipuleanatus</italic> Tsai et Feng is an herb grown in Southeast Yunnan, China, and North Vietnam, which contains OA-type triterpenoids (spinasaponin A methyl ester, stipuleanoside R1 and R2, pesudoginsenoside RP
