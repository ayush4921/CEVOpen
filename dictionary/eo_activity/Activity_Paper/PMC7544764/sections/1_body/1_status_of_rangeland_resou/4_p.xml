<p id="Par10">The current global debate on the potential use of indigenous knowledge on rangeland management and biodiversity conservation has brought attention to researchers and land practitioners. Historically, pastoral communities relied on their indigenous knowledge and experiences to manage their rangeland resources. While, international recognition of indigenous knowledge on rangeland management is gaining momentum, the development and implementation of framework for integrating local communities and ecological methods in some parts of Africa have made limited progress (Roba and Oba 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). According to Saruni (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>), indigenous knowledge is normally ignored in academic research and policy circles. Scientific bias of viewing local pastoralists as one of the agents of environmental degradation has always creates hostility between herders and ecologists (Benjaminsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). The equilibrium ecological theory that strongly linked the degradation of rangelands by the pastoralistsâ€™ culture of overstocking appears to ignore the potential use of indigenous knowledge possessed by these pastoralists (Roba and Oba 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>; Vetter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005</xref>). With these views, there is scanty information regarding the role and state of indigenous knowledge on rangeland management and biodiversity conservation in Tanzania and elsewhere. The proceeded sections reviewed different sources and summarized the role of indigenous knowledge on rangeland resources management and challenges hindering utilization of indigenous knowledge and practices.
