<p id="Par8">Pressures on rangelands’ biodiversity utilization are growing in line with increasing human population (Kidegesho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>). The rapid human population growth in Tanzania which results into increased rates of unsustainable consumption of resources and changes in land uses is the underlying cause for biodiversity loss (Kideghesho 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Selemani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>). With current increasing anthropogenic activities such as expansion of crop production and settlements, most rangelands in Tanzania are increasing experiencing some form of exploitation pressures and hence become degraded (Selemani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>). On the other hands, overexploitation of rangeland resources is associated with tremendous increase in both wildlife and livestock population resulting into changes in botanical composition (replacing perennial by annual species) and nutritional quality of forage by increasing unpalatable species against palatable one (Selemani and Sangeda 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). Increasing bush encroachment and invasive species due to heavy grazing pressure resulting to suppression of herbaceous vegetation production is very common in most Tanzanian rangelands. Lyimo et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>) reported some major impacts associated with bush encroachment and invasive species in different parts of country which include but not limited to loss of biodiversity, disappearance of certain species of fauna and flora which in turn resulted to social and economic distress to human livelihoods. Using economic value approach, Kirui (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>) concluded that, the annual cost for land degradation due to land use and land cover changes in Tanzania is approximately $ 2.3 billion which is equivalent to 13.7% of the country GDP.
