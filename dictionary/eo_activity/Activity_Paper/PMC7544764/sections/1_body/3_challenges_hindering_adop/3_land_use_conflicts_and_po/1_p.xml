<p id="Par29">Overexploitation of natural resources in Tanzania is partly attributed to poverty among pastoral communities. Tanzania is classified among the least developed countries in the world (Kideghesho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). Homewood et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>) described pastoral communities living in Arid and Semi-arid regions as among the poorest groups affected by extreme climatic events. These marginalised groups derived their livelihoods from the harsh environments by extracting natural resources from rangelands. However, increasing human population pressure overwhelmed the ability of local communities to conserve their biological resources using their indigenous knowledge. Increasing environmental scarcity is a driving force for conflicts between different land users (Benjaminsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). The land use conflicts may results into destruction of natural resources and rangelandsâ€™ biodiversity through burning or improper cultivation.
