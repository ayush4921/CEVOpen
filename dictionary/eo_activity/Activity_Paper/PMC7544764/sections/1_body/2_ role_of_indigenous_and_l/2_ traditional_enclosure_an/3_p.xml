<p id="Par15">In Maasailand, tradition pasture reserves are well known as 
 <italic>Alalili</italic> and are practiced in response to the declined pastoral mobility due to expansion of protected areas and crop production. Historically, Maasai were mobile pastoralists, searching for quality pasture and water and the 
 <italic>Alalili</italic> were only used for sick animals or calves (Goldman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). However, increasing sedentarisation forced Maasai pastoralists to use 
 <italic>Alalili</italic> as important pasture reservation strategy for their livestock. It is adaption mechanism to the effect of climate change and variability (Goldman and Riosmena 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). Mapinduzi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>) pointed out that, 
 <italic>Alalili</italic> is one of the powerful Indigenous and Local Knowledge used by Maasai for dry season feed reserves and biodiversity conservation. 
 <italic>Alalili</italic> is normally managed by elders through individual boma, or groups of bomas or entire village (Goldman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>).
