         <sup>132</sup>
        </xref> depending on severity and duration, stress can have quite a different impact on the organism—from beneficial to harmful: chronic eustress (too little stress), acute stress (optimum stress) initiate beneficial adaptive stress response, while when stress increases beyond a certain level ‐ acute distress (too much stress), and chronic stress (burnout)—it leads to harmful health effects and can cause numerous diseases. In this context, adaptogens act like chronic eustress activating adaptive stress response, resilience and overall survival.
