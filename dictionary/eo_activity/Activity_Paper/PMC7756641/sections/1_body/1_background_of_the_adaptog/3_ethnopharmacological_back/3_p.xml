<p>For instance, an assumption is that some adaptogens used in TCM, Kampo, and Ayurveda medicine (e.g., Ginseng, Ashwagandha, Andrographis, Bryony) must have normalizing effects, irrespective of the nature of the disease. Herbalists refer to adaptogens as restoratives, qi‐tonics, rasayanas, or rejuvenating herbs. Tonic herbs are classified as the highest and most sought‐after herbal remedies in many traditional systems of healing such as TCM and Ayurveda. Both traditional systems are based on holistic approaches to patients and treatment, suggesting that the patient is an individual and not a disease. Holistic medicine strives to consider the whole person, suggesting that one can only achieve optimal health by complex treatment of all imbalances (physical, emotional, or spiritual) induced by environmental factors. Consequently, multitarget therapy by herbal preparations have polyvalent actions on various mediators, effectors, and regulatory systems, presumably making it the most effective approach for the treatment of complex diseases.</p>
