<p>Homeopathic preparations are made from ingredients which, in undiluted form, cause symptoms similar to the disease they aim to treat. These ingredients are repeatedly diluted, with shaking at each stage (Table 
 <xref rid="med21743-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Homeopaths consider that this technique prevents side effects, enhances the ability of preparations to amplify a response, and generates curative properties, even for ingredients that are chemically inactive or so significantly diluted that none of the original material remains. While high‐potency preparations (i.e., highly diluted ones) clearly cannot be evaluated using bioscientific concepts and methods, lower potency ones may well exert relevant pharmacological and toxicological effects.
