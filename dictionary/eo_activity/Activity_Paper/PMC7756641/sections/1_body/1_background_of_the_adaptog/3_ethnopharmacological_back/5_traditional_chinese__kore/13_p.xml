<p>“Kampo” (Traditional Japanese Academic Medicine) developed on the Japanese Islands from ca. 500 AD based on Ancient Chinese Medicine (ACM)—the common ancestor system of Japanese Kampo, Korean Medicine (KM), and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Subsequent independent developments and European influence in the 16th century resulted in a divergent cultural evolution establishing Kampo as an independent TMS distinct from other systems. Over the past centuries, fundamental philosophical differences have developed.

 </xref> Kampo is mostly based on the systematic collection of case histories—empirical knowledge of the effect of Kampo preparation. As Kampo is regulated by the Japanese government, Kampo prescriptions (as finished pharmaceutical products) are included in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) and covered by the national health insurance. Every Kampo formula is indicated for individuals with the same “symptom patterns”
