<p>The adaptive stress response is a survival mechanism. All functions of the body systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, nervous, endocrine, gastrointestinal digestive) are regulated by about 30,000 genes and fragments of DNA, which are located in the nucleus of every single cell. The activity of genes depends on the signals/stimuli received from numerous receptors and various proteins located on the outside surface of the cell membrane. The receptors specifically trigger signals from extracellular molecules—stressors (Figure 
 <xref rid="med21743-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and transfer the signals to genes via many signaling cascades (adaptive signaling pathways), which can interact and influence each other in a complex molecular network (Figure 
 <xref rid="med21743-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Collectively, this stimulus‐response system is known as the adaptive stress response system of the body responding to environmental stress.
