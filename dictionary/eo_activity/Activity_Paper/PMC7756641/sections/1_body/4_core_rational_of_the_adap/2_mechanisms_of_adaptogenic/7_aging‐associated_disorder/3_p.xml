<p>Overproduction of ROS in stress‐induced condition leads to destruction of proteins, including those triggering genetic programs of cellular senescence and cell death (apoptosis). Attenuation of functions, increasing damage to proteins, and toxic protein aggregates initiate aging‐related changes leading to disease, senescence, and reduced life span. In aging cells, substantially decreased expression of heat shock protein Hsp70 and its precursor, heat shock transcription factor HSF1, correlates with a decreased ability to cope with stress.

In addition, Hsp70 directly protects cells against switch to apoptosis. Decreased expression of HSF1 and Hsp70 in brain cells is observed in Alzheimer's disease.
