 </xref> One recent study in which the gene expression profiles of isolated brain cells were exposed to adaptogens, showed that at least 88 of the 3516 genes regulated by adaptogens modulate many signaling pathways involved in the adaptive stress response.

 </xref> Genes encoding neurohormones, transmembrane channels, and receptors, transcription regulators and ligand‐dependent nuclear receptors, protein kinases phosphatases, peptidases, metabolic enzymes, chaperones and other intermediates of intra‐ and extracellular communications (Table 
 <xref rid="med21743-tbl-0009" ref-type="table">9</xref>) are key elements in several canonical pathways involved in defence response, survival, longevity, and in maintaining of cellular and organismal homeostasis.
