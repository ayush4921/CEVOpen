<p>In addition to this possible source of ATP generation stimulated by adaptogens, apparently there are some other mechanisms of regulation of energy homeostasis by adaptogens. Thus, adaptogens presumably decrease c‐AMP level in brain cells by deregulation the expression of genes involved in regulation of cAMP.

 </xref> Consequently, low levels of c‐AMP decreases protein kinase A (PKA) overall activity. PKA activation effects vary with the cell type; for example, PKA stimulates lipases in adipocytes, while in myocytes and hepatocytes PKA increases glucose formation and its catabolic transformation to pyruvate (glycolysis). This provides free energy in the form of adenosyl triphosphate (ATP) and nicotine adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH), which are important in stress response. The regulation of cAMP levels and PKA activity is one of mechanisms of regulation of energy homeostasis, somewhat a metabolic switch between catabolism and anabolism. Stress‐induced catabolic transformations are induced by downregulation of cAMP and PKA by adaptogens. Apparently, PKA is involved in “energy‐saving” effect of adaptogens that favors ATP‐consuming anabolic pathways. Increased intracellular ATP levels and prevention of ATP‐conversion (to cAMP) is due to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase by adaptogens. An increased storage of ATP seems to represent an energy source for other ATP‐dependent metabolic conversions. This is consistent with the concept of ATP generation induced by adaptogens and their potential benefits in aging‐related diseases and fatigue.
