<p>For example, it was found that the fixed combination of 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Andrographis</italic> might be useful for the treatment of encephalitis because of the synergistic inhibition of the expression of a number of genes of the molecular network involved in the development of encephalitis, whereas neither 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus</italic> nor 
 <italic>Andrographis</italic> individually has an effect on these genes.

 </xref> Although microarray analysis did not provide the final proof of the efficacy of this fixed combination in humans with encephalitis after its oral administration, it provided information regarding its predictable (
 <italic>z</italic>‐score &gt; 2) effects on diseases and biological functions as well as insights into putative genes and directions for future research and possible implementation into practice.
