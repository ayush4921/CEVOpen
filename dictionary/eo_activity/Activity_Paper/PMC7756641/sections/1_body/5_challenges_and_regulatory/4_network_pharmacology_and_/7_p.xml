<p>The adaptogenic process is can be studied very well using “systems biology” and “network pharmacology” approaches, which has the potential to provide plant‐based treatments for complex diseases, chronic conditions, and syndromes. This is a remarkably complex system of synergistic interactions of molecular networks and cellular communication systems that quite literally add up to more than the sum of the parts. It also requires a detailed understanding of disease concepts, as we have outlined in this MS and second, the use of suitable pharmacological models to understand such effects. There can be no one to one correlation between use as an adaptogens and a specific model, and the suitability of a model needs to be assessed carefully before starting experimental approaches. Such approaches can help understanding these complex systems better and this is a key challenge in the future.</p>
