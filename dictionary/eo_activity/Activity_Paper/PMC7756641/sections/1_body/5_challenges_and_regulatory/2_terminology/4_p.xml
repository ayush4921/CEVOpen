    <italic>The HMPC is aware of the fact that numerous preclinical and clinical studies have been performed with the view to proving the concept of an adaptogen. However, the clinical data have a number of shortcomings such as deficiencies in the description of inclusion and exclusion criteria, description of the medication, diagnosis, study design, analysis, etc. There is a wide range of clinical conditions that have been investigated and in some studies the number of patients was very small. None of the studies would be sufficient to substantiate efficacy of Eleutherococcus preparations in a clearly defined clinical condition, although, in total, the data available are sufficient to justify further research into the concept of adaptogens</italic>.

    <italic>As the term “adaptogen” is considered not appropriate for a marketing authorization, more clinical studies and data on the efficacy in a well‐defined clinical condition would be necessary</italic>.
