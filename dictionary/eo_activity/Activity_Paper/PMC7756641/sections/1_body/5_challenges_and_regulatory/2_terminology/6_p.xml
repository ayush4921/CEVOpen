<p>Various adaptogenic herbal medicinal products, which are formally divided into two categories (EC–traditional, used for at least 30 years, including at least 15 years within the EU; and well‐established use, used within the EU for at least 10 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety), have a commonly acceptable level of safety and efficacy in various diseases. Nevertheless, more evidence from large‐scale, well‐controlled clinical trials of high‐quality uniform botanicals and their phase III pharmacovigilance data are essential for further implementation in common practice, at least for decreasing the risk of disease progression and as adjuvant therapy in infections and chronic diseases.</p>
