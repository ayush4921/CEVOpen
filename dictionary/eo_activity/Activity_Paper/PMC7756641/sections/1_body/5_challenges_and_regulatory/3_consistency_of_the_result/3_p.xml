<p>Studies on well‐defined preparations often show contradictory results, which is a common trait of herbal preparations per se. Although numerous studies of adaptogens have suggested an advantageous safety and tolerability profile as compared with conventional drugs, we also acknowledge several disadvantages of herbal preparations per se. Herbal preparations, although standardized to active constituents, are still very complex mixtures of many compounds and may have variable positive and negative effects depending on factors that have a crucial impact on the reproducibility of pharmacological activity (e.g., growing conditions, regional territory, and genus differences). Difficulties in manufacturing place herbal preparations at a disadvantage against conventional drugs, which are single compounds that remain identical and reproducible from batch to batch during production. In addition, various differently standardized herbal preparations of the same medicinal plant may have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic dose–effect responses. For example, the maximal active antifatigue, antidepressant, and antistressor dose of the SHR‐5 brand of

 </xref> Finally, we acknowledge the difficulties in producing herbal medicinal products that provide reproducible effectiveness over time, and this represents a serious challenge and limitation of herbal medicinal products and dietary supplements in general. However, despite these limitations, the development of herbal preparation for the prevention and treatment of many diseases is of great interest and has promising potential for safe, effective, and affordable therapies with superior tolerability and a low incidence of adverse events. More evidence from properly controlled clinical studies is required to support health claims and indications of pharmaceutical‐grade herbal preparations for use in disease treatment.
