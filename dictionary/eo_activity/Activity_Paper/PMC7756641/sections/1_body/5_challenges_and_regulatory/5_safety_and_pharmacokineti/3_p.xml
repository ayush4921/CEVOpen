 </xref> that intraperitoneally administered 3H‐labeled eleutheroside B (with radioactivity localized in the aglycone, 52 µCi/mmol) in rats demonstrated that eleutheroside B is quickly absorbed into the blood and distributed in the liver, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, thymus, spleen, heart, testes, brain, and hypophysis. The extent to which a compound is distributed throughout the body has a large impact on its therapeutic utility.
