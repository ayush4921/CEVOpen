 </xref> Salidroside was quickly absorbed into the blood of rats (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> = 1 h; bioavailability: 75%–90%) and metabolized to tyrosol within 2 h after oral administration of the 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> extract. The concentration of tyrosol attained its maximum value within 1.5–2.0 h and then decreased exponentially to basal level within 3 h after oral administration of the extract. Many of the measured pharmacokinetic parameters of purified salidroside were significantly different when the pure compound was administered (

 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>dis</sub>, AUC, 
 <italic>t</italic>‐1/2, and higher

 <sub>max</sub> and CI) rather than the plant extract. Rosavin had a lower bioavailability (20%–26%) and was eliminated from the blood within 2 h. The pharmacokinetics of rosavin in humans are different from that in rats. For example, both 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> (2 h) and elimination rate were longer in humans after oral administration of 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> tablets in a therapeutic daily dose. The maximal concentration and elimination half‐life of salidroside were two‐ to threefold higher than those of rosavin. The elimination of salidroside from the blood was 1.8‐fold longer than the elimination time of rosavin. The beneficial effect of 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> on mental performance in humans, which was observed 1 h after oral administration and lasted for more than 3 h, is worth noting. During this time period, the concentration of salidroside in human blood was about 587 ng/ml after 1 h and 483 ng/ml after 4 h.

 </xref> It was found that after intravenous administration, salidroside was extensively metabolized to tyrosol and then distributed to various organs and cleared rapidly. The highest levels of p‐tyrosol were detected in the heart, followed by the spleen, kidney, liver, and lungs.
