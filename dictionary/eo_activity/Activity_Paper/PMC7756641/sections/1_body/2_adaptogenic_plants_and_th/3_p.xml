<p>The number of plants reported as being adaptogenic has increased exponentially during the past decades. However, it should be emphasized that only a few comply with the most important criterium—exhibiting multitarget effects on the neuroendocrine‐immune system. These effects include triggering intracellular and extracellular adaptive signaling pathways that promote cell survival and organismal resilience in stress; and regulating metabolism and homeostasis via effects on the expression of stress hormones (corticotropin‐ and gonadotropin‐releasing hormones, urocortin, cortisol, melatonin, Hsp70, and neuropeptide Y) and their receptors.
