 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A shows the EDX of sennoside A capped AgNPs, which indicates the presence of only Ag element along with carbon and oxygen. The corresponding SEM and TEM images are given in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B and C, respectively, which reveals the presence of roughly spherical well dispersed NPs. The size of NPs was calculated from the TEM images with Gaussian distribution and average particle diameter was found to be 12 nm (
