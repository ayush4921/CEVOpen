<p id="p0185">Khan et al. studied the antimicrobial activities of methanol extract of cassia alata leaves, flowers, stem bark and root bark with different 28 microorganisms and reported that the E. coli and S. aureus were the most active human pathogen (
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2001</xref>). Our results showed that sennoside A and Ag/sennoside A NPs were most active against with E. coli and S. aureus microorganisms used in this study. The antifungal activities were also determined with candida albicans ATCC 10231 and candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 under similar conditions (

 <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> clearly shows that the slopes of inhibition against [sennoside A] are higher in the initial stage, indicating the higher cell death in the first stage. A number of mechanisms have been suggested for the antimicrobial activities of AgNPs by various investigators on several occasions (

 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>). The release of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions from the surface of AgNPs and reactive oxygen species were responsible for the antimicrobial activities of AgNPs. It is well known that the protein of bacteria cell wall have various coordination sites due to the presence of pH sensitive –NH
 <sub>2</sub>, and –COOH groups, which have strong coordinating properties towards metal ions and/or metal NPs. Due to the nano-metric size AgNPs were pass through the cell membrane and formed stable complex with the active functional groups, which disturbed the normal activity of cell well protein, membrane bound enzymes, lipids, DNA replication as well as structure of bacteria. After inclusion of metallic silver in nanoscale into the cell membrane of bacteria, the sulphur containing cysteine oxidized simultaneously and released silver ions into the bacteria (

 <sub>50</sub> was found to be 0.63, 0.21, 0.45 mg/L and 0.53, 0.32, 0. 48 mg/L against antibacterial strain S. aureus and antifungal albicans ATCC 10231 for pure sennoside, Ag/sennoside A NPs, and rhein-9-anthrone, respectively. The excellent inhibitory effect of Ag/sennoside A NPs might be due to the combined synergistic effect of Ag NPs and sennoside A. The incorporation of AgNPs into the cell wall were responsible to inhibit the growth, changes the wall integrity and leads to cell death with the variation of osmotic pressure.
