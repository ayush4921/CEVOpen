<p id="p0045">The aqueous extract of senna leaves contains sennosides (A and B), aloe-emodin (glycoside and diglycoside) and rehin (glycoside, diglycoside, and anthrone) (
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Su, 2002</xref>). Habib and Elsebakhy reported that the UV–visible spectra of aloe-emodin and rehin showed a well-defined sharp absorption peak at ca. 260 nm and 440 nm and sennosides A and B exhibited absorption peak at 270 nm and 370 nm in ethylacetate (
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Habib and Elsebakhy, 1980</xref>). Tan et al. reported that the standard solution of sennoside A and sennoside B showed absorption peaks at 269 nm, 340 nm and 268 nm and 358 nm, respectively, in water-acetonitrile system (

In order to characterize the extracted dark yellow solid, UV– visible spectra were recorded under different experimental conditions. Our spectra does not contained any absorption peak in the entire visible region (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; vide infra), which indicated that the aloe-emodin and rehin constituents were not present in the aqueous extract. On the other hand, the absence of absorption peaks at 358 nm also indicated that the sennoside B was also not present in the extract and was ignored completely. Therefore, sennoside A was the main constituent in the aquous extract and its molar concentration was calculated with using molar extinction coefficient, ε = 9430 L/mol/cm (
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Hietala et al., 1988</xref>) at 340 nm wavelength. The Beer-Lambert law was obeyed for the entire range concentration (from 1.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 18.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mol/L) of sennoside A with correlation coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998).
