Surfactant, polymer, ligand, and organic solvents were used as a capping agent. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (cationic surfactant) acted as an excellent stabilizing agent in the nanotechnology, which can be removed from the surface of NPs by washing (

Sennosides and anthracene derivatives have been used as laxative to the treatment of constipation and colon infection. Therefore, we used sennoside A as a reducing agent to the synthesis of AgNPs for the first time.
