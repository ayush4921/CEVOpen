   <bold>BGSN3</bold> and three different DBCO-derivative fluorophores. Protein (5 µM) was incubated with 5 µM of the azide-based BG for 60 min at 25 °C; then, an equimolar amount of DBCO-based substrate was added for the chemical click reaction, keeping the same time and temperature conditions. As control, SNAP-

   <sup>®</sup> was incubated only with 
   <bold>SVG</bold> (lane 1, signal marked with an asterisk).
