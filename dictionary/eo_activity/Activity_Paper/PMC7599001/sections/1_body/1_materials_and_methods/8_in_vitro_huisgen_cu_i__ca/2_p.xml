 <bold>BGSN3</bold>. An opportune amount of purified proteins was incubated within an equimolar ratio of these substrates for 60–120 min at 25 °C and 37 °C respectively, to ensure the complete enzymatic labelling reaction. Later, we performed the subsequent cycloaddition using 5 µM of an alkyne-derivative of the fluorescein (
 <bold>BDP FL alkyne</bold>), in the presence of copper (1 mM), TCEP (1 mM), TBTA (0.1 mM) and, where indicated, of SDS (0.05%). Finally, mixtures were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analysed as described in Section 4 (
