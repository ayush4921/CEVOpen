<p>HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Roche, Switzerland). HEK293T cells were transfected with SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> plasmid by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocol. The treatment with 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> were performed, at the concentration and time indicated for each experiment. Twenty-four hours after transfection, we treated cells with 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> for 2 h at different concentrations ranging (from 1 to 25 µM), directly dissolving the compound in complete culture medium. Then cells were harvested, washed with PBS 1× buffer and lysed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with complete protease (Roche, Switzerland) and phosphatase (SERVA Electrophoresis, Germany) inhibitors. Afterwards, transfected cells were treated with a fixed concentration of 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> (10 µM) at different time points (from 30 to 120 min). Again, HEK293T cells were washed and lysed as described before. To confirm the reaction with 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>, the same amount of protein extract (0.91 µg/µL for each sample) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 
 <bold>SVG</bold>. Subsequently, proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analysed by 
 <italic>gel-imaging</italic> on a VersaDoc 4000™ system (Bio-Rad), by applying a blue LED/530 bandpass filter (
