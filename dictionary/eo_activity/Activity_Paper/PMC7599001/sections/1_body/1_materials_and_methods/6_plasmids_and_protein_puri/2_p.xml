<p>The cloning procedures in the pQE31 expression vector (Qiagen, Germany) were similar for both proteins. In particular, the pSNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>(m) Vector was used as a template to amplify the DNA fragment relative to the SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> gene, by using QE_SNAP-Fwd/QE_SNAP-Rev oligonucleotides pairs (5′-ATGGCAGGATCCAA TGGACAAAGACTGCGAAATG-3′/5′-CTATCAAAGCTTAACCCAGCCCAGGCTTGCCCA G-3′; 
 <italic>BamH</italic> I and 
 <italic>Hind</italic> III sites, respectively, are underlined). Afterwards, the resulting fragment and the pQE31 vector were digested with 
 <italic>BamH</italic> I and 
 <italic>Hind</italic> III restriction enzymes and ligated, leading to the final pQE-SNAP plasmid. The final SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> protein was expressed with an extra N-terminal aminoacidic sequence, comprising a His
 <sub>6</sub>-
 <italic>tag</italic> (MRGSHHHHHHTDP-). The ligation mixture was used to transform 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> KRX competent cells and positive colonies were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analyses.
