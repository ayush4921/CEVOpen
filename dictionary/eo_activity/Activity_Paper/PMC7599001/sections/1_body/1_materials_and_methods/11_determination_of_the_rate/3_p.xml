 <bold>BGSN3</bold>, which was obtained by the afore-described protocol, in order to get the complete labelling. Then, to each aliquot of 5 µM of 
 <italic>clickable</italic> proteins, 20 µM of 
 <bold>DBCO-PEG
  <sub>4</sub>-Fluor 545
 </bold> fluorophore was added. At different times, an excess of sodium azide (NaN
 <sub>3</sub>, 300 mM) was immediately added to each aliquot and then placing tubes on ice, in order to stop the click reaction between the azide group on the 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> and the

  <sub>4</sub>-Fluor 545
