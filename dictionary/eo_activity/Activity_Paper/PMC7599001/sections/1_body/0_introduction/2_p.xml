<p>The advent of the self-labelling 
 <italic>protein-tags</italic> (SLPs) has led to a huge push in modern biotechnology, especially in the field of cell biology, where auto-fluorescent proteins (AFPs) for a long time dominated for their versatility in the localisation experiments of proteins, organelles, and membranes

 </xref>. But the use of SLPs clearly goes beyond: they catalyse the covalent, highly specific and irreversible attachment of a part of their synthetic ligands upon reaction. This offers the opportunity to label them by conjugation to those ligands of an infinite number of chemical groups, such as fluorescent dyes, affinity molecules, or solid surfaces, expanding the application fields
