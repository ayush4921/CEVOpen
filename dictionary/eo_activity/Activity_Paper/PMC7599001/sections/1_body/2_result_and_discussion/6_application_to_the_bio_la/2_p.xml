 <sup>®</sup> technology to the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for the covalent immobilisation of a protein of interest was first explored by the group of Kai Johnsson

 </xref>. Their approaches, again, required preliminarily the synthesis and the purification of a compatible substrate to cover the sensor chip surface. We used, instead, the

 <sup>®</sup> directly on an alkyne-derived sensor chip of the bio layer interferometry (BLI) equipment, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>. This technique is more advantageous with respect to the SPR because: (i) it needs a smaller amount of sample, making it more compatible to higher throughput (the capacity of running up to 96 samples in a parallel); (ii) the possibility to reuse samples, and (iii) of the total independency from any microfluidic issues.
