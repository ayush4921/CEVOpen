<p>After the enzymatic reaction of

In this case, the complete fluorescein labelling of the protein was achieved only in the presence of a small amount of SDS during the cycloaddition step (lane 3), suggesting that the protein is still folded after the enzymatic reaction and the azide is hidden in the active site core. The addition of the denaturant could have slightly opened the protein structure, favouring a better exposure of the azide group to the solvent, and allowing the click reaction to occur.
