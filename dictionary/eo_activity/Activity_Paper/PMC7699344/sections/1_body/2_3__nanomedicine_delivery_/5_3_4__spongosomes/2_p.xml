<p>Zou et al. reported the fabrication of BJO-loaded spongosomes and conducted a detailed structural characterization using cryogenic TEM (Cryo-TEM), SAXS, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The spongosomes had sizes in the range of 120 to 200 nm in diameter. Due to the alginate coating, the colloidal properties of each spongosome sample were stable over a 30-day storage period. From a drug delivery perspective, it was noted that spongosomes containing 2 mg/mL BJO maintained a high encapsulation efficiency of around 90% even after 30 days. In vitro cancer cell testing showed that the spongosomes containing 2 mg/mL BJO had the most potent inhibitory effect. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of free BJO and spongosomes containing 2 mg/mL BJO were around 68 and 28 Î¼g/mL, respectively, while the spongosome without BJO was nontoxic.
