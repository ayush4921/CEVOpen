<p>Dou et al. reported another nanoemulsion delivery platform for quassinoids, which they termed a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The nanoemulsions were used to encapsulate BD quassinoid and were orally administered to treat ulcerative colitis in rats. Different excipients were tested as candidates to improve the BD solubility in water, and Solutol HS-15 and propylene glycol were identified as high-performing ones (

Various oils were also tested to improve the BD solubility, and a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil was the best performing one. As such, nanoemulsions comprising BD in a mixture of MCT oil, Solutol HS-15, and propylene glycol were fabricated (

The BD nanoemulsions had typical diameters of around 20 nm and remained stable after various processing conditions such as heating, cooling, and repeated freeze-thawing, as well as upon dilution in aqueous solutions with different pH conditions. In vitro release profile testing in simulated intestinal (pH 6.8) and gastric (pH 1.2) fluid conditions showed that the BD nanoemulsions enabled a greater release in near-neutral pH conditions, with a total release of around 86% over an approximately 12-h time period (
