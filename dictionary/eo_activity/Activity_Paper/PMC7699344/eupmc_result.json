    "<i>Brucea javanica</i> oil (BJO) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various types of cancer and inflammatory diseases. There is significant interest in understanding the medicinal activities of BJO and its molecular components, especially quassinoids, and in exploring how they can be incorporated into nanomedicine delivery strategies for improved application prospects. Herein, we cover the latest progress in developing different classes of drug delivery vehicles, including nanoemulsions, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, and spongosomes, to encapsulate BJO and purified quassinoids. An introduction to the composition and medicinal activities of BJO and its molecular components, including quassinoids and fatty acids, is first provided. Application examples involving each type of drug delivery vehicle are then critically presented. Future opportunities for nanomedicine delivery strategies in the field are also discussed and considered within the context of translational medicine needs and drug development processes."
