<p>After the collection of the blood, the mice were sacrificed and the liver was dissected out, and weighed. Then, it was preserved in a 10% formalin solution. A portion of liver tissue from the right lobe of the liver was taken and dehydrated in different grades of ethanol (40%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100%) and cleared with xylene. Xylene was also cleared using paraffin wax using an automatic tissue processing machine. The tissues were embedded with paraffin wax and blocked in the coronal plane. Sections of 4â€“5 micrometer thickness of the tissue was made using a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin dye, and a histological observation was made under a light microscope.</p>
