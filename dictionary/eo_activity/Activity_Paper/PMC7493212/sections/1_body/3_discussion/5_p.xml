<p>An increase in liver weight is an indication of liver injury.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In the present study, liver weight of the mice administered with paracetamol alone significantly increased compared to the normal control group (P&lt;0.01). The reason is that water is retained in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes leading to enlargement of liver cells, resulting in increased total liver mass.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In our study, the crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> administered at a dose of 400 mg/kg reduced liver weight of the mice significantly (P&lt;0.05).
