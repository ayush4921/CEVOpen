<p>The crude extract showed the highest free radical scavenging activity with 50% inhibitory concentration of 128.6 µg/mL compared to the aqueous fraction and chloroform fraction [IC50:168.9µg/mL and 406µg/mL], respectively. The maximum percentage of inhibition was observed with the crude extract (71%) at the highest concentration (200 µg/mL) (
