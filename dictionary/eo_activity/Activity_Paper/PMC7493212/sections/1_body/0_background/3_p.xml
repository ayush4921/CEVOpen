 <italic>Senna singueana</italic> demonstrated hepatoprotective activity against D-galactosamine-induced liver damage in rats by its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects.

 <italic>Lannea stuhlmannii</italic> and 
 <italic>Lannea humilis</italic> exhibit hepatoprotective activities against D-galactosamine-induced hepatic injury in rats. The hepatoprotective activity of the extracts was due to the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of tannins and proanthocyanidins.
