<p>Paracetamol is a commonly available over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic drug which is associated with acute liver damage. The hepatotoxicity associated with paracetamol is mainly due to excessive accumulation of its toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which oxidizes liver tissue macromolecules such as lipid or -SH group of protein causing oxidative stress and hepatic necrosis.
