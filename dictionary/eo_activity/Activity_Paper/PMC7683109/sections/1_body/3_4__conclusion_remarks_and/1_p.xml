<p>The current treatment for neurodegenerative diseases is based on synthetic drugs that show undesirable side effects or toxicity. On the other hand, natural components are thought to be relatively safe and effective; therefore, many researchers have focused to find herbal products with neuroprotective effects. Initial experimental studies have shown that natural CA and its derivatives have therapeutic effects via modulation of several mechanisms, such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic connection in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD. However, further studies in animal models and clinical trials are needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of CA and its derivatives as a potential therapeutic option for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
