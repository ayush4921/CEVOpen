<p id="p0125">The analgesic effects of each of TIME, TIEAE and TIHE were evaluated using formalin tests. Swiss albino mice were injected with 20μl of 3% formalin into the sub plantar space of the left hind paw. After 30 min, control, standard, TIME-2, TIME-4, TIEAE-2, TIEAE-4, TIHE-2 and TIHE-4 group were administered their individual dose. Anti-nociceptive effect was determined in two phases. The acute phase was recorded during the first 5 min, while the late phase was recorded during the last 15–30 min after formalin injection. Mice were observed and the amount of time spent licking the injected hind paw was measured in seconds during the acute phase (0–5 min) and late phase (15–30 min). The time (in second) spent in licking responses of the injected paw was considered as an indicator of pain response [

 <disp-formula id="ufd2">Inhibition (%) = [Duration of paw licking (control) – Duration of paw licking (test)] × 100/Duration of paw licking (control).</disp-formula>
