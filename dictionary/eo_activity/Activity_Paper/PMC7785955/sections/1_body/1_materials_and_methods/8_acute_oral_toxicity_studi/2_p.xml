<p id="p0105">All conform to OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) guideline rules 423 (acute toxic class method). 20 Swiss albino mice were used for the study, since the plant extracts are relatively nontoxic; the starting dose level of TIME, TIEAE and TIHE was selected as 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg and the extract was administered orally to mice which were fasted overnight with water ad libitum. In accordance with before and after treatment, body weights of mice were recorded. The onset of toxicity and signs of toxicity were recorded for 14 days.
