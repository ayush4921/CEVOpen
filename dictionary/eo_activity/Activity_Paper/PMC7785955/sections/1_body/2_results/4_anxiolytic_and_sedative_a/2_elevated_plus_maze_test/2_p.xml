<p id="p0155">Anxiolytic activity of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves was evaluated by elevated plus-maze test. In the study, the administration of TIME-4, TIEAE-4 and TIHE-4 significantly (p &lt; 0.001) elevated the number of open arm entries compared with control (3.40 ± 0.51) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Increased duration in the open arm entries was also observed (p &lt; 0.01) for TIME-4 and TIEAE-4 in a dose-dependent manner compared with control (64.40 ± 2.06) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). TIHE-4 was most significant in terms of the number of arm entries (9.60 ± 1.82) and the duration in open arm (89.80 ± 4.60 min) when compared with the control group. Similarly, the standard group exhibited a marked increase (p &lt; 0.001) in the number of arm entries (13.40 ± 1.36) and the duration in the open arm entries (114.60 ± 1.72) compared with control (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A-B). However, numbers of close arm entries were not different among the groups (

 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. leaves.
