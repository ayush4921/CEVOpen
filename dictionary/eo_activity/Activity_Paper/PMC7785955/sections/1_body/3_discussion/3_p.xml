<p id="p0185">Numerous plant extracts have been shown to have anxiolytics properties, a compound of substance that inhibits anxiety. EPM is a widely used assay to examine anxiety in laboratory animals [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Using EPM assay, we found that administration of different group of TIME, TIEAE and TIHE induced an anxiolytic-like effect in mice as demonstrated by increased open arm entries and the time spent in the open arms compared to control. Mostly dysfunction of neurotransmitters (dopamine, GABA, and serotonin) or dysregulation of glutamatergic, serotonergic, GABA-ergic, and noradrenergic transmission cause anxiety. In the study, extracts of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. may induce anxiolytic activity by altering the function and synthesis of neurotransmitters. It is assumed that active components of the plant interact either with neurotransmitters or with neuromodulator receptors. These receptors are responsible for the regulation of neuronal communication, stimulation of the CNS activity and development of endocrine systems function [

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, our phytochemical screening reported that the plant contains flavonoids, terpinoids, tannins and saponins which may exhibit anxiolytic activity by interacting with the neurotransmitter or neuromodulator receptors. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the plant contains potential compounds that show anxiolytic effect.The chemical compounds that reduce the time of onset of sleep and/or extend the duration of sleeping time, often exhibit sedative and CNS depressant activity [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Numerous studies report that the bioactive compounds work through gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, there is a possibility that the TIME, TIEAE and TIHE act on GABA receptors to mediate the downstream actions. In general, brain cells make GABA using glutamate that works as inhibitory neurotransmitter resulting in reduced firing rate of nerve cells [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. GABA receptor is a ligand-based ion channel whose activation leads to the cellular inhibition in the CNS [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Mechanistically, the phytochemical constituents saponins and alkaloids have been revealed to be able to stimulate GABA receptors [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our findings evidenced that 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. has a pronounced effect on both induction and duration of sleep. Our phytochemical screening reveals the presence of a multitude of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids and saponins that may underlie the observed effects. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the plant contains potential compounds that show sedative and anxiolytic effect. Future investigation need to be performed to identify the bioactive compounds that inducing the sedative properties.
