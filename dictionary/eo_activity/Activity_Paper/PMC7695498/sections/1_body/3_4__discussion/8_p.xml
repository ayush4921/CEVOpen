<p>Excessive ROS production that exceeds critical levels can overcome all the heart's antioxidants' protection strategy, causing oxidative stress that damages the biological tissues in the hearts. This, in turn, may cause the degeneration of the myocardium, which distorts myocardial and reduces the interstitium space of the heart (
