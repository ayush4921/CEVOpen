<p>The weight of animals in groups A, C, and D (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) during the administration progressively increased weekly throughout the administration period. These are contrary to the animals in group B with a progressive weight loss weekly. Also, animals in group B showed a progressive weight loss (from 198.6 ± 10.9 g to 162.8 ± 10.1 g); this implies that they lost weight when the animals' initial value in 1st week and final weight of the animals in 6th week (-35.8) were compared. However, there was an increased in the weight gain of animals in the groups A, C, and D when their (1st week) initial weight (188.4 ± 8.6 g, 195.2 ± 9.8 g, and 192.2 ± 8.8 g) was compared with the (6th week) final weight (212.6 ± 10.8 g, 212.4 ± 7.5 g, and 221.0 ± 8.5 g).
