<p>Although there is an evident antihyperglycemic effect of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract on induced diabetes in experimental animals, the duration of these studies were short, and also another model of type 2 diabetes studies would be interesting to elucidate the exact mechanisms of action of this plant. In addition, there has been one clinical trial that contradicted findings from animal studies. Namely, aqueous extract (infusion of dried 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> leaves) was tested to evaluate a clinical effect in 22 type 2 diabetic patients that had poor response to conventional treatment. The results showed that infusion reduced glucose levels by only 0.64%, cholesterol by 4.16%, and triglycerides by 5.78% [
