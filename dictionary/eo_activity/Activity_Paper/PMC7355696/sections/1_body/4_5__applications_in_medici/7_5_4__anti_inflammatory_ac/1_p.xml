<p>Investigation of the anti-inflammatory effect of the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in a rat model showed that serum creatinine kinase-MB was subsided by 52.2–69.0% (depending on the dose of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract). In addition, the treatment with extracts significantly reduced myocardial myeloperoxidase activity in myocardial infarction [

 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) also declined considerably in the serums of rats with myocardial infarction. In addition, peripheral neutrophil count was significantly lowered by all doses of the extract. Interstitial fibrosis was significantly attenuated by treatment with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> compared to control. The results of this study demonstrated that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts have strong protective effects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction, and it seems possible that this protection is a result of its anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, the 11-oxomarrubiin, vulgarcoside A, and 3-hydroxyapigenin-4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-(6′′-
 <italic>O</italic>-p-coumaroyl)-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside from the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> exhibited moderate to low levels of inhibition on NO production, while vulgarcoside A also showed a moderate inhibition effect on pro-inflammatory cytokinine TNF-α [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> showed inhibitory activity toward the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which plays a key role in the transformation of arachidonic acid into pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and is associated with inflammation [
