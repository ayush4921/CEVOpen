<p>Moreover, one study was undertaken to determine the antifungal activity of flavonoids (flavans and flavanols) extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> against two fungal strains; 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> ATCC 16,404 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10,231 using the solid medium diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained range between 6.25 and 100 μg/mL and led to experiencing strong antifungal inhibition, which often exceeded the effect of marketed antifungals (amphotericin, fluconazole, terbinafine, and econazole nitrate) that marked 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> flavonoids as potentially powerful antifungal agents [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] concluded that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> and marrubiin can be used as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin dermatophyte infections. They examined the effect of acetone and methanol extracts, essential oil, and marrubin (all in two doses: 20 and 100 μg/mL) against the dermatophytes fungi

 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>, 
 <italic>Arthroderma cajetani</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton tonsurans</italic>, 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic>, and against two fungi strains (
