<p>The in vitro anticancer activity of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> ethanolâ€“water extracts (90:10,

 <italic>v</italic>) and six pure compounds (acacetin, acacetin-7-rhamnoseide, apigenin, diosmetin, diosmetin-7-glucoside, and luteolin-7-rhamnoside) were also tested against Ehrlich tumor cell lines, human tumor cell lines U251 (brain tumor) and MCF7 (breast cell lines) [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Alcoholic extracts, acacetin, apigenin, and acacetin-7-rhamnoside showed high anticancer activity against breast carcinoma, whereas all tested compounds had anticancer activity against Ehrlich tumor cell lines. Another study [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that labdanein (methoxylated flavone) from 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> displayed a moderate effect on human myeloid leukemia (K562) and imatinib-resistant human myeloid leukemia (K562R) cells, as well as on human B cell precursor leukemia cell lines (697). The authors of this study suggested that these results provide a common natural source for the hemi-synthesis of future ladanein-derived flavones and the study of their antileukemic activity. Tlili et al. [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> and other Tunisian plant extracts on leukemia and colon cancer cell lines (K-562 and CaCo-2, respectively). Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory activity was assessed, and the results showed that white horehound possesses the highest activity in the group of analyzed plants.
