 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Latin name 
 <italic>Marrubium</italic> derives from the Hebrew word 
 <italic>marrob</italic>, meaning bitter juice, while 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> means ‘common’ or ‘well known’. In the English language, the name ‘horehound’ comes from the Old English words 
 <italic>har</italic> and 
 <italic>hune</italic>, meaning downy plant. The most common folk name in the Serbian language is 
 <italic>očajnica</italic> meaning a ’desperate woman’, because tea from this herb was typically used as a bitter remedy by women who were unable to conceive (for regulation of menstrual cycle). Nevertheless, the most prevailing traditional application of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> worldwide is for the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders.
