<p>The accumulation of furanic labdane diterpenes in plantlets seemingly depends on the developmental stage. No furanic labdane diterpenes were detected in plantlets during the first four to five weeks following germination. At this time, the leaves become more differentiated, and the number of trichomes on leaves is increasing. Young leaves and buds contain the highest content of furanic labdane diterpenes, which are mostly stored in peltate glandular trichomes [
