<p>Drying is used to dehydrate plants by reducing the moisture content that encourages biochemical deterioration, as well as the growth of microorganisms. The drying air temperature is a determining factor in drying kinetics. The drying rate decreases in low drying temperature. Any increment in the drying air temperature (50, 60, 70 and 80 °C) increases the energy efficiency, while any increment in the air flow rate (150 and 300 m
 <sup>3</sup>/h) shows an inverse effect.
