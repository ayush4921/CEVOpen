<p>In the present study, SNPs were synthesized using an eco-friendly protocol of extracts from the roots, stems, leaves, and fruit of CT for as reducing, stabilizing, and capping agents for biomedical purposes. This is a one-pot and “green” nanotechnology for quick and facile synthesis of CT-SNPs. The synthesized CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs showed high phenol and flavonoid content, as well as a powerful antioxidant and reducing capacity. The characterization of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs was conducted using UV-Vis spectra, DLS, HR-TEM, EDS, XRD, and FT-IR. The results showed well dispersed and highly crystalline SNPs. The photocatalytic activity in the CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs during the organic azo dye degradation can be accredited to MB, MO, RB, and RB5, respectively. Our result also demonstrated that CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs have more effective antibacterial properties against gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus, B. cereus</italic>) and gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>) bacteria and cytotoxicity and apoptosis against hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) than individual extracts. CTR-SNPs showed significantly more photocatalytic and biological properties than CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs. SNPs have received increasing attention as anti-bacteria or tumor therapeutics as they can be engineered to target specific bacteria or tumor cells. Recent evidence suggests that anti-bacterial and anti-tumor properties of green synthesized SNPs could be allied with the interaction between SNPs and cell membranes, suppressing the bacteria and tumor cells. According to the results of our study, we suggest that the anti-bacteria and anti-tumor properties of CT-SNPs is an efficient therapeutic target. Further studies are necessary to clarify the underlying potential molecular mechanisms that regulate disease progression involving these anti-bacterial and anti-tumor benefits. Hence, our findings provide strong evidence that CT-SNPs are beneficial owing to their photocatalytic and biological properties and may show promising biomedical applications.
