<p>The free radical ABTS and DPPH scavenging capacity of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts was determined according to the method, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts were mixed with ABTS (7 mM) or DPPH solution (60 µM) in 24-well microplates. The optical density value of the mixture was explored at 734 nm (ABTS) and 510 nm (DPPH), using a FLUOstar
 <sup>®</sup> Omega Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).
