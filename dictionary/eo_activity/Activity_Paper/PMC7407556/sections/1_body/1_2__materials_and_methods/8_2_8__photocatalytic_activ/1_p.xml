<p>The photocatalytic activities of the CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs were evaluated by degrading MB, MO, RB, and RB5 dye by [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs were added to MB (0.8 mM), MO (0.05 mM), RB (0.05 mM), and RB5 (0.05 mM) solution and then, ice-cold sodium borohydride (0.06 M) solution was added. The photodegradation monitored using an Evolutionâ„¢ 300 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the range of 300 to 800 nm with regular intervals.
