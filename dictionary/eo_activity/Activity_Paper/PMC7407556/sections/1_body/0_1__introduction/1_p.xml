<p>Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) are noteworthy owing to their extensive applications in cosmetics, biomedical, food, and health industries, fungicidal agents, and water-based systems. This may be due to their unique conductivity, optical catalytic activity, biocompatible nature, and better structural properties than their bulk counterparts [

 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SNPs have also been shown to possess potential biological properties, such as antibacterial, antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory activities [

Over the past decade, rapid-green synthesis approaches, and methods for producing SNPs, have been an interesting area in “green” nanotechnologies. Currently, SNP-mediated biogenic sources that are chosen to substitute toxic chemical methods have shown significant potential in reducing polluting reaction by-products. The “green” nanotechnologies are advantageous over physical and chemical methods and exploit economical and ecofriendly methods by using an available and non-toxic medium, such as medicinal plants that leads to the green synthesis of SNPs [

 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The application of medicinal plants in the formation of SNPs has prompted numerous investigations in the field of “green” nanotechnologies. Compared to other biogenic sources, including bacteria and fungi, medicinal plants appear to be more facilitative and faster, which significantly increases the productivity of this green-synthetic approach [

Notably, the medicinal plants used were known for their phytochemical characteristics, such as reducing capacity, stabilization, and capping biogenic sources. The major phytochemicals of medicinal plants that affect the reducing capacity, stabilization, and capping of the SNPs are phenolics, flavones, terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, proteins, and alcoholic compounds [
