<p>The DPPH radical inhibition assay was used to determine the antioxidant capacity. The individual samples showed a good radical scavenging activity but, more importantly, in this assay, the combination of two species revealed that mixed fruit juices possess a higher antioxidant potential than the individual ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05468-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The DPPH radical inhibition capacity of the tested samples ranged from 20% to 95%, which indicates significant antioxidant activity. The best DPPH activity was obtained for mixed juice of 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina.</italic> The interactions effects of polyphenolic compounds in the juice composition may occur due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between them, leading to a decrease in the ability of hydroxyl groups to inhibit free radicals and then an antagonistic effect may occur. If functional groups such as methoxyl are found in the structure of the compounds, this effect may be reversed and could lead to an increase in antioxidant activity, so a synergistic effect may occur [

 <sup>•</sup> assay, individual catechin and epicatechin showed lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> values when compared with the combination of the same compounds at the same level of concentrations, which means that their combination led to a synergistic antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This may be the explanation for the increased antioxidant effect of the mixtures between 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> or 
 <italic>Thricosanthes cucumerina</italic> which are rich in epicatechin, and 
 <italic>Cucumis metuliferus</italic>, rich in catechin. Muhammad et al. studied the interaction between different combinations of binary mixtures by DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay, such as epicatechin and gallic acid in various ratios and concluded that they are slightlys synergetic, whereas catechin and gallic acid are slightly to moderately synergetic [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The interaction of the juices’ constituents may influence the antioxidant activity of the mixtures, so this may be the reason why some juice mixtures showed a very good to moderate synergetic effect.
