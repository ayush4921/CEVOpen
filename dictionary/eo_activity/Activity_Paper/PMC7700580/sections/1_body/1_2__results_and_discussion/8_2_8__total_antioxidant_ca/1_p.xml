<p>This assay aims to support the idea that the formulation of a combination of selected plants may have a synergistic effect on antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This method, based on the reduction of the molybdenum cation, is a useful quantitative method for evaluating water and fat-soluble compounds with antioxidant capacity (total antioxidant capacity). To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of TAC in these four species. The analyzed juices exhibited different activities (

 <italic>M. charantia</italic> and 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> juices showed the best antioxidant capacity which may be due to the electron-donating existing compounds, such as polyphenols, which can transform free reactive species into non-reactive compounds, which are more stable. The comparison between individual and mixed juices values of TAC assay shows the best antioxidant capacity to reduce molybdenum for 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> mixed juice.
