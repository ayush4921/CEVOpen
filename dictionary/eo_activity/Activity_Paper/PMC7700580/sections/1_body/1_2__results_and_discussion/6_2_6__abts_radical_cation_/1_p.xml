<p>Our results demonstrate that individual and combined juices of 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> have the best synergistic ABTS radical scavenger activity, with values between 29.47 and 32.60 μETx/mL juice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05468-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The 
 <italic>B.hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> radical scavenger activity was reduced, considering the applied time interval. Two antagonistic mixed juices obtained from 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> and 
 <italic>B.hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>B.hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> (ranging from 2.22 to 6.23 μETx/mL juice) had decreasing radical scavenger activity. On the other hand, the ABTS activity of the mixed juices comprised of 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina, C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. hispida,</italic> or 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>. and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> had average values compared to individual juices. Therefore, this analysis is the only method that reflects the antioxidant capacity of fresh juices individually and in combination, with both antagonistic and synergistic effects.
