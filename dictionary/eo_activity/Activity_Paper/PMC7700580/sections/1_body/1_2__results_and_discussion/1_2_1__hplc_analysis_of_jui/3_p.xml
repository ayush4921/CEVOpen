<p>We performed an ANOVA analysis to detect the differences between the averages of the concentrations of the compounds from each of the four groups (
 <italic>M. charantia, C. metuliferus, B. hispida</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic>). The Levene test confirms the homogeneity of the variants (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Since, in the ANOVA results, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in all cases, the averages in the content of analysed compounds are significantly different for at least two of the four groups analysed. The results of the Duncan test are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05468-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (if the mean values per line differ significantly between groups, then the letters labelling them are different).
