<p>The aim of our study was to investigate the chemical composition of fresh juices of the four mentioned species, namely 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> ”Brâncuși” variety, 
 <italic>Cucumis metuliferus</italic> ”Tempus” variety, 
 <italic>Benincasa hispida</italic> ”Zefir” variety and 
 <italic>Trichosanthes Cucumerina</italic> ”Felix” variety, from the Cucurbitaceae family, acclimatized in Buzau, Romania (

Another purpose of this study was to investigate, in a comparative way, the in vitro antioxidant activities and iron binding abilities of both individual and combined juice assortments from these plant varieties in order to stimulate the increase of consumption of fresh juices useful for a rich, diverse and health-promoting diet. The fact that scientific publications focusing on the profile and content of antioxidant compounds in fresh juices obtained from these plant species are rare, has motivated us to discover more information on the antioxidant properties of combined fruit juices that can work in a synergistic manner. The present study also highlights the potential of fresh juices as a promising and attractive source of valuable phytochemicals and natural antioxidants for the development of health products and medicines.
