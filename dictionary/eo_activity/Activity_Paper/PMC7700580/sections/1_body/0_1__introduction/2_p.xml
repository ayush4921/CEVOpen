 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L. (bitter melon) is one of the most well known and studied species of Cucurbitaceae and due to its ample and unique chemical composition, it is a very good candidate for the development of anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic health products and medicines. Fresh juice from 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> could control blood sugar and insulin levels, as well as improving the human digestive system. The daily dose of a 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> juice drink helps to increase body stamina and prevents fatigue [

 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and benzoic acid [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Various parts of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> have shown significantly different antioxidant activities when ferric reducing power assay were used. The antioxidant activity of unripe 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> fruit was found to be higher than that of ripened fruit, but lower than that of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> stem and leaves [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other studies revealed that non-polar extracts from this plant showed good antioxidant activity which might be attributed to the content of fatty acids and essential oils rather than phenolic-based compounds [

 <italic>M. charantia</italic> has been shown to have anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity, which is beneficial for anti-ulcer activity [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two in vitro studies have highlighted the anti-herpes, ribosome-inactivating proteins MAP30 against HSV-2 and HSV-1 activities of its extracts [
