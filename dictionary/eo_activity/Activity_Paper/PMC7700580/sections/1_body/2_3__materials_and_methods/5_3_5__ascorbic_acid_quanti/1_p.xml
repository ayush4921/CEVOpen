<p>Ascorbic acid presents a significant importance for human health, is a strong reducing agent and can be found in vegetables and fruits. For the estimation of the ascorbic acid content, various spectrophotometric methods have been reported. This methods are based on oxidizing agents such as ferric salts, methylene blue, potassium permanganate or phenol indophenol [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A microplate assay based on potassium permanganate, as oxidizing agent, was applied in an acid medium to quantify ascorbic acid and therefore to explore the health-promoting properties of the juices obtained from the tested fruits. Freshly prepared samples were obtained by weighing 10 g of fruit sample in a 50 mL beaker, then adding meta-Phosphoric acid (3%) to avoid the oxidation of the ascorbic acid and mixing well to obtain the fruit juice. All the samples were filtered and the filtrate was transferred to 200 volumetric flasks and then completed to the mark with meta-Phosphoric acid (3%). Blank sample was prepared by replacing the fruit samples with distilled water. Standard solution of ascorbic acid was prepared in meta-Phosphoric acid (3%) to obtain a 1-mg/mL stock solution. A series of dilutions 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125 was prepared from the stock solution. A 0.1-mg/mL KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution was prepared in H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution (5.0 M). An amount of 20 µL of sample was mixed with 180 µL of 0.1 mg/mL acid solution of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> and left to sit in the dark for 5 min. The absorbance of the samples was read at 530 nm. In this assay, the ascorbic acid consumes the potassium permanganate (violet solution), resulting in a decrease in the absorbance of 530 nm. All the experiments were done in triplicate.
