 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, fruits without blemishes or damage (1 kg) were selected, then they were washed well and squeezed using a commercial juice machine (Tefal Frutelia ZE420D38, 11, 400 W). The fresh juice was centrifuged at 6000× rpm for 20 min. The clear supernatant was taken as 100% test sample and stored at 4 °C for further analysis, for a maximum of 48 h. The juice combinations were obtained by mixing the juices in a volumetric ratio of 1:1.
