<p>The ferrous ion binding ability of the iron chelators was calculated using the formula below:
 <disp-formula>Iron binding ability (%) = (A
  <sub>c</sub> − [A
  <sub>s</sub> − A
  <sub>b</sub>])/A
  <sub>c</sub> × 100%
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control, A
 <sub>b</sub> is the blank for each sample and A
 <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the iron chelator.
