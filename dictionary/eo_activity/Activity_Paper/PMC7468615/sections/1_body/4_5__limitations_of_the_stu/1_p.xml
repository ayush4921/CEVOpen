<p>Due to the lack of genetically modified immunocompromised mice, the study was not conducted on 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which is resistant to chloroquine. As 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cannot infect normal mice, it would be good if the extract is also tested against the actual resistant parasite. However, the study is ok as most malaria screening tests utilize 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> at the early stage of investigation.
