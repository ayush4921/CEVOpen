<p>A candidate antimalarial agent should elicit parasite suppression of 30% or greater [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, the extract at all doses tested was found to possess a promising chemosuppression effect and found to be active in counteracting the malaria parasite. Furthermore, if the antimalarial activity of a compound displayed a percent growth inhibition of ≥50% at a dose of 500-250, 250-100, and ≤100 mg/kg/day, the literature grades it as moderate, good, and very good, respectively [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, the fruit of 
 <italic>C. frutescens</italic> possesses a very good antimalarial activity.
