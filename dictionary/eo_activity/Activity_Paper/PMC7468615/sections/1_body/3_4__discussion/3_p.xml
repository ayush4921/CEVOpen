<p>Phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, abundantly localized in the plant extract, could be responsible for the antiplasmodial activity as plant-derived alkaloids such as quinine are evidenced to possess a potent antimalarial activity. This plant also contains terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. These bioactive principles have been reported to possess a range of therapeutic activities including antimalarial activity in the literature [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The chemosuppressive effect exerted could be via indirect boosting of the immune system or inhibition of other target pathways which are not fully realized. The phytosteroids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids observed in this plant have been proven to possess potential immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. Furthermore, the plant constituents may target the previously discovered targets in the pathogenesis and life cycle of the malaria parasite but with a unique or similar mechanism of action [
