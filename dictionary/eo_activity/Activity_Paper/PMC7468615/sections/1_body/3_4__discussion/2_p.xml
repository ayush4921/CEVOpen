<p>In the present study, crude fruit extract of 
 <italic>C. frutescens</italic> showed a dose-dependent significant inhibition of parasitemia compared to the vehicle-treated group. This is comparable with similar studies done on 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, chemoprevention efficacy of the plant is superior to our previous report on 
 <italic>Schinus molle</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
