<p>Among the challenges to confront the disease, development of resistant strains of the parasite to the conventional antimalarial drugs is a common phenomenon. In other words, the plasmodial parasites that were initially responding to the antimalarial drugs are now losing sensitivity [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, there is high probability that these resistant types can move to the rest of the world and be a global threat. This issue necessitates the scientific community to research for new antimalarial agents having better safety and efficacy [
