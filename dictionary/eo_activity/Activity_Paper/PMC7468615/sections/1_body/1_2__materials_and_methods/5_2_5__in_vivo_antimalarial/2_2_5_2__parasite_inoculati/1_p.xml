<p>Chloroquine sensitive 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> (ANKA strain) was obtained from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. The parasites were then maintained by serial passage of blood from infected mice to noninfected ones every week until 30-37% of the parasitemia level was attained [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The parasitemia levels of the donor mice were determined from the blood collected by cutting a 0.5 to 1 mm section from the tail of the mice with scissors. Mice with the aforementioned level of rising parasitemia were used as donors. Donor mice were euthanized using halothane in a closed chamber, and the infected blood was immediately collected through cardiac puncture into a heparinized vacutainer tube [24- 26]. The collected blood from all donor mice was pooled together to avoid variability and then diluted in normal saline [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The blood was then diluted with physiological saline (0.9%) in such a way that the final suspension would contain about 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs) in every 0.2 ml of blood [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Experimental animals were inoculated with 0.2 ml of diluted blood, intraperitoneally.
