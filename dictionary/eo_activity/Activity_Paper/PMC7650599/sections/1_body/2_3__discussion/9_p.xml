<p>Plant extracts and/or the thereby-derived phytochemicals are known to provoke cancer cell death by causing oxidative damage to genetic material-mediated cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death [

 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. With this in mind, the DNA damage to HepG2 cellular DNA following 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> crude extract treatment was investigated using the alkaline comet assay, and scored in terms of tail length, tail intensity and olive tail moment. The comet assay is a well-established and highly sensitive method for the detection of DNA damage and fragmentation pattern [
 <xref rid="B61-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> induced 4-fold significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher DNA damaged to HepG2 cells compared to the untreated control, as reflected by the olive tail moments (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Consistent with the DNA damaging ability, 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> halted the cell cycle progression significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, versus control) in the G0/G1 phase (

 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> L. bark, provoked the apoptotic mechanism via DNA fragmentation and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest [
