<p>Medicinal plants are known to be the epicenter of numerous well-established ethnomedicinal systems across the globe [

Plant secondary metabolites have contributed enormously to the modern-day pharmaceutical industry by providing the chemical backbone for almost 25% of the 1562 clinical agents, as well as 60% of the 246 oncologic drugs, approved by the US Federal Drugs Administration between 1981 and 2014 [

As such it is of utmost importance to evaluate the unexplored terrestrial flora for their therapeutic potential, as the dwindling medicinal plant species continue to stand as a rich repository to probe for novel chemotypes in the drug developmental process.
