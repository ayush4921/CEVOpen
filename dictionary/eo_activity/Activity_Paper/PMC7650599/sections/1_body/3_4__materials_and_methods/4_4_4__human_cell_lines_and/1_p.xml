<p>Human liposarcoma cells (SW872), human lung carcinoma cells (A549), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-8 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (USA). Human ovarian epithelial (HOE) cells immortalized using SV40 large T antigen were obtained from Applied Biological Materials Inc (Richmond, BC, Canada). All cell lines, except the ovarian cell lines, were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium. Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium was used in the case of ovarian cell lines. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/L streptomycin-penicillin. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% humidity at 37 °C.</p>
