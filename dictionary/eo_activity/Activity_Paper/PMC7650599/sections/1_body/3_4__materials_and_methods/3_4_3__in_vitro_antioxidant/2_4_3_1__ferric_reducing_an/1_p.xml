<p>The final reaction volume of 3.4 mL of the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay contained 100 µL of extract and 300 µL of water followed by the addition of 3 mL FRAP reagent. The FRAP reagent was prepared immediately before use by mixing 100 mL of 0.25 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10 mL of 20 mM ferric chloride (source of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) and 10 mL of 10 mM 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine. After incubating the mixture for 4 min at ambient temperature, the absorbance was read at 593 nm against a blank. Results were reported as in mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>.
