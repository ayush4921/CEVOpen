<p>The DNA damage induced by the 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract was assessed in HepG2 cells by the alkaline comet assay. Treatment with 10 µg/mL 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract for 24 h resulted in the induction of significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) DNA damage in HepG2 cells as compared to untreated control cells. The occurrence of DNA damaged was scored in terms of tail length, tail intensity and olive tail moment of cell cultures by comet assay software (
