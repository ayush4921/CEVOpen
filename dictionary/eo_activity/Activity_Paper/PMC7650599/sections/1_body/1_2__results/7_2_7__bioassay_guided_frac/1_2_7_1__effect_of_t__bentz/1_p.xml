<p>HepG2 cells were used as a model to fractionate and characterize the bioactive components present in 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract. The first round of fractionation was achieved using liquid–liquid portioning with organic solvents of increasing polarities. The 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> butanol fraction, being the most active, was further fractionated on a Sephadex LH-20 column. A total of 11 subfractions was derived, with their cytotoxic activity being limited between fractions F4 to F10 only (

The assessment of their chromatographic patterns revealed differences in the chemical compositions of the fractions, albeit with multiple overlapping peaks highlighting the chemical complexity of the subfractions. Given the most potent cytotoxic activity of the subfraction F6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.2 ± 1.8 µg/mL), the further fractional separation of the latter was achieved using preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to yield 11 HPLC subfractions (F6.1–F6.11). Of these, HPLC subfraction F6.1 retained most of the cytotoxic activity, providing an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.8 ± 0.3 µg/mL. By contrast, HPLC fractions F2, F7, F9, F10 and F11 failed to effectively inhibit the growth of HepG2 cell cultures; hence no IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined for these subfractions. A summary of the bioassay-guided fractionation employed is depicted in
