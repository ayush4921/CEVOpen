<p>In an effort to identify the bioactive constituents in 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic>, bioassay-guided fractionation was carried out. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy, of the 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> butanol fraction 6 and its semi-prep HPLC sub-fractions allowed the identification of eight phenolic compounds, including α and β-punicalagin (
 <bold>1</bold>), isoterchebulin (
 <bold>2</bold>), terflavin A (
 <bold>3</bold>), 3,4,6-trigalloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (
 <bold>4</bold>), 2”-

 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-isoorientin (
 <bold>6</bold>), 2”-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylvitexin (
 <bold>7</bold>), and ellagic acid (
 <bold>8</bold>) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figures S4–S7</xref>). The bioactive HPLC subfraction F6.1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value = 15.8 ± 0.3 µg/mL) was revealed to be α and β-punicalagin (
 <bold>1</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), while a mixture of isoterchebulin (
 <bold>2</bold>), terflavin A (
 <bold>3</bold>) and 3,4,6-trigalloyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose (
 <bold>4</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) was identified from the active subfraction F6.6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value = 19.6 ± 0.7 µg/mL). A mixture of 2”-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-orientin (
 <bold>5</bold>) and 2”-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-isoorientin (
 <bold>6</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S7 and Table S1</xref>), with a ratio of 5:2 based on the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR integration of single hydrogen in each compound, was identified from the non-active subfraction F6.9. 2”-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylvitexin (
 <bold>7</bold>) and ellagic acid (
 <bold>8</bold>) were detected only by LC-MS from the butanol fraction 6 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Additionally, two simple phenolics, gallic acid and methyl gallate, were detected in both the ethyl acetate and butanol fractions, and identified by GC-MS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00303">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). They were likely present in other less bioactive fractions. The levels of gallic and methyl gallate were quantified as 15.6 ± 1.1 and 26.2 ± 8.1 µg/mg total extract (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) by HPLC, respectively.
