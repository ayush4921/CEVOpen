<p>A study investigated the antihepatoma components and mechanism of action of 
 <italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic> L. Its chemical components were evaluated and screened comprehensively and efficiently by drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic characteristics. The target sites of multiple active components were predicted according to the reverse pharmacophore matching model and antihepatoma-related gene targets of 
 <italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic> L. were screened through comparison with the databases. The functions of target genes and related pathways were analyzed and screened, and the component/target/pathways network of anti-liver cancer effect was constructed. The pathway enrichment results indicated that 
 <italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic> L. may play an antihepatoma role by inhibiting the development of hepatitis B or acting on the key targets of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, such as MAPK1, HRAS, and AKT1. The network was used to evaluate the antihepatoma activity of various components. The results of network pharmacology were further verified by molecular docking of selected active components and the key targets. The present findings guided further pharmacological studies on this plant [
