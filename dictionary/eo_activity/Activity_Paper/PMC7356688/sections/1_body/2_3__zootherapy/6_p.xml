<p>For example, one report has described that four bovines (
 <italic>Bos primigenius</italic> taurus) meat-derived peptides (GFHI, DFHING, FHG, GLSDGEWQ) exhibit the most cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 breast human cancer cell line and decrease the viability of stomach adenocarcinoma cell lines (AGS) [

 <italic>Bos Taurus domesticus</italic> Gmalin), also denominated as 
 <italic>Calculus bovis</italic> [

 <italic>Capra aegagrus</italic> hircus) spleens or livers were isolated the bioactive peptide-3 (ACPB-3), that exhibited anticancer activity against BCG-823, GCSC, and HCT-116 cell lines in vitro and in vivo [
