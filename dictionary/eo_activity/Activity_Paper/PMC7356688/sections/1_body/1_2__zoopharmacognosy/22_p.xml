<p>The most representative case is the swallowing of

 <italic>Strongyloides</italic> spp.) was tested. The results suggested the lack of therapeutic value which could be due to experimental problems that interfered with the test such as the failure of the extraction method, the choice of a non-representative in vitro model that did not simulate the complex interactions resulting from the ingestion if the in vivo activation of secondary compounds would be necessary for antihelmintic action [

 <italic>Rubia</italic> contains several species used extensively in traditional Chinese, Indian, and Korean medicine, mainly their roots, rhizome extracts, and their phytochemicals have drawn much attention due to their potent bioactivities that include the treatment of cancer, inflammation, infections, rheumatism, and so on [
