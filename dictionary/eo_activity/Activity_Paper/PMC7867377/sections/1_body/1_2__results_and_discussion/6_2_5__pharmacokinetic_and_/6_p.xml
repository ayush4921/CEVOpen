<p>The toxicity profile of all the identified phytoconstituents from 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> ethanolic crude extract has been predicted based on AMES toxicity, hepatotoxicity, hERG potassium channel inhibition and skin sensitization parameters. Results outlined that, out of the fifty four identified compounds, only three have a deviated mutagenic and hepatic toxicity potential, which means that about 95% are devoid of any risk of toxicity, 100% have no hERG I inhibition and 75% exerted no skin-sensitive effects.
