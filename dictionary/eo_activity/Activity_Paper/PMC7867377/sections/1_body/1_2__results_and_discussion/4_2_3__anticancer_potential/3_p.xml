<p>One study revealed the anticancer effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>S. doederleinii</italic> using the brine shrimp lethality test against two cancer cell lines MDAMB231 (breast) and HepG2 (liver). As a result, after 24 h of exposure to 50% lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) in the brine shrimp lethality test was found to be &gt;1000 μg/mL. MDAMB231 and HepG2 were found to be the most susceptible with the treatments of ethanol (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 306 μg/mL) and aqueous (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 329 μg/mL) extracts of 
 <italic>S. doederleinii</italic>, respectively [

 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic> also showed potent anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines. It was found to decrease the metastasis, expression of MMP-2 and 9 (matrix metalloproteinase) and urokinase plasminogen activator in A549 cells and Lewis lung carcinoma [

 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic> and its anticancer efficacy was screened against five different cancer cells, including HL-60 (human leukemia cells), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cells), PANC-1 (human pancreatic cancer cells), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells) and BEL-7402 (human hepatoma carcinoma cells). The extract was found to be efficient in the inhibition of the proliferation of all cells with a remarkable inhibition of HL-60 [
