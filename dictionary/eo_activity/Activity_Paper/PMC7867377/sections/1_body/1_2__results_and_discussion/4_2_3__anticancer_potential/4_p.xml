<p>The cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induction potential of hexane, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate and butanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. plana</italic> was performed against MCF-7 cells. Different crude extracts of 
 <italic>S. plana</italic> displayed inhibition of MCF-7 cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30 μg/mL, 19 μg/mL, 24 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL respectively. Butanol crude extract was found as the highest cytotoxic and apoptotic induction against MCF-7 cancer cells [

 <italic>S. uncinata</italic>, 
 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic>, 
 <italic>S. remotifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>S. delicatula</italic>, 
 <italic>S. moellendorfii</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pulvinata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. labordei</italic> were evaluated using BEL-7402, HT-29 and HeLa cells. In results, 
 <italic>S. labordei</italic>, 
 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic> and 
 <italic>S. uncinata</italic> had a higher inhibition of Bel-7402 and HeLa cells, whereas, 
 <italic>S. moellendorfii</italic> had moderate inhibition, but 
 <italic>S. remotifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pulvinata</italic> had almost no inhibitory activities. The major bioactive compounds responsible for the inhibition for cancer cells were bioflavonoids, detected in the ethyl acetate extracts. Moreover, the efficacy of all three extracts of all the plants on cell inhibition and apoptosis were not the same, they were highly efficient on HeLa cells than HT-29 cells [

 <italic>S. repanda</italic> possessing anticancer potential against three malignant lineages, HCT-116, MCF-7 and A549 cell lines. Though, all the three cell lines have high metastatic potential, 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> was found to inhibit the proliferation of all three malignant cells in a time and concentration dependent manner.
