<p>Flavonoids and natural phenolic acids are one of the most prevalent and pharmacologically active groups of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract revealed the presence of phenols like coumarin, chlorogenic acid, 7-hydroxycoumarine, caffeic acid, 4-methoxycinnamic acid, isoferulic acid, formononetin, 2-amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol and 4-coumaric acid. The other main flavonoids identified in the present study were rutin, vitexin, quercetin, quercetin-3Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin, rhamnetin, glycitein, diosmetin and genistein. They are well known for their potential therapeutic applications including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective effects, etc. These compounds play a crucial role in prevention of cancer through various mechanisms at the molecular level. This may include impeding the signaling pathways, migration, differentiation and proliferation inhibition, gene regulation, carcinogen metabolism, induction of apoptosis via arresting cell cycle, etc. [
