<p>H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity was measured as per the method used by Adnan et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One milliliter of crude extract (100–500 μg/mL) was mixed with 1 mL of 2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution, prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The tubes were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and absorbance was measured at 230 nm. Absorbance was determined against a blank solution (phosphate buffer without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>). Standard ascorbic acid was used as positive control. Calculation of the percentage of scavenging of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was then estimated as follows:
 <disp-formula>Inhibition (%) = (A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub>) × 100
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> whereas, 
 <disp-formula>A
  <sub>0</sub> = absorbance of the control
  <label>(5a)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>A
  <sub>1</sub> = absorbance of the extract/standard
  <label>(5b)</label>
 </disp-formula>
