  <p>The principal of oxidative damage and the role of antioxidants in scavenging free radicals. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The free radicals generated from endogenous sources, at limited concentrations, are considered important for regulation of cell maturation, in addition to their role in immune defense. Excessive concentrations of these unstable molecules can result from illness conditions and exogenous sources, and thus lead to oxidative damage (imbalance between free radical and antioxidant concentrations). This status results in cell injury/death based on the extremely high reactivity of free radicals with vital cellular molecules including lipids, amino acids, proteins, and DNA. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Antioxidants are necessary to stop oxidative damage by neutralizing free radicals. They own this unique role due to their capability to give an electron to free radicals that have unpaired electrons to make them stable and unharmful.
