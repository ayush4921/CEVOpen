  <p>Potential mechanisms of action of honey as an immunomodulatory agent. These mechanisms relied on the antioxidant activity of honey. This activity inhibits oxidative stress and results in stopping harm to the vital cellular components (lipids, amino acids/proteins, and DNA), which promotes lymphocytes proliferation and activation. On the other hand, inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathways results in complicated cellular mechanisms finished with suppression of pro-inflammatory genes, and thus blocks the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the antioxidant activity also reduces the release of arachidonic acid, which results in the oxidation of membrane phospholipids, and thus reduces its metabolites (leukotrienes and prostaglandins) that are considered as important inflammatory mediators [
