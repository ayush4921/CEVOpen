<p>Synergistically, honey combinations with other rich natural products (such as cinnamon, garlic and ginger) have shown stronger antimicrobial and immune booster activities [

 <xref rid="B130-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. This approach could help to enhance the role of honey as a complementary and alternative medicine against COVID-19. Furthermore, in order to study the pharmacokinetic profiles of honey, an interesting study has shown that it can enhance the intestinal absorption of carboxyfluorescein as a drug model [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These findings refer to the potential of honey as a natural enhancer to improve the bioavailability of poorly absorbable drugs [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Thus, future studies should assess the probable effect of honey in enhancing the intestinal absorption of drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19. On the other hand, honey can be mediated by green synthesis (i.e., using natural products) of nanoparticles (NPs) [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] that show a promising role in controlling immune homeostasis during several inflammatory conditions [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. NPs can also be used as a tool in rapid point-of-care diagnostics, surveillance, and monitoring, as well as in therapeutics delivery and vaccines development against COVID-19 [
