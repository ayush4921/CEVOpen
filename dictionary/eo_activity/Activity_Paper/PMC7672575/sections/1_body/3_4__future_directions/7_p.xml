<p>Nevertheless, the potential of honey against COVID-19 must be imperatively discussed. It is well established that COVID-19 clinically progresses through different stages [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. In early stages of COVID-19 infection (stage I), a controlled viral response is induced and manifests mild, non-specific symptoms such as fever and dry cough. As the infection progresses, localized inflammation in the lung is norm (stage II) and a minority of patients would transition into a severe stage (stage III), which is manifested as systemic hyperinflammation. The potential of honey with its anti-inflammatory properties may benefit the later stage of COVID-19 infection. However, it needs to be noted that honey is also capable of inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1Î², TNF, and IL-6, associated with the systemic disease of COVID-19 infection [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], render its antiviral potential to be cautiously approached. Furthermore, its efficacy compared to conventional drugs such as glucocorticoids and remdesivir in the management of COVID-19 is very much lacking and similarly doubtful.
