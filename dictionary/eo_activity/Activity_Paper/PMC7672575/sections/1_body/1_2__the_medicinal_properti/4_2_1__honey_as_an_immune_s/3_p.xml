<p>On the other hand, studies showed that antioxidants could modulate the signal transduction pathways crucial to cellular responses including inflammation, survival, cellular proliferation, and death, that are affected by oxidative stress [

For example, the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) can be modulated by antioxidants, which results in the activation of some Nrf2 target gene candidates (e.g., Nrf2, SLC48A1, SLC7A11, p62, HO-1, and Bcl-2 genes) that control antioxidant defense and autophagy [

Furthermore, inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE), which can result from antioxidant activity, promotes the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) second messenger system. Therefore, activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) targets genes and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which is the key regulator of autophagy and is also involved in the regulation of Nrf2 pathway [

Altogether, the potential immune booster activities of antioxidants from honey are not only limited to inducing lymphocytes proliferation and activation and inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it also can induce autophagy machinery. Thus, promoting these three immune responses could help to fight against COVID-19.
