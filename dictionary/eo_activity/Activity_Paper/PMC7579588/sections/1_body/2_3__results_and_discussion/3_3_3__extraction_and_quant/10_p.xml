<p>The interaction between Congo red and β-glucans of plant origin has been known for decades [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, it was only in 2007 that Mao et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] using a curdlan, non-brnched 1,3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan, found that that Congo red binds to the triple helical chain β- glucans. Exposure of curdlan to Congo red did not result in enhancing the solution color [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In 2011, Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] determined triple-helix 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans by the spectrophotometric method using Congo red in the mycelia cultivated in vitro and in fruiting bodies of edible mushrooms, thus confirming the ability to bind triple–helix 1,3-1,6-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans to this dye [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The specific ability of triple-helix β-glucans to bind Congo red dye particles has also been used for determination by Semedo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Morales et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our study, the content of β-glucans in mushrooms was therefore evaluated by spectrophotometric method using Congo red dye. The results obtained (
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-07299-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were within the range of values presented by other authors [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
