<p>The fluorimetric method for the determination of 1-3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan content using aniline blue was used for the first time for the determination of the content of these compounds in food samples by Ko et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For the first time, Nitschke et al. used the fluorimetric method for the determination of 1,3-β-glucans of a non-branched structure in mushrooms [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Some studies declare that such fluorimetric method is specific to (1→3)-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan binding, but it showed certain limitations that were not always appraised, i.e., the polymerization degree, presence/absence of substituents and their chemical conformation might modulate the fluorimetric determination [
