<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 12 software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The normality of distribution verified, using the Lilliefors (Kolmogorov–Smirnov) test and the Shapiro–Wilk test, showed no normal distribution of the analyzed quantitative variables; therefore, non-parametric tests were used for comparison. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the content of β-glucans assayed by the Megazyme method and by the Congo red method between wild growing and commercially cultivated mushrooms, as well as to compare various extraction fractions of β-glucans in the Congo red method.</p>
