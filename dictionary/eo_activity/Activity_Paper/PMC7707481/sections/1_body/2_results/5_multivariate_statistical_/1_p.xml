<p>Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to reduce the data complexity and better discovery for the potential differential metabolites. The unsupervised PCA was performed with principal components 1 and principal components 2 to get a general description of the variance of metabolites. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243111.s002">S2 Fig</xref> of the PCA score plot, four groups of samples with different salinities were completely separated. The supervised OPLS-DA was carried out to better distinguish the four salinity samples and differential metabolites. The validity of the OPLS-DA model was assessed with permutation tests (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243111.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), indicating that there was no overfitting phenomenon in this model. The model parameters were R2X = 0.812, R2Y = 0.995, and Q2 = 0.906 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; R2X = 0.787, R2Y = 0.977, and Q2 = 0.832 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g002">Fig 2B</xref>. In both cases, these results indicated that the model was stable with strong predictable ability under the positive and negative ion mode, the control group and the different salt stress groups could also be completely separated. Furthermore, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> showed that plants treated with different salt stress were completely separated from control. The differential metabolites were identified and discovered by the components of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), 200 mM vs control (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>), respectively, to distinguish the differences of metabolites under different salt stress. The metabolic pathways of 47 differential metabolites based on the control group and different salt-treated samples were displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, these changes indicated salt stress had a wide range of effect in LJF; Clear differentiation was observed in the heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243111.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243111.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Besides, the similarity evaluation of clustering was consistent with the OPLS-DA analysis, both were higher in the content of metabolites at 100 mM NaCl. These results suggested the quality of LJF under 100 mM salt stress was better than the other three groups.
