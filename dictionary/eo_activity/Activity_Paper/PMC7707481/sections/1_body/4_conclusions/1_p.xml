<p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that the combination of LC-MS-based metabolomics and multivariate statistical analysis was an effective approach to distinguish and qualify LJF under different salt stress. A total of 79 compounds were identified in LJF treated with different salt stresses, 47 of them were differential compounds. Differential metabolites indicated that secondary metabolites, which were close to the antioxidant capacity, such as phenolic acid, flavonoid, and iridoid were affected in all LJF samples exposed to salt stress. Among these metabolites, significantly increases were observed at 100 mM NaCl treatment compared to the control group, while the relative contents (peak areas) of metabolites were decreased under 300 mM, indicating that low salt-treated group appeared to be better in terms of relative contents of the wide variety of bioactive components and excess salts in the soil are harmful to the development and quality of plants. Meanwhile, the biosynthesis of phenolic acid, flavonoid, and iridoid were influenced in all LJF samples under salt stress. These metabolomic changes exposed to salt stress were first reported on LJF and clearly involved in a network. Our study provides insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and can be used as powerful complementation to improve the medicinal value for the development of LJF.</p>
