<p>In this study, LJF was treated with varying saline concentrations (0, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl) for 35 days. A metabolic profiling method based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass/mass spectrometer (HPLC-Triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were employed to identify the significant metabolites, discriminate the groups, and screen differential metabolites. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of primary and secondary metabolites were also investigated in LJF to evaluate the effect of salt stress. Our study provides insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and can be used as a powerful method to improve the medicinal evaluation for the development of LJF.</p>
