<p>The modern discovery of natural products based on ethnomedicinal uses of the medicinal herb has been used for their therapeutic values since ancient times. Plant-derived bioactive compounds are commonly used in the pharmaceutical, nutritional and food supplement industries to prepare different herbal products, vitamins, food supplements and drugs for treating different disease [

Several well-validated experimental protocols and animal models are necessary for developing a pharmacologically complex lead compound derived from a medicinal plant to achieve a clear preclinical and clinical decision. Phytochemical analysis of the plant extract reveals several compounds considered responsible for numerous biological effects [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. AFMV extracts demonstrated that the plant contains several secondary metabolites including alkaloid, carbohydrate, flavonoids, tannins, protein and phenolic. Alkaloids, common secondary nitrogenous compounds, used to treat various human and animal disorders since middle age and flavonoids are used to treat anti-inflammatory, cancer and cardiovascular diseases [
