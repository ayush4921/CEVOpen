<p>The anti-arthritic activity of AFMV was evaluated using the inhibition of protein denaturation technique followed by a method described by Ansari et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with some modifications. Serially diluted concentrations between (31.25–500 µg/ml) of AFMV extract and standard diclofenac-Na were obtained. For each concentration 0.5 ml of test/standard solution from prepared dilutions was mixed with aqueous albumin (0.45 ml, 5% w/v) and 1N HCl was then added to adjust the (pH 6.3). The prepared mixtures then incubated at 37°C for 20 min after that the temperature was increased to keep the mixtures at 57°C for 30 min, the samples were cooled, and (2.5 ml) of phosphate buffer was added to the solution. All the reagents except extract are contained in the blank solution. The absorbance was measured using UV-Visible spectrophotometer at 416 nm. Each test was done for triplicate for maintaining accuracy. The % of inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated from the following equation:
