 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Male Swiss albino mice were divided into seven groups, consisting of six animals (n=6) each. Test groups were administered different doses (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3000 and 4000 mg/kg, p.o.) while the control group received 1% tween 80 in saline water. The animals were monitored closely for the next 48 h and up to 14 consecutive days to record any acute toxicological signs (mortality, allergic reaction and behavioural changes).
