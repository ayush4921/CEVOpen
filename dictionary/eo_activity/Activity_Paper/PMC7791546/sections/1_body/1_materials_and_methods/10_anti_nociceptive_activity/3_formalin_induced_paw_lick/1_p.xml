<p>The formalin-induced paw licking test in Swiss albino mice was evaluated as previously described method [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All the animals were received with respective treatment 30 min before the commencement of the study as described in the experimental design section. After 30 min of the administration, (2.5%, 20 µL) formalin was injected by a micro-syringe into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw of mice and placed in a glass made a cage for observation. The licking and biting of the injected paw were pain response and the first 5 min as neurogenic phase and later 15–30 min as the inflammatory phase was recorded. The % of inhibition of licking was calculated from [
