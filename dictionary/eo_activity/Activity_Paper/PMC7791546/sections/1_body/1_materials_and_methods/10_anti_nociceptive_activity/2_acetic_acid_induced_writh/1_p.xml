<p>The acetic acid-induced writhing test in swiss albino mice was carried out as described with minor modification [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref>]. All the animals received respective doses 30 min before initiating the study as per the experimental design. One hour later, mice in all groups were treated with 0.7% (v/v) acetic acid solution (10 mL/kg body weight, i.p). Five minutes after acetic acid injection (i.p), mice were placed in a glass made cylindrical cage, and the number of writhing and stretching was counted over 20 min. The percent inhibition of writhing was calculated from [
