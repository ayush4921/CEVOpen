Although wide-spread trading of silphion in the Mediterranean region was initiated with the establishment of the Greek colonization of the Cyrenaic region, the commercial source must have been well developed prior to these large-scale trading practices and there is even some fragmented evidence in Minoan pictograms that suggests the presence of silphion production in the Late Bronze Age [
