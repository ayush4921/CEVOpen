<p>Hexane and dichloromethane extracts (10 g each) were fractionated over a silica gel column (5 × 60 cm) using hexane-ethyl acetate mixtures as elution solvent. If necessary, further separation and purification of compounds were carried out on a Sephadex LH-20 column (4 × 65 cm) packed in hexane/dichloromethane/methanol (14:9:1) followed by prep. TLC (1 mm thickness, silica gel F254 developed with hexane/ethyl acetate at 9:1, 7:3, or 1:1 mixtures).</p>
