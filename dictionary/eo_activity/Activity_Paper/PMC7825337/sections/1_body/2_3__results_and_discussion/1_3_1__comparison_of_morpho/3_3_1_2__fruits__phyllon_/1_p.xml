<p>Theophrastus calls the fruits of silphion leaf-like (i.e., phyllon); indeed, mericarps of the 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> fruits remarkably resemble the leaflets of a pinnatipartite leaf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In most of the literature, the silphion fruit is described and positioned as a “heart-shaped” fruit [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, careful examination of the numismatic figures of fruits reveals that the “heart-shape” was actually formed by the overlapping mericarps of silphion fruits with a clear depiction of the stylopodium at the top and base of carpophore at the bottom appearing between them. As with the case of extant 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> fruits, 
 <italic>F. drudena</italic>’s fruit is a schizocarpic fruit but each mature mericarp has a papery resemblance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f004">Figure 4</xref>) which would facilitate the spreading of mericarps by wind, as described by Theophrastus; “when a strong south wind blows after setting of the dog-star, it is scattered abroad and the silphium grows from it” [
