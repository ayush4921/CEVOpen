<p>Based on the frequently depicted numismatic figures, one of the most distinct morphological characters of silphion is the opposite arrangement of stem leaves, which is very rarely observed with the other 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species. Undoubtedly, a predominant feature of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> observed in the field was the opposite arrangement of inflorescence branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f002">Figure 2</xref>), as depicted for the silphion plant on Cyrenaic coins. Occasionally, three or more sheaths of stem leaves appeared at the same stem node, especially at the base of flowering branches in the upper section of the plant. The stalk of silphion was often represented with a ribbed appearance on the numismatic figures. Although the stem of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> does not have such protruded ribs, it has a striated appearance due to the presence of resin channels under the surface epidermis of the stem (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f003">Figure 3</xref>).
