<p>Some of the compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> have previously been isolated from other medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 
 <italic>Ferula gummosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition to those known compounds, several unknown compounds were isolated from the extracts of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic>. It should be noted that the major sesquiterpenes of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> were also minor compounds of 
 <italic>F. gummosa</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>F. galbaniflua</italic> Boiss, and Buhse) which required the use of a large amount of galbanum resin to isolate those compounds [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The attractive pleasant smell of the oleo-gum-resin of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> is probably induced by the GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor modulating activity of the volatile sesquiterpene compounds of its oleo-gum-resin [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This influential effect of the resin may account for the discovery and establishment of silphion as a state trade commodity of the ancient Greek colonies in the Cyrenaic region. A literature survey of the biological activity of other known compounds indicates that some of the common medicinal uses of silphion such as anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], antiproliferative, antimycobacterial [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], immunomodulator [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] selective estrogen receptor modulator [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] (i.e., aphrodisiac and emmenagogue), cardioprotective [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] activities, etc. could be accounted for by these compounds (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00102-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The presence of both terpenoid and phenolic compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in silphion validates the oral prescription and plaster medications proposed by Asclepiades of Bithynia for the treatment of “inflammation in the heart” condition [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, the value of 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> as a source of promising bioactive compounds in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases has been questioned, the only negative aspect of 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic> was the presence of highly mutagenic α- and β-asarones in its extracts [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Since the extracts of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> practically contain most of the bioactive sesquiterpenoids of 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic> without α- and β-asarones, it may be an ideal substitute for 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic> as a source of precious bioactive compounds/extracts to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, and other medical conditions where 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic> was used as a traditional folk medicine. Furthermore, a recent publication on the potential aphrodisiac effects of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> extract and its sesquiterpene coumarins also confirms the notorious use of silphion [
