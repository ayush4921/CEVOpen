  <italic>Mesona chinensis</italic> is an important traditional Chinese medicine and edible plant resource in China. In this work, we sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>M. chinensis</italic> and researched its evolution. The genome size is 152,547 bp, with 37.89% GC content, including a large single copy region (LSC) of 83,482 bp, a small single copy region (SSC) of 17,725 bp and a pair of inverted repeats region (IRs) of 25,670 bp. The complete chloroplast genome was predicted to encode 131 genes, consist of 86 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>M. chinensis</italic> was closely related to other Labiatae species 
  <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>.
