<p>When our body is attacked by bacteria and viruses, the inflammatory process is activated with the production of white blood cells and other protective substances [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These inflammatory reactions set up to protect our organism which involves reactive oxygen species starting with the activation of leukocytes. Thus, the effect of a product for the modulation of inflammatory processes could be provided by its antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The release of elements such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, and/or peroxyl radicals is responsible for the development of oxidative stress. These reactive oxygen species play a very important role in the pathophysiology of many diseases (coronary artery disease, neurodegenerative disorders, aging, atherosclerosis, inflammation, chronic pain, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and cataracts) [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During the development of many inflammatory disorders, the phagocytes are activated; hydrogen peroxides (free radical species) such as the O
 <sub>2</sub> and âˆ™OH radicals are released [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and destroy the membrane by lipid peroxidation following a direct or indirect oxidative action. Tissue damage leads to the development of an inflammatory reaction with the production of chemotactic factors and numerous mediators [
