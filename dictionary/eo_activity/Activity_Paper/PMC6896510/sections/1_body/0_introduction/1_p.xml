<p>Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is a key Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme of liver-derived high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which is linked to various pathophysiological disorders

 </xref>. Although the “physiological” substrates of PON1 appear to be lactones, PON1 has a large number of promiscuous activities towards organophosphate triesters, arylesters, thiolactones and cyclic carbamates

  <sup>2</sup>
 </xref>. Thus, PON1-status can be determined by measuring enzyme activity levels with different substrates, and the latter can vary by over 10-fold between individuals with various PON1 genetic polymorphisms and pathological conditions
