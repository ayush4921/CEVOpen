This study provided an opportunity to carefully examine challenges that may exist when using quick and safe PON1 single progress–curve measurements with non-toxic substrate, and simple direct calculation of kinetic parameters from raw time–concentration data by performing any available nonlinear curve-fitting approach and software like MS Excel
