<p>Several studies have reported using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure the content of saponins in herbal medicines for better accuracy [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To quantify the contents of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> in 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic>, an accurate method was developed using a mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. First, [M + NH

 <sup>+</sup> ions were obtained in the MS
 <sup>1</sup> scanning mode (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range = 100â€“1500). Then, under the optimized HPLC-ESI-MS/MS conditions, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were characterized by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) through the transition from the parent ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 1092.5 [M + NH
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>+</sup> and 930.5 [M + NH
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>+</sup> to the main product ions at m/z 773.3 [M-2Glc + Na]
 <sup>+</sup> and 347.3 [2Glc + Na]
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively (
