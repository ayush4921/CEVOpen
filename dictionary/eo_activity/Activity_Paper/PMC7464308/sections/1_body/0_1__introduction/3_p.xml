 <italic>Stauntonia hexaphylla</italic> (Lardizabalaceae) has been used as a traditional herbal medicine in Korea, China and Japan for its analgesic and diuretic properties [

 <italic>Stauntonia</italic> produces various phytochemicals, such as oleanane triterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], phenolic glycosides [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and triterpene saponins [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which exhibit diverse pharmacological effects including anti-HIV-1 protease [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] effects. In the previous study, we had identified several triterpene glycosides that inhibited the activation of an established macrophage cell line called RAW 264.7 in vitro [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previously, oleanane triterpene saponins have shown anti-inflammatory inhibitory effects, such as aster saponin C2 [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and kalopanaxsaponin B [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we identified two major derivatives of oleanolic acid saponins and examined their pharmacological activities for inhibition of the activation of the RAW 264.7 cell line in vitro, relative to those of oleanolic acid aglycon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03699-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, the preliminary comparison of anti-inflammatory activity of these saponins with their aglycon was also discussed. Additionally, to investigate the in vivo efficacies of the saponins and the aglycon, we performed an animal experiment widely used for determining macrophage-dependent immune response, i.e., the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse sepsis model, administered orally with either the saponin or the aglycon beforehand [
