<p>RAW 264.7 cells were plated at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate and were incubated overnight. Then, compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, oleanolic acid and dexamethasone were added to the cultures at 10 μM, 3.3 μM, 1.1 μM, 0.37 μM and 0.12 μM, respectively. After 1 and 24 h culture with each compound at 37 °C, respectively, LPS was supplemented to the cultures at 0.5 μg/mL. After 24 h culture at 37 °C, nitric oxide concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured using NO detection kit (21023, LiliF Diagnostic, Seoul, Korea)
