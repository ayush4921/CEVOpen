<p>For animal experiments, all of the compounds were first pulverized with Tween 20 and then diluted with saline (1:99) to maximize the solubility of compounds in water [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The compounds in the saline/Tween 20 solution (2.5, 0.83 and 0.28 mg/mL, respectively) was administered via oral gavage (200 µL per injection). Mice (male BALB/C, 8 weeks; Samtako, Osan, Korea) were pretreated orally with individual compounds for 4 days. Two hours after the last treatment, the mice were injected i.p. with LPS (0.1 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ninety min after the LPS injection, the blood was collected, and the concentration of TNF-α in the blood was measured with TNF-α ELISA kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The experiment was performed with 3 mice per group.
