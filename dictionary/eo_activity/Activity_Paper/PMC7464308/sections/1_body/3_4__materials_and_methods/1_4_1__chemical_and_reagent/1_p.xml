<p>The optical rotation values were recorded with a JASCO P-1020 polarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). FT-IR spectra were performed on a JASCO Report 100 infrared spectrophotometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). All NMR spectra were carried out on Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometers (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) in pyridine-

Silica gel (70-230, 230–400 mesh, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) and YMC RP-18 resins (75 µm, Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd., Kasugai, Japan) were used as absorbents in the column chromatography. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from Merck KGaA (silica gel 60 F
