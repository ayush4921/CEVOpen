<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> (2.0 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of 1.0 N HCl (H
 <sub>2</sub>O/dioxane, 1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), and each solution was heated at 80 °C for 8 h. After cooling, the solvent was evaporated under N
 <sub>2</sub>, and the residue was separated by solvent–solvent partition using CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> and water. The solvent system was CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O 2/1/0.2, and spots were visualized by spraying with 95% EtOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>-anisaldehyde (9/0.5/0.5, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), then heated at 200 °C for 7 min. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>f</sub> values of glucose, and arabinose detected by TLC were 0.30 and 0.50, respectively. The water layer was concentrated under N
 <sub>2</sub>, and the remaining portion was dissolved in 3 mL of pyridine and heated with 10 mg of 
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride. After heating at 80 °C for 60 min, 0.1 mL of 
 <italic>o</italic>-tolylisothiocyanate was reacted with the mixture at 80 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture evaporated under vacuum. The reaction mixtures were directly analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Phenomenex column 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm), with a mobile phase MeCN-H
 <sub>2</sub>O (25–75); flow rate of 0.5 min/mL; UV detection at 250 nm. The derivatives of 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and 
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinose in compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were determined by comparison to the retention times of the standards (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>: 
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinose 15.6 min, and 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose 28.8 min).
