<p>All the clinical strains selected for the assay had the ability to produce biofilms. This was first determined qualitatively from photomicrographs of glass slides with adhering bacterial biofilms stained with 0.1% crystal violet (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To quantify the amount of the biofilm produced, the optical densities (OD) of reconstituted biofilm solutions from the microtiter plate assay were determined (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A negative control was included and used to calculate a cutoff OD value, which separates a nonbiofilm producer from a biofilm-producing organism according to the established standards [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. From calculations, the following parameters were set: OD &lt; 0.12 as weak biofilm producers; OD between 0.12 and 0.24 as moderate biofilm producers; and OD &gt; 0.24 as high biofilm producers. The rank order of biofilm-producing ability was
