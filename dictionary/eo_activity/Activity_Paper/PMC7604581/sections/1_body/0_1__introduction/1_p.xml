<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major public health concern worldwide as it reduces the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies and increases morbidity, mortality, and health care costs [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current evidence suggests that free-floating bacteria attach onto solid surfaces and create a complex polysaccharide matrix called the biofilm, which protects them from antimicrobial agents [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biofilms have great significance for public health because biofilm-associated microorganisms exhibit dramatically high resistance to antimicrobial agents than planktonic forms [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is because in the biofilm state multiple bacterial species form a polymicrobial community with several advantages including a more efficient DNA sharing and quorum sensing system, passive resistance, and metabolic cooperation, which protects them from antimicrobial agents and host immune responses [
