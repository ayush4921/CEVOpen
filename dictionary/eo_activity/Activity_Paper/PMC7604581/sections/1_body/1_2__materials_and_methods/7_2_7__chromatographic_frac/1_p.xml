<p>The alkaloid extract (50 g) was loaded onto a glass column (60 cm × 3 cm) packed with silica gel (70–230 mesh). It was then eluted with gradient mixtures of pet-ether, EtOAc, and MeOH. Fifty-six fractions were collected in 60 mL aliquots and bulked together into six subfractions based on their TLC profiles coded CF 1–6. Fraction CF1 (9.5 g) was further purified by column chromatography to obtain sixty-three fractions bulked into six subfractions, which were labeled HF1, HF2, HF3, HF4, HF5, and HF6. Fraction HF1 (1.19 g) was subjected to purification by preparative HPLC [MeOH−H
 <sub>2</sub>O + 0.1% HCOOH 98 : 2, 2 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>] to yield pure compounds, namely, HF1A, HF1B, and HF1C. Details of HPLC experimental procedures are provided in supplementary data (
