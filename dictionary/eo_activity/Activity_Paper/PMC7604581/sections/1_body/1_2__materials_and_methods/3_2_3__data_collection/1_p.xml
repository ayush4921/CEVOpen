<p>The ethnobotanical survey was carried out in May, 2016, with the help of some members of the Ghana National Association of Traditional Healers, Ashanti region (GNATH), a subunit of the Ghana federation of traditional healers associations (GHAFTRAM). The research was conducted in five villages in the district, namely, Bonwire, Ejisu, Onwe, Besease, and Juaben. Participants were informed of the objectives of the survey and personal visits were made to their homes and practice sites. A prior informed consent form (translated into the local dialect) was given to the participants to sign after the objectives of the study had been explained. In keeping with the traditional customs, appropriate gifts and drinks were given to the participants for the time and the courtesies extended to us. Data were collected through a survey employing open-ended, semi-structured questionnaires in English and translated into the local dialect (Ashanti-Twi). Thirty traditional healers participated in the survey. All participants provided information on the methods of practice, vernacular names of anti-infective plant remedies employed by them, methods of preparation, and administration of these remedies. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the chiefs of the studied areas and the GNATH.</p>
