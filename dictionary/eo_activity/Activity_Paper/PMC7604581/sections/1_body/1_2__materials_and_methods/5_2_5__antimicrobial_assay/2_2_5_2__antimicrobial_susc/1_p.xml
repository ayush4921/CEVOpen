<p>The agar well diffusion method as described by Jorgenson et al. was used, and the method description partly reproduces their wording [

After solidification, equivalent wells were drilled in each of the petri dishes using a sterile cork borer (No. 5) and filled with the extracts at concentrations of 5 mg/mL. The petri dishes were allowed to stand for 1 hour at 25°C to allow for diffusion of extracts into the seeded agar and then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Zones of growth inhibition were determined after incubation. Ciprofloxacin was used as the reference drug. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as the mean of three values ± the standard deviation.
