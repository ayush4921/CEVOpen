<p>Resistant clinical strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (A), 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> clinical strain (B), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 (C), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 (D), and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> clinical strain (E) were obtained from the Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, KNUST, and used for the study. They were authenticated according to their respective features on selective media, maintained in 30% glycerol broth and stored at −40°C in a frost-free freezer. The strains were aseptically subcultured into sterile Mueller Hinton broth and incubated at 37° C for 24 hours prior to use. For all assays, the working culture was prepared by standard dilution in distilled water and the bacterial suspension was adjusted to a turbidity matching that of 0.5 McFarland Standard (containing ∼10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL) according to the CLSI guidelines [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To ensure cellular quiescence, this dilution was maintained at 4°C.
