<p>The hydrogen peroxide scavenging of the endophytic metabolite extracts was determined using the method previously reported by 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ruch et al. (1989)</xref>. The reaction mixture was prepared by adding hydrogen peroxide solution (2 mM) to 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 0.5 ml of different concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) of tested sample was placed into the test tube and diluted with phosphate buffer to 2.0 mL. Subsequently, 3.0 mL hydrogen peroxide solution was added to the mixture, and the absorbance of 230 nm was measured after 10 min. The hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities were calculated by the following formula:
