<p>The total antioxidant capacity of the endophytic metabolite extracts was determined using the phosphomolybdate method as described by 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Naima et al. (2012)</xref>. 0.5 mL of different concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) of tested sample and 5.0 mL of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, 4 mM ammonium molybdate) were mixed in a tube and placed at 95Â°C for 90 min. After the mixture cooled to room temperature, the absorbance of 765 nm was noted as A
