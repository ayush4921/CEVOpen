<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the secondary metabolites of the endophytes was determined by the paper diffusion method, as described by 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Shafi (1975)</xref>. Ten microliter of varying concentrations of the extracts (0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 mg/mL) were placed on the agar surface previously seeded using the above-mentioned method. Paper discs impregnated with 10 μL of a solution of 5 mg/mL of penicillin as a standard antimicrobial were used for comparison. All petri dishes were sealed with sterile laboratory parafilm to avoid eventual evaporation of the test samples. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Inhibition of bacterial growth on the plates containing the test samples was determined by comparison with growth on the blank control plates. The MIC of each test sample was determined as the lowest concentration to completely inhibit the growth of each organism (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Delaquis et al., 2002</xref>). The MIC was repeated for each of the test organisms in triplicate (
