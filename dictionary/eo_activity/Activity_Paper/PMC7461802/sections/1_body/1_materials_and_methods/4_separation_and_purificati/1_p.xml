 <italic>sinensis</italic> were rinsed thoroughly with running water for 10 min. They were soaked in 75% ethanol for 45 s. Then soaked in 2% NaClO for 4, 5, and 6 min, respectively, then the surface sterilizing agents were removed by rinsing 6 times with sterile distilled water. The last rinse was collected to evaluate the effect of sterilization (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As described 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Grum-Grzhimaylo et al. (2016)</xref>, emerged fungal isolates were purified and pre-identified by morphological characters. To avoid redundancy, in few cases of joint isolations from different media, the co-isolated strains were discarded down to a minimum number of morphotypes (
