<p>The total flavonoid content of the endophytic metabolite extracts was determined using the method previously reported by 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2008)</xref>. 1.0 mL of tested sample (0.1 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL of distilled water, after which 0.5 mL NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.5 M) and 0.5 mL Al(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> (0.3 M) solution were added to the mixture. After 6 min, 0.5 mL NaOH solution (1.0 M) was added to the mixture and cultured for 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance of 510 nm was determined with rutin as a standard compound.
