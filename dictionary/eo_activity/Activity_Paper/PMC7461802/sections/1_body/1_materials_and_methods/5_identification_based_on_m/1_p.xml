<p>Morphological observation combined with molecular biology identification are widely used for taxonomic studies of strains (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). The isolated fungi were grown on PDA medium and bacteria were grown on beef extract-peptone medium. Characterization of cell morphology included their mycelium color, pigment, morphology of spore producing structure, presence or absence of sporulation and spore morphology, and were described and surveyed using a microscope (Motic E220, China).
