<p>As shown in

 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), indicating that the antioxidant activity of the tested samples was similar to the V

 </sub> standard. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B–F</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, compared with Vc, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the four samples for hydroxyl radical, reducing power, total antioxidant capacity, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion was significantly lower (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the JH-4 mycelium for the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide radicals and superoxide anion were significantly higher compared with the other three samples (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The JH-4 mycelium IC
 <sub>50</sub> for DPPH radicals, hydroxyl radical, reducing power, total antioxidant capacity, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion was 0.057 ± 0.002, 0.061 ± 0.002, 0.062 ± 0.004, 0.068 ± 0.002, and 0.071 ± 0.006 mg/mL, respectively, all of which suggest that the antioxidant activity of JH-4 mycelia was the strongest.
