    "Plant seeds are not merely reproductive organs, they are also carriers of microorganism, particularly, inherent and non-invasive characteristic endophytes in host plant. Therefore, in this study, the endophytic diversity of <i>Angelica</i> seeds was studied and compared with endophytes isolated from healthy leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of <i>A</i>. <i>sinensis</i> using 20 different media. The metabolites of endophytic strains were evaluated with six different methods for their antioxidant activity and the paper disc diffusion method for antimicrobial activities. As a result, 226 endophytes were isolated. Compared with the biodiversity and abundance of uncultured fungi from <i>Angelica</i> seed, the result showed that the most frequent endophytic fungi were <i>Alternaria</i> sp. as seen in artificial media; moreover, compared with artificial media, the pathogenic fungi, including <i>Fusarium</i> sp. and <i>Pseudallescheria</i> sp., were not found from the <i>Angelica</i> seed, the results suggested it may not be inherent endophytes in plants. In addition, bacteria from seven phyla were identified by high-throughput sequencing, while five phyla of endophytic bacteria were not isolated on artificial media including <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Microgenomates</i>, and <i>Saccharibacteria</i>. Furthermore, the sample JH-4 mycelium displayed the best antioxidant activity, and the active constituent may be a flavonoid as determined by total phenol and flavonoid content. Moreover, YH-12-1 mycelium had strong inhibitory activity against the five tested strains and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> was found to be 25 Î¼g/mL. Our results confirm that plant endophytes are rich in biodiversity and contain important resource of many uncultured microorganisms."
