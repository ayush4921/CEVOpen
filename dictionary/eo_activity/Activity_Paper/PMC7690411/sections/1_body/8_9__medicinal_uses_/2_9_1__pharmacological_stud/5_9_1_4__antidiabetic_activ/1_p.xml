<p>Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disorder that is principally characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency, and high blood sugar level. Very few information is available regarding apple and its polyphenol extracts potential effect on regulating glucose levels in the blood and other markers related to diabetes. It has been found that in apple extract, two inhibitors at concentrations 10 times dilution (I
 <sub>2</sub>) showed minimum absorbance resulting in the reduction in browning at a glucose concentration. So, in diabetes,

Due to the presence of a higher amount of quercetin, apple consumption may lower the risk for diabetes, and its peels were also associated with a decreased risk in type II diabetes. Phenolic compounds including flavonoids present in apple juices were found to affect insulin, plasma concentrations of glucose significantly, and another two hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, in volunteers, and the result appeared to be consistent with delayed intestinal absorption of glucose [
