<p>Apple polyphenols are often used as food additives due to their potent antioxidant capacities and antibacterial properties. Apple pomace is rich in polyphenols as a by-product of apple processing. Studies have shown that golden crown apple pomace extract has the highest total flavonoid content of ethyl acetate extract (EAE) [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 1.25 mg/ml, and the MIC against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was 2.5 mg/ml. Phloridzin and phloretin showed better antibacterial activities than the EAE, which were MICs of 0.5 and 0.1 mg/ml against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, or MICs of 1.5 and 0.75 mg/ml against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Apple polyphenols also have a strong inhibitory effect on caries bacteria transglucosylase (GTase), which can prevent the formation of tartar.
