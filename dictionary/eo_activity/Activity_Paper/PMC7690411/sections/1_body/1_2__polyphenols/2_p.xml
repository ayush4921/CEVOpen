<p>Apples contain a large number, and high levels, of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity and given that there is a correlation between the content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity among all the varieties of apple [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01408" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it is evident that polyphenols are the chief antioxidant biomolecules of this fruit. In addition to their potent antioxidant effect, apple polyphenols show several other useful pharmacological properties [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01408" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, apple polyphenols have the potential to be hepatoprotective and inhibit hepatic steatosis [
