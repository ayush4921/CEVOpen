<p>MOL dried powder (COA lot no. 5534) from Khaolaor Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Samutprakan, Thailand) was subjected to serial exhaustive extraction. One kilogram of MOL powder was sequentially extracted using hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and 95% ethanol (EtOH) as extractants. The extraction process was repeated three times with 1 L of each solvent at room temperature (RT). The extracts were filtered through Whatman no. 3 filter paper and the filtrates were concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Hei-VAP Value HB/G3B) to produce hexane extract (35.37 g), EtOAc extract (44.78 g), and EtOH extract (66.63 g). The crude EtOAc extract (10 g) was dissolved in hexane-EtOAc (70–30%) and separated by chromatography on a silica gel column; a gradient sequentially formed of hexane-EtOAc (90–10%, 80–20%, 70–30%, 60–40%, 50–50%, 40–60%, 30–70%, 20–80%, 10–90%, and 100% EtOAc), and EtOAc-methanol (MeOH) (90–10%, 80–20%, and 100% MeOH) were used as the mobile phase for elution. All collected fractions were monitored and combined based on the thin layer chromatography (TLC) pattern. Next, the active fraction (fraction no. 7; 135 mg) was dissolved in hexane-EtOAc (30–70%) and re-fractionated by silica gel column chromatography; a gradient sequentially formed of hexane-EtOAc (90–10%, 80–20%, 70–30%, 50–50%, and 100% EtOAc), and EtOAc-MeOH (90–10%) were used as the mobile phase for elution. All sub-fractions (nos. 7.1–7.8) were tested for anticancer activity using the MTT assay. The strongest active sub-fraction (sub-fraction no. 7.7) was then subjected to the identification of bioactive compounds using at-line-LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. All extracts were stored at −20 °C until use.</p>
