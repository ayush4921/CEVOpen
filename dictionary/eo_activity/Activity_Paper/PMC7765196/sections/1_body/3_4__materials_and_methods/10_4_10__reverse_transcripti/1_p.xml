<p>MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were plated into a 12-well culture plate. Cells were then treated with fraction no. 7 (75 and 100 µg/mL) for 24 h. For control, cells were incubated with culture medium alone. The total RNA was isolated by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Tetro cDNA Synthesis Kit (BIOLINE USA Inc, Taunton, MA, USA). The resulting cDNAs were amplified with different primers (

 <sup>®</sup> No-ROX Kit (BIOLINE USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA). Relative differences in gene expression among groups were determined from the quantification cycle (Cq) values. These values were first normalized to a housekeeping gene (β-actin) in the same sample (ΔCq) and are expressed as the fold-change over control (2
 <sup>−ΔΔCq</sup>). Real-time fluorescence detection was performed using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
