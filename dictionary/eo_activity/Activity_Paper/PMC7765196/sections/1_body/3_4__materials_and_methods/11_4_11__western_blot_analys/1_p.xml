<p>MDA-MB-231 cells (7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were plated into 6-well culture plates. Cells were incubated with fraction no. 7 (75 and 100 μg/mL), 7-octenoic acid (2.5 and 4 mg/mL), oleamide (70 and 100 μg/mL), 1-phenyl-2-pentanol (600 and 700 μg/mL), or doxorubicin (1.5 μM) for 24 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Bio Basic Inc.) supplemented with Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein samples were heated, separated in 12% SDS-PAGE (150 V, 1 h), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (100 V, 1.30 h). The membranes were washed and blocked with 2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at RT. Then the membranes were probed with primary antibodies against β-actin, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, or cleaved caspase-3 by incubating overnight at 4 ˚C. The membranes were then washed three-time with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Protein detection was performed by adding horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence substrate. The intensity of each band was analyzed using Image Lab Software (Version 5.1, Hercules, CA, USA).
