<p>With regard to the anticancer properties, MOL extracts have been shown to disrupt the proliferation of different cancer cell lines, for example the hot aqueous MOL extract induced apoptosis in human lung cancer A549 cells by affecting mitochondrial viability in a ROS-dependent manner [

 <sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup> and p27
 <sup>Kip1</sup> proteins [
