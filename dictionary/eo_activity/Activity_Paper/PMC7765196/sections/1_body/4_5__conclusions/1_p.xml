<p>We demonstrate the bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of the potential anticancer compounds from MOL extract against TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231. Crude EtOAc extract and their fractions were screened for anticancer activity using different bioassay. We tentatively identified 10 compounds from sub-fraction no 7.7 by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Moreover, we also investigate the individual mechanisms of actions of three identified compounds, including 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol against TNBC cell lines (

Our findings suggest that oleamide has strongest potential as an anticancer treatment by induce apoptosis through suppress Bcl-2 expression and subsequently promote activation of caspase 3. This is the first report concerning MOL extract and oleamide activity against MDA-MB-231 cell line.
