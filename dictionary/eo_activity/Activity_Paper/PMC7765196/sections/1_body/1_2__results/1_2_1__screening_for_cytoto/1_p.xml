<p>To compare the cytotoxic effects of crude MOL extracts, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated into 96-well plates and incubated with serial concentrations of the crude hexane, crude EtOAc, and crude ethanolic (EtOH) extracts for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. Crude EtOAc extract exhibited the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (233.5 μg/mL) followed by crude EtOH extract (241.1 μg/mL), and crude hexane extract (342.6 μg/mL), respectively (
