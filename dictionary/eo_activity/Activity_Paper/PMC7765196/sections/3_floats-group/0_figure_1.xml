  <p>Effects of crude hexane, EtOAc, and EtOH extracts of MOL on the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cells were plated into 96-well plates and incubated with each extract for 24 h. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. Each dot represents mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Cell viability after treatment with each extract at IC
   <sub>50</sub> concentrations for 24 h. One-way ANOVA was performed with multiple comparison correction (Dunnett test). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. IC50, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration; EtOAc, ethyl acetate; EtOH, ethanol.
