  <p>Effect of 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol in vitro cell migration. (
   <bold>A</bold>) MDA-MB-231 cells were scratch wounded and incubated with compounds, doxorubicin, or complete medium (control). The wound areas were imaged at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post-scratching. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Wound area (%) summarized from triplicate data. One-way ANOVA test was performed with multiple comparison corrections (Dunnett test). Data represent the mean Â± SEM of three independent experiments. (*
