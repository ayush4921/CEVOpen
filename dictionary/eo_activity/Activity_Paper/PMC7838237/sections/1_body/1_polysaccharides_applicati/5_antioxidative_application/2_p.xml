Antioxidative properties of polysaccharides are well proved, different kinds of polysaccharides have been used for this purpose include seaweed polysaccharides, e.g., sulfated polysaccharides, plant polysaccharides, e.g., arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and pectic polysaccharides, and mushroom polysaccharides, e.g., Î²-glucans and glycoproteins [
