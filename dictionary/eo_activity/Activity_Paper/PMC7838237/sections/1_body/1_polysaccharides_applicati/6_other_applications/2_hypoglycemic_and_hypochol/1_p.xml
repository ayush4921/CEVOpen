<p id="Par17">Since the 1980s of the last century, polysaccharides have been extensively investigated in clinical trials for their hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic effect, 
 <italic>Ganoderma atrum</italic> polysaccharide has potential for the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, as well as a protective effect on kidney injury in the second type diabetes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Natural polysaccharides can be used as nanocarriers for proteins that enhance the stability of loaded proteins and prolong their therapeutic effect, e.g., the bioavailability of orally administrated Insulin-loaded dextran-chitosan nanoparticulate polyelectrolyte complex is increased with extended hypoglycemic effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other examples of polysaccharides with hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic effects include sulfated polysaccharides extract from 
 <italic>Bullacta exarate</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], chitosan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], and Kefiran [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Traditional Chinese medicine derived from 
 <italic>Tremella fuciformis</italic> Mushrooms polysaccharides showed a significant dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect and improved insulin sensitivity by regulating PPAR-Î³-mediated lipid metabolism when it was administered to mice [
