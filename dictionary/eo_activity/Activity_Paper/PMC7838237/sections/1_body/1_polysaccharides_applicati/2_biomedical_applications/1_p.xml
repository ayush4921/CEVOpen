<p id="Par10">Since the last century, polysaccharides have found their place in the biomedical fields [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Owing to many properties of polysaccharides like biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, and enhanced solubility and stability. They have been considered as potential candidates in many biomedical applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, the abundance of polysaccharides sources and their low cost made them substances of choice and used in many biomedical [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and biotechnological applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For instance, polysaccharides obtained from algae have been extensively used in biomedical applications such as wound management, regenerative medicine and to control drug delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The ability of polysaccharides-based biomaterials to form hydrogels is another advantage of these new emerging class of biomaterials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], e.g., heparin-loaded hydrogels, which have been used successfully to deliver bone morphogenetic proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The polysaccharide was proved to improve the mechanical properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which can overcome the poor biological performance of synthetic polymers [
