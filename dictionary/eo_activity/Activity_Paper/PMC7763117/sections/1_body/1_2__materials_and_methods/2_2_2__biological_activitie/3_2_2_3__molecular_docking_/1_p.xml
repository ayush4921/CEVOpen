<p>The 3D structures of antibacterial target (PDB id 1YLJ) [30] and antifungal target (PDB id 2YOK) were fetched from Protein Data Bank Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (PDB) (2020). Protein Data Bank [online]. Website u1eb6 [accessed 00 Month Year]., and all the atoms were prepared, charged, protonated, and minimized via MOE 2016 suite. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were built and saved in their 3D conformations by Builder tool incorporated in MOE 2016. The following factors were used for energy minimization gradient: 0.05, Force Field: MMFF94X+Solvation, Chiral Constraint: Current Geometry. Energy minimization was terminated when the root mean square gradient fell below 0.005. The minimized structures of the complexes were used as the template for molecular docking. Ten conformations were generated for each docked ligand-target complex. Lowest energy minimized conformation of each docked complex was used for further analysis.</p>
