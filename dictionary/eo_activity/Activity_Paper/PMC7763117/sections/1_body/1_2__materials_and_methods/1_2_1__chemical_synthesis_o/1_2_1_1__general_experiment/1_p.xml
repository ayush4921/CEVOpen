<p>Chemicals were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germay) and Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA). IR spectra were recorded on Schimadzu Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer model 270 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), using ATR (attenuated total reflectance) facility. All the reactions were monitored by Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using the precoated silica gel-60 F254 purchased from Merck KGaA. Flash column chromatography was carried out with silica gel as stationary phase (particle size 200–300 mesh). High resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) experiments were carried out on Finnigan MAT-311A (Finnigan MAT GmbH, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer with (ESI) ionization techniques. NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance 300 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) in deuterated chloroform using TMS as internal reference, at 300 MHz ( 
 <sup>1</sup> H NMR) and 75 MHz ( 
 <sup>13</sup> C NMR). Chemical shifts are mentioned in delta (δ) units while coupling constants (J) values are in Hertz unit (Hz).
