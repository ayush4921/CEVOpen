<p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether the PBWE was useful in ameliorating TMT-induced seizures and whether it had any potential neuroprotective effect on hippocampal neurodegeneration. We also aimed to isolate the major components of the PBWE, and confirm which component could exhibit a possible involvement in the neuroprotective effect. </p>
