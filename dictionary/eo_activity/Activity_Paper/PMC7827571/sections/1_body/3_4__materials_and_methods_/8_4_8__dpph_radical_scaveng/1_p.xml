<p>Free radical scavenging activity was assessed using a modified version of the method proposed by Cheng, et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4–6 per group). In brief, 100 μL of sample extracts (4, 20, 100, 500, 2500 μg/mL) or isolated compounds (10, 25, 50, 100, 200 μM) dissolved in 50% ethanol were added to 100 μL of 0.2 mM DPPH (Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK) solution, reaching a final concentration of 0.1 mM DPPH. Each reaction mixture was shaken for five seconds and left to stand for 30 min in the dark at 25 °C. The absorbance of each mixture was measured at 515 nm against a blank (50% ethanol) using a SpectraMax i3x Microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular devices). The inhibition rate of DPPH radicals was calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula>DPPH inhibition rate (%) = (1 − [A
  <sub>sample</sub> − A
  <sub>blank</sub>]/[A
  <sub>control</sub> − A
  <sub>blank</sub>]) × 100
 </disp-formula>
