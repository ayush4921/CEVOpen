<p>Although PB larvae have been broadly used in oriental medicine to treat several diseases, few studies have been conducted on its protective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we selected the TMT-intoxicated models for investigating the neuroprotective effects of PB larvae. TMT induces clinical symptoms of central nervous system, such as learning impairment and tonic-clonic seizure [

The toxin also leads to neurodegeneration in the limbic system especially the hippocampus, via various events, including oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, intracellular calcium overload, impaired neurotransmission, and mitochondrial dysfunction [

 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we performed an in vitro experiment that showed that pretreatment with the PBWE reduced TMT-induced neuronal death in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, in our in vivo model, oral pretreatment with the PBWE decreased death rate and significantly reduced the seizure severity on day 2 post-TMT treatment. Additionally, pretreatment with the PBWE substantially decreased the number of FJC-positive degenerating neurons in TMT-treated hippocampal DG, consistent with the improvement in clinical symptoms. Thus, we may conclude that pretreatment with the PBWE exhibited neuroprotective effects, which resulted in reducing seizure severity and neuronal cell death in the TMT-induced neurotoxicity model.
