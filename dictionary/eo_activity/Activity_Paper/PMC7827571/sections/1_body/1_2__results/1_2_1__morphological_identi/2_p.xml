<p>The five randomly selected PB larvae were assessed for genetic species identification. A total of 16 cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences including those from PB and its closely related species were used for comparative analysis based on multiple sequence alignment (

 <italic>P. brevitarsis</italic>, with different COI sequences when compared to the closely related species. Intraspecies sequence variation in five 
 <italic>P. brevitarsis</italic> samples was shown at four nucleotide positions, which were 158 (G/A), 164 (C/T), 389 (C/T), and 458 (A/G). Thus, intraspecies sequence variability was about 0.34% in 
 <italic>P. brevitarsis</italic>.
