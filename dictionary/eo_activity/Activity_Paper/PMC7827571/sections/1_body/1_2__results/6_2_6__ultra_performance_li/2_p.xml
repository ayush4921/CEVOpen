<p>To examine the antioxidative activity of the isolated compounds, which could affect that of PBWE, we identified the free radical scavenging rate (%) in the DPPH assay (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5–6 per group; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00679-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). The inhibition rates of inosine and benzoic acid significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner above the dose of 10 μM and 50 μM, respectively, compared to that in the blank control. IC
 <sub>50</sub> of inosine and benzoic acid were 338.3 μM and 472.0 μM, respectively. Meanwhile, in case of the other compounds, the inhibition rates did not follow a dose-dependent manner, although all values above 10 μM were significantly higher than that of the blank control.
