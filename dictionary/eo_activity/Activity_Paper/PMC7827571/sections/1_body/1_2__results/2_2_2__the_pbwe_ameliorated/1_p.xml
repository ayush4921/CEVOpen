<p>We performed the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay to confirm whether the PBWE treatment alleviates TMT-induced injury in hippocampal cells at days in vitro (DIV) 7. We found that treatment with 5 μM TMT alone increased LDH release from cultured hippocampal neurons compared to that in vehicle controls at 24 h after treatment (
