 <p>This study aimed to investigate whether the 
  <italic>Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis</italic> (PB)â€™ water extract (PBWE) ameliorates trimethyltin (TMT)-induced seizures and hippocampal neurodegeneration. To investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of the PBWE in vitro, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was conducted in TMT-treated primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. In TMT-treated adult C57BL/6 mice, behavioral and histopathological changes were evaluated by seizure scoring and Fluoro-Jade C staining, respectively. In our in vitro assay, we observed that pretreating mice hippocampal neuron cultures with the PBWE reduced TMT-induced cytotoxicity, as indicated by the decreased LDH release. Furthermore, pretreatment with the PBWE alleviated seizures and hippocampal neurodegeneration in TMT-treated mice. The antioxidant activity of the PBWE increased in a dose-dependent manner; moreover, pretreatment with the PBWE mitigated the TMT-induced Nrf2 stimulation. In addition, six major compounds, including adenine, hypoxanthine, uridine, adenosine, inosine, and benzoic acid, were isolated from the PBWE, and among them, inosine and benzoic acid have been confirmed to have an essential antioxidative activity. In conclusion, the PBWE ameliorated TMT-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons in both in vitro and in vivo assays, through a potential antioxidative effect. Our findings suggest that the PBWE may have pharmacotherapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases such as seizures or epilepsy.
