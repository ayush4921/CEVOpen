<p>Currently, we are losing the fight against ineffective, toxic, and expensive therapeutic antimicrobial drugs. However, endophytes provide a suitable alternative since they are a warehouse filled with novel bioactive compounds with endless possibilities of biological properties. Over the past few years, endophytic fungi have attracted tremendous attention in the drug development process as they are ubiquitous and abundantly availability. Numerous studies have reported novel, beneficial bioactive compounds exhibiting biological properties, such as antibacterial, antidiabetic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis, insecticidal, immunomodulatory, antiviral, anticancer activities, anthelmintic, etc., that were successfully isolated from endophytic fungi. Despite this, limited research has been conducted on the valuable bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi. Research priorities need to shift towards biotechnological advances to accelerate the screening of new biomolecules for the treatment of numerous life-threatening diseases, thus safe-guarding human health. All things considered, an untapped wealth of novel bioactive compounds resides within endophytes, thus ensuring the discovery of new bioactive compounds for potential applications in the agricultural, food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
