 <italic>Nerium oleander</italic> L (Apocynaceae) isolated from 
 <italic>Trachelospermum jasminoides</italic> also displayed antioxidant potentials [
 <xref rid="B82-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Using chemical analysis, six new macrolides comprising myrothecines D–G (1–4), 16-hydroxymytoxin B, and 14′-dehydrovertisporin and four 10,13-cyclotrichothecane derivatives were detected in three endophytes of 
 <italic>Myrothecium roridum</italic> IFB-E008, IFB-E009, and IFB-E012. In addition, an investigation into their antimicrobial properties revealed that the compounds exhibited sufficient cytotoxicity based on their bioactive data [
