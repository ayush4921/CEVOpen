<p>Mao and colleagues (2019) discovered two novel decalin/tetramic acid hybrid metabolites—hyalodendrins A and B, isolated from the endophytic fungus 
 <italic>Hyalodendriella</italic> sp. Ponipodef12 using spectroscopic chemical analysis. These compounds were capable of inhibiting the growth of fourth-instar larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B92-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Bioassay was carried out using one hundred and fifty-two (
 <italic>n</italic> = 152) endophytic fungi to determine their anti-plasmodial activity using a 96-well microtiter plate. The results showed that extracts from 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. AMst1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.16–1.43 µg/mL), 
 <italic>Trichoderma afroharzianum</italic> AMrb7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.71–2.31 µg/mL), and 
 <italic>Penicillium tropicum</italic> AMb3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.90 µg/mL) possess significantly effective anti-plasmodial activities against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strains [

 <italic>Phyllosticta capitalensis</italic> from 
 <italic>Tibouchina granulosa</italic> (Desr.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae) inhibited 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and 
 <italic>Trypanossoma cruzi</italic>. Based on high-resolution mass spectrum analysis (UHPLC-HRMS), 18 compounds were identified from 
 <italic>P. capitalensis</italic> and crude extracts from the endophyte displayed growth inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.2, 82.0, and 50.13 μg/mL, respectively. Given that the diseases Leishmaniasis and Chagas are abandoned tropical diseases caused by protozoa and infect over 12 million individuals globally, these findings present a significant hope for mankind [

 <sub>18</sub> and others (
