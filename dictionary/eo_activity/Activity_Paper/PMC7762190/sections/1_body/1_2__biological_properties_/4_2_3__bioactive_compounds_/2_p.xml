<p>The ground-breaking study resulting in the discovery of paclitaxel, also known as the “golden” compound, produced renewed hope in the search for novel anticancer agents, and the compound gained significant popularity because of its distinctive mode of action when compared to other anticancer agents. Paclitaxel obstructs the uncontrolled duplication of cancerous cells, thereby reducing their growth and spread. Paclitaxel with a chemical formula of C
 <sub>47</sub>H
 <sub>51</sub>NO
 <sub>14</sub> is formulated from ‘taxol”, the first anticancer drug to generate billions of dollars. The endophytic fungus (
 <italic>Taxomyces andreanae</italic>) isolated from the Pacific yew bark (
 <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic>) produces the anticancer bioactive compound paclitaxel. A number of studies have also isolated taxol and its related compounds from a variety of endophytes, including 
 <italic>Grammothele lineata</italic> [

 <italic>Aspegillus aculeatinus</italic> [

 <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and 
 <italic>Acremonium, Colletotrichum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., from an ecologically altered 
 <italic>Taxus baccata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Taxol and its associated compounds were characterized and confirmed using UV absorption, HPLC, FTIR spectra, and LC–ESI–MS [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Despite its very effective anticancer properties, taxol is rare, which amplifies the need to enhance the search for alternative sources to this very important bioactive metabolite [
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, plants that produce taxol appear to be “rare”, which, coupled with the fact that the production of taxol from 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> plants is a complex process, means that an alternative will be to constantly assess taxol-producing endophytic fungi due to the ease and practicality of obtaining these valuable compounds. In order to understand the complexity of the processes or molecular mechanisms involved in the production of taxol, [
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] assessed the transcriptome of 
 <italic>Aspergillus aculeatinus</italic> Tax-6, indicating that genes involved in two pathways (mevalonate (MVA) and nonmevalonate (MEP)) need to be expressed. Despite the fact that the potential of endophytes to produce taxol varies, with 
 <italic>Grammothele lineata</italic> producing 382.2 μg/L [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], 
 <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> producing 140.8 μg/L taxol [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and 
 <italic>Acremonium, Colletotrichum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., which also produced up to 116.19 μg/L [
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the production of a very high yield (560 µg/L) by the mutant strain 
 <italic>A. aculeatinus</italic> BT-2 when compared to the wild-type 
 <italic>A. aculeatinus</italic> Tax-6 strain [
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] indicates the importance of genetic manipulation in the search for these very important bioactive compounds. In addition to the previously mentioned studies, other endophytic fungi, such as 
 <italic>Pestalotiopsis microspore, Alternaria alternata, Periconia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Pithomyces</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Chaetomella raphigera, Monochaetia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Seimatoantlerium nepalense</italic>, 
 <italic>Botryodiplodia theobromae</italic>, 
 <italic>Phyllosticta spinarum, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bartalinia robillardoides</italic>, have also been found to produce anticancer bioactive agents that chemically belong to taxols [
 <xref rid="B48-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Several taxol-producing endophytes therefore provided a cheaper and more accessible alternative for anticancer agents [
 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and it is on this basis that taxol compounds were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, lung cancer, and refractory ovarian cancer [
