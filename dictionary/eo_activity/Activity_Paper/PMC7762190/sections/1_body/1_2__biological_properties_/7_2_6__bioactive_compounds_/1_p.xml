<p>Immunosuppressive drugs, also known as antirejection medications, are utilized to suppress, reduce, or prevent allograft rejection during organ transplant in patients [
 <xref rid="B95-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. They therefore play a significant role in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, and insulin-dependent diabetes [
 <xref rid="B95-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Currently, the effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs is affected by a number of side effects, and given that their demand is high, there is a need to hasten the search for safer but more reliable drugs in order to alleviate these problems. A number of studies have established that endophytes are capable of producing bioactive molecules with immunosuppressive potentials [

 <xref rid="B97-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Data generated using chemical analysis revealed the presence of a novel amide derivative (-)mycousnine enamine biomolecule that was produced by the endophyte

 <italic>Smilax china</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B98-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Furthermore, cyclosporin A and (-)mycousnine enamine have selectively inhibited T cell proliferation by blocking the expression of the surface activation antigens CD25 and CD69. These findings confirm that endophytic fungi may serve as a potential source for potent immunosuppressants that have low toxicity but high selectivity [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. ZJ-SY2, which was associated with mangrove 
 <italic>Sonneratia apetala</italic> leaves. These compounds exhibited excellent immunosuppressive properties, with IC

 <italic>Xylaria longipes</italic> HFG1018, obtained from the basidiomycete 
 <italic>Fomitopsis betulinus</italic>, which is associated with rotting of wood, produced eighteen new nor-isopimarane diterpenes, xylarinorditerpenes A–R (1–18), some of which possessed immunosuppressive potential [
