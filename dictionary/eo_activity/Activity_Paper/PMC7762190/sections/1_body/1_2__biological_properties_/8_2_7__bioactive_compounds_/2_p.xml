<p>Isoindolones compounds, namely emerimidines A and B, emeriphenolicins A and D, as well as other compounds, including aspernidines A and B, austin, austinol, dehydroaustin, and acetoxydehydroaustin, were discovered in the endophytic fungus 
 <italic>Emericella</italic> sp. (HK-ZJ) from the mangrove plant 
 <italic>Aegiceras corniculatum.</italic> A bioassay using the cytopathic effect (CPE) test revealed that the fungal extracts displayed potency against influenza A viral (H1N1) [

 <italic>Nigrospora sphaerica</italic> (No.83-1-1-2), 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (No.58-8-4-1), and 
 <italic>Phialophora</italic> sp. (No.96-1-8-1) exhibited some antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV). Extraction and identification of compounds revealed two novel heptaketides, (+)-(2S,3S,4aS)-altenuene (1a) and (−)-(2S,3S,4aR)-isoaltenuene, along with six recognizable compounds, (−)-(2R,3R,4aR)-altenuene, (+)-(2R,3R,4aS)-isoaltenuene, 5′-methoxy-6-methyl-biphenyl-3,4,3′-triol, alternariol (4), alternariol-9-methyl ether, and 4-hydroxyalternariol-9-methyl ether [
