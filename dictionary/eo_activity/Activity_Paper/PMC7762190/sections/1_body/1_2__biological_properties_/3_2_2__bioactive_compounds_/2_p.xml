<p>Research advances in modern antifungal agents rely highly on screening for novel bioactive compounds that have gained popularity in the drug development process and will aid in the fight against animal and human fungal pathogens. Peláez and co-workers (2000) established that new triterpene glycoside exhibited good antifungal inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. with 19 and 30 mm, respectively. Furthermore, in vivo studies conducted on mouse models showed moderate efficacy against candidiasis [

 <italic>Favolaschia calocera</italic>—which displayed antifungal effectiveness. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) displayed by compound 1 was ≤ 9.37 and ≤ 18.75 μg/mL against 
 <italic>Candida tenuis</italic> and 
 <italic>Mucor plumbeus</italic>, respectively [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. (C7B) and 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. (B1C, C4E, C4D)) were effective against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aereus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>, displaying clear-zone diameters of 17.91 ± 0.84 mm; 17.78 ± 0.83 mm; 17.66 ± 0.83 mm; 16.72 ± 1.15 mm, and 13.65 ± 0.27 mm, respectively [
