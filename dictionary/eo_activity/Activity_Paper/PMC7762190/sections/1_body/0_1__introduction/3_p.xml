<p>In addition, the ratio of fungal species to vascular plants is approximately 1:6, which is estimated at 1.5 million fungal species [

Endophytes are microorganisms that colonize internal plant tissues without causing any apparent harm to the host plant throughout their life cycle. This interaction is considered as mutualistic symbiosis, whereby both partners benefit from the association [

 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The endophytes aid in the physiological and ecological roles of the plants, resulting in protection and survival mechanisms. Moreover, endophytic fungi promote growth, prevent abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought conditions, salinity, extreme temperatures, heavy metal toxicity, and oxidative stress, and provide protection from insect and herbivores [
