<p>Inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values corresponding to the concentrations reducing 50% of the initial DPPHâ€¢ values were obtained by plotting the percentage of free radical-quenching activity against the logarithm of the different concentrations ranging from 16.9 to 1.4 g/L (acetonic) and 40 to 2.5 g/L (aqueous). Once the concentration values were transformed, a nonlinear regression (log (inhibitor) vs. response-variable slope) was applied to obtain a sigmoid curve.
