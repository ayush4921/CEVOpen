<p>The treatment was renewed each day using a freshly prepared 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> extracts. Zebrafish development was carefully checked by using a stereo microscope (Nikon SMZ18) at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf looking at four apical observations as indicators of lethality according to the OECD guidelines 236: (i) coagulation of fertilized eggs, (ii) lack of somite formation, (iii) lack of detachment of the tail-bud from the yolk sac, and (iv) lack of heartbeat. At the end of the exposure period, the acute and developmental toxicity (teratogenicity) were determined according to the OECD ruled based on a positive outcome in any of the four apical observations recorded. The percentage of mortality was determined by using the following equation:
