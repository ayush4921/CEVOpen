<p>High phenolic acid and flavonoid contents are often associated with a high antioxidant capacity of the plant extract [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These compounds are characterized by one or several aromatic rings with at least one hydroxyl group [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This particular chemical structure conferred them different antioxidant activities due to their ability to directly scavenge free radicals by donating protons/electrons [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or by activating antioxidant signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, the DPPH experiment highlighted the strong capacity of both extracts to reduce DPPH radicals due to their high content in bioactive molecules. These high antioxidant properties for the acetonic extract are consistent with a previous study [
