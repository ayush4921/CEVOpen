<p>Medicinal plants known as “green gold” have been widely used in traditional medicine for centuries across the world. The relatively toxic effect of the medicinal plant relies on different parameters, such as the plant part used, composition, preparation method, and concentration. Among plant-based beverage preparations, the infusion is the most commonly used after decoction. Therefore, we studied the potential toxic effect of an aqueous extract from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> on zebrafish embryos. A median lethal concentration of 17.6 ± 1.7 g/L was found. This concentration is higher than the concentration recommended by the herbalist for this method of preparation, around 1–4 g for 1 L. However, we must remain vigilant about taking this aqueous extract, which can have teratogenic effects, especially during pregnancy.
