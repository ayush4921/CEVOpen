 <italic>z</italic> 191.0554 due to the loss of caffeic acid moiety, and the main product ions at

 <italic>z</italic> 179.0343, corresponding to loss of quinic acid moiety;

 <italic>z</italic> 135.0441, corresponding to loss of a -CO

 <italic>z</italic> 173.0447, allowing the identification of 4-CQA, which is consistent with the 4-acylated mono-acyl CGAs [
