 <sub>12</sub> (mass error 1.04 ppm) was detected, suggesting the presence of di-caffeoylquinic acid isomers (di-CQA). The main MS2 product ions were at

 <italic>z</italic> 353.0878, due to the loss of the caffeic acid moiety;

 <italic>z</italic> 191.0554, corresponding to quinic acid;

 <italic>z</italic>, 179.0342 corresponding to caffeic acid;

 <italic>z</italic> 173.0447, corresponding to a dehydrated quinic acid; and 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 135.0440, corresponding to a decarboxylated form of caffeic acid. Interestingly, among these four isomers, only peak 16 (5.82 min) had an MS2 base peak at

 <italic>z</italic> 191.0554, allowing the identification of 3,5-diCQA (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04482">Figure S2h</xref>). The other three isomers had an MS2 base peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 173.0447, which is consistent with the 4-acylated mono-acyl CGAs. In this way, the peak 17 (6.02 min) was assigned to 3,4-diCQA due to a higher intensity of the quinic acid product ion (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 191.0554) than the remaining peaks (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04482">Figure S2i</xref>). Due to the lack of standards, peak 19 (6.36 min) was tentatively characterized as either 1,4-diCQA or 4,5-diCQA (
