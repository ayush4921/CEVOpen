 <sub>9</sub> (mass error 0.2 ppm), could be coumaric acid isomers. Indeed, these two peaks had the same MS2 ion at

 <italic>z</italic> 119.049, corresponding to the removal of a -CO
 <sub>2</sub> group from coumaric acid. The identification was further confirmed by comparing the MS2 fragmentation behavior and the retention time of a 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid reference standard. Therefore, peak 8 was identified as m/o-coumaric acid and peak 10 as 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (
