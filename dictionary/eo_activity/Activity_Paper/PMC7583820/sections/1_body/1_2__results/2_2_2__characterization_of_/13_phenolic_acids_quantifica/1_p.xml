<p>The quantification by mass spectrometry highlighted a high abundance of cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives in both extracts (

Most of the compounds were found in significantly higher concentrations in acetonic versus aqueous extracts: 0.002162 vs. 0.000703 mg/mL for caffeic acid, 0.007596 and 0.001437 mg/mL for dicaffeoylquinic acids isomers, and 0.004070 and 0.002415 mg/mL for protocatechuic acid. Interestingly, the concentration of caffeoylquinic acid isomers (5-CQA/3-CQA) was higher in the aqueous relative to the acetonic extracts (0.010163 vs. 0.005559 mg/mL). Indeed, the total amount of phenolic acids and flavonoids is higher in the acetonic extract than in the aqueous extract. These results highlight a notable amount of phenolic acids in both
