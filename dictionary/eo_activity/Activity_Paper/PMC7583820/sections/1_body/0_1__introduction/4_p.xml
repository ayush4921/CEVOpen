<p>In the present study, we compared the precise phenolic profile of aqueous and acetonic (polyphenol rich) extracts from dried leaves of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> by performing LC-MS/MS analysis. In a second part, we investigated the potential toxicity of several concentrations of these extracts using a zebrafish model. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), due to its small-size, high reproductive ability, and rapid embryogenesis and organogenesis, has become the most famous cost-effective alternative model used for large-scale and high-throughput toxicological and physiopathological studies [

The transparency of zebrafish embryos and larvae enables the real-time visualization and imaging of drug effects throughout the developmental process. This laboratory model is widely used to test compoundsâ€™ toxicity. We consequently determine the median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) in a zebrafish embryo and larvae models.
