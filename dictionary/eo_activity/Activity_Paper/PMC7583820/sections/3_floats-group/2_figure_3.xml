  <p>Survival curves for 96 hpf zebrafish embryos exposed with acetonic (
   <bold>A</bold>) or aqueous (
   <bold>B</bold>) extracts from 
   <italic>A. borbonica</italic> at high concentrations of 16.9 g/L (acetonic) and 40 g/L (aqueous) and a low concentration of 2.3 g/L (acetonic and aqueous), and E3 was considered as control. Median lethal concentration curves (LC
   <sub>50</sub>) for 96 hpf zebrafish embryos and 72 hpf larvae exposed to acetonic (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>) or aqueous (
   <bold>D</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) extracts at different concentrations ranging from 16.9 to 1.3 g/L (acetonic) and 40 to 2.3 g/L (aqueous) for 4 and 2 days, respectively. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> values were expressed in g/L. Data are the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments.
