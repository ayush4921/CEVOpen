<p id="p0035">The total phenolic content of all methanolic extracts of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> was determined by FCR. GA was used as a reference phenolic compound for the determination of phenolic content in different methanolic extracts. As determined in previous studies (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">de Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>), 1.0 ml of FCR was mixed with 1.0 ml of methanolic extract from different parts of the plant having concentration (1.0 mg/mL). After proper mixing for at least 5 min, add 3.0 ml of 2% sodium carbonate solution and vortex the glass tubes to ensure complete mixing. Keep the glass tubes containing the mixture in the dark at room temperature for 3 h for proper mixing. Record the absorbance at 760 nm of each solution using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance recorded were analyzed and expressed the results in milligrams of GA equivalent per gram dry weight (mg GAE/g DW).
