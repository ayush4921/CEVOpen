<p id="p0045">To determine the antioxidant activity of methanolic extracts of various parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic>, the DPPH assay was performed to estimate the scavenging ability of various extracts by quenching DPPH. As previously determined by Brand-Williams et al., in 1995 (
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Brand-Williams et al., 1995</xref>), the assay was performed in triplicates with slight modifications, and the mean absorbance was calculated and noted. Briefly, freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.3 mM) was prepared in 95% methanol, stored in an amber color bottle at 4–8 °C. All the T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> were dissolved in 95% methanol and make various concentrations (1000–0.976 µg/ml) of an extract as well as ascorbic acid (positive control) by applying serial dilution method. Add 500 µl of (0.3 mM) of DPPH working solution to each serial diluted 500 µl of extract as well as ascorbic acid as positive control under restricted light. Additionally, 500 µl of DPPH is mixed with 500 µl of 95% methanol as a control without extract or ascorbic acid. The mixtures of DPPH working solution and extract, ascorbic acid (positive control), or control are mixed well and incubated in dark for 30 min. The absorbance of different extracts, positive control and blank were measured by spectrophotometer at 517 nm after adjusting zero for 95% methanol. The change in coloration from dark blue to yellowish color of DPPH was recorded and percent inhibition of DPPH radical exhibited by extract samples and ascorbic acid as a positive control was calculated by using formula
