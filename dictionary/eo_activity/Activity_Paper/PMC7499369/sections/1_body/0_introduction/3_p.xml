<p id="p0010">T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> is commonly called ‘‘Athal’’ in the Arabic region. It is a type of halophytic plant and grows much faster than other plants in extremely arid and harsh environmental conditions. T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> belongs to family 
 <italic>Tamaricaceae</italic>. The plant is woody and can reach a height of 50 feet and a width of 6 feet (

 <italic>articulata</italic> that have been reported from the Morocco region, but it is still not clear the phytochemical composition and the comprehensive analysis of biological activities of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata.</italic> Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the comparative analysis of biological activities of different methanolic extracts (fresh leave, dry leaves, stem, and root) of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> found in Saudi Arabia.
