<p>The antibacterial activity was determined using the broth microdilution method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Bacterial strains were cultured on nutrient agar (Fluka Analytical) and incubated at 37°C for 18 hours. A bacterial suspension equivalent to 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/mL was added to MHB and the test sample, which had been serially diluted across the 96 well microtitre plate. MICs were determined after 18 hours of incubation at 37°C. With the addition of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a 1 mg/mL methanolic solution of MTT, a colour change of the dye to purple indicated the presence of growth. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed. MIC values were determined in duplicate per plate and repeated in at least two independent experiments.
