 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains WP2, K12 J53-2, and K12 JD173 and recipient 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains ER1793 (streptomycin-resistant) and JM109 (nalidixic-resistant) were used in the bacterial conjugation assays. Conjugative plasmids used were pKM101 (IncN; ampicillin-resistant), TP114 (IncI
 <sub>2</sub>; kanamycin-resistant), and R7K (IncW; ampicillin-, streptomycin-, and spectinomycin-resistant), which were purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ), and conjugative plasmid pUB307 (IncP; ampicillin-, kanamycin-, and tetracycline-resistant) was provided by Prof. Keith Derbyshire, Wadsworth Center, New York Department of Health.
