<p>A complementary approach of tackling antibiotic or multidrug resistance is to target bacterial adaptation and persistence mechanisms such as horizontal DNA transfer, mutation, antibiotic tolerance, and the production of virulence factors. Such mechanisms are known to be nonessential to the growth of bacteria and as a consequence of this, they are not expected to extensively promote evolution of bacterial resistance against such complementary mediators [
