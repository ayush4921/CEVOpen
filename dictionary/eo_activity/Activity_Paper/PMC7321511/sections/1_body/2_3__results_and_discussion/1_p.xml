<p>In this study, extracts and fractions from 
 <italic>Myristica lowiana</italic> were investigated for their capacities to inhibit plasmid conjugation in 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> Extract and fraction that showed potent anti-conjugant activity, that is, at least 70% reduction in the transfer frequency of the any of the test plasmids (pKM101, TP114, pUB304 and R7K) was further investigated for their antibacterial activities, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical constituents. The hexane fractions, chloroform extract and its fractions, and methanol extract and its other fractions did not exhibit potent anti-conjugant activity; hence, these products were not further investigated. Some of the aforementioned extracts and fractions also showed no conjugal inhibition, while others showed increase in the conjugation frequency of the test plasmids. The hexane extract and methanol fraction eluted with methanol and water (9 : 1, v/v) were the only products that exhibited potent anti-conjugant activity.
