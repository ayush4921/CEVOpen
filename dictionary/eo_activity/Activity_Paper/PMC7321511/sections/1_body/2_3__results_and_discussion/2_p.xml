<p>The hexane extract (4.14â€‰g) gave rise to an olive green liquid. Phytochemical screening of this extract revealed the presence of sterols, terpenoids, and amide bonds. However, the extract tested negative for tannins, saponins, reducing sugars, and flavonoids. The NMR spectra (Supplementary Figures
