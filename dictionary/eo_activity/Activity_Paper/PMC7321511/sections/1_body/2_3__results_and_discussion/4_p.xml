<p>The antibacterial activities (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) revealed that both hexane extract and methanol fraction had moderate antibacterial activity (32 to 64â€‰mg/L) against Gram-positive bacteria but were not active against Gram-negative organisms. We suggest that the difference in activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may be due to the differences in the cell wall and the additional outer membrane in Gram-negative organisms restricting cell entry or accumulation of components within the extract and fraction [
