<p>The percentage inhibition of violacein pigment synthesis by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV12472 was evaluated at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations and reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01768-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> inhibited violacein production better than 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic>, as it percentage inhibition of violacein varied from 80.5% ± 3.0% at MIC to 5.6 ± 0.2 at MIC/8 as compared to 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> with 75.1% ± 2.5% at MIC and 15.5% ± 1.1% at MIC/4. At MIC/16, no inhibition was observed.
