<p>Prior to the GC-MS analyses, the samples were silylated using BSTFA [bis (trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide], according to the method described by Talla and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. GC-FID and GC-MS were performed as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The GC-MS profiles of the extracts were achieved on a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890, Bunker Lake Blvd, Ramsey, MN, USA) with a JEOL MS-600H mass spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) as detector. Prior to this, GC-FID was performed on a Shimadzu GC-17(Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). We used helium (1 mL/min) as the carrier gas at a split ratio of 1:10 in a SPB-5VR capillary column of length 30 m and inner diameter 0.25 mm. The initial temperature of the oven was varied as follows: 60 °C for 3 min, increased at the rate of 5 °C/min to 180 °C, and finally at 7 °C/min to 300 °C final temperature. A ZB-5MSVR column of 30 m length and 0.25 mm inner diameter was used for GC-MS and the same temperature conditions as for GC-FID were applied. Next, 250 °C and 70 eV was applied for the ion source. Mass spectral fingerprints were used for identification on the NIST library and compared with some data reported.
