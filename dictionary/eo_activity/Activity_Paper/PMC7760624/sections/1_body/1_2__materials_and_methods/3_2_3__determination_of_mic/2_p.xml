<p>The broth dilution method, as described by the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2006), was applied to determine the MIC values [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The lowest concentration of extract at which no bacterial growth was visible was considered as the MIC. Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) was used as the medium and the bacterial concentration used had a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Into 96-well microtiter plates, containing extracts at concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312 mg/mL), 100 μL of microbial cell solutions were inoculated and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, after which the MICs were determined and recorded.
