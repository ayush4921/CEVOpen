<p>In order to protect themselves during adverse conditions such as immunological defense systems of host, antibiotics, and starvation, many fungi and bacteria cells constitute self-organized and three-dimensional communities in which they will live. These constituted and protected communities are called biofilms and they contribute to the severity of chronic infections as well as the persistence of resistance to drugs and antibiotics [

Therefore, most antimicrobial agents treat symptoms of planktonic bacteria, and disease will resurface, due to the bacteria which were within biofilms and which will break out when the threat from the antibiotic is over. The potential of these plant extracts to inhibit biofilm formation by test bacteria is a very desirable effect. This can subsequently eliminate bacteria resistance or reduce the severity of microbial infections.
