 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium normally found in the intestine of poultry and most other animals. Colibacillosis occurs as acute fatal septicemia or subacute pericarditis, air vasculitis, salpingitis, and peritonitis. It is a common disease of economic importance in poultry and animals worldwide. However, no single 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> serogroup used as a bacterium can provide full protection against all of the serogroups that cause infections. Virulence factors include possession of large virulence plasmids and the ability to resist phagocytosis and serum killing, acquire iron in low iron conditions, and adhere to host structures [
