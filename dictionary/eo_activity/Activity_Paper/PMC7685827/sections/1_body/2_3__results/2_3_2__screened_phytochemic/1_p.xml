<p>Phytochemical (secondary metabolic chemicals) screening of the ethanol extract of the 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> leaf revealed the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, and saponins. 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> bark also had alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, and steroids. The phytochemicals of the stem and root of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> were less compared to the leaf and bark by ethanol extracts. Overall, phytochemical crude extracts by aquatic extracts were very low compared to ethanol extracts as shown in
