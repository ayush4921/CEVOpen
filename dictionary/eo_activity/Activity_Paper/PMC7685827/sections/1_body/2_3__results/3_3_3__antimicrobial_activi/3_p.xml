<p>The antibacterial activities of the stem crude extracts were tested on selected pathogenic bacteria which imply that the ethanol extract showed significant growth inhibition against tested bacterial species. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the zones of inhibition of the ethanol and aqueous stem extracts were in the range of 6.33–16.77 mm and 1.13–7.80 mm, respectively.
