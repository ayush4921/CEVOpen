<p>The ethanol and aqueous crude extracts of the leaf at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/ml were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities against the test pathogens. The zones of inhibition of crude extracts were 1.60–6.90 mm and 9.63–19.67 mm for aqueous and ethanol extracts, respectively. Ethanol extracts from leaves have a large inhibition zone, especially on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, as shown in
