<p>All the experimental measurements were performed in triplicate (except HPLC-DAD and antimicrobial activity study) and expressed as the average of the three analyses ±standard deviations (SD). The correlation coefficient between variables, means, standard deviations, standard errors, standard curve, IC 
 <sub>50</sub> values and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was calculated by using MS Excel 2007 Software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Figures are prepared in Origin Pro 8 Software (Northampton, MA, USA). A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
