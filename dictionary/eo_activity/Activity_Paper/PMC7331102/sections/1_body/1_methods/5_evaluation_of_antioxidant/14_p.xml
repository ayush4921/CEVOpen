  <italic>Evaluation of antimicrobial activity.</italic>
 </bold> Antimicrobial activity was determined using the standard Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. A total of 40 μl of the extracts was placed into the paper disc with sterile double distilled water (70% ethanol used as a negative control). After diffusion of the extract, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 16-18 h. Then the zone of inhibition was measured

In the antimicrobial activity study, concentration (µg) of total bioactive compounds in 40 µl was also calculated from the extractive values of the particular solvents.
