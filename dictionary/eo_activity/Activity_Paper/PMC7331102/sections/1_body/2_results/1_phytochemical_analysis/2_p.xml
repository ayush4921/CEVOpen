<p>The highest concentration of alkaloid content was observed in HI aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts (0.148±0.006 and 0.171±0.004 mg CE/g dry weight, respectively). The lowest concentration was observed in CR aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts (0.017±0.006 and 0.024±0.003 mg CE/g dry weight, respectively) (

The highest concentration of cardiac glycosides content was observed in EH aqueous and HI 70% ethanolic extracts (2.20±0.20 and 3.86±0.27 mg DE/g dry weight, respectively). The lowest concentration was obtained from TP aqueous and CB 70% ethanolic extracts (0.23±0.04 and 1.70±0.09 mg DE/g dry weight, respectively) (
