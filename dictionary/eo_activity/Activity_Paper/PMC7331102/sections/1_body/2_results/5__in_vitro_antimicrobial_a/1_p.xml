<p>Zone of inhibition shown by aqueous and 70% ethanolic leaves extract indicated the presence of high antimicrobial activity. EH aqueous extracts showed the highest zone of inhibition in comparing with all the extracts. TP and CR 70% ethanolic extracts had given better antimicrobial properties than other leaves 70% ethanolic extracts. SE strains have not given any zone of inhibition in case of all the extracts (
