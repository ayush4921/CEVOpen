 </sup>. Among these three compounds were present in all the extracts (chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid and coumarin). In EH and TP highest ten compounds were identified. In HI lowest six compounds were identified. In EH six compounds were found in the highest amount, and these are GA (83.258 ng/µl), CH (122.149 ng/µl), SYA (9.487 ng/µl, pCA (10.017 ng/µl, SIA (297.315 ng/µl, CM (3.719 ng/µl). In each of TP and CR two phenolic acids were found in the highest amount and these are CHA (6.405 ng/µl), KMP (5.241 ng/µl) and CA (23.006 ng/µl), QE (15.099 ng/µl), respectively. Sinapic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid present in all the leaves extracts as well as it is found in the highest amount in EH extract. Availability of coumarin among these standard phenolics is found minimum in all the extracts. The HPLC-DAD profile showed in chromatogram representation and in
