<p>PPO is a widely distributed copper-containing enzyme in plants. It is known to be responsible for the enzymatic browning reaction occurring during the handling, storage and processing of the fruits and vegetables. The two molecular oxygen occurs in the two separate reactions when PPO shows the activity. The PPO enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds into highly reactive quinones. Polymerization of PPO-derived quinones causes the postharvest browning of cut or bruised fruit, but the native physiological functions of PPOs in undamaged, intact plant cells are not well understood
