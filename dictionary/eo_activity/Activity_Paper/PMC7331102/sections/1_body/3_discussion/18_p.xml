<p>The dissolution of calcium oxalate and the number of calcium ions in the solutions are inversely related. The current 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-lithiatic investigation concluded that the aqueous extracts showed higher dissolution percentage of calcium oxalate crystals (except CB) than 70% ethanolic extracts. The result of CB aqueous extract contradicts with the previous reports of Celestian 
 <italic>et al</italic>., who showed that CB aqueous extracts had higher dissolution percentages of calcium oxalates

 </sup>. According to our knowledge, the present work highlighted the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-urolithiasis activity of HI, and CR leaves extracts for the first time. Lithiasis and its co-morbidities proceed to the development of oxidative stresses which is known to be a primary reason for inflammation. Previous research suggests that oxidative stresses and inflammation generated by one disorder, and it may happen in a particular situation which produces the development of the co-morbidities. As observed by the researchers that mildly high calcium or phosphate can promote the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the renal interstitium with localized swellings and deposition of collagen resulting to the production of Randall’s plaque or it may be possible that mildly high calcium and phosphate or oxalate and low citrate or magnesium levels in the urine can cause to crystallization in the collecting ducts of kidney that is oxidatively stressed and injured

 </sup>. The present study reveals that the aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts of EH can be able to dissolve the calcium oxalate stones which are higher comparing with the other leaf extracts. The result of the study concluded the necessity of EH aqueous extracts for the treatment of renal stones which agrees with the previous investigation as well
