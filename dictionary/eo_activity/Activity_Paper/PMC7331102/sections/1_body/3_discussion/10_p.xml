 <sub>2</sub> becomes toxic to the cell because it is rapidly decomposed into oxygen and water and gives rise to the hydroxyl radical, which can initiate lipid peroxidation mechanisms by obtaining hydrogen atoms from unsaturated fatty acids and cause DNA strands damages. The hydroxyl radical is short-lived severely reactive free radicals, formed in the biological systems, capable of damaging a wide range of biomolecules located in the living cells through diffusion-limited reaction. Its removal is necessary for the protection of food, too
