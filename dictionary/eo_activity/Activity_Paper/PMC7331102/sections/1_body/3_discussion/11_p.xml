<p>It has been well known that carotenoids class of compounds undergo bleaching, i.e. lose their colour, when exposed to free radicals or to oxidative species. This entire mechanism occurs by the addition of the conjugated double bond which is present in the available reaction system either by the help of cleavage or by adding one of the double bonds of molecules. This cleavage occurrence can be identified by analyzing the products that are created, which are primarily carbonyls or epoxides

 </sup>. Membrane lipids are rich in unsaturated fatty acids which are most susceptible to oxidative mechanisms. The free radical chain reaction is widely accepted as a common process of lipid peroxidation, and it is thought that the inhibition of lipid peroxidation is caused by antioxidants due to their free radical scavenging properties
