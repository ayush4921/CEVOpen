<p>It is concluded that the medicinal plants are best sources of phytochemicals and remedial agents for several disorders. In the present investigation, the extracts of HI, TP, CR, CB and EH were found to be rich in secondary plant metabolites, which showed significant

 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, further studies are recommended to know and evaluate the pharmacological efficacy, potentiality and mode of action. The reasonable difference between the presence of phytochemical contents are may be due to leaves maturity, fertility, pest exposure, moisture, relative water content, pH, solubility, solvents polarity, environmental factors like pollution, solar reflectance, rainfalls, precipitation, location and temperature
