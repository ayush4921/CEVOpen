  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. The importance of phylogenetic data, genetic diversity, and population structure analyses to characterize the biodiversity of wild species has been well-established in numerous studies (e.g.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>). Microsatellites (Single Sequence Repeats, SSR) are amongst the most efficient and widely used markers for these studies as they are codominant and highly polymorphic loci
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. Although these markers are species specific, the increasing accessibility to next-generation sequencing
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup> has enabled the development of SSRs for the so-called orphan, neglected or wild crop relative species (e.g.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>), although sequencing large plant genomes still remains a challenge
