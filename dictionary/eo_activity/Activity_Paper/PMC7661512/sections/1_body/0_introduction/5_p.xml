<p id="Par6">In the past, sustainable harvesting of medicinal plants was regulated through traditional practises such as taboos, restrictions and harvesting tools
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. However, with commercial demand increasing, 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> groves were repeatedly raided by harvesters that often debarked the whole tree, especially mature plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. Severe harvesting resulted in high tree mortality in many areas and in the extinction of many local populations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup> and consequently, 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> is considered threatened throughout its range
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>, and listed as an 
 <italic>Endangered Species</italic> in the IUCN Red List
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. The most extreme case is that of Zimbabwe, where the species is listed as extinct in the wild
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. That resulted in the import of bark supplies in the late 1990s from Mozambique and South Africa
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup> being later trafficked from the same countries
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, in South Africa, 43% of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> bark in the Johannesburg main market originated from Mozambique, with annual traded amounts estimated at 500–1000 kg
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. As a result, populations of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> in Mozambique are currently restricted to fragmented patches in the Lebombo Mountains, Tembe River and Futi Corridor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. According to the Red List classification for Mozambique, this species is considered 
 <italic>Vulnerable VU A2 cd</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup>. Despite this critical situation, only a few studies on the populations dynamics of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> are available; of the 60 research and review papers available in the Web of Science on 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> on 05 February 2020, only seven addressed this topic

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup> while the vast majority are focused on the medicinal applications of this species. Nevertheless, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have been used to solve genetic relationships between 
 <italic>W. ugandensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> and 
 <italic>W. stuhlmanni</italic> showing a high degree of genetic variation among individuals within populations as well as between populations
