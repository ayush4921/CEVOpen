<p id="Par7">In this work, we have developed SSRs markers for 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> to investigate the genetic legacy of exploitation in this slow growing species and to contribute to future re-introduction actions. For that, we have used its best known area of occurrence, Mozambique (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to addressed the following questions: (1) How is genetic diversity distributed within and among individuals across geographical areas?; (2) Is the genetic structure associated with the geographical distribution?; and (3) Is there any evidence of inbreeding or lack of gene flow between populations?
