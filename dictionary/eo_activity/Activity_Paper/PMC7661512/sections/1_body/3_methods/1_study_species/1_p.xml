 </sup>. The flowers are small (&lt; 7 mm in diameter), white to greenish in colour, generally solitary or in tight, few-flowered heads, borne on short, robust stalks in the axils of the leaves from autumn to winter (April–June). Flowers are bisexual, actinomorphic (having symmetrically arranged perianth parts of similar size or shape that are divisible into 3 or more equal halves). Flowers are visited by many insect species, most especially bees. The flowers develop rounded, oval berries (30 mm in diameter), usually dark-green and turning purple during ripening that occurs throughout winter an into early summer (July to December). Dispersion occurs by frugivorous birds that disperse the seeds, although fruits can also drop near the maternal tree. Leaves are glossy and dark green, with a bitter, peppery taste. The stem is covered by a brown bark marked with corky lenticels and is bitter and peppery and is widely used medicinally. The active compounds (drimanes and sesquiterpenoides) are mostly found in the inner part of the stem and root bark.
