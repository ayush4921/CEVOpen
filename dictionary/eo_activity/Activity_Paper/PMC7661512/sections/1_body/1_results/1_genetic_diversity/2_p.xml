<p id="Par9">From the three sampling areas of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> 156 alleles were found in the 48 individuals sampled, being the number of alleles higher in LM than in the other two areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The average Shannonâ€™s diversity index (
 <italic>I</italic>) was also higher in LM than in TR and FC. Observed and expected heterozygosis had similar average values in LM and TR being slightly lower in FC. The polymorphic information content (
 <italic>PIC</italic>) had high average values while inbreeding coefficients (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>IS</italic>
 </sub>) were low and showing negative values in the three sampling areas.
