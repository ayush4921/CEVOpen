 <italic>K</italic> = 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Fig. S1). One cluster was predominantly found across LM and TR areas, while a second one characterized the FC area. Nevertheless, some individuals in this last area showed signs of genetic admixture between the two genetic groups (* indicated in Fig.
