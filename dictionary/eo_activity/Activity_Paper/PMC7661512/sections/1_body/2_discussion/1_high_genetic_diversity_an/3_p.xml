 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> and might also explain the levels of heterozygosis found here. Indeed, the related species 
 <italic>Warburgia ugandensis</italic> has a mixed mating system being predominantly outcrossing

 </sup>. Additionally, insect pollinators of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> such as bees are probably able to travel over the large agricultural blocks separating the three geographical areas studied here, promoting gene flow. Genetic admixture between sites might also be facilitated by frugivorous birds that often eat the berries thereby facilitating the dispersion of seeds. In accordance, we found high levels of genetic admixture between populations with only two genetic clusters being found, one grouping the northern populations and the other one, the southern populations.
