 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> are threatened by fire from slash and burn agriculture, as they occur in adjacent patches or in agricultural lands

 </sup>. Equally, burning of natural vegetation to improve livestock fodder, poaching, and opening of new areas for settlements are also potential threats to the species (e.g.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>
 </sup>). Vegetative propagation of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> is possible through tissue culture
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup> although expensive. This species is being largely cultivated ex situ in South Africa
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>
 </sup> and in small scale in Zimbabwe
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup> and Mozambique (unpublished data), to encourage the sustainable use of the species. Home gardening would also be important for this species although that requires the involvement of local communities and understanding their perceptions towards the conservation of this species.
