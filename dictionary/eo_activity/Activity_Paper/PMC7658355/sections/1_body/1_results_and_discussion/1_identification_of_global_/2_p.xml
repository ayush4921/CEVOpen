 <sub>52</sub>NO
 <sub>7</sub>P) with RT 6.430 min was added to the extracts as two internal standards (L-2-chlorophenylalanine with mass number 200.0478, 0.3 mg/mL; Lyso PC17: 0 with mass number 510.3481, 0.3 mg/mL). Metabolites in Danshen samples were identified according to internal standards and metabolomics databases of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), Lipidmaps (v 2.3) and METLIN by the software of Progenesis QI V2.3. A total of 10,108 substance peaks were detected by UPLC-MS in the samples of SSM and NSSM, among which 4759 metabolites were identified including 2241 metabolites from negative ion model (ESI
 <sup>-</sup>) and 2518 metabolites from positive ion mode (ESI
 <sup>+</sup>), respectively (Fig.
