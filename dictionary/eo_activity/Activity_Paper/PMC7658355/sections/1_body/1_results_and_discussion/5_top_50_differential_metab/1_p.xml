<p id="Par19">Among these 297 differential metabolites, those differential metabolites in top 50 VIP value were collected. Ranking these metabolites by FC calculated from data matrix, it showed that the content of indoleacrylic acid with the highest content by “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” was at 7.54 folds, while the content of psoromic acid was only about 5% compared to NSSM (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). A heatmap was drawn using the top 50 differential metabolites, there’s significant difference between SSM and NSSM materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The conclusion can be reached that there was a marked change in the content of compounds during Danshen
