<p id="Par12">The supervised method, partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) was also applied to investigate the metabolites difference between SSM and NSSM samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The calculated R
 <sup>2</sup> value of PCA and Q value of PLS-DA are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and the values indicated that there was statistically significant difference between SSM and NSSM. The orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA), another supervised method, was used to highlight the quantitative variation in the metabolites between two samples, and good model quality was also shown by the value of R
 <sup>2</sup>X and Q
 <sup>2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The OPLS-DA score of each sample in this figure once again showed that there was significant difference among them (p &lt; 0.5). The cross-validation with 200 permutation tests indicated that this OPLS-DA model was reliable, with intercepts of R
 <sup>2</sup> and Q
 <sup>2</sup> equal to 0.654 and − 0.516, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d).
