<p id="Par11">Unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out on the detected 10,108 substance peaks, QC samples and the two kinds of samples SSM and NSSM were classified into different metabolite profile with a significance of 0.05 by PCA, showing good stability and repeatability of the LC/MS detection (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In order to visualize the metabolites differences between experimental samples and QC samples, and eliminate the effects of quantity on pattern recognition, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and a log10 transformation of peak areas for each metabolite were performed. Samples of SSM, NSSM and QC were merged into independent cluster (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Thus, PCA combined with HCA indicates that samples of SSM and NSSM had remarkably differential metabolic profiles.
