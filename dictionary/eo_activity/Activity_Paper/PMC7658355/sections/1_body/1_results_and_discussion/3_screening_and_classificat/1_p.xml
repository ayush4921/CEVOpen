<p id="Par13">To visualize the result of fold change analysis of 10,108 substance peaks, a volcano plot was drawn by transferring the fold change (FC) value of each substance peak to log2 (FC), and transferring the P value (P = 0.05) of Student’s t test to –log10(P value). Among all of the differential metabolites, upregulated metabolites (SSM compared with NSSM) were symbolized with red dots gathered into a group and downregulated metabolites with blue dots gathered into a group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). As shown in the volcano plot, there were obvious differences in metabolites between the two samples.
