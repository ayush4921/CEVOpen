<p id="Par19">In binding interaction between phytochemical compounds (14) from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> with S protein of the SARS-CoV-2, the docking score ranged from − 7.30 (for andrograpanin) to − 9.10 kcal/mol (for isoandrographolide) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of the 14 compounds, five compounds: isoandrographolide (− 9.10 kcal/mol), 19-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-14-deoxy-11, 12-didehydroandrographolide (− 8.40 kcal/mol), neoandrographolide (− 8.20 kcal/mol) and 5-hydroxy-7, 8, 2′, 5′-tetramethoxy flavone (− 8.20 kcal/mol) shown better binding affinity as compared to remdesivir (− 8.00 kcal/mol). Isoandrographolide has properly positioned into the binding pocket constructed by hydrogen bonding with GLU773 and ARG1019 amino acids of S protein exhibited highest (− 9.10 kcal/mol) binding affinity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Totally, 13 compounds from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> have shown better inhibitory activity against S protein.
