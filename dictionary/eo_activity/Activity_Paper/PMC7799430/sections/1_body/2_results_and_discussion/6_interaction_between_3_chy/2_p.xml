<p id="Par23">The binding affinity of compounds to 3CLpro ranged from − 6.10 kcal/mol (for andrograpanin) to − 9.30 kcal/mol (for geraniin) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Among 21 phytochemicals derived from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>, six compounds, viz. geraniin (− 9.30 kcal/mol), furosin (− 8.70 kcal/mol), corilagin (− 8.70 kcal/mol), quercitrin (− 8.60 kcal/mol), astragalin (− 8.40 kcal/mol) and quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (− 8.20 kcal/mol), have shown better binding affinity as compared to remdesivir (− 7.90 kcal/mol) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The compounds belong to tannins (geraniin, furosin and corilagin) and flavonoids (quercitrin, astragalin and quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside) are found to have good inhibitory action on 3CLpro. Several reports have been shown antiviral effect of flavonoids (Gescher et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>) evaluated 80 flavonoids compounds present in different medicinal plants against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, hesperidin, rutin, diosmin, apiin, diacetylcurcumin, (E)-1-(2-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-[3-[(E)-3-(2-hydroxy-4- methoxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-enyl] phenyl] prop-2-en-1-one and beta, beta'-(4-Methoxy-1,3- phenylene) bis(2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethoxyacrylophenone have shown effective binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro. The flavonoids from the two plant species used in the present study have higher binding affinity to protease similar results were reported by Adem et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Geraniin, with the highest binding affinity of − 9.30 kcal/mol, has formed five hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues, LEU141, GLY143, SER144, CYS145 and THR190 of 3CLpro (Table
