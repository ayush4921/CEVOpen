<p id="Par13">Impact of Covid-19 is having catastrophic effect on human health and life. The scientific communities from the nuke and corner of the world have scrupulously engaged in developing the drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, causal agent of Covid-19. The current study discusses on the potential of phytochemicals present in two medicinal plants used in the Ayurveda, an age old medical practice in India. Plants/herbal extracts part of Ayurveda medicines are known to boost immunity in humans, which is crucial for fighting against microbial enemies (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>). Plant extracts from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> have been extensively used in Ayurveda for curing various human ailments (Niranjan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>; Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). The herbal extracts may have several phytochemicals, few of them might be playing role in neutralizing the pathogens. Binding interaction between a pathogen protein and ligand derived from herbal extracts may result in inhibition of the activity of pathogen protein. Hence, to understand and determine the potency of the plant extracts against cataclysmic virus SARS-CoV-2, about 21 compounds present in 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 14 compounds present in 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> were used for molecular docking simulation with four SARS-CoV-2 receptor targets.
