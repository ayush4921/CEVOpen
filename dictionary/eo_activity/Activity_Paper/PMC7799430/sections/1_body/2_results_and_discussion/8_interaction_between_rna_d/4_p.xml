<p id="Par31">In general, the flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin), a phenylpropanoid (hinkonin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and a bioactive compound (isoandrographolide), diterpenes (14-deoxy-14,15-didehydroandrographolide, 14-Deoxyandrographolide, 19-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-14-deoxy-11,12 didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide) and a flavonoid (5-hydroxy-7,8,2′,5′-tetramethoxy flavone) from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> have shown good binding affinities with all the four SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The natural compounds obtained from the medicinal plants have been used in case of two previous coronavirus outbreaks of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>). Similarly, strong interaction of tannins (polyphenols) from green tea, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate with viral receptor (3CLpro) of SARS-Cov-2 was shown (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The flavonoids and tannins interaction with proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro may provide more insights into exploiting these compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibiting compounds and lead to novel drug development. Further, among all the phytochemicals, the geraniin has shown consistent interaction and very good binding affinity with all the viral protein receptors. The geraniin, extracted from 
 <italic>P. amarus,</italic> has shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in HeLa CD4 + cells with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 0.9 to 7.6 μg/ml (Notka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2004</xref>). This suggests that geraniin with multiple target binding abilities in docking analysis with high dock score than remdesivir can be a potential candidate to harness as anti SARS-CoV-2 drug. However, this needs in vitro evaluation to authenticate the prediction studies.
