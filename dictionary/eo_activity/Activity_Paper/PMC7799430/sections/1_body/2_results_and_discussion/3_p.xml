<p id="Par15">In the recent clinical trials, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue of adenosine triphosphate has been reported to be a potential prodrug against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Gao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>). It was originally developed for treating viral infection caused by Ebola and Marburg virus but was also found effective against SARS and MERS (Elfiky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Hence, remdesivir has been used as a positive control in the current study. During virus replication, the RdRp mistakenly incorporates remdesivir into its genome, which results in stalling of replication (Wang et al. 2020). In our study, remdesivir has shown good interaction with RdRp protein (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with the binding affinity of − 7.6 kcal/mol. Similarly, it has shown a good binding affinity with 3CLpro (− 7.90 kcal/mol), S protein (− 8.00 kcal/mol) and PLpro (− 9.50 kcal/mol) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and might be having some role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Many recent computational investigations also showed inhibition activity of remdesivir with various viral receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (Elfiky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>; Hall and Feng 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; Murugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>). This shows that the prodrug might be effective against all the four viral receptors.
