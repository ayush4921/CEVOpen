<p id="Par3">The SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus, belongs to family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> of order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). It has enveloped positive sense single-stranded RNA genome with 33 kilo base (Kb) encoding for 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fehr and Perlman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>; Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 lacks the hemagglutinin-esterase gene. However, it comprises two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) at 5′ end and 3′ with 265 and 358 nucleotides, respectively. The first ORF comprises approximately 67 percent of the genome and encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), which were processed by proteolytic cleavage, whereas the remaining 13 ORFs encode for structural proteins and protein accessory (Boopathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). The nsps mainly include helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro) and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2005</xref>; Boopathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Four major structural proteins are spike surface glycoprotein (S protein), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and envelope (E). M protein possess N-terminal glycosylated ectodomain at the N-terminal end that consists of three transmembrane domains (TM) and a long C-terminal CT domain (Boopathi et al. 2020; Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). The M and E proteins are required for virus morphogenesis, assembly and budding, whereas S protein is a fusion viral protein comprising two subunits S1 and S2. The S1 subunit consists of receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and signal peptide. The S2 subunit comprises two heptad repeat regions known as HR-N and HR-C, which form the coiled-coil structures surrounded by the protein ectodomain (Walls et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2020</xref>). A furin cleavage site (PRRARS’V) is present in S protein at the interface between S1 and S2 subunits that will be processed during the biogenesis (Coutard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 S protein facilitates the entry of viral particles into the host cell after binding with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Tortorici and Veesler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>) and also determines the host range and cellular tropism (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2005</xref>). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mediated by the cleavage of viral spike protein by host proteases, viz. serine proteases (TMPRSS2) or cysteine proteases (Cathepsin B/L) (Boopathi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Yan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>). The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are prime targets of the coronavirus (Matsuyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2010</xref>; Glowacka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>; Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2020</xref>).
