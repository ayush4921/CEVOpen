<p>All plant components (
 <xref rid="T1 T2 T3" ref-type="table">Tables 1â€“3</xref>) were dried and grounded to obtain a fine powder. About 1 g of each dried powder was infused using 40 ml of boiled water. Aqueous extracts were chosen based on traditional use and prior studies of plants selected. The infusion was left for 15 min before being filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper. After that, the filtrates were dried under a vacuum (Savant Speedvac; New York, U.S.A.) to produce plant extract that was used to perform DPP-IV inhibitory experiments. For this purpose, the dried extract was dissolved in a 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer at an initial concentration of 5 mg/ml.
