<p>Sitagliptin and vildagliptin significantly reduced DPP-IV activity in high-fat fed rats (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A–D). Hot water extracts (250 mg/5 ml/kg) of 
 <italic>A. latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> also significantly decreased 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> DPP-IV enzyme activity compared with glucose alone (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05–0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A–D). The effects of 
 <italic>A. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> were particularly prominent with a sustained inhibition of DPP-IV activity from 30 min onwards (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05–0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A,C). Lesser but still significant effects were observed with 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> and 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> extracts (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B,D). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, active GLP-1 (7-36) concentrations in plasma were significantly increased by 32–45% (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05–0.01) at 60 min after administration of each plant extract. An 81–89% increase was observed with sitagliptin and vidagliptin (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
