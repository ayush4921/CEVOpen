<p>Although the present study describes DPP-IV lowering activity of many medicinal plants with anti-diabetic actions, few precise details are known about the nature of the phytochemicals that are absorbed and subsequently inhibit DPP-IV. All 22 plants examined inhibited DPP-IV activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to some extent suggesting that such chemicals are commonly encountered in the plant kingdom. Studies to date suggest that these include alkaloids, glycosides, terpenoids, phenolic, flavonoids as well as protein hydrolysates and peptides [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These may act at the molecular level by binding to the active site of the enzyme, thereby inhibiting interactions with natural substrates. Small peptides may also serve as competitive substrates as is the case with diprotin-A. Indeed, we demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory action for caffeine, catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, isoquercitrin, quercetin and rutin which may realistically contribute to the observed effects as they have been reported to be present in plants at levels of up to 2â€“30% by weight, not accounting for losses during our extraction procedure [

Rutin is the most abundant of these phytochemicals and was also shown to be the most effective inhibitor of DPP-IV, with an action broadly similar to that observed with the established anti-diabetic drug, nateglinide. The active plant constituents might, like this meglitinide, serve as effective prandial blood glucose regulators stemming partly from their ability to preserve active forms of GLP-1 and GIP released by feeding [
