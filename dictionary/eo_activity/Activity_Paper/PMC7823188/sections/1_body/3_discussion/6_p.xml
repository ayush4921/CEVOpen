<p>In the light of the DPP-IV inhibitory actions of the 22 plants tested plus the selected phytochemicals, it is notable that flavonoids and their metabolites have been reported to exhibit anti-diabetic activities. An inverse relationship has been suggested also between flavonoid intake and T2DM risk [

 <italic>Lens culinaris</italic> extracts have been shown also to exhibit DPP-IV inhibitory activity [

 <italic>A. catechu, M. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic>) have been reported to contain potential phenolic compounds that exert antioxidant effects and DPP-IV inhibitory activity [
