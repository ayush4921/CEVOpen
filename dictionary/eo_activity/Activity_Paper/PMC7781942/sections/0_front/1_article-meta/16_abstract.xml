  <italic>Annona muricata</italic> L. (
  <italic>A. muricata</italic>) is an important tropical fruit and medicinal plant. It is one of the easily found plants used traditionally in treating cancer. In many tropical countries, especially in Southeast Asia, 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> is popular for its edible fruit and medicinal merits. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. The chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic> was found to be a double strand ring structure with the size of 196,038 bp that consists of four regions: a large single-copy region of 75,339 bp, a small single-copy region of 3105 bp, and two inverted repeat regions of 58,797 bp. The GC content of the whole chloroplast genome was 39.92%. It was found that 111 protein-coding genes, one Pseudogene, 38 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes were annotated in the chloroplast genome, and the total number of genes was 158. DNA sequences of the chloroplast genomes of 19 species which belonged to three families of Magnoliales order were analyzed and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The result indicated that 
  <italic>A. muricata</italic>, 
  <italic>Annona cherimola</italic>, 
  <italic>Uvaria macrophylla</italic>, 
  <italic>Greenwayodendron suaveolens,</italic> and 
  <italic>Chieniodendron hainanense</italic> had a close phylogenetic relationship. The findings also provided abundant basic data for the genomics study of 
  <italic>A. muricata.</italic>
