<p>The same as other plants, the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> was found to be double stranded ring structure with the size of 196,038 bp and consist of four regions: a large single-copy region (LSC, 75,339 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC, 3,105 bp), and two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb, 58,797 bp). Compared to the chloroplast genomes of other plants, the 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>'s IR region was found to be large and the SSC region was small. The GC contents of LSC, SSC and IR regions of the chloroplast genome were 38.84%, 45.07% and 40.73%, respectively. The GC content of the whole chloroplast genome was 39.92%. The whole chloroplast genome composed of 59,091 A bases (30.14%), 58,697 T bases (29.94%), 39,673 G bases (20.24%), and 38,577 C bases (19.68%). There were 111 protein-coding genes (PCGs), one Pseudogene, 38 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes that were annotated in the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>. The total number of genes was 158. Among the 111 protein-coding genes, 
 <italic>ycf2</italic> was the largest gene with the size of 7,518 bp and 
 <italic>petN</italic> gene was the smallest with the size of 90 bp.
