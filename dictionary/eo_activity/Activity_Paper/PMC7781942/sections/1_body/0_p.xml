 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> L. is an important tropical fruits that contributes to the economic growth of some tropical countries that include tropical America, Australia, Africa and Malaysia (Cheong et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It belongs to the family Annonaceae, which is commonly known as Soursop, Graviola and Guanabana (Soheil et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition to being a fruit tree, 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> also has medicinal properties and has been traditionally used to treat cancer (Minari and Okeke 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The compounds isolated from the seeds and the leaves of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> showed significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity toward the human hepatoma cell lines (Liaw et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Chang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Besides, the leaf decoction is usually administered to lessen the symptoms of cancer (Mao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> also has many other medicinal effects. The phytochemical complexity of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> extracts may offer health-promoting benefits including chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects (Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Animal experiments have stated that the ethanol extract from the stem bark of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> significantly inhibited cold immobilization stress-induced increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver and brain of albino rats (Padma et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The aqueous extract has been found to protect the pancreatic β-cells against streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Florence et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
