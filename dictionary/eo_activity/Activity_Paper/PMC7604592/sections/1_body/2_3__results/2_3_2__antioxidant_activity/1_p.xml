<p>The radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> fractions is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the ABTS test, 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> displayed a remarkable capacity to scavenge free radicals at various concentrations. It was found that SGCF had the highest antioxidant content at a concentration of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL with a value of 76.7 and 74.1% in DPPH and ABTS, respectively. In addition, the remaining fractions also showed variable antioxidant activities in both tests (
