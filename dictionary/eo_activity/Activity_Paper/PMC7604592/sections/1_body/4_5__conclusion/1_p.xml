<p>The present study determined the total phenolic contents of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> found in Saudi Arabia. In accordance with a recent study, our data indicate that 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> are a good potential source of natural antioxidants, such as GA and VA. The chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> (SGCF) exhibited the highest antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, which was positively correlated with their phenolic profile. The HPLC method we developed was approved and used to determine the GA and VA content in 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic>. It can be concluded that the combination of these two bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> is crucial for the plants' antioxidant and cytotoxic activities which confirm their beneficial effect on human health. Thus, the findings of this study encourage further research in order to fully elucidate the bioactive constituents of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic>, which may lead to the discovery of novel and effective drugs against degenerative diseases.
