<p>The analysis was carried out by Shimadzu chromatographic system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with binary solvent delivery units (LC-10AD Prominence liquid chromatography pumps), Prominence UV/Vis detector (SPD-20A), and a system controller (CBM-20A Prominence Communication Bus Module) with LC solution software. Chromatographic analyses were performed on Shim-pack VP-ODS C18 reversed-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase was acetonitrile–water–acetic acid (20 : 80 : 1) and increasing up to acetonitrile–water–acetic acid (80 : 20 : 1) in 30 minutes. Chromatographic operations were carried out at a constant flow rate (1 ml/min) and ambient temperature. Detection was performed at 277 nm according to the ultraviolet (UV) absorption maxima of the two analytes.
