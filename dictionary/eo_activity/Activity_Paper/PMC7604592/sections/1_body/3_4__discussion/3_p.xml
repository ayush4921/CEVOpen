<p>Our results show that 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> extracts had promising cytotoxic activity. We found that 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> extracts decreased the viability of various cancer cells. Data from the literature on the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> are still scarce. A new study by Ramadan et al. (2020) showed that 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> essential oils exerted cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Phenolic compounds, including GA and VA, are among the best candidates for mediating anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is apparent that phenolic contents determined by colorimetric standard methods do not give the exact quantity of the phenolic compounds found in plant extracts. Therefore, chromatographic methods, such as HPLC, play an important role in the isolation and quantification of phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our study showed that GA and VA were abundant compounds in SGCF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results are in agreement with Mohamed (2015), who detected the presence of GA, VA, and several other phenolic compounds from the roots of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> found in Egypt. Overall, these results demonstrate that the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> were likely due to the combination of phenolic acids found in these species.
