 <italic>Senecio glaucus</italic> is one of the most important species from the 
 <italic>Senecio</italic> genus. It is an annual herbaceous plant. The presence of bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic>, such as phenolics, saponins, flavonoids, and tannins, as well as some volatile essential oils, has been reported [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> reportedly exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against colon carcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As part of our systematic investigation of various plant species scattered in Saudi Arabia, we aimed to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic>. In addition, we also aimed to quantitatively estimate the presence of total phenolics and some phenolic acids, such as gallic acid (GA) and vanillic acid (VA).
