<p>The acute dermal toxicity testing was carried out based on the methods described in the OECD draft guideline number 434.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Ten albino female rats (Rattus albus) (weight= 200–300 g, age= 8–12 weeks) were used. In considering the most appropriate sex, females are generally slightly more sensitive to acute oral toxicity as well as dermal toxicity than males.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref> Rats were divided into two groups of five animals in each group (test and control groups). Animals that show normal skin texture were housed individually in a cage and acclimatized to the laboratory condition for 1 week prior to the test. Following acclimation, 10% of the body surface area fur was shaved 24 hours before the study on the dorsal area of the trunk of the test animals. A limit test dose of 2,000 mg/kg of the 10% w/w of the crude extract formulation was applied evenly over the shaved area for 24 hours. Initially, a sighting (pilot) study was conducted with one animal for the first 24 hours. The purpose of the sighting study is to check whether the larger dose selected is toxic or not for the main study. The remaining four rats were tested on the following day having obtained the information about safety in the sighting study. Observations for any signs of adverse skin reactions, inflammation, or edema were made for 24 hours with special attention within the first 4 hours. Regarding scoring of the skin irritation, normally we followed the Draize scoring criteria for erythema and edema. However, none of them were showing clear signs and symptoms of toxicity when the animals were followed up daily for 14 days.
