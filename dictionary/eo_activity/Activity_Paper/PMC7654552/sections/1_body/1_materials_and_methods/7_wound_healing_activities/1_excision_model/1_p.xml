<p>Mice were anesthetized by injecting ketamine (1 mL/kg) and diazepam (1 mL/kg) subcutaneously and then the back fur of the animals was removed. Approximately 300 mm
 <sup>2</sup> circular marks were prepared using a permanent marker. Then, the full thickness of this circular mark was excised at nearly the same anatomical site using forceps and sharp sterilized surgical blades to form a wound (

Application of the preparations was continued daily until complete wound healing was seen in the test groups. Wound healing parameters such as wound contraction and the period of epithelialization were determined. The epithelialization period is the total number of days required for the wound scabs to fall off without leaving a raw wound since the first day of wound creation.

Then, the traced area for each mouse was calculated by using scaled paper (graph paper), each small square representing 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. The percentage of wound contraction was determined as follows.
