<p>Then, the hydromethanolic extract was successively fractionated using different solvents having varied polarity index (chloroform, ethyl acetate, and distilled water). The crude extract (60 g) was mixed with 200 mL distilled water in a separatory funnel and an equivalent amount of chloroform was added and shaken. After a distinct layer was formed in a mixture, the chloroform fraction was separated. This procedure was repeated three times to find the chloroform fraction. Then the aqueous residue was mixed with equivalent volume of ethyl acetate and separated. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions were evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) and dried in an oven under 40°C, while the aqueous fraction was dried in a freeze drier. The dried fractions were placed in a tight container at −4°C until used for the actual experiment.</p>
