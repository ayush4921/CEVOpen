<p>The present study investigated that topical ointments of the 80% methanol extract at both dose levels and the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds showed considerable wound healing activity as evidenced by the significant increase in wound contraction and tensile strength, and a shorter period of epithelialization as compared to the negative control. The study also indicated that both the crude extract and solvent fractions possess anti-oxidant effects at varying degrees. The aqueous fraction has better wound healing as well as anti-oxidant activity among other fractions. Hence, the present study highlighted the potential wound healing as well as anti-oxidant activities of the plant and justified the traditional use of the plant for the treatment of wounds.
