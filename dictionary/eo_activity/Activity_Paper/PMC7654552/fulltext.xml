Female adult rats were used since female rats are more susceptible to chemical toxicity. The animals were placed in cages under standard conditions with 12 hours light and dark cycles. They were provided with a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum throughout the experiment and acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 1 week before the experiment.

Then, the extract was filtered by gauze (muslin) and re-filtered using Whatman No 1 filter paper. The marc was re-macerated twice in the same manner. Then, the filtrates were combined and evaporated on a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) under reduced pressure and dried in an oven at 40&#x000b0;C (Gallenkamp, UK). The extract was put in a refrigerator until used for further activities.</p><p>Then, the hydromethanolic extract was successively fractionated using different solvents having varied polarity index (chloroform, ethyl acetate, and distilled water). The crude extract (60 g) was mixed with 200 mL distilled water in a separatory funnel and an equivalent amount of chloroform was added and shaken. After a distinct layer was formed in a mixture, the chloroform fraction was separated. This procedure was repeated three times to find the chloroform fraction. Then the aqueous residue was mixed with equivalent volume of ethyl acetate and separated. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions were evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rota Vapor R-200) and dried in an oven under 40&#x000b0;C, while the aqueous fraction was dried in a freeze drier.

Animals that show normal skin texture were housed individually in a cage and acclimatized to the laboratory condition for 1 week prior to the test. Following acclimation, 10% of the body surface area fur was shaved 24 hours before the study on the dorsal area of the trunk of the test animals. A limit test dose of 2,000 mg/kg of the 10% w/w of the crude extract formulation was applied evenly over the shaved area for 24 hours. Initially, a sighting (pilot) study was conducted with one animal for the first 24 hours. The purpose of the sighting study is to check whether the larger dose selected is toxic or not for the main study. The remaining four rats were tested on the following day having obtained the information about safety in the sighting study. Observations for any signs of adverse skin reactions, inflammation, or edema were made for 24 hours with special attention within the first 4 hours. Regarding scoring of the skin irritation, normally we followed the Draize scoring criteria for erythema and edema. However, none of them were showing clear signs and symptoms of toxicity when the animals were followed up daily for 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2007"><title>Wound Healing Activities</title><sec id="s0002-s2007-s3001"><title>Excision Model</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by injecting ketamine (1 mL/kg) and diazepam (1 mL/kg) subcutaneously and then the back fur of the animals was removed.

One of the forceps served as a support and the other forceps holed a plastic of volume 1,000 mL (plastic bottle). Then, both forceps were allowed to grip the edges of the wound 3 mm away on both sides. After this, constant water flow was allowed to enter the plastic bottle which was suspended with the string that passed on the wheel until the wound opened up (broken). The flowing water was stopped immediately as the wound breaks in each mouse.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Traditionally, different medicinal plants have been used for many years as topical preparations to promote wound healing. The beneficial traits of plant extracts used to treat wound healing are to produce minimal pain, and reduced scarring to the patient.<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Therefore, the studied plant was evaluated for its anti-oxidant and wound healing activities.</p><p>The crude extract and fractions produced good anti-oxidant activities in this study. Higher free radical scavenging activity (89.57%) was observed in the aqueous fraction, and lowest effect (70.32%) was observed in the chloroform fraction. But the percentage of inhibition of ascorbic acid was found to be 96.07%.</p><p>The results of the present study indicated that the crude extract and the solvent fractions significantly increased wound healing effects with both 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract ointment treated groups at varying degrees both in the excision and incision models. The enhanced wound contraction and shorter period of epithelialization induced by the crude extract as well as fractions of <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds might be associated with increased collagen synthesis and facilitate proliferation of epithelial cells, which might be ascribed to its potent antioxidant activity as revealed in the present study. This fact can be further supported by a study reporting that the leaves of <italic>B. carinata</italic> have antigenotoxic and deoxyribo nucleic acid (DNA) damage protective effects.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Protection of macromolecules like DNA, proteins, and lipids can be achieved through scavenging excess free radicals released as a result of oxidative stress that can be induced by a variety of environmental and chemical factors and natural radiation.<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>In the excision model, the 10% (w/w) extract ointment treated group showed significant wound area contraction from day 6 to day 16, whereas the 5% (w/w) extract ointment treated group showed significant wound area contraction beginning from the 8th day on wards. Besides, the epithelialization period was significantly reduced from 20 days (negative control) to 16 days (5% w/w extract) and 14 days (10% w/w extract). Hence, a faster rate of wound contraction and shorter period of epithelialization of the extract ointments may be due to the synergistic effects of different secondary metabolites present in the plant. This finding is strengthened by previous reports of a review on health promoting bioactive phytochemicals from <italic>Brassica genus</italic> viz <italic>B. nigra</italic>, <italic>B. juncea</italic>, <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, and <italic>B. rapa</italic> showed that high content of poly phenols and flavonoids are found in the seeds, and these phytochemicals contribute to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property. Particularly, sinapic acid, an isolated phenolic compound and kaempferol and quercetin, the flavonoids isolated from Brassica vegetables were reported to have anti-oxidant activity.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Furthermore, Brassinosteroids, a group of steroidal substance, found in brassica species are plant growth hormones involved in cell growth, division, and differentiation. Topical application of brassinosteroid significantly reduced wound size and accelerated wound healing in treated animals in the mouse model of cutaneous wound healing.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Moreover, sinigrin, a major glucosinolate isolated from the Brassica species including <italic>B.carinata</italic>, was studied for a number of activities such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, and wound healing effects.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>A better wound healing effect of the crude extract was further evidenced by the tensile strength in incision wounds. In this model, there was a significant increase in wound breaking strength (tensile strength) in 10% extract, 5% extract ointments, and the standard drug as compared to the negative control. This fact is evidenced by the antigenotoxic effects of <italic>B. carinata</italic> and its protection of DNA damage that can be caused by oxidative stress. Further, the present finding can be supported by published literature stated that <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. <italic>capitata</italic> showed maturation of the extracellular matrix in skin wounds of wistar rats as evidenced by significant levels of total collagen and glycosaminoglycans found to occur starting from the 8th day compared to negative control. The tensile strength indicates how much the repaired tissue resists to breaking under tension, which is related to an increase in collagen synthesis and maturation, formation of stable intra and intermolecular cross-link, matrix deposition, and cell migration, and may indicate the quality of repaired tissue.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>In excision wound model, despite all fractions showed varying degrees of wound area contraction compared to the negative control at both dose levels, better activity was observed for 10%w/w aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions, as shown in <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among all fractions, aqueous 10% w/w fraction showed better wound healing activity. This finding may indicate the phytochemicals responsible for wound healing activity are largely polar compounds and are found in large amount in the aqueous fraction. Phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and glucosinolates that are found in Brassica species, and which were explained for their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity, are usually polar and highly soluble in water because the naturally occurring glycosides sugar moieties elevate their hydrophilicity.<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Therefore, these compounds may contribute to facilitate wound healing in aqueous fraction and ethyl acetate fractions as well.</p><p>On the other hand, significant wound closure of chloroform fraction was seen starting from the 8th day compared to negative control, which may account for the presence of non-polar substances such as fatty acids, as indicated in the oils of other mustard seeds. Chemical analysis of <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> (L.) in the previous study demonstrated the presence of a significant amount of unsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid (18.2%), linoleic acid (16.9%), erucic acid (42.0%), eicosenoic acid (8.8%), and others, which all contribute to anti-oxidant and wound healing effects.<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Besides, the current phytochemical screening of chloroform fraction revealed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, alkaloids, and steroids, despite the type and content being unknown yet. Hence, these chemicals may produce a combined effect of wound healing.</p><p>Generally, from the findings of the present study, it is therefore plausible to assume that the 80% methanol extract and solvent fractions of <italic>B.carinata</italic> seeds constituted secondary metabolites that contribute to promote wound healing either individually or synergistically, justified by the traditional claims of the plant for use in the treatment of wounds.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study investigated that topical ointments of the 80% methanol extract at both dose levels and the solvent fractions of <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds showed considerable wound healing activity as evidenced by the significant increase in wound contraction and tensile strength, and a shorter period of epithelialization as compared to the negative control. The study also indicated that both the crude extract and solvent fractions possess anti-oxidant effects at varying degrees. The aqueous fraction has better wound healing as well as anti-oxidant activity among other fractions. Hence, the present study highlighted the potential wound healing as well as anti-oxidant activities of the plant and justified the traditional use of the plant for the treatment of wounds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank University of Gondar for the financial support extended to complete the research work.</p></ack><sec id="s0006"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA, one way analysis of variance; DPPH, 2, 2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate; OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; SEM, standard error of the mean; SPSS, Statistical Package for Social Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and are also available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate</title><p>All the experiments were conducted in accordance with a guide for the care and use of laboratory animals: Eighth Edition by National Research Council, Division on Earth and Life Studies, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
