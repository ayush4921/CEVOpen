  <p>Schematic overview of SE in 
   <italic>Centaurium erythraea</italic>. Left panel: Both leaves and roots of the in vitro grown 
   <italic>C. erythraea</italic> plants can serve as sources of explants for the induction of SE. Hairy root cultures can also be used as explants. Upper panel: SE can be induced from leaf explants on the inductive medium containing 2,4-D and CPPU, both in the light and in darkness. Somatic embryos form from differentiated somatic cells in the subepidermal layer of the leaf explant. In this case, SE is indirect and proceeds via the callusing phase. Middle panel: The obtained somatic embryos can be further used as explants for secondary or cyclic embryogenesis [
   <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Lower panel: SE from root or hairy root explants is spontaneous, on Â½MS medium and direct. SE starts with asymmetric divisions of single totipotent cells from the epidermal or subepidermal layers of root explant. Successive divisions give rise to somatic embryos.
