<p>While the initiation of embryogenic tissues depends on the developmental stage of the used initial plant material and components of the nutrient medium, the sustention of the embryogenic potential during subsequent cultivation requires the simultaneous activity of signaling and genetic pathways. Identification of proteins and genes involved in the control of the embryogenic potential of the plant cells represents one of the most efficient ways for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SE. These molecules, so-called SE markers, can allow the identification of the cells with embryogenic potential in the tissue culture before visible morphological changes. Several proteins isolated during SE are stress-related or pathogen-related proteins. These proteins were isolated from different plants during stress treatments of plant tissue culture imposed by wounding, desiccation, heavy metals, or PGRs [

The largest number of extracellular proteins are glycoproteins, of which arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are especially important during SE. The current review covers several aspects of SE, including the influence of explant type and culture conditions (PGRs and light conditions), as well as the roles of antioxidative enzymes and AGPs, investigated in a medicinal plant
