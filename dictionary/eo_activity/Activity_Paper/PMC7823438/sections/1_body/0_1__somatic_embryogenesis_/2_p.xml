<p>Somatic embryos can develop from a wide range of differentiated cell types, such as ovule, embryo, root, leaf, and meristem cells, in response to different exogenous and/or endogenous factors [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The presence and level of endogenous factors (phytohormones) determine whether SE can occur spontaneously, on a hormone-free medium, or must be induced by the addition of plant growth regulators (PGRs). SE can be direct (DSE), without an intermediate callusing phase, or indirect (ISE), which implies the formation of disorganized callus tissue [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Somatic embryos developed through DSE or ISE may be of uni- or multicellular origin [
