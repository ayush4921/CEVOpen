<p>The morphogenesis from the root explants was studied using LM2, JIM13, JIM15, JIM16, and MAC207 mAbs, of which the expression of JIM13-reactive epitope was not detected at all [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The JIM16 epitopes were localized in all cells of the root explants, especially in the endodermis and the central cylinder, as well as in the newly formed meristematic centers, so they were considered as markers of organogenesis, not somatic embryogenesis. The remaining three mAbs reacted with the epitopes present in somatic embryos. LM2 epitopes were widely distributed in root cross-sections at the beginning of the culture, but after 4 weeks in culture, the LM2 signal was more localized in epidermal cells and newly formed globular somatic embryos [

 <xref rid="B99-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], where this epitope was foundin the surface cell layer surrounding somatic embryos; however, in this system, JIM13 and JIM16 mAbs were also expressed. MAC207 epitope had strong expression in protodermal cells of the embryos, as well as at the surface of epidermal cells of root explants adjacent to globular somatic embryos, with a strong signal in the extracellular matrix. Finally, the JIM15 epitope was reactive with AGPs in developed somatic embryos, as well as in the cells of the vascular elements of the root explants [
