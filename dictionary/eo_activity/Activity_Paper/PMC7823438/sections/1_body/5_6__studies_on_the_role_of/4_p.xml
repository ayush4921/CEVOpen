<p>To study the role of AGPs during morphogenesis in vitro, βGlcY can be applied as an adjuvant to the culture medium [

 <xref rid="B109-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. As expected, the addition of βGlcY to the inductive medium during the induction of ISE from centaury leaf explants in darkness reduced the number of developed somatic embryos per explant in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The concentration of 150 µM βGlcY almost completely inhibited ISE, whereas, at lower concentrations, the embryos developed only in the explants’ regions that were not in direct contact with the βGlcY-containing medium (
