<p>The first successful induction of SE in centaury was obtained in a cell suspension derived from callus cultures [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The calli were initiated from roots and shoots of seedlings on medium supplemented with kinetin (KIN, 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M) and auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M) or 2,4-D (10
 <sup>−6</sup> M). In contrast to 2,4-D, IAA showed a stimulatory effect on SE induction from the cell suspension, but light was the main embryogenesis-inducing factor in this system.
