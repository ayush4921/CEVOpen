<p>Wounding of the centaury leaves (cutting the leaves into explants) caused an increase in SOD activity (comprising 3 Cu/Zn-SOD isoforms), an increase in CAT activity (comprising 3 major activity bands), as well as a decrease in total POX activity [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], indicating that SOD and CAT are involved in the protection of centaury leaves from wounding-induced oxidative damage. Wounding leads to an accumulation of ROS in 
 <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> leaf explants, which occurs within seconds [

 <xref rid="B86-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] showed that mechanical injury of 
 <italic>Mesembryanthemum cristallinum</italic> leaves leads to H

 <sub>2</sub> accumulation, which was accompanied by an increase in total SOD activity and a decrease in CAT activity. Decreased POX activity in response to wounding, recorded in centaury leaves, is consistent with low POX activity in freshly isolated leaf explants of 
 <italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mechanical wounding is an inevitable consequence of in vitro manipulations. Wound signaling triggers not only defense responses, such as the production of ROS but also healing responses, including dedifferentiation, cell cycle reactivation, and vascular regeneration [
