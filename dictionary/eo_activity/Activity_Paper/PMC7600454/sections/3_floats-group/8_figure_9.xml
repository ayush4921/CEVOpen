  <p>Surtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression, as shown in a representative Western blot (
   <bold>a</bold>). Normalized values of SIRT1 and GAPDH against β-actin ((
   <bold>b</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>))
   <bold>.</bold> The mean ± SD values of normalized SIRT1 and GAPDH expression were obtained from three independent experiments, * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. control; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. 100 mM glucose alone. For SIRT1, 
   <italic>p</italic> values were 0.005, 0.011 and 0.005 for CHP, CHL and GA, respectively. For GAPDH, 
   <italic>p</italic> values were 0.001, 0.001 and 0.008 for CHP, CHL and GA, respectively.
