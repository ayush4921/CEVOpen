 <caption>
  <p>The proposed diagram of pharmacokinetics for evaluating of active phytochemicals of CH extracts. After chemical constituents are absorbed by gastrointestinal tract, they are delivered to liver, where they are biotransformed and delivered into blood. Chemical constituents are biodistributed to other peripheral organs by blood stream. Absorbed chemical constituents are excreted through the urine but certain chemical constituents that are not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract will be eliminated through feces. Absorption rate constant (
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>a</sub>); Constant elimination (
   <italic>K</italic>
   <sub>el</sub>); Volume of distribution (
   <italic>V</italic>
   <sub>D</sub>).
