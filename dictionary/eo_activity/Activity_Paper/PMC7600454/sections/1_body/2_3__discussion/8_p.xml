<p>The Western blot results demonstrated that high glucose significantly increased cyclin D1, pRb and pcdc2. Increased cyclin D1 could induce phosphorylation of Rb (

Although the pRb/E2F complex permits cell progression in the G1 and S phase, in hyperglycemia, hyperphosphorylation of Rb-induced high glucose and cyclin D1 caused cell cycle arrest at G1. Many studies have indicated that hyperphosphorylated Rb failed to assemble E2F [
