<p>Furthermore, we hypothesized that SIRT1 would up-regulate through the phosphorylation of GAPDH. GAPDH and SIRT1 expression, when treated with either CHP or CHL, confirmed that both extracts could reduce the glucose level in cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-f010">Figure 10</xref>b showed the underlying mechanisms of both extracts. Low cellular glucose significantly increased the phosphorylation of GAPDH and SIRT1 expression. When cellular glucose decreased, GAPDH became a critical enzyme and was phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus triggering SIRT1 activation. This process was necessary to protect cells from glucose starvation, such as autophagy and gluconeogenesis [
