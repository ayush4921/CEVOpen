<p>Cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were co-treated for 24 h. The next day, protein extraction was carried out using 1 mM of PMSF in a NP-40 lysis buffer. Total protein (40 μg) was mixed with a 2× Laemmli buffer (ratio 1:1) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Protein was separated with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (cyclin D1 (1:2000), pRb (1:2000), pcdc2 (1:2000), SIRT 1 (1:2000), GAPDH (1:10,000) and β actin (1:2000)) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, membranes were washed 3 times with 1× TBS-Tween 20 (TBST) for 15 min, incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody) for 45 min at RT and washed 3 times with TBST for 15 min. Protein bands were visualized by adding an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent using autoradiography films and Kodak processing chemicals. Each band was normalized against β actin as an internal control.</p>
