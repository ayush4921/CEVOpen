<p>Hyperglycemia is a key characteristic and risk factor that triggers neuronal damage, leads to encephalopathy and causes the development of Diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated neurodegenerative diseases through the induction of neuronal senescence [

 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The incidence of most neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), has been shown to increase exponentially with advancing hyperglycemia and neuronal senescence. Hyperglycemia results in damage of brain structure and is closely related with the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, thus increasing amyloid beta accumulation [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00283" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hyperglycemia can cause neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest is an important process associated with neuronal senescence. In replicatively senescent cells, the cell cycle is arrested at the G1 and/or G2 phase [
