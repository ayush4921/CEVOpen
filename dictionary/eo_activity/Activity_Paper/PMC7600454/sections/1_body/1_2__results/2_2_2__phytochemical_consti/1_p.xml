<p>The extraction yields of CHP and CHL were 14.17% and 13.04%, respectively. Gas chromatographâ€“mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis showed the presence of different phytochemical compounds in both extracts. All peaks in both CHP and CHL extracts were detected and compared the MS data with databases to identify chromatographic peaks. GC-MS chromatograms of CHP and CHL were shown in
