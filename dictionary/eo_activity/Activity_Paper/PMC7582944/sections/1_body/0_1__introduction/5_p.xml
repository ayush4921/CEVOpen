<p>Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with MS/MS facilitates the characterization of various compounds based on the molecular formula, exact mass, and fragmentation pattern [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS was used for the qualitative identification of the main constituents in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. crocea, I. germanica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. spuria</italic> from Kashmir (India) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This method showed high sensitivity and allowed the identification of substances present in the raw materials in minor quantities. Sajad et al. developed an HPLC-UV-DBP method for the rapid identification and quantification of tectorigenin in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. growing in Kashmir [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The quantitative determination of tectorigenin indicated its presence in 1.08% to 8.84%. In another study, HPLC–DAD–CL and HPLC–ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS were used for the identification of xanthones, isoflavonoid glycosides, and their aglycones, flavones, and other phenolic compounds in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Belamcanda chinensis</italic> (
 <italic>I. domestica</italic>), 
 <italic>I. tectorum</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> grown in China [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, most of these methods allowed the qualitative or quantitative determination of one or a few compounds but failed to present the full metabolic profile of the plants of interest.
