<p>In the last few years, several groups have used HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS
 <sup>n</sup> for the identification of the metabolic profile of several medicinal plants [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This method was used by Wei et al. for the identification of known isoflavones in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. tectorum</italic> and 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> grown in China. HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS
 <sup>n</sup> can simultaneously provide UV and mass spectra, necessary for the identification of known components by comparing the chromatographic data of authentic compounds to the on-line detected chromatograms of the target compounds. It provided fragmentation pathways of the known compounds that can assist in elucidating the unknown structures based on the tandem mass [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Currently, HPLC coupled with several detectors is the optimal chromatographic method for the quick, simple, and quantitative identification of secondary metabolites in plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our previous phytochemical investigations on 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. resulted in the isolation of flavones, isoflavones, xanthones, hydroxycinnamic acids, and coumarins by column chromatography. However, the qualitative and quantitative determination of phenolic compounds in certain 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. using HPLC was never carried before. Thus, this study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the phenolic compounds in the rhizomes of four Ukrainian 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. (
 <italic>I. pallida, I. hungarica, I. sibirica</italic>, 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>) by HPLC-DAD and UPLC-MS/MS. Furthermore, we analyzed the samplesâ€™ antioxidant capacity using the HPLC-ABTS system and NRF2 expression for the first time. We also conducted related pharmacological in vitro assays for 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> crude extracts, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, cytotoxic, hepatoprotective, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) bioassays.
