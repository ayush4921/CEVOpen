<p>Oxidative stress and inflammation are pathophysiological processes that usually accompany various chronic diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oxidative stress and inflammatory processes are intertwined and affect each other through the activation of a plethora of molecular pathways. Oxidative stress promotes the prognosis of many diseases including inflammation, metabolic and liver diseases. The antioxidant scavenging process is an important process to prevent the harmful effect of free radicals [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most of the used antioxidants are of natural origin such as phenolics and vitamins. Phenolics are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They can be found in many foods and medicinal plants and possess potent antioxidant properties rendering them ideal candidates for the development of antioxidant drug leads [
