 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9993) within the tested ranges. The repeatability was expressed as the relative standard deviation (%RSD) of the major constituents’ content and the RSD ranged from 0.3% to 1.3%, which was satisfactory. The determination of the main compounds in the tested solutions was done by comparing the peaks retention times and the UV-spectrum obtained from the chromatogram of the standard solution (
