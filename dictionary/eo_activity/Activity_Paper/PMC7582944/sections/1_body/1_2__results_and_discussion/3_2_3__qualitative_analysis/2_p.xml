<p>Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was identified as gallic acid according to the absorbance maxima at 217 nm and 271 nm, characteristic of the hydroxycinnamic group of compounds. The presence of a molecular ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 169 further confirmed its nature [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Gallic acid is formed through the shikimic acid pathway and is a major component of many phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> also showed absorbance maxima at 236 nm and 324 nm corresponding to the hydroxycinnamic group of the compound. Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was eluted at t
 <sub>R</sub> 3.92 min and showed fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 179, 161, and 135 in the negative-ion mode, suggesting a caffeic acid structure. It is known that caffeic acid possesses potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic properties [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] so its presence in the 
 <italic>Iris</italic> raw materials supports their use in folk medicine targeting inflammatory-related disorders.
