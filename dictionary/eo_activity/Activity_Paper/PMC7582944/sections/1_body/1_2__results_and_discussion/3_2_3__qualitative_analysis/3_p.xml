<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed typical maximum absorption peaks at 240 (shoulder peak), 257, 318, and 365 nm, which are characteristic UV features of xanthones (mangiferin). Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>11</bold> demonstrated maximum absorption peaks at 218–322 nm (shoulder peak) and 218–264 nm which are characteristic peaks of isoflavones (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04588">Table S1</xref>). MS data were measured in the negative ion mode and the mass spectroscopic data of all compounds are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04588-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The detected compounds demonstrated regular MS fragmentation behavior, which was useful in providing information on their chemical structures. For the flavonoid glycosides, the MS spectra showed an ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> [(M–H) − 120]
 <sup>−</sup> which represents a characteristic ion of 
 <italic>C</italic>-glycosides, such as mangiferin (
 <bold>2</bold>). Mangiferin was the only 
 <italic>C</italic>-glycosidic xanthone derivative identified in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. by this method. The MS spectra of flavonoid glycosides exhibited a loss of 162 Da, suggesting the presence of one hexose residue. This fragmentation pattern was characteristic of O-glycosides, such as tectoridin (
 <bold>4</bold>) and irisolidone-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside (
 <bold>6</bold>). The loss of a methyl radical ion (15 Da) was the predominant fragmentation pattern for most of the compounds, owing to the loss of a methoxy group. For example, iristectorigenin B (
 <bold>7</bold>) exhibited an ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 329 in the negative ion mode. The mass data showed a fragment ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 314 indicating the loss of a methyl residue. Irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>) lost three methyl groups showing fragments at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 344 and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 329. All the LC chromatograms of the identified compounds are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04588-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The chromatograms of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic>, 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>, 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic> rhizomes are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04588">Figures S1–S4</xref>. The pseudomolecular ion signals for germanaism B (
 <bold>5</bold>) and nigricin (
 <bold>8</bold>) were not observed in the negative ion mode utilizing the Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) diagnostic [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], thus, for the detection of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>, it was necessary to apply the positive ion mode [
