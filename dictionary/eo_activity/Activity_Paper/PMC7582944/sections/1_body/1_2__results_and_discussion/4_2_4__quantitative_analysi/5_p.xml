<p>The most common isoflavonoid-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosides in 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes were tectoridin (
 <bold>4</bold>), germanaism B (
 <bold>5</bold>), irisolodone-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside (
 <bold>6</bold>), as well as nigricin (
 <bold>8</bold>), irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>), and irisolidone (
 <bold>11</bold>). The obtained results illustrated that the amount of tectoridin (
 <bold>3</bold>) (3.921 ± 0.071 mg/g), nigricin (
 <bold>8</bold>) (2.267 ± 0.003 mg/g) and iristectorigenin B (
 <bold>7</bold>) (0.750 ± 0.003 mg/g) in 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes was remarkably high in comparison with other species. However, the average content of tectoridin in 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> rhizomes obtained from different regions of China was reported to be 9.31 mg/g by HPLC analysis [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The highest amount of tectoridin (12.85 ± 0.06 mg/g) was detected in 
 <italic>Belamcanda chinensis</italic> (
 <italic>I. domestica</italic>) rhizomes from Hubei Province in China [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], which significantly exceeded the content of tectoridin in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. from Ukraine. On the other hand, an average content of irigenin was detected in 
 <italic>I. domestica</italic> from China 0.89 ± 0.08 mg/g, which was three times less than the detected amount in 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic> (3.199 ± 0.034 mg/g) and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> (4.892 ± 0.038 mg/g) from Ukraine, and the content of irigenin in 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> exceeded five folds the reported content in 
 <italic>I. domestica</italic>.
