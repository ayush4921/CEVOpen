<p>Separation of the compounds was achieved using a Nexera X2 LC-30AD HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The system comprises an on-line degasser, a quaternary pump, SIL-30AC autosampler (Shimadzu), CTO-20AC thermostat (Shimadzu), a column temperature controller and a SPD-M20A diode array detector (DAD). Other instruments used in the investigation were an Ultrasonic Cleaner Set (Wise Clean WUC-A06H, Witeg Labortechnik GmbH, (Wertheim Germany), Libra UniBloc AUW120D (Shimadzu Analytical Scale, Kyoto, Japan); pH-meterâ€”Knick Electronic Battery-operated pH Meter 911 PH (Portamess, Berlin, Germany), and class A analytical vials that meet requirements of the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine (SPhU, 2015).</p>
