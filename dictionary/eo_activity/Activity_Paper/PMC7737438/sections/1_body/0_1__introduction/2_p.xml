 <italic>Streblus asper</italic> (SA), belonging to the Moraceae family, is well known as a folk medicinal plant in Asian countries, such as India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Philippines, Southern China, and Thailand. It is a rich source of cardiac glycosides, phenolic compounds, and volatile oils [

Scientific evidence on the anti-inflammatory effects of SA extracts has rarely been reported, and there is no confirmed evidence of an anti-inflammatory mechanism through the lipoxygenase enzyme. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of an aqueous SA leaf extract, including in vitro lipoxygenase assay and in vivo experiments on xylene-induced ear edema in mice. The results of this study will provide potential information for the treatment of neurogenerative disorders caused by neuroinflammation [
