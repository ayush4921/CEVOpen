<p>Many studies reported that phenolic compounds inhibit the inflammatory process via inhibiting lipoxygenase enzyme involved in transformation of arachidonic acid to inflammatory mediators and involved free radical scavenging in arachidonic acid metabolism [

From our previous study, the certain polyphenolic compounds such as gallic acid, isoquercetin, quercetin, rutin, catechin, and tannic acid were found in SA aqueous extracts. Therefore, this can be explained that the antilipoxygenase activity of the SA extract might be affected by the antioxidative action of phenolic compounds [
