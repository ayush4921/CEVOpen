<p>Lipoxygenase is the enzyme involved in the arachidonic acid pathway that produces leukotrienes [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This study was performed to investigate the antilipoxygenase activity of a SA leaf extract in vitro. The results showed that the SA extract has less antilipoxygenase activity than diclofenac sodium. It is possible that SA has anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of cyclooxygenase as the main pathway, while lipoxygenase is involved in a minor pathway that slightly involves leukotrienes; therefore, the proposed mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of SA might involve prostaglandins, which are products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.
