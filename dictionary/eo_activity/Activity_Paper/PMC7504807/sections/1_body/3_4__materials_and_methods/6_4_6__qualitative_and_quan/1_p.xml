 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the flavonoid metabolites of the samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by mass spectrometry. The characteristic ions of each substance were filtered by the triple quadrupole, and the signal intensity of the characteristic ions were obtained in the detector. The mass spectrometry file under the sample was opened with MultiaQuant software to conduct the integration and correction of chromatographic peaks. The area of each chromatographic peak represents the relative content of the corresponding substance. Finally, all the chromatographic peak area integral data were exported and saved. In order to compare the content difference of each metabolite in different samples among all the detected metabolites, we corrected the mass spectrum peaks of each metabolite detected in different samples according to the information of retention time and peak type of metabolites, and therefore the accuracy of the qualitative and quantitative analysis was further ensured.
