<p>The antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. organic extracts were evaluated based on their scavenging activity for the DPPH radical. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, the methanolic extracts held the highest RSA (20â€“76%) among the organic extracts, except for the ethyl acetic extract from 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic>, with a RSA of 62.3 0.4%. The observed results are possibly related with the high content of polyphenols usually present in the methanolic extracts, which are known for their antioxidant activity

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>23</sup>
 </xref>, which have been isolated from 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp., suggest that these compounds may also contribute to the observed bioactivity. The quinone moiety present in abietane diterpenes is probably responsible for their biological activity, since quinones represent important features at stabilising free radicals in many biological systems suffering from oxidative stress, protein inactivation and intermediate melanin synthesis pathway in human skin
