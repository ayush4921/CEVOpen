<p>The anti-elastase activity of 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. organic extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>) revealed impaired elastase inhibition, in contrast to the previous enzymatic assays regarding tyrosinase and collagenase inhibitory activity. Under the experimental conditions, the maximum elastase inhibition obtained was 42.8 4.2% for 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> ethyl acetic extract, while the positive control, ursolic acid, inhibited elastase by 69.9 3.7%. The organic extracts from 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> and the acetonic extract from 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> showed no elastase inhibition (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
