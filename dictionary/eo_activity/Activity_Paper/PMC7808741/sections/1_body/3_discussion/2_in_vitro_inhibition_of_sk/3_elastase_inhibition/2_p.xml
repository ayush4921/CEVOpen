<p>Mild elastase inhibition (around 30%) was observed for the organic extracts from 
 <italic>P. neochilus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic>, probably due to the presence of different types of triterpenes, such as compounds (
 <bold>7</bold>), (
 <bold>8</bold>), (
 <bold>14</bold>) and (
 <bold>15</bold>). Moreover, previous studies suggested that polyphenolic compounds may have anti-elastase activity due to interaction of the hydroxyl groups with the elastase domain

 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. aqueous extracts expected to have this type of compounds, were further evaluated for anti-elastase activity (
