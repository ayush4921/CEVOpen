<p>The experimental results showed that the methanolic extracts from 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic>, as well as the 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> ethyl acetic extract, generally had the highest values for radical scavenging activity and enzymatic inhibition. Interestingly, the isolated compounds mainly present in these plant extracts (abietane diterpenes, triterpenes, and polyphenols) also revealed high inhibitory effects on tyrosinase, collagenase and elastase enzymes. The highest inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> aqueous extract in the anti-tyrosinase assay, which contains only minor amounts of polyphenolic compounds, is probably due to the presence of the diterpenoid (
 <bold>9</bold>). Despite the lower efficiency observed in the elastase inhibition assay, the abietane diterpene (
 <bold>4</bold>) showed high inhibitory activity only surmounted by the triterpene mixture of (
