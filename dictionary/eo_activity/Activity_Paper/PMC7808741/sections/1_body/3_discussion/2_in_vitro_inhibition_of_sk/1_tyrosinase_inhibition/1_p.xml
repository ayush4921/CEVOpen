<p>The 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. extracts and isolated compounds have been evaluated as tyrosinase inhibitors. The organic extracts showed promising results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>) with inhibitory activity as high as 68% compared to 92.9 7.4% obtained for kojic acid used as positive control. According to the results obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>), the methanolic (25–66%) and acetonic (27–68%) extracts exhibited the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). High tyrosinase inhibition was observed for the 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> acetonic (67.9 3.6%), 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> methanolic (65.9 3.4%) and 
 <italic>P. saccatus</italic> acetonic (56.4 5.7%) extracts. Moreover, 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> showed the highest anti-tyrosinase activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and these were also the plants that showed increased antioxidant activity. The observed results can be attributed to the abietane diterpenoids mainly present in the organic extracts of these two plants
