  <p>Signalling pathway induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation causing skin damage. Radical oxygen species (ROS) up-regulated mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascades enhance transcriptional activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) heterodimer (comprised of c-Jun and c-Fos) thus increasing metalloproteinases (MPPs) expression. Additionally, transforming growth factor (TGF)-/Smad signalling pathway is down-regulated by over-accumulation of ROS, decreasing the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagenase and elastin.</p>
