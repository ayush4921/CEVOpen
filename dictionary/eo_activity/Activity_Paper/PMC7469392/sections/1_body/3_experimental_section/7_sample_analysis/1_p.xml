<p>Fluorescein standard solutions for calibration curves, fluorescein standard solutions for permeability assay, and postrun samples were analyzed in 96-well plates using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry (490 nm, BioRad Microplate Reader). The compounds and propranolol standards were analyzed on a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 system using an analytical column (Shim-pack XR-ODSIII 2.0 mm i.d × 150 mm, flow rate of 0.25 mL/min, column oven at 40 °C). Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and ultrapure water (Milli-Q) with 0.1% formic acid were used as mobile phases. A gradient elution system was used. The initial solvent concentration was kept at 5% aq. acetonitrile for 5 min, then increased up to 80% aq. acetonitrile over 2 min, and held for 8 min.</p>
