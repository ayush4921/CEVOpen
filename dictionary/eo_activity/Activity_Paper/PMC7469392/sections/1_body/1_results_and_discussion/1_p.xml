 </sup> The Caco-2 cells were seeded onto transwells and maintained for 21 days when they were fully confluent and functional monolayers. The integrity of the Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the TEER values for the transwells fell within the acceptable range (400–600 Ω·cm
 <sup>2</sup>) for fully confluent monolayers with well-established tight junctions between the cells.

 </sup> The permeability assay was conducted by placing 100 μL of a 1 mg/mL solution (dissolved in Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS)–4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer) of the compound to be assayed into the apical chamber and 400 μL of HBSS–HEPES buffer into the basolateral chamber. Samples from the basal side were taken and replaced with the equivalent amount of buffer every 30 min for 150 min. Propranolol and fluorescein were used as the positive and negative control compounds for the assays, respectively. Propranolol, a completely orally bioavailable compound with &gt;90% absorption in the human gastrointestinal tract, exhibits a very high apparent permeability (

 <sub>app</sub> &gt; 20 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s), whereas fluorescein is a poorly orally bioavailable compound that exhibits extremely low

 <sub>app</sub> values (

Hence, propranolol and fluorescein represent the upper and lower bounds for the permeability assays performed on the flavonoids and saponins reported in this paper. These control compounds exhibited permeability values within the expected ranges, propranolol ((56.0 ± 8.88) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s) and fluorescein ((0.1 ± 0.002) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s),

 </sup> providing further evidence of good monolayer integrity (

 </xref>). To evaluate the physical integrity of the monolayers after exposure to the compounds for 150 min, the permeability of fluorescein across the washed monolayers was determined after the assay was complete (postrun fluorescein assay). The postrun fluorescein control assay also gave consistently low

 <sub>app</sub> values (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
