<p>Gypenoside L (
 <bold>12</bold>), with the C-3 disaccharide, showed high permeability with a 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> value of 10.7 (±2.09) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s. Interestingly, gypenoside LI (
 <bold>13</bold>), the 20
 <italic>R</italic>-epimer of 
 <bold>12</bold>, exhibited a 10-fold decrease in permeability (1.39 (±0.088) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s). This may suggest that the stereochemistry at C-20 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>) can be a significant factor for determining the monolayer permeability of the saponins. Yixinoside B (
 <bold>14</bold>) exhibits the same C-20 stereochemistry as 
 <bold>12</bold> and bears two glucose units attached through the hydroxy group at C-3 but is hydroxylated at position C-1 rather than at C-2 as seen in 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>). This structural isomer of 
 <bold>12</bold> exhibited a slightly higher 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> value (13.6 (±1.61) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s) than 
 <bold>12</bold>, suggesting that a saponin possessing a hydroxyl group at C-1 and 
 <italic>S</italic>-configuration at C-20 is more permeable across Caco-2 monolayers than its structural or configurational isomers.
