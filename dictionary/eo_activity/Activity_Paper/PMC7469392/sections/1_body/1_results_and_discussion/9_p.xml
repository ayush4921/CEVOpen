<p>A literature survey confirmed the lack of any report on the permeability of dammarane saponins. However, reports suggest that the other class of saponins, the steroidal saponins, can pass through Caco-2 monolayers. These saponins are actively transported by suitable transport proteins, such as sugar transporters, or can be effluxed across the monolayers by efflux pumps such as P-gp and MRP-2.

 </sup> We know that Caco-2 cells express active transporters including sugar transporters such as SGLT1 (responsible for the transport of glycosides),

 </sup> GLUT2 and GLUT5.

 </sup> Analysis of our permeability assay data in light of these literature reports suggests that the glycosylated saponins assessed here may be actively transported by sugar transporters across Caco-2 monolayers. The low permeability of saponins 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> may be attributed to the fact that these saponins are effluxed across Caco-2 monolayers by suitable efflux pumps such as P-gp and MRP-2. An inhibitory transport study can be used in the future to determine the specific transporters or efflux proteins that are involved.
