<p>This highly potent, safe, and effective plant extract could be the first choice for treating or preventing many health disorders; however, the complex chemical profile of 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> makes it difficult to identify the individual bioactive compounds from a complex mixture (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>) of hundreds of natural products. This necessitates a systematic approach that can differentiate the complex mixture and allow researchers to confidently focus their attention on a smaller subset of compounds to evaluate their potential bioactivities. Our strategy for this relies on the knowledge that the traditional use of this herb is as an orally ingested extract and thus the compounds most likely to be responsible for the bioactivity must be orally bioavailable. To rapidly and efficiently evaluate the relative potential oral bioavailability of a significant number of compounds, the Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability model is an ideal
