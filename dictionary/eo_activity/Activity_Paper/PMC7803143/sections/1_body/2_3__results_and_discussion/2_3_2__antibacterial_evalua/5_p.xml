 <italic>Raoultella ornithinolytica</italic> crude extract had MIC values ranging from 0.250 to 16 mg/mL, with the most significant inhibition observed for 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>M. marinum</italic> at concentrations of 0.500 mg/mL, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was inhibited at concentrations of 0.250 mg/mL. Microcin genes have been reported to be present on 
 <italic>Raoultella ornithinolytica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and microcins are antibacterial peptides produced by 
 <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This could explain the observed results. 
 <italic>Acinetobacter guillouiae</italic> crude extract showed MIC values of between 0.500 and 16 mg/mL. The crude extract showed activity against 
 <italic>M. marinum</italic> at 0.500 mg/mL.
