<p>Seven Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Phenotype diversity of the endophyte contributes to the Gram reaction and colony morphology of the endophytes [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and hence the diverse endosphere, while the growth rate and size of the host plant also have an effect on the diverse endophytic community [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The endophytic community of plants is influenced by the age of the host plant, geographic location, and abiotic factors such as temperature [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This would explain the diversity of the bacterial endophytes isolated.
