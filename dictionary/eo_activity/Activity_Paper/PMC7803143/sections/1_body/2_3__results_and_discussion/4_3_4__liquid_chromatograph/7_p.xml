<p>Vasicinol is a quinazoline alkaloid from 
 <italic>Adhatoda zeylanica</italic> Medic. [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Crude endophyte extracts of 
 <italic>Bacillus safensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cichorii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Arthrobacter pascens</italic> displayed the presence of this alkaloid; this is not surprising as some quinazoline alkaloids are produced by microbes [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Vasicinol can be tested on other resistant pathogenic bacteria to combat antimicrobial resistance, as its antibacterial activity has been reported by Jain et al. [
