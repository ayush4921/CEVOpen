<p>Serial dilutions were carried out using the MH broth from 16 mg/mL down to 0.031 mg/mL, which was the lowest inhibition observed. The experiment was carried out in five repeats using a 96-well microtiter plate. The outer wells of the plate were filled with sterile distilled water (sdH
 <sub>2</sub>O). The inoculum (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added to each well that did not contain the sdH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The diluted crude extract samples (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added in five wells horizontally, and the concentrations decreased in a vertical order from 16 mg/mL down to 0.031 mg/mL. The plates were covered and incubated overnight at 37°C. After incubation, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.02% (w/v) Resazurin sodium salt dye solution was added to the wells, and the resulting solution was incubated for another two hours. On reduction, resazurin changes color from blue to pink to clear as oxygen becomes limited within the medium, indicating metabolism and the viability of bacterial cells, as well as no effect of the crude extracts on the bacteria. Any well with a known concentration showing a slight color change was used as MIC. The wells were visually inspected for color changes.
