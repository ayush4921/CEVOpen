<p>The evaluation of the anticancer activity of the crude secondary metabolite extract was performed using the MTS (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay as previously described by Sebola et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A stock solution of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of all crude extracts (leave crude extracts and endophytic crude extract) was prepared in 0.1% DMSO and sonicated. Serial dilutions were done according to [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Briefly, dilutions were carried out using growth media from 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 3.13 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. MTS (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer cytotoxicity assay was carried out to determine a change in cell viability through the use of a color change. The MTS compound (yellow) is metabolized by viable cells to form a dark purple-colored compound, while dead cells turn the color of the MTS compound pink. The samples were run in duplicate across three plates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), and the average values obtained were reported. The U87MG (glioblastoma) cells and A549 (lung carcinoma) cells were grown using normal tissue culture techniques using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Merk, Johannesburg, SA) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Merck, Johannesburg, SA). The cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were incubated in 96-well plates at 37°C overnight, with the subsequent addition of the crude bulb extracts and crude endophytic extracts, in concentrations of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 50.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 25.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 6.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 3.125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The cells were left to incubate for 4 days, whereupon MTS (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the cells. The absorbance values were measured at 490 nm after 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr incubation periods. Cell viability was then calculated using the formula

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The positive control used for all conducted tests was auranofin, as it is able to inhibit thioredoxin reductase as well as the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) by targeting proteasome-associated deubiquitinase, thus inducing lung cancer cell apoptosis by selenocystine [
