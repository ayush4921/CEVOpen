<p>The extraction of crude extracts from each isolated endophytic bacterium was carried out using the method previously described by Sebola et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, LB broth (1 L) was prepared in 2 L of broth and was measured into a 4 L Erlenmeyer flask leaving room for aeration and autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. Each 4 L flask was inoculated with one of the endophytic bacteria as listed in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, shaken at 200°rcf, and incubated at 30°C, an ideal temperature for the growth of the endophytes [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. After 7 days of cultivation, sterile XAD-7- HP resin (20 g/L) (Sigma, Johannesburg, South Africa, BCBR6696V) was added to the culture for 2 h, shaken at 200 rcf. The resin was filtered through cheesecloth and washed three times with 300 mL of acetone for each wash. The acetone soluble fraction was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and a dark yellowish viscous extract was obtained, which was transferred into a measuring cylinder. Depending on the volume, ethyl acetate was added in a ratio of 1 : 1 (v/v). The mixture was vigorously shaken for about 10 min, decanted into a separating funnel, and allowed to separate and each phase is collected in a conical flask. This process was repeated until the dark yellowish viscous liquid obtained after removing the acetone became a very light-yellow liquid. The ethyl acetate fraction was evaporated using a rotary evaporator, and the brown extract obtained was stored in an amber bottle in a cool dry place until the analysis was done. The light-yellow liquid was evaporated, and no reasonable extract or further analysis was done on this substance. The brown crude endophyte extracts were used for antibacterial and anticancer assays and metabolite fingerprinting.
