 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lung cancer has been deemed as one of the most prevalent cancers in the developed world and has a very poor survival rate since most patients are diagnosed at a stage when curative treatment is impossible. It is one of the hardest cancers to diagnose [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] described that discovery and development of chemotherapeutic agents are vital in the treatment of cancer, since currently used therapies are ineffective and have side effects, and many important anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin, penochalasin A, and chaetoglobosin E, have been isolated from endophytes. Therefore, further investigations on bacterial endophytes have to be conducted.
