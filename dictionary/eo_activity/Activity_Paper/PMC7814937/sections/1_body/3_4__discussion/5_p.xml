<p>In this study, cell cycle analysis was conducted in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines after treated with 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> methanol extract at IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. At 24 h, the extract induced S and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases arrest in MCF-7 and G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases arrest in MDA-MB-231. At 48 h, growth in a number of the treated cells was observed in the sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> phase in MCF-7 and sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> in MDA-MB-231, while significant decreases in the number of cells were observed in G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub>, S, and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M in MCF-7 and S and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M in MDA-MB-231. At 72 h, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> methanol extracts arrested MCF-7 at the sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> phase and MDA-MB-231 at sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> and S phases.
