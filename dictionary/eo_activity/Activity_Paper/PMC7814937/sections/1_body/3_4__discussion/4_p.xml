<p>It was reported by Nur and Nugroho [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] that 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> extracts demonstrated a cytotoxic effect on T47D cell lines. This research result indicated that the chloroform extract of the 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> leaves was stronger in inhibiting the growth of the cells than the methanol extract. Similarly, Ghosh and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] revealed that different nanoparticles Pton–PdNPs, PdNPs, and PtNPs made from 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> tuber extract exhibited the antiproliferative effect where Pt–PdNPs had been the most cytotoxic nanoparticles at concentration 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies conducted on cytotoxic activities of the water extract, nonethyl acetate extract, ethyl acetate extract, ethanol extract, and diosbulbin B isolated from 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> showed that ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts reduced the lump weight in S180 and H22 tumour cells bearing mice while no such effect was observed in water and nonethyl acetate extracts [
