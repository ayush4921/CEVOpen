<p>Another study which was conducted by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> and other 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species possessed high antioxidant activity as in the following order 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>D. collettii</italic>, 
 <italic>D. nipponica,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. opposita</italic>. This indicates that members of the genus 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> have therapeutic potential due to high antioxidants contents. Comparable study was carried out by Ghosh et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) synthesised by 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> showed high radical scavenging activities that are slightly lesser when compared with ascorbic acid. Vitamin C also showed 14.11% of superoxide scavenging activity while CuNPs showed 48.39% of the activity.
