<p>On comparative research by Liu and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], it was found that dioscin fundamentally hinders multiplication of C6 glioma cells at the S stage because of an expansion in a few cells in the stage following expanding dosages of dioscin increment in sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> arrest. Demonstrating that dioscin caused cell cycle capture at the S stage, G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> stage decline in a few cells was observed. It has been recently detailed that dioscin restrained ROS creation, brought about DNA harm, and made cell cycle captured at the S stage, when contrasted and untreated, gathering the extent of the G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> stage decreased from 61.38% to 35.43%, and S stage increased from 30.62% to 59.77% by 5.0â€‰mg/ml of dioscin while the extents of G
 <sub>2</sub>/M stage had small changes. These findings showed that dioscin was able to block human HEp-2 and TU212 cells at the S stage [
