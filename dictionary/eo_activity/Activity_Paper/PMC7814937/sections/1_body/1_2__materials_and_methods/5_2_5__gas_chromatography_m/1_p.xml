<p>The selected crude extract was analysed using gas chromatography (GC-MS-2010 Plus-Shimadzu) in order to determine the secondary metabolites present. The segment (30.0 m length, 0.25 mm ID, and 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thickness) was set at 50°C for 4 min which was then expanded to 300°C at the rate of 3°C/min, and after that supported for 10 min. The temperature at the injector was set at 250°C, and the volume was set at 0.1 L. The present helium rate of the bearer gas was set at 1 mL/min with an aggregate run span of an hour. Electron ionization and mass spectra were performed at 70 eV and between the range of 40–700 m/z [
