<p>The monoacid derivative of hydroxy carboxy polyethylene glycol (HO-PEG200COOH) (0.028 mol) was activated with a 1:2 molar equivalent of 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (3a) (0.046 mol) and N, N-dicyclocarbidiimide (0.046 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane. The solution was stirred over night at room temperature. This reaction mixture appeared like a resin when dried under a vacuum. This syrupy resin was dissolved in 15Â mL of acetone. Later the white precipitate of DCU that appeared was discarded and the filtrate was collected. The final filtrate was evaporated to afford compound 4a. TLC in (methanol:ethyl acetate 7:3) was performed to check for the presence of DCU. It showed a negative result. The IR spectra confirmed this negative result. A negative dye test indicated complete amino group capping.</p>
