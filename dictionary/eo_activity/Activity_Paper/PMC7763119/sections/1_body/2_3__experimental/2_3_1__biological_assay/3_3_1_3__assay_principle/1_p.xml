<p>In this assay, the viability of chemically-treated cells were measured by a dye, Resazurin or Alamar blue (AB). AB, a nonfluorescent pointer dye, changed to bright red-fluorescent resorufin through the reduction reactions of metabolically active cells. The quantity of fluorescence produced was directly proportional to the number of living cells.</p>
