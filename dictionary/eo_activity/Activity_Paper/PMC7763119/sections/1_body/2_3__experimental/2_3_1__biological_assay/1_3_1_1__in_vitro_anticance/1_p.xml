<p>A library of 24 compounds was tested using the Alamar blue (AB) assay (in the case of leukemia cells) for their antiproliferative activity in vitro against 2 cancer cell lines: SW620, MD468, and MD468-2 were all colon cancer cell lines obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). MD468 is a mismatched repair-deficient cell line, and MD468-2 has a p53 mutation. The results of the cytotoxic activity in vitro were expressed as an ID50 (nM/mL), i.e. the concentration of the compound that inhibited the proliferation of 50% of the tumor cells when compared to the untreated control cells. Camptothecin (10 nM), Paclitaxel (10 nM), Doxorubicin (250 nM), and Oxaliplatin (2000 nM) were applied as referential cytotoxic agents (positive test controls). A value of less than 10 nM/mL was considered as an antiproliferative activity criterion for synthetic compounds. The results of the cytotoxicity studies are summarized in Table 3.</p>
