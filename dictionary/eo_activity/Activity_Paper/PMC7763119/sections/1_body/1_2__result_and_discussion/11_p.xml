<p>The resin was dehydrated in a vacuum for IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, and mass spectral analysis. At this point, the adhesive did not stick to the glass wall anymore. The IR spectrum of the resin showed the characteristic absorption band of the PEG ether backbone (1120 cm–1) and absorption bands (1760 and 1685 cm–1)for the ester and amide bond, respectively (C=O) (Table 2).</p>
