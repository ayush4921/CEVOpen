<p>The synthesis of quinoline compounds 3a–3i (Scheme) was accomplished, starting with 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (2). The treatment of compound 2 with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in 30% aq. ammonia at 0–2 °C with constant stirring for 2–3 h gave 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (3a). However, the reaction of compound 2 with fused sodium sulfide in dry dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by hydroxyl amination, afforded 6-amino-2-mercaptoquinoline-3-carbaldehydeoxime (3b). Next, 3-(6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-yl)-1-p-tolylprop-2-en-1-one (3c) was prepared by the reaction of compound 2 with 4-methyl acetophenone in 40% ethanolic NaOH. Moreover, 4-(2-(6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-yl) vinyl phenol (3d) was synthesized by treating a mixture of compound 2 and p-cresol in AcOH/Ac2O under reflux for 6–7h. Additionally, compound 2 was treated with thiourea and urea in AcOH under reflux for 15–16h and produced 7-aminopyrimido(4,5-b)quinoline-2(1H)thione(3e) and 7-aminopyrimido(4,5-b)quinoline-2(1H)one (3f), respectively. Furthermore, 3-(P-tolylimino) methyl-2-chloroquinoline-6 amine (3g) was prepared by condensation of compound 2 with p-toludiene in acidic methanol. A noteworthy ring annulation was observed when compound 2 was condensed with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol under reflux for 5–6h, which afforded 1-H-pyrazolo (3 and 4b), and quinolin-6-amine (3h). The synthesis of (Z)-ethyl 3-(6 amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-yl)-2-cyanoacrylate (3i) was accomplished by condensation of compound 2 with ethyl cyanoacetate (Table 1).</p>
