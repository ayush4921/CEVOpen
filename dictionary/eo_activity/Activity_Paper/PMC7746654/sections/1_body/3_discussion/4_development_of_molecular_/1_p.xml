<p>Artaxa guttata, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> are valuable medicinal plants in traditional Korean herbal medicine (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine [KIOM], 2020</xref>). To ensure quality control, safety, and effectiveness of their ingredients, Herbal Pharmacopeia mandates that herbal medicinal materials should be kept in pure form. Adulterants may cause negative side effects and quality problems. The purity of herbal medicinal ingredients can be tested with species-specific molecular markers. Here, we developed indel marker sets to distinguish between four species of medicinal Boraginaceae. Although cp genomes are highly conserved within the same genus, they frequently possess insertion/deletion regions. We detected the conserved indel regions 
 <italic>psaA</italic>- 
 <italic>ycf3</italic>, 
 <italic>trnI-CAU- ycf2</italic>, and 
 <italic>ndhC</italic>-
 <italic>trnV-UAC</italic>. The corresponding marker sets 
 <italic>psaA</italic>- 
 <italic>ycf3</italic> (PSY), 
 <italic>trnI-CAU- ycf2</italic> (TCY), and 
 <italic>ndhC</italic>-
 <italic>trnV-UAC</italic> (NCTV) successfully discriminated between the four species, as well as between the closely related 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>. The rapid and accurate species identification achieved by these marker sets will help distinguish 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> without having to rely on morphological analysis, and will prevent incorrect classification of ambiguous samples from valuable 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species.
