<p>Most genes in the Boraginaceae exhibited stable gene evolution (purifying selection). Positive selection was detected in 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>, a gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco, which is commonly observed in angiosperm cp genomes due to the elevated selective pressure for this protein (

 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Large-scale studies confirmed that positive selection of 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> is widespread among land plants. Thus, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kapralov and Filatov (2007)</xref> evaluated positive selection in 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> in over 3,000 species. and reported positive selection in most land plants but not in algae and cyanobacteria. A similar study supported the positive selection of 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> in 
 <italic>Ilex</italic> using 240 
 <italic>Ilex</italic> sequences (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Positive selection in the chloroplast genome, including at 
 <italic>rbc</italic>L, has been reported in numerous plant taxa (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2014</xref>). The results of our study corroborated the results of the previous studies. The positive selection suggests ongoing adaptation to the environment (
