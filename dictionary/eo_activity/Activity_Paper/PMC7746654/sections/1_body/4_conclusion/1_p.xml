<p>Floral morphological and micromorphological characteristics, as well as chloroplast (cp) genome sequences of selected species in 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> genera were analyzed. The floral characteristics reveal great diversity in floral epidermis cell patterns, gynoecium, and structure of trichomes. Chloroplast genomes of the four species were well conserved with respect to genome length, gene number, gene orientation, and local divergence. Most variable sequences were detected in non-coding regions. These hotspots were used to develop new indel molecular marker sets for efficient and rapid species identification. We successfully established phylogenetic relationships among 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species in Boraginaceae using cp genome sequences. Accordingly, we suggest that 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> be recognized as an independent species following 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Kurz (1874)â€™s</xref> taxonomic concept based on its narrow distribution, different life cycle, and newly found gynoecium characteristics and genetic distance of cp genomes in this study. Morphological characteristics, genomic data, and taxonomic concept presented in our study for medicinal 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> species will be helpful in further research on Boraginaceae.
