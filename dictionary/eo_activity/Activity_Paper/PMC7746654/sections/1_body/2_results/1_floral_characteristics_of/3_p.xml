<p>The outer calyx of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> was densely covered with non-glandular trichomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>); whereas that of 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> was densely covered with both non-glandular trichomes and glandular trichomes with stalk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Hirsute, thick, and long non-glandular trichomes were found in 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Non-glandular trichome surfaces were generally verrucate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E,F</xref>); whereas glandular trichomes were always smooth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Only in 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic>, non-glandular trichomes were both verrucate and smooth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). The shape of the corolla was tubular-campanulate in all species; however, cellular and trichome distribution patterns were quite different. All 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species presented a tabular rugose cellular pattern on the outer corolla (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2I–K</xref>); whereas 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> exhibited a papillose knobby pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). The verrucate, non-glandular trichomes were sparsely to moderately pubescent on the outer corolla surface of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic>. Smooth glandular trichomes with stalk and smooth non-glandular trichomes were only found in 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>. The inner corolla cells of all 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species were papillose conical and 10.70 ± 2.69 (S.D.) μm tall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2M–O</xref>), whereas those of 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> were papillose knobby and 36.74 ± 6.22 (S.D.) μm tall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2P</xref>). 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> had smooth glandular trichomes with stalk on the inner corolla surface, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> was glabrous, and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> had both smooth glandular trichomes with stalk and verrucate non-glandular trichomes.
