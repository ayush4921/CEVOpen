<p>Using the non-synonymous substitution to synonymous substitution (Ka/Ks) ratio, a total of 77 genes were calculated to identify selective pressure for the three 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species, 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. officinalis</italic>, with 
 <italic>T. plicata</italic> as reference (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Most genes were conserved and exhibited a Ka/Ks ratio &lt; 1. Only 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> was positively selected in all five Boraginaceae cp genomes (Ka/Ks = 1.064â€“1.286).
