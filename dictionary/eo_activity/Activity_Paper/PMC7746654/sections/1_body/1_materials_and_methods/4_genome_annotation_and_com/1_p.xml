<p>Gene annotation of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> cp genomes was performed using GeSeq (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Tillich et al., 2017</xref>), and annotation results were concatenated using an in-house script pipeline. Protein-coding sequences (CDS) were manually curated and confirmed using Artemis (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Carver et al., 2008</xref>), and checked against the NCBI protein database. The tRNAs were confirmed with tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</xref>). IR region sequences were confirmed using IR finder and RepEx (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Gurusaran et al., 2013</xref>). Circular maps of the three 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and one 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> cp genomes were obtained using OGDRAW (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Greiner et al., 2019</xref>). GC content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of the four cp genomes were analyzed using MEGA7 software (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Codon usage distribution of six Boraginaceae cp genomes was visualized using the Heatmapper program, with average linkage of clustering and Euclidean distance measurement methods (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Babicki et al., 2016</xref>). RSCU &lt; 1.00 indicated a codon that was used less frequently than expected; whereas RSCU &gt; 1.00 indicated a codon that was used more frequently than expected. MAUVE V2.3.1 was used to identify local collinear blocks of six Boraginaceae species (
 <italic>Arnebia guttata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, 
 <italic>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</italic>, 
 <italic>Borago officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tiquilia plicata</italic>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Darling et al., 2010</xref>). The mVISTA program in Shuffle-LAGAN mode was used to compare the cp genomes with 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> as reference (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Frazer et al., 2004</xref>). DnaSP version 6 was used to calculate nucleotide variability (Pi) among cp genomes (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Rozas et al., 2017</xref>). Substitution rates Ka and Ks were estimated with KaKs Calculator ver. 2.0 (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).
