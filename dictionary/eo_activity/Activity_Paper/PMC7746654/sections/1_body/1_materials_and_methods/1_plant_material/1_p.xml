<p>Plant material used in this study was collected from natural populations in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Korea during a three-year survey of the vascular flora of Central Asia (2018â€“2020). Protologues and other relevant taxonomic literature were searched and used for accurate identification of all studied species (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Royle, 1839</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Bunge, 1840</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Kurz, 1874</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Johnston, 1924</xref>;

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Song J. H. et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2019</xref>). To confirm the consistency of all studied characteristics, at least two populations were compared for each species: 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> (two individuals), 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> (10 individuals), 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> (ten individuals), and 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> (10 individuals).
