<p id="Par23">A set of 44 items were prepared based on the scope of practice of a typical PHC nurse in Poland as specified in the current 
 <italic>Regulation</italic> of nursing practice document [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The survey was developed to obtain information about the study participants’ perceptions regarding frequency of the key PHC practice activities. For example, participants were asked “How often does a primary health care nurse perform (a particular task named here) in a given year?” Possible responses included one of the following: Never; Seldom; Occasionally; Often. Participants were also asked to rate the consequences of doing the task incorrectly with possible responses: No negative consequences; Minimal negative consequences; Moderate negative consequences; Significant negative consequences. Although the question was “How often does a primary health care nurse in a given year?”, we assume that the nurses responded based on their own professional experience.
