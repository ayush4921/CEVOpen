<p>Data analysis was performed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test, aiming to identify the significant differences among averages, using the BioEstat program (Ayres). Differences that presented probability levels less than and equal to 5% (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) were considered statistically significant. The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
