<p>The cytotoxicity of the oil was evaluated against larvae of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> Leach, with adaptations [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A solution of 250 mL of synthetic sea salt at 35 g.L
 <sup>−1</sup> was prepared. In this, 25 mg of 
 <italic>A. salina</italic> eggs were incubated and exposed in artificial lighting within 24 hours for the larvae hatching (nauplii stage). The nauplii were then separated and placed in a dark environment at room temperature for another 24 hours to reach methanuplion stages. The stock solution was prepared to contain 0.06 g of the essential oil and 28.5 mL of the solution of synthetic sea salt, and 1.5 mL of Tween 80 were added to facilitate solubilization. For the negative control, Tween 80 with solution saline (5%) was used, and potassium dichromate (K

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) (1%) was used as the positive control. Subsequently, at the end of the dark period, they were selected and divided into 7 groups with 10 methanuplia in each test tube. In each group were added aliquots of the stock solution (100, 75, 50, 25, and 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), and the volume was supplemented to 5 mL with a solution of synthetic sea salt, obtaining solutions with final concentrations of 40, 30, 20, 10, and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, in triplicates. In the end, the number of nonsurvivors for LC
 <sub>50</sub> determination was counted using the SPSS® software probit analysis.
