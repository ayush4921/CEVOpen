<p>The quantification of the antioxidant activity performed by the DPPH assay was based on the methodology proposed by Sousa et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Lopes-Lutz et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with some adaptations to laboratory conditions. Initially, a methanolic solution of DPPH (stock solution) was prepared at a concentration of 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was kept under the light. After that, six concentrations (7.81, 15.62, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of EO and of the positive control (ascorbic acid and gallic acid) were prepared. For the evaluation, 2.7 mL of DPPH stock solution was added to a test tube, followed by the addition of 0.3 mL of the EO solution in different concentrations. Then, the white solution was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7 mL of methanol and 0.3 mL of a methanol solution of each EO concentration evaluated. After 30 minutes, spectrophotometer readings (Biospectro SP-22) were taken at 517 nm wavelength [
