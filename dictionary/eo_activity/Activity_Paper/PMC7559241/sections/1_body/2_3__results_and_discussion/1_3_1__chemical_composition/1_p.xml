<p>Phenolic compounds contain one or more hydroxyl groups in the aromatic rings, and they exhibit a broad spectrum of biologic abilities including antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. Thus, these compounds are gaining a great interest in pharmaceutical and food areas [

 <xref rid="B24-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From this perspective, we investigated total phenolic content of the mushroom extracts and the results are given in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was observed that 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> contained the highest level of phenolic (20.10 mg GAE/g extract), followed by 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> (16.52 mg GAE/g) and 
 <italic>R. aurea</italic> (11.36 mg GAE/g). The lowest content was also determined in 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic> with the value of 7.42 mg GAE/g. In literature, different level of phenolics in the mushroom samples were observed [

 <xref rid="B27-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The differences levels could be explained by several factors such as different geographical locations and collection seasons. As an another subject, the spectrophotometric Folin–Ciocâlteu assay could not reflect accurate levels of phenolics in the plants or mushrooms extracts because the reagent could be also react with peptides and other chemicals [
 <xref rid="B28-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To this end, at least one chromatographic method such as HPLC, LC–MS or GC–MS need to confirm the precise level of total bioactive compounds. In the current study, the chemical profiles of the mushroom extracts were investigated by LC–MS/MS. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the mushrooms contained very low level of phenolics and hinic acid was determined in all mushroom extracts. 
 <italic>p-</italic> hydroxybenzoic acid was another important compound and the highest level of it was determined in 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> extract (105.73 µg/g extract). Interestingly, cinnamic acid was only determined in 
 <italic>A. crocea</italic> (539.38 µg/g extract). In addition, chlorogenic acid was determined in 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> (6.81 µg/g extract) and 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic> (5.49 µg/g extract). Matairesinol (7.68 µg/g extract) and amentoflavone (1.02 µg/g extract) were just determined in 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic>.
