<p>For the antimutagenic evaluation of mushroom extracts, plate incorporation method described by Maron and Ames [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was conducted with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B20-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Three different doses of mushroom extracts were treated with positive mutagens both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. A hundred µL of fresh bacterial culture, 500 µL of metabolic activation enzymes (S9 mix) (or Na–P buffer for the assay without S9), 100 µL of known mutagen solutions and 100 µL mushroom extracts were added to 2.5 mL top agar (at 45 °C). Vortexed mixture was poured onto the MGA plates and after solidification all plates were incubated 48–72 h at 37 °C and the number of revertant colonies per plate was counted. For each assay triplicate plates were used. After incubation period the revertant colonies were counted and plates including only positive mutagen (without mushroom extract) were determined as 0% inhibition. The antimutagenic potential (Inhibition) was determined by equation: [(A − B)/(A − C)] × 100, where A = No. of his. revertants in the absence of sample, B = No. of his. revertants in the presence of sample, C = spontaneous revertants [
