<p>Mushrooms displaying biologic activities have attracted much interest of both the pharmaceutical and food industries. In light of the data presented in this present study, the eight mushroom under investigations showed interesting biologic properties and chemical profiles; (H) 
 <italic>depilatum</italic> and 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> showed best radical quenching and reducing power abilities among the tested samples. In addition, different enzymatic inhibitory propensities were observed from the tested mushroom extracts. The mushroom samples showed significant anti-mutagenic potentials and none of them exhibited mutagenic effects. They alleviated significant mutagenic actions of 2-amino flouren and 2-amino anthracene by the inhibition ratios. Taking into consideration these facts, the mushroom species under investigation can be regarded as valuable sources of bioactive compounds to design novel ingredients. However, further experimental studies, both in vivo and/or bioavailability, are required to provide a more comprehensive therapeutic profile of these mushrooms.
