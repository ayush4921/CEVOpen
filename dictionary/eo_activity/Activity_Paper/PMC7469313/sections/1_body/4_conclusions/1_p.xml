<p id="Par42">The predominant use of roots, root barks, and root tubers in preparing decoctions by herbalists in the study area threatens the ecological survival of some of the plant species used. The preservation of ethno medicinal knowledge in the study area is a pressing concern considering the advanced age and little formal education of the herbalists interviewed. Plans to conserve some of the medicinal plants documented in this study should be initiated. There is a need to scientifically scrutinize the medicinal claims made by the herbalists interviewed in this study.</p>
