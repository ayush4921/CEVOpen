<p>Experimental diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of freshly prepared alloxan monohydrate [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] at the dose of 180 mg/kg to at least 12 h-fasted animals. Following this injection, a large proportion of the beta cells would be subjected to apoptosis (alloxan monohydrate mode of action), and this would cause the liberation of its content in the blood, especially insulin. The high insulin level in the blood would cause a hypoglycemic shock to the animals and may lead to death. To avoid this shock, a glucose preparation (0.2 mL / 4 g/L concentration) was orally administrated to the animals.
