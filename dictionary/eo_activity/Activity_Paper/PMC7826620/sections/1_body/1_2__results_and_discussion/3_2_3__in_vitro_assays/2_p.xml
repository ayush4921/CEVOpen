<p>One of the important approaches adopted as treatment of diabetes is the inhibition of glucose absorption. By inhibiting the digestive enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides to small absorbable fragments, we prevent postprandial high blood glucose. An example of this group of inhibitors 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitors. WFLE potential inhibitory effect will be tested against those two enzymes to possibly reveal one or more modes of action of this plant.
