<p>The results showed that BPH induction significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the prostate protein content as observed in the group that received the hormone alone, when compared to normal control. A significant decrease in prostate protein content was observed in the group treated with 200 mg/kg of the 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> acetogenin fraction when compared to the TP group. This value was not significantly different from the group treated with the standard drug. However, a non-significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in the prostate protein content was observed in the group that received a lower concentration of the fraction (100 mg/kg) when compared to the TP group (
