<p>The histologic section of prostate in normal group showed a standard prostatic architecture with prostate gland lined by basal cell (BC) and eosinophilic secretion (ES) within the alveoli. In the group that received the hormone alone, there was a severe hyperplastic gland (HG), change in morphology of the BC and secretion atrophy within the lumen. Treatment of the rats with 200â€…mg/kg 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> acetogenin fraction showed near-normal architecture with well-perfused secretion. This restoration is similar to the histoarchitecture of prostate in group treated with a standard drug,
