<p>Effect of the acetogenin-rich fraction of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaves on PSA levels of the rats with experimentally induced BPH is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. At the end of the 28 days of subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate, there was a significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in PSA level (initial PSA) in groups that received the hormone compared to the normal control, indicating successful induction of BPH. Daily administration of the acetogenin fraction, at the dose level of 200 mg/kg body weight to the hyperplasic rats for seven days, caused a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decrease in PSA level (final PSA) compared to the untreated rats (TP group). This result was not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) from those treated with the standard BPH drug (dutasteride). The ameliorating effect of the plant material on the induced BPH was in a dose-dependent manner.
