<p>The ethanol extract was first partitioned in n-hexane (100 mL ×3) using a separating funnel. The ethanol layer was then concentrated to obtain a solid crude extract. The crude extract was subjected to column chromatography (open column, silica gel 60), using the mixture of solvents: hexane/ethyl acetate (93/7 v/v), dichloromethane: ethanol (93/7, 80/20 and 50/50 v/v). Eluted fractions were collected with 100 mL beakers and were tested for annonaceous acetogenin using Kedde reagents. Formation of pink to red-purple color on addition of Kedde reagents indicated the presence of annonaceous acetogenin [
