<p>It has been shown that plant-derived medications exhibit their anti-BPH effect through different mechanisms including antiandrogenic, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19â€“21</xref>]. Antioxidants are known to mitigate the deleterious effect of oxidative stress - a factor believed to play a great role in the development of age-related diseases such as BPH [

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition to antiproliferative effect,

 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaf extract also exhibits a remarkable antioxidant activity [
