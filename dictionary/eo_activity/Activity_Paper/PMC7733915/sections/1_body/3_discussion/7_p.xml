<p>Several literatures have associated oxidative stress with BPH development [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; this could arise as a result of overproduction of oxidant molecules or depletion in the antioxidant system during prostate enlargement. Besides the possible prostate tissue damage by the reactive oxygen species, a compensatory cellular proliferation can as well set in, thereby worsening the prostate enlargement [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant system of the cells, however, plays an important role in the development of prostate disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, a significant elevation in the concentration of MDA with a corresponding decrease in the antioxidant activities observed in the rats that received the hormone alone confirmed associated oxidative stress in BPH development. This could be due to the impact of the supernormal dose of the exogenous hormone and physiological changes associated with prostate enlargement. However, administration of AFAL significantly decreased the MDA concentration and restored the antioxidant activities of the test rats in a dose-dependent manner.
