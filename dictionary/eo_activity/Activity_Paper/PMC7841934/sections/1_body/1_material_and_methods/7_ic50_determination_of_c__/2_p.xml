<p>To check the antipromastigote activity of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic>, log-phase promastigotes were incubated at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> parasites in the presence and absence of leaf methanolic extract. To determine the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, parasites were incubated at different concentrations of extract. The percentage inhibition was calculated as (mean parasite number of treated sample/mean parasite of control) × 100. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was determined by extrapolating the graph of % of viable parasites under treatment versus the concentration of extract.
