 </sup> The target protein was changed into a macromolecule, which converted the atomic coordinates into pdbqt format. The grid box was selected around the crystal structure while other parameters were left as default for molecular docking by AutoDock Vina.

 </sup> The binding affinity and inhibitory constant were used to analyze the results of molecular docking, and then all possible docked conformations were generated for different constituents. The detailed interactions, including their types such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, alkyl, pi-alkyl, and halogen interactions, between different constituents and the target proteins were analyzed by BIOVIA Discovery Studio.

 </sup> The most favorable binding poses of the compounds were analyzed by choosing the lowest free energy of binding (Δ
 <italic>G</italic>) and the lowest inhibition constant (
 <italic>K</italic>i), which is calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula id="ueq1">
  <graphic xlink:href="ao0c05629_m001" position="anchor" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </disp-formula>where Δ
 <italic>G</italic> is the binding affinity (kcal/mol), 
 <italic>R</italic> (gas constant) is 1.98 cal K
 <sup>–1</sup> mol
 <sup>–1</sup>, and 
 <italic>T</italic> (room temperature) is 298.15 Kelvin.
