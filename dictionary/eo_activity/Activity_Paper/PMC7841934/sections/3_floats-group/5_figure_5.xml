  <p>Antileishmanial activity of 
   <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf extract: (A) THP-1-differentiated macrophages were treated with different concentrations of 
   <italic>C. fistula</italic> and miltefosine (0–1000 μg/mL) and cell viability was ascertained by MTT assay. (B) 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> stationary phase 
   <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes were treated with different concentrations of 
   <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf methanolic extracts, with miltefosine-treated positive control and untreated control. Each set is statistically significant compared to control. (C) THP-1-differentiated macrophages were parasitized in a 1:10 ratio with stationary phase promastigotes and then treated with different concentrations of 
   <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf extract. Percent reduction in the parasite load was determined as described in the method. (D) Intramacrophagic parasites were stained with modified Giemsa stain. The images were captured at 100X under oil immersion.
