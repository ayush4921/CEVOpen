While there is a growing interest in medicinal mushrooms in Western countries and an increasing number of pre-clinical studies indicate distinct anti-cancer and regenerative properties, little is known about their potential relevance for clinical practice. This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical evidence, significance and potential role of medicinal mushrooms in complementary cancer care. Scientific databases for (randomized) controlled clinical trials evaluating whole spectrum formulations of medicinal mushrooms (mushroom powder and mushroom extracts) in cancer patients during and/or after conventional oncological treatment were searched. Eight studies met our inclusion criteria (eight randomized controlled trials, one controlled clinical trial). The medicinal mushrooms investigated were <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic> (two trials), <italic>Agaricus blazei murill</italic> (two trials), <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (one trial), <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> (one trial) and <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (three trials); all were compared to placebo and administered orally. A variety of cancer entities, outcomes and treatment durations were observed. Study results suggested beneficial effects of medicinal mushrooms, particularly quality of life and reduction of adverse effects of conventional therapies. Also, positive effects on antitumor activity and immunomodulation were reported, e.g., an increased activity of natural killer cells. In addition, results might suggest a longer survival of cancer patients receiving mushroom preparations, although in most studies this was not significant when compared to placebo. Adverse events of treatment with medicinal mushrooms were poorly reported; gastrointestinal reactions and a decrease in platelet cell count occurred in some cases. The methodological quality of most studies was generally unsatisfying and most results were insufficiently reported in several respects. Medicinal mushrooms may have a therapeutic potential for cancer patients during and after conventional oncological care with regards to quality of life, reduction of adverse effects of conventional care and possibly other surrogate parameters like immune function. There is an urgent need to investigate the safety and possible interactions of medicinal mushrooms. High-quality clinical research is warranted in order to clarify the potential of medicinal mushrooms in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>medicinal mushrooms</kwd><kwd>integrative oncology</kwd><kwd>integrative medicine</kwd><kwd>medicinal fungi</kwd><kwd>complementary medicine</kwd><kwd>Integrative medicine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a major global threat and is the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries after cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration et al., 2017</xref>). Conventional cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormone-targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These treatments can have various side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, skin or mucous membrane irritation, pain, fatigue, bone marrow suppression or immunosuppression, which may lead to higher infection rates and can significantly affect quality of life during or post oncological treatments (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Urruticoechea et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite the growing success of conventional personalized cancer therapies, recurrence and metastases remain common, depending on the type of cancer and the stage of disease (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, a large number of patients are diagnosed when in advanced stages, leaving little treatment options but for palliative care (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Haun et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The use of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is widespread and widely accepted in cancer patients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Astin, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ernst and Cassileth, 1998</xref>). Studies have shown that 20&#x02013;50% of cancer patients use some form of CIM therapies as an add-on to conventional treatments (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ernst and Cassileth, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2019</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms have been used in traditional Asian medical systems continually for several centuries (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Mushrooms have been identified to possess many medicinal functions (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2014</xref>), including antioxidant (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2016</xref>), antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Shigesue et al., 2000</xref>), immunomodulating (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2013</xref>), antitumoral (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Reis et al., 2015</xref>), hepatoprotective (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), antidiabetic (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), prebiotic properties (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singdevsachan et al., 2016</xref>). These properties were primarily demonstrated in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Mushrooms are high in protein (up to 40%), vitamins, fiber, minerals, trace elements and are low in calories and cholesterol (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2010</xref>). Higher basidiomycetes mushrooms (pillar mushrooms/stand mushrooms) contain various types of biologically active, high-molecular (e.g., &#x000df;-glucans) and low-molecular compounds (e.g., triterpenes, lectins, steroids) in fruiting bodies, spores, culture mycelia and culture broth, with suggested anticarcinogenic effects (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wasser and Weis, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2017</xref>). They contain various compounds that intervene in signaling pathways of tumor-specific proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, cancer-specific metabolism, angiogenesis, metastasis and key functions of the immune system (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blagodatski et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several extracts from medicinal mushrooms such as polysaccharides and in particular &#x000df;-glucans, e.g., krestin and polysaccharide peptide (PSP) from <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic>, and lentinan, isolated from <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic> (Shiitake), have been investigated <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> and in studies in humans (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>). Many clinical studies have been conducted on the complementary use of these substances, e.g., in conjunction with chemotherapy. The results indicate relevant health benefits such as overall disease-free survival of colorectal cancer patients and in improving quality of life among lung cancer patients (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). A wide range of antitumoral or immunostimulating polysaccharides with different chemical structure from higher basidiomycetes mushrooms has been widely investigated (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2002</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms have been approved for more than 30 years in Japan and China as an adjunct to standard cancer treatments and have an extensive clinical history of safe use as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although very popular in East Asia, medicinal mushroom therapies are still largely unknown in Western countries, especially in conventional medical institutions. The medicinal use of mushrooms is becoming wide known within the CIM communities of Europe and the United States. The number of studies on medical mushrooms in oncology has increased in recent decades (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>). Apart from focusing on certain mushroom-derived mono-substances, such as PSP, lentinan and krestin, research into the entire spectrum of mushroom formulations is considered promising. The large number of active ingredients of medicinal mushrooms is suspected to synergistically act on several cancer-related pathways (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A single mushroom species may contain several of active ingredients which have the potential to influence several cancer-related processes in a synergistic way (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blagodatski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>). As such research on complex synergistic anticancer effects caused by combinations of molecules in mushroom extracts seems particularly important.</p><p>The purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate clinical trials (CTs) investigating the effects of medicinal mushrooms in the supportive, complementary therapy of cancer patients during and/or post conventional care. They are currently mostly multi-substance formulations and are available in the form of powders, tablets, capsules or other extract forms. In this paper we focused on clinical studies which investigated the effects of these formulations on immune function, quality of life, well-being and their adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CENTRAL, the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International CTs Registry Platform Search Portal from inception until June 2020, with no restrictions on the date of publication.

In patients with multiple myeloma, the immune status was much better in terms of white blood cells and immunoglobins, which also led to fewer infections when treated with <italic>Agaricus blazei murill</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tangen et al., 2015</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms could help to counteract bone marrow suppression induced by chemo- and radiotherapy (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hofer and Pospisil, 2011</xref>). Their main component, &#x000df;-glucans, have hematopoietic effects and improve bone marrow regeneration <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Sorimachi et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Several reviewed studies showed a possible improved therapeutic response to chemo- and radiotherapy. Tsai et al. observed an advantage in the 6-months OS and mortality rate in favor of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>). The medicinal mushroom preparation was given for 4 weeks, most likely too short a duration to produce significant changes. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> showed inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell lines, and sensitization of radio/chemotherapy of cancer stem cells (CSC) by modulation of microRNA expression (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Another <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed an association between the CSC-inhibitory effect of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> and significant downregulation of several microRNAs and cancer stemness expression levels in brain and breast CSCs (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A Cochrane review of five RCTs using <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> showed that cancer patients (especially lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer) in the verum group were more likely to respond positively compared to placebo and chemo/radiotherapy alone (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.51, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). The treatment with <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> alone did not show the same regression rate as the combined therapy.</p><p>A meta-analysis including 1,094 patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer treated with polysaccharide K, a main ingredient of <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic>, showed an OS risk ratio of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55&#x02013;0.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). The disease-free survival risk ratio was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Another meta-analysis including 3,117 patients of 38 RCTs in China showed an overall response rate in treating lung cancer treated with lentinanIV (1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;mg/d, 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks, depending on the study), a main ingredient of <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic>, was increased from 43.3% of chemotherapy alone to 56.9% of lentinan plus chemotherapy. Compared with chemotherapy alone, lentinan plus chemotherapy showed more efficacy in treating lung cancer (pooled RR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.74&#x02013;0.85) (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, adverse effects were rarely reported. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common problem, which may be due to the high amount of dietary fiber and prebiotics known to cause mild stomach upset such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. Tsai et al. observed a significant decrease in platelet count in patients treated with <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic>, despite the short treatment duration of 30&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>). The data indicated a large difference in the decline in platelet levels between the two groups in patients with lung cancer (84 vs. 5%) and gastric cancer (22 vs. 5%) which could not be explained properly. Also patients with colorectal cancer treated for 6&#x000a0;months with <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic> showed reduced platelet counts compared to placebo (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fortes et al., 2009</xref>). The relevance of a reduced platelet count was unclear and needs further investigation. The assessment of adverse effects of medicinal mushrooms as well as the correct dosage and possible drug interactions must be further clarified in future CTs.</p><p>The postulated mechanisms of action are still vague and diverse. Secondary metabolites of medicinal mushrooms may produce health benefits and anticancer effects by activating stress resistance mechanisms, including autophagy, DNA repair and expression of antioxidant enzymes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kalaras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al., 2020</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms are recognized as immunomodulators and anti-cancer agents that are able to disrupt certain cellular signal transmission pathways, which are associated with cancer development and progression (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Silva et al., 2012</xref>). The biochemical mechanisms that mediate this biological activity are still not clearly understood. Several pathways, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects triggered by medicinal mushrooms have been described (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ayeka, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>). Mushroom polysaccharides are known to stimulate latent natural killer cells, T cells, B cells and macrophage-dependent immune system responses (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2017</xref>). Several species of medicinal mushrooms have shown anti-tumour properties in experimental studies (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2011</xref>). However, much of the evidence is based on results of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> animal data (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Silva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Compounds of mushrooms may produce hermetic dose-response effects, with potentially beneficial effects at low doses and toxic effects at high doses in normal cells, while in cancer cells only the toxic effects at high doses are potentially beneficial (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese, 2005</xref>). The supposed hormetic effects of fungochemicals seem to be relatively modest in humans, which may explain why such effects are observable in animal models but less obvious in clinical studies (where several variables and opposing factors may dilute such effects).</p><p>Natural killer cells play an important role in innate immunity by recognizing major histocompatibility class I-negative target cells, which can escape immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells. A Cochrane review of five RCTs using <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> as complementary cancer therapy showed that patients in the verum group had increased natural killer cell activity and increased levels of CD3, CD4 and CD8, leukocytes, and CD4/CD8 ratio (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Moreover there is evidence that orally taken medicinal mushrooms have an influence on the microbiome (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jayachandran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2019</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms could act as prebiotics that can stimulate the growth of beneficial microbiota. Prebiotics can modulate the human intestinal microbiota and can attenuate various disease such as diabetes, obesity and cancer (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>). The important sources of prebiotics in mushrooms are indigestible polysaccharides, which can inhibit the proliferation of pathogens by promoting the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singdevsachan et al., 2016</xref>). Poor intestinal microbiota can contribute to the development of cancer and various metabolic disorders leading to inflammation in the intestine, liver and brain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Boulang&#x000e9; et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vivarelli et al., 2019</xref>). Isolated substances from medicinal mushrooms such as crestin and lentinan administered IV are most likely to have different mechanisms of action <italic>in vivo</italic> than orally taken full-spectrum mushroom formulations. Future studies are necessary to compare the effects of extracts and isolated substances.There is a lack of conclusive evidence on dosage of medicinal mushrooms. First <italic>in vivo</italic> dose escalation studies were identified. Torkelson et al. conducted a controlled dose escalation study with nine breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy receiving <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> for 6&#x000a0;weeks (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Torkelson et al., 2012</xref>). A faster recovery was observed in the medium and high dose patients (6 and 9&#x000a0;g/day). Further research is needed to determine the correct dose of medicinal mushrooms, as well as possible interactions with chemotherapeutic agents, in order to make it a safe treatment during conventional cancer therapy. In addition, the quality of the products is of crucial importance, as contamination with mold, pesticides and heavy metals could be a problem for herbal products from natural sources (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>There are several relevant limitations to the reviewed studies, particularly the small study populations (ranging from n = 15 to n = 198), short treatment periods (ranging from 3&#x000a0;weeks to 6&#x000a0;months), studies examining various tumor entities (breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, lung, hepatocellular cancer, multiple myeloma), lack of information about the exact ethnicity of the study participants and non-standardized mushroom preparations. The methodological quality of most studies was unsatisfactory and most results were poorly reported in many respects (especially between-group comparisons were missing quite often). Future studies should be reported with the assistance of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. In addition, detailed information about production, composition and bio-active ingredients were mentioned only in a few of the reviewed studies and there only partially. Furthermore, this review included only English publications. It is likely that further studies can be found in Chinese and Japanese databases. Four out of five RCTs of the Cochrane review were in Chinese and were published in Chinese journals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This narrative review shows possible potential of medicinal mushrooms in complementary cancer treatment. Promising anticarcinogenic effects have been documented <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for several medicinal mushrooms. However, only few clinical studies defined OS or time to disease progression as primary endpoints. Others were too short in duration as to be fitting to strengthen this hypothesis. Immunomodulating effects such as the proliferation of lymphatic cell lines, immunoglobulins and cytokines have also been documented in humans.</p><p>It is likely that medicinal mushrooms could improve quality of life during and after conventional cancer therapy. Their prebiotic effects pose a possible explanation, as do other, yet unknown effects. A better emotional and physical status, better sleep and less fatigue, as well as fewer side effects of conventional chemotherapy such as nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal symptoms could be observed in the reviewed CTs on patients taking medicinal mushrooms.</p><p>Adverse events of treatment with medicinal mushrooms were poorly reported but appeared to be rare. The relevance of a reduced platelet count remains unclear and requires further investigation. The correct dosage and possible drug interactions also need to be further clarified in future clinical studies. There is an urgent need to investigate efficacy and safety of medicinal mushrooms in well planned CTs as more and more patients use mushrooms as a co-medication.</p><p>However, current knowledge does not support the routine use of medicinal mushrooms in cancer patients. The decision whether to use medicinal mushrooms as an add-on treatment in cancer care should remain patients&#x02019; preferences for now, assisted by evidence-informed physicians. Currently, evidence for the use of medicinal mushrooms in cancer is rather scarce and the methodological quality of most of the reviewed studies is poor. The existing evidence only allows for preliminary conclusions. The lack of standardization in several aspects of the included studies, such as inconsistent preparation methods and different modes of administration of medicinal mushrooms as well as the lack of key information in the reviewed publications, reduces the reliability and validity of those studies.</p><p>A special feature of medicinal mushrooms might be, as they produce hundreds of active compounds, that they may influence several cancer-related processes in a synergistic way. Therefore, not only studies on certain mushroom-derived compounds are warranted, but also further research on complex anticancer effects facilitated by combinations of molecules could be of great interest.</p><p>In summary, despite the promising preliminary data, more scientific work needs to be done to clarify the use of medicinal mushrooms in cancer therapy. Particularly, further clinical research is needed, including methodologically high-quality studies, larger sample sizes, standard mushroom preparations and longer-term follow-up studies. In addition, future studies should also investigate the preventive aspects of medicinal mushrooms, as medicinal mushrooms or more common types of mushrooms can also be effective in reducing cancer incidence as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MJ conceived the manuscript, gathered information, assembled <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and wrote part of the paper.
