<p>Several reviewed studies showed a possible improved therapeutic response to chemo- and radiotherapy. Tsai et al. observed an advantage in the 6-months OS and mortality rate in favor of

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with 
 <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> showed inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell lines, and sensitization of radio/chemotherapy of cancer stem cells (CSC) by modulation of microRNA expression (
