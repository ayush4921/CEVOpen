<p>The purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate clinical trials (CTs) investigating the effects of medicinal mushrooms in the supportive, complementary therapy of cancer patients during and/or post conventional care. They are currently mostly multi-substance formulations and are available in the form of powders, tablets, capsules or other extract forms. In this paper we focused on clinical studies which investigated the effects of these formulations on immune function, quality of life, well-being and their adverse effects.</p>
