<p>Several extracts from medicinal mushrooms such as polysaccharides and in particular ÃŸ-glucans, e.g., krestin and polysaccharide peptide (PSP) from 
 <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic>, and lentinan, isolated from 
 <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic> (Shiitake), have been investigated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in studies in humans (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>). Many clinical studies have been conducted on the complementary use of these substances, e.g., in conjunction with chemotherapy. The results indicate relevant health benefits such as overall disease-free survival of colorectal cancer patients and in improving quality of life among lung cancer patients (
