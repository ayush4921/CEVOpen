<p id="Par13">Based on this definition, a signal can be supported by diverse levels of evidence, ranging from one or more reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to observational studies and randomized clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] can be highlighted solely by statistical associations resulting from ratios of observed versus expected numbers of reports (i.e. disproportionality) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Different stakeholders can detect signals—including regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, academics, independent research organizations, or patients and their carers—and avail themselves of several channels to disseminate them, such as peer-reviewed articles, abstracts, drug bulletins, websites, and restricted publications. Minutes of meetings of committees can also document discussions relating to signals [
