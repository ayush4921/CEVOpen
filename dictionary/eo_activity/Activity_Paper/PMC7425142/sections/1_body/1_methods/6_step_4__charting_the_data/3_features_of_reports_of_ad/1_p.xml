<p id="Par59">To extract the features of reports of ADRs that were considered as supporting putative causal relationships, we shall include a set of pre-determined codes in the extraction form as multiple-choice checkboxes, each followed by a free-text field. These are “Time-to-onset”, “Dose-response relationship”, “Positive de-challenge”, “Positive re-challenge”, “Site-specificity of ADR”, and “Population-specificity of ADR”. Quotations from the full texts will be inserted in the respective free-text field. DS has been involved in qualitative assessments of reports of ADRs, and the codes have been based on his experience.</p>
