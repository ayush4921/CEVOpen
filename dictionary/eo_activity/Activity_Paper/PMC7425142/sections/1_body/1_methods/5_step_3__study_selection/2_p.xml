<p id="Par42">Clearly, these criteria are insufficient for discarding all irrelevant publications, and we may obtain a large list of references. We shall therefore stipulate that any retrieved study should concern patients (i.e. excluding simulations and animal studies). We have therefore devised criteria for exclusion. First, descriptive, experimental, and observational study designs that are not unequivocally conducted to detect signals, even though the original authors may have described their findings as “signals”. An explicit description of the findings as “signals” in the abstract and in the full text will be necessary for eligibility. Secondly, different thresholds for significance may be used in disproportionality analyses, e.g. PRR ≥ 2 with Σ
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 4 with or without a minimum of three reports of ADRs. To account for this, we shall not apply standard thresholds, but we will require the presence of a threshold for significance, whether referenced or in the full text.
