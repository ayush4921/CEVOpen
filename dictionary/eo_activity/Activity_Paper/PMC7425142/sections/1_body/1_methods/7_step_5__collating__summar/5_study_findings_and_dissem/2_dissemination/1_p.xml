<p id="Par72">The results of the scoping review will consist of an overview of the levels of evidence underpinning signals. We shall highlight any discrepancies across stakeholders in levels of evidence, times to signal, and the most frequent features of reports of ADRs used to support putative causal relationships. We shall contextualize our findings with other published records and report the limitations of the study and recommendations for research. Variations from the published protocol will be presented and amendments made to the registered version. The full review will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.</p>
