<p id="Par65">Our study provides a plethora of scientific evidence that the different extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> from Nepali origin have astonishing potential on inhibiting free radicals as well as enzymes involved in digestion, skin related problems, and neurological disorders compared with the commercially available drugs. The great ability of this plant to inhibit those enzymes is basically due to the presence of active secondary metabolites.
