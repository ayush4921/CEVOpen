<p id="Par62">Melanin is an important component which helps in regulating physiology, pathology, and toxicology of several organs such as skin, eyes, and brain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Due to the high reactivity of tyrosinase, melanin reacts with amino acids and proteins to enhance the brown color pigmentation in the skin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The generation of ROS by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation adversely affects skin health by the activation of enzymes such as elastase that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the dermis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Thus, elastase inhibition is a useful approach to prevent skin alterations and premature skin aging. In our observation, crude methanol extract followed by water and ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> has tyrosinase inhibitory potential compared to standard drug Kojic acid. In comparison to the lipase, amylase and glucosidase inhibitory potential, crude extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> revealed comparatively lower inhibitory potential against tyrosinase and elastase. Only crude methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed the elastase inhibition compared to standard Quercetin. Whereas, crude water extract does not reveal any inhibition in the given concentration towards elastase enzymes. The presence of arbutin might be the defined source of tyrosinase inhibition from 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, the purification of those extracts might enhance the inhibitory potential of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> on the tyrosinase and elastase.
