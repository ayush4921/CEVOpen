<p id="Par64">The diverse secondary metabolites with ranges of pharmacological significance were isolated and studied from 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species. For example gallic acid, tannic acid, glucose, mucilage, bergenin, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, arbutin, phytol, damascenone, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, syringic acid, hyperoside, afzelechin, methyl gallate, paashaanolactone, etc. have been isolated from 
 <italic>Bergenia ciliata</italic>, 
 <italic>Bergenia ligulatas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bergenia stracheyi</italic> till date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Our HRMS data also revealed the presence of diverse secondary metabolites in the methanol extract, which might be the reason behind the higher bioactivities. These secondary metabolites possess marked bioactivities. Enzymes inhibitory tendencies of these extracts may be due to the presence of diverse bioactive molecules such as catechin, bergenin, and many other flavonoids molecules. Bergenin and catechin are the marker compound of 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species which are major bioactive ingredients in the herb–drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antihyperglycemic, immunostimulant, and antipyretic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Phenolic acids such as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, and ferulic acid are known to inhibit cancer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The major compound identified in 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> were Bergenin, catechin, arbutin, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, syringic acid, hyperoside, afzelechin, methyl gallate, paashaanolactone, astilbin, quercetin, kaemferol-7-O-glucoside, diosmetin, phloretin, and morin. Most of the compounds identified here are highly abundant in 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species. Arbutin is the great tyrosinase inhibitor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], morin has great antioxidant and cholinesterases inhibiting potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Flavonoids like afzelechin and quercetin show antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. All the identified compounds based on HRMS data were further verified with the literature report i.e. Arbutin, Gallic Acid, Protocatechuic Acid, Bergenin, Catechin and Syringic Acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], Hyperoside [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], Afzelechin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], Methyl Gallate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], Paashaanolactone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], Astilbin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], Quercetin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], Diosmetin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], Phloretin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], and Morin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. We firmly believe that presence of phenolic and flavonoids molecules are largely responsible for the bioactivities of 
 <italic>B. pacumbis</italic>.
