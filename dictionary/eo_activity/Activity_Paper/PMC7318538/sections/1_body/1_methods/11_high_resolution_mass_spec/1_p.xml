<p id="Par53">Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were performed using an HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS instrument on an Agilent 6520 quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer connected with Agilent 1200-HPLC system via Dual electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Agilent Technologies, USA). 1 mg/mL stock solution of methanol extract was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. The filtered stock solution was further diluted to 500 ppm using methanol. The prepared dilution was transferred into a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) autosampler vial for LC-MS analysis and 1 μL aliquot was injected into the HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS system. The Mass Hunter software version B.04.00 build 4.0.479.0 (Agilent Technology) was used to analyze chromatogram, mass spectra, exact mass calculation, and prediction of chemical formula of the identified compounds as by Singh et al.
