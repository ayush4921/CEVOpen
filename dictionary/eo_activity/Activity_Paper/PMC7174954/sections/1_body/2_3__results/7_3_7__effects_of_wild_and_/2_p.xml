<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values showed ABTS radical scavenging potential of all the extracts, and the standards were in the following order: vitamin C (standard) &gt; wild (methanol) &gt; cultivated (acetone) &gt; wild (acetone) &gt; wild (water) &gt; cultivated (methanol) &gt; cultivated (water) &gt; BHT (standard). Methanol extracts of the wild plants, acetone extracts of cultivated plants, and vitamin C showed the higher potential of ABTS as evaluated by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> which was greater than the least concentration evaluated. Methanol extracts and acetone extracts of the wild plants and acetone extracts of the cultivated plants showed higher potential of DPPH with IC
 <sub>50</sub> which was greater than the least concentration evaluated. The DPPH radical scavenging potential followed this trend: BHT &gt; wild (methanol) &gt; cultivated (acetone) &gt; wild (acetone) &gt; cultivated (water), wild (water) &gt; vitamin C. The acetone extracts of the cultivated plants showed no activity on the scavenging of the nitric oxide. The nitric oxide radical scavenging potential of all the extracts and the standards based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was in the decreasing order: BHT, wild (methanol) &gt; wild (water) &gt;cultivated (water) &gt;wild (acetone) &gt; cultivated (methanol) &gt; vitamin C &gt; BHT &gt; cultivated (acetone).
