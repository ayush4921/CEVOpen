<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the different solvent extracts of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> is compared to that of known antioxidants (vitamin C and BHT), and their respective concentrations and are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The DPPH radical scavenging potential in all solvent extracts and BHT significantly increased with increasing concentrations in both wild and cultivated plants. The methanol extracts of wild and cultivated plants showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at all concentrations except at 0.2 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL. The methanol extract of the cultivated plants exhibited a higher radical scavenging activity of 89.4, 90.77 and 92.05% at 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL concentrations, respectively. No significant difference (
