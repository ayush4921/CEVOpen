<p>Total flavonol content was estimated using the method of Mbabie et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Two millilitres (2 mL) of plant extracts (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> prepared in ethanol and 3 mL of 50 g/L sodium acetate solution. The absorption at 440 nm was measured after 2.5-hour incubation at 20°C. The total flavonol content was calculated as quercetin (mg/g) using the derived equation based on the calibration curve 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.0255
 <italic>x</italic> (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9812), where 
 <italic>Y</italic> is the quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) and 
 <italic>x</italic> is the absorbance. The formula used was 
 <italic>CV</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic>, as described above for total phenols.
