<p>Total proanthocyanidin was estimated as described by Kibiti and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Half a millilitre of 0.1 mg/mL of extract solution was mixed with 3 mL of 4% vanillin-methanol solution and 1.5 mL hydrochloric acid (HCL) and vortexed. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by the measurement of the absorbance at 500 nm. The experiment was done in triplicate. Proanthocyanidin content was evaluated using the calibration curve equation: 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.9038
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0449 (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9951), and was expressed as mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g using the formula from the equation 
 <italic>CV</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic>, where “
 <italic>C</italic>” is the concentration as derived from the calibration curve equation in mg/mL, “
 <italic>V</italic>” is the volume of the extract used in the assay in mL, and “
 <italic>m</italic>” is the mass of the extract used in the assay in “g”.
