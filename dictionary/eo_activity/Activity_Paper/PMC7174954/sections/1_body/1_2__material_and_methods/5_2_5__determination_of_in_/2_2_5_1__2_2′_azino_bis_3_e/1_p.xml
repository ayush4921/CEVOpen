<p>The method of Wintola and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was adopted for the determination of ABTS activity of the plant extract. The ABTS radical was generated by allowing a mixture of 7 mM ABTS and 2.4 mM potassium persulfate in the same ratio to react in the dark for overnight at room temperature. The solution was then diluted by mixing 1 mL ABTS in 60 mL of methanol to obtain the absorbance of 0.706 ± 0.001 units at 734 nm using a spectrophotometer. ABTS solution was freshly prepared for the assay. One millilitre (1 mL) of different concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/mL) of the extracts and standard drugs was allowed to react with 1 mL of ABTS radical in the dark for 7 minutes. The absorbance was taken using a spectrophotometer at 734 nm. The percentage inhibition of ABTS by the plant extract was compared with that of vitamin C and BHT as standards. The percentage inhibition of ABTS was calculated as
