<p>Nitric oxide is also an important cellular signaling molecule needed in low amounts to protect some vital organs in the human body, especially the liver and heart, from ischemic damage and hypertension. However, the overproduction of this molecule may cause inflammation and pathogenesis of various human diseases such as cardiovascular diseases which may be detrimental to human health. Higher nitric oxide observed in wild

It was also observed that extracts of wild and cultivated plants showed good nitric oxide scavenging activity as compared to those of the standards. The nitric oxide inhibiting ability of the plant extracts could partially justify the use of wild plants in the treatment of oxidative-induced ailments due to its higher scavenging activity.
