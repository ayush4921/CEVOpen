<p>The significantly higher phenolic content in the methanol and water extracts of cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> might indicate a certain stress parameter that may not be justified in this research. However, it may have been attributed to growing 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> outside its habitat. Similar results were also obtained by Soriano-Melgar et al. [

 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> could have pharmacological effects which may also be attributed to agromorphological divergence. These results also suggest that relocating these plants from the wild to nursery did not result in the loss of phenols. Therefore, results further confirm that the similarity in some of phytochemicals between the wild and cultivated plants may be helpful for the domestication of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> by medicinal plant users.
