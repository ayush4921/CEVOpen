 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with strong taproot and trifoliate leaves that have long and green petiole [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] pointed out that the flowers are borne on long, hairy peduncles arising from the stem nodes. The plant has oval or spherical pods that are about 3.0–3.7 cm long [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The developmental period of the plant ranges from 110-150 days under a mean temperature of 20–28 °C, well-drained soil and sandy loams with 5.0–6.5 pH values [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Bambara groundnut seed colouration varies from black, brown or red and sometimes stippled with numerous colours [

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The hulls are often removed before they are consumed. The removed hulls are regarded as a waste product. However, the work done by Klompong and Benjakul [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] has shown the hulls to be a source of nutraceuticals and functional ingredients. BGN is free from complete crop failure because of its ability to thrive well under harsh environmental stress conditions like low and uncertain rainfall and nitrogen-deficient soils [
