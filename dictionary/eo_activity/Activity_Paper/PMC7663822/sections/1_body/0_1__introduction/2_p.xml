<p>One of the emerging research areas of cosmetic and phytopharmaceuticals research is the design of green and sustainable methods for the extraction of bioactive natural products for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Besides the high yield of the desired natural product, the ideal extraction procedure should have low energy consumption and employ biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-flammable solvents [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One such solvent is glycerol, a natural, low-cost, non-toxic, biodegradable liquid. It is manufactured from renewable sources, e.g., as a by-product of biodiesel production [

An additional advantage of glycerol is its hygroscopic nature, which makes it one of the most widely used ingredients in creams and lotions, where it acts as a natural humectant, denaturant, fragrance ingredient, hair conditioning agent, oral care agent, skin protectant, and viscosity decreasing agent [

However, glycerol also significantly contributes to the efficacy of cough syrups due to its special properties of lubrication, demulcent effects, sweetness, and humectant activity [

Interestingly, in spite of the numerous advantages of glycerol as an extraction solvent, it is relatively underutilized in the production of extracts for pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical purposes. Some newer literature examples of glycerol use for extraction of natural products include the extraction of saponins and polyphenols from licorice [
