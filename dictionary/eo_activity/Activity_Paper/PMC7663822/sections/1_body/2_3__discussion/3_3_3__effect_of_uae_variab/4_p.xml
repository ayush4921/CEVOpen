<p>The influence of the amount of solvent used for the solidâ€“liquid extraction of a fixed amount of herbal material was also assessed. In this study, the employed amounts of solvent did not significantly affect the extraction efficiency of cichoric acid or TPA. This indicates that the concentrations of the target phenolic acids did not significantly change, even when a larger volume of solvent was employed. This finding has numerous positive ecological and economical implications, because a larger amount of product may be obtained from a fixed amount of herbal material without compromising the quality of the extract. In this way, the expensive herbal material may be more efficiently utilized.</p>
