<p>Finally, in order to impede the oxidative degradation of phenolic acids that may occur during the extraction, water-soluble antioxidant ascorbic acid was added to the reaction mixture and its influence on the phenolic acid concentration was investigated as the final independent variable. The intention of the ascorbic acid addition was to improve the extraction of phenolic acids by impeding oxidation processes that may occur during the extraction. Previous researchers have found that the addition of antioxidants to the previously prepared 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> glycerol extracts may improve the stability of the phenolic acids present therein [

Thus, it was expected that the addition of ascorbic acid to the glycerolâ€“water extraction mixtures would have the same effect on other phenolic substances. Surprisingly, the presence of ascorbic acid in the reaction mixture had a negative influence on all of the phenolic acids analyzed in this work. The process seemed to be time-dependent, as evidenced by the negative influences of time and ascorbic acid interaction. A possible explanation is that ascorbic acid either reacted with the analyzed phenolic acids or enabled their reaction with other natural substances present in the extracts [
