<p>Besides possible negative effects on the UAE of phenolic acids in the presence of ascorbic acid, some metals may also display beneficial bioactive properties. Since according to European legislation, 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> may be used in traditional medicines for prevention and treatment of the common cold and alleviation of skin disorders and minor wounds [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the content of zinc, the metal that may support skin- and immunity-related properties of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>, was also determined. The micronutrient zinc is important for maintenance and development of immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], it may likely contribute to wound healing when applied locally, as it has been found that the amount of zinc in the wound increases during the healing process. This may induce the keratinocyte proliferation, as it has been shown that keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation are controlled by zinc [
