<p>Antioxidants in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry may be regarded as prophylactic and therapeutic agents. They prevent the damage caused by free radicals and other reactive oxygen species, thus hindering the pathogenesis of various disorders such as aging, cancer, diabetes, as well as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, antioxidants protect pharmaceutical and cosmetic products against the oxidation that occurs during their storage and use. Such influences include UV radiation [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as free radicals- or metal-ion-induced peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, in which natural cosmetics and pharmaceuticals are especially rich [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this work, the RSA of the extracts prepared by maceration was determined. The RSA of the extracts prepared by UAE was not determined, because those extracts contained ascorbic acid, a strong antioxidant, the activity of which would clearly outperform the activity of phytochemicals from 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> and would indicate a falsely strong RSA. All the extracts prepared by maceration showed notable RSA. In general, 3 day maceration yielded the extracts with stronger RSA levels, with most 3 day extracts showing equal radical scavenging activity to BHA. The correlation between the phenolic content and the radical scavenging activity levels of the extracts was not significant. Similar observations were also reported by other authors [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This is not surprising, because caffeic acid derivatives are not the only substances with radical scavenging abilities in 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>. Various other phytochemicals, which were not determined within scope of this work but are present in 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>, such as phylloxanthobilins [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], may act as strong antioxidants and free radical scavengers.
