<p>In order to characterize the significance of independent variables and to select the most significant variables based on their output responses, a Pareto chart was used. The Pareto chart depends on the standard deviation to estimate the sampling errors of variables. Two important limits in the Pareto chart are the Bonferroni limit and the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit. Variables with coefficients above the Bonferroni limit are significant model factors. On the other hand, the terms that fall between the Bonferroni limit and the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit are considered likely to be significant, while the coefficients below the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit are insignificant [

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with high 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values (&gt;0.92), as well as confirming that only the statistically significant effects and the terms supporting the hierarchy were included in the model (details are presented in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05142">Supplementary Materials</xref>). The Pareto charts, along with the actual vs. predicted charts for the selected responses (caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and TPA), are presented in
