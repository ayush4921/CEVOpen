<p>In this work, the efforts were undertaken to optimize the UAE of phenolic acids from 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>. For this purpose, a two-level factorial design was used. The effects of the glycerol concentration (A), temperature (B), ultrasound power (C), time (D), ascorbic acid concentration (E), and the amount of solvent (F) were investigated. The independent variables and their levels are presented in
