    "<h4>Background and objectives</h4><i>Kigelia africana</i> is a medicinal plant growing naturally in many parts of Africa. In Kenya, a water concoction of the plant is used to treat breast and prostate cancers. Laboratory data on its anti-cancer activity and active principles is limited, hence no scientific rationale for its medicinal use. This study reports on <i>in-vitro</i> toxic activities of dichloromethane and methanol extracts of the plant against human breast cancer cells and phytochemical screening of the two extracts.<h4>Methodology</h4>Plant extracts were obtained by sequential solvent extraction of dry plant material (stem bark) using analytical grade dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) and methanol (Sigma Aldrich). <i>In-vitro</i> anti-cancer activities of the extracts were determined using the suphorhodamine (SRB) assay against a human breast cancer cell line (HCC 1937). Preliminary Thin layer chromatography of plant extracts was done using POLYGRAM® SIL G/UV<sub>254</sub> plates (Merck) to establish presence of different classes of secondary metabolites.<h4>Results</h4><i>In-vitro</i> cytotoxic activities of the two extracts were significantly different (<i>P</i> = 0.05). The methanol extract exhibited higher activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 26.02 μg/ml) compared to that of dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) (IC<sub>50</sub> = 55.01 μg/ml). Phyto-chemical screening of the two extracts revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenols, steroids and flavonoids.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The high <i>in-vitro</i> anti-cancer activities of solvent extracts of <i>Kigelia africana</i> justify its use in traditional medicine to manage breast cancer. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts reveal similar profiles hence the differences in their anti-cancer activities can be attributed to quantitative variations of various classes of secondary metabolites."
