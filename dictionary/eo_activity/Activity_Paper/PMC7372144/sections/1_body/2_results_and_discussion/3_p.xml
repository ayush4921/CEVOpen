<p id="p0055">At all tested concentrations, wells treated with methanol extract exhibited low absorbance values (low cell survival) compared to the dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) extract. The analysis of variance was done using a one way ANOVA at a P value of &lt;0.05 and the means were found to be significantly different with a P &lt; 0.0001. Percentage inhibition of cell growth by the two extracts was determined from respective absorbance values at all concentrations (
