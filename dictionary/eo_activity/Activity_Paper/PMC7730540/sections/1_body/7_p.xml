<p>Cassell et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] explored SAR trends, at the meta-position of Phe
 <sup>4</sup>, of the endogenous DOR peptide Leu
 <sup>5</sup>-enkephalin, demonstrating that substitution at this position variously regulated DOR and MOR affinity and G protein activity, enabled the fine-tuning of β-arrestin2 recruitment to both receptors, and increased the plasma stability of the derived peptides. The resulting peptide analogues should be useful tools for studying the role of DOR in cardiac ischemia and the importance of DOR mediated β-arrestin2 signaling in the peptides cardioprotective effects.
