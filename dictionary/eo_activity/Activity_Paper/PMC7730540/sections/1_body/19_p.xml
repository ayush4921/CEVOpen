<p>Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at three crystal structures of the MOR, Podlewska et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] explored the distinct activity profiles at the MOR of morphine (unbiased ligand), PZM21 and SR-17018 (G protein-biased MOR agonists) and fentanyl (Î²-arrestin2-biased MOR agonist). Several shared and distinct receptor-ligand interaction patterns were identified, and specific amino acids were proposed to be of particular interest when designing new G protein-biased MOR agonists.
