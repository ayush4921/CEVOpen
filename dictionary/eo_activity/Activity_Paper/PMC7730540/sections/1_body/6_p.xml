<p>In their report, Tymecka et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] performed a β
 <sup>2</sup>-
 <italic>Homo</italic>-amino acid (β
 <sup>2</sup>hAA) scan of the selective MOR peptide agonist TAPP (H-Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Phe-NH
 <sub>2</sub>) sequence, an analogue of endomorphin-2 and enkephalin-derived DAMGO. Derivatives with (R)- or (S)-β
 <sup>2</sup>hPhe
 <sup>4</sup> bound the MOR with affinities equal to that of TAPP. Combining design strategies, synthesis, binding assays and molecular modeling, they provided additional understanding of SARs of the TAPP sequence. Using a structure-based docking at the MOR and three-dimensional interaction pattern analysis, Dumitrascuta et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] rationalized the experimental results on binding and activation of the MOR by three synthetic analogues of the naturally occurring dermorphin and effective analgesics, DALDA, [Dmt
 <sup>1</sup>]DALDA and KGOP01. The Dmt (2′,6′-dimethyl-L-Tyr) moiety of [Dmt
 <sup>1</sup>]DALDA and KGOP01 represented the driving force for the high potency and agonist activity at the MOR. The findings of Tymecka et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Dumitrascuta et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] offer significant structural insights into flexible peptide ligand-MOR interactions that are important for further understanding of MOR function and pharmacology, and the future design of peptide-based analgesics.
