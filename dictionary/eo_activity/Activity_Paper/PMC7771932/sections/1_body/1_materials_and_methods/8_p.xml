 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> (MF) ethanol extract was used to evaluate antioxidant activity using DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), according to Young and his group method with some modification (Lee et al., 2013). Briefly, various concentrations of MF (10,20,30,40,50,60,70, 80) µl were added to 200 µl of DPPH (1mm) in 96 well/plate and kept in a dark place for 30 min, and measured the absorbance at 490 nm by a micro-plate reader (ELISA, Asyshitech., UK), the equation (1) was used to estimate antioxidant activity % of MF:
