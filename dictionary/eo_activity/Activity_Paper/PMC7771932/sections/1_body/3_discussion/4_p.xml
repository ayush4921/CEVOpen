<p>The previous studies of Iraqi 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>extracted by MAE did not reported anti-liver or anticancer properties in Iraq and worldwide. In this research, the anti-liver cancer activity of Iraqi 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>extracted by MAE and ethanol as extraction solvent was investigated using an MTT assay. The results showed a significant toxicity against HCAM cancer cells, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 541.7 Âµg/ml. This value indicates a substantial potency of the bioactive compounds. To enhance the MTT assay results, AO/EB staining method was used to detect apoptosis and DNA damage by using the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the extract in comparison with control cells (untreated cells). Apoptosis phase occurred in the HCAM cells because of the bioactive compounds function together of monoica extract, which supported the MTT assay results. MTT result combined with Nasir and his group results of Saudian monoica as anti- liver cancer cells promised the future uses of this wild herb in the traditional medicine and prevent liver diseases. Therefore, urgent further investigations of used MAE to isolate natural molecules from Iraqi 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>ethanol extract by MAE which responsible for the anti-liver cancer in the near future.
