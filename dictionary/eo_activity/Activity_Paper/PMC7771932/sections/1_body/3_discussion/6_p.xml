<p>In conclusion the type of extraction method and solvent play a role in the selectivity of chemical compositions of wild edible plants or medicinal plants. The microwave-assisted extraction method with GC-MS analysis provided an initial library of bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extract. The antioxidant and anti-liver cancer results could pave the way for the isolation of the molecules responsible for the anticancer action against HCAM liver cancer cells and mechanistic investigations. Therefore, suggested using regular daily doses of 
 <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> to enhance the prevention of liver cancer and diseases.
