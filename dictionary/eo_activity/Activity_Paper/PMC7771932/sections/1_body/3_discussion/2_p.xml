 <italic>M. orientalis </italic>were showed high antioxidant among all fern extracts (Carine et al., 2015). Hereby, used the DPPH method as a fast and inexpensive method with precise results to determine the antioxidant activity of the extract. The antioxidant action enhances the importance of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extracted by microwave-assisted extraction, which could possibly inhibit free radical formation in the body and prevent liver disease. Non of previous studies showed the antioxidant activity of monoica Forssk extracts and Itâ€™s the first report of antioxidant evaluation of Iraqi 
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extracted by MAE method.
