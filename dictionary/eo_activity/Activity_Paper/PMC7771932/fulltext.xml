Common wild edible plants include amaranth, asparagus, burdock, cattail, clovers, chickweed, and chicory (Tariku and Eyayo, 2017). They are reported to be used as ointments for wounds and possess antiviral activity. Various countries have been using wild edible plants species, like India, China, and some Arab and African countries (Geng et al., 2016). A number of wild edible plants grow in Iraq, but few studies have reported on their chemical compositions. One report showed the bacterial activity of 22 Iraqi wild plants (Abdulameer, 2014). One of the most famous wild edible plants in Iraq is <italic>Suaeda monoica Forssk</italic>, which belongs to the family <italic>Chenopodiaceae</italic> and grows in hypersaline soil (Iwona et al., 2014). It is used by Iraqi people in the southern region as a vegetable food and is available in vegetable shops or markets. It is believed to have health benefits, it has a good taste, and is non-toxic (Ali et al., 2018). One study investigated the phytoconstituents of a methanol extract of the wild plant in Saudi Arabia (Elsharabasy et al., 2019). People are suffering from liver diseases due to viruses, drugs, poisons, alcohol, cancer, and inherited diseases (Xiong and Guan, 2017). The long tradition of medicinal plants that have been used liver disease treatment could help to discover new plants with new bio-functions to prevent liver diseases and understand the mechanisms of action (Li et al., 2018). Wild plants could play a role in hepatic protection due their antioxidant content, which could prevent damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit free radical generation (Guan and He, 2015). The phyto-nutrients discovered in wild plants are growing and can be explored using different extraction methods and solvents (Traka and Mithen, 2011). Saline soils and environmental factors play a role in the chemical composition of wild plants (Ceccanti et al., 2019). In addition, their toxicity has to be evaluated, and the compositions of toxic compounds have to be determined to identify the toxicity of edible species and the safety of high and low-toxicity compounds like nitrites and oxalate (Yang et al., 2020). Thus, examining the toxicity of wild edible plants is very important to demonstrate the limits or high benefits of the components, while taking into consideration the development of cultivation techniques, which can also control or reduce the toxic compounds in the plants (Cornanra et al., 2018). Hence, Few reports have been used microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) for wild plants components with various solvents and compared with other extraction methods such as maceration and soxhlet extraction methods (Li et al., 2017). MAE exhibited high selective efficiency for the bioactive compounds (Belwal et al., 2017). The biological properties of wild plants components extracted by MAE have not yet reported, and one report showed high antioxidant activity of three wild edible mushrooms extracted by MAE (&#x000d6;zy&#x000fc;rek et al., 2014). Therefore, in the present research, used microwave-assisted extraction and ethanol solvent to investigate the bioactive compounds, antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-liver cancer properties of <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> (wild edible plant).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>

The chemical composition of <italic>S.</italic>
<italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extracted by microwave-assisted extraction have not yet reported. Therefore, used an ethanol extract of <italic>S.</italic>
<italic>monoica Forssk</italic> prepared via MAE method in constant conditions for the first time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 (a)</xref>. The compounds contain N and O in their structures as derivatives of amino acids, fatty acids, and phenol or toxic compounds such nitrites and oxalate. These are important for human health due to their biological functions and cannot be produced by the body. Compared the results to those of Elsharabasy and his group (Elsharaby et al., 2019), who used different solvents and extraction methods for wild Saudi Arabian <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic>. The results exhibited some similar and selective bioactive compounds. The environmental effects of the soil play an important role in the secondary metabolism of wild plant growth to produce bioactive compounds, and recommend using microwave-assisted extraction as an extraction method in future experiments for the isolation of natural molecules from medicinal plants. </p><p>The antioxidant actions of wild plants as food are important due to their functions in the body. Therefore, discovering new edible wild plants with high or moderate antioxidant activity could provide enhanced health benefits against human diseases. Carine and her group found that roots of <italic>O. japonica </italic>and fronds of <italic>M. orientalis </italic>were showed high antioxidant among all fern extracts (Carine et al., 2015). Hereby, used the DPPH method as a fast and inexpensive method with precise results to determine the antioxidant activity of the extract. The antioxidant action enhances the importance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extracted by microwave-assisted extraction, which could possibly inhibit free radical formation in the body and prevent liver disease. Non of previous studies showed the antioxidant activity of monoica Forssk extracts and It&#x02019;s the first report of antioxidant evaluation of Iraqi <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extracted by MAE method.</p><p>The studies have been showed the importance of wild edible plants against cancer diseases. Jianling and his group found that C. sanguine extract showed significant inhibition against Hep-2 and MGC-803 tumor cells (Jiangling et al., 2013). Yiftach and his group found that Silybum marianum L. is antioxidant wild edible and enhance liver cells regeneration (Yiftach et al., 2008). Gnocchi and his group found that ethyl acetate of <italic>Brassica oleracea </italic>L. and <italic>Crithmum maritimum L</italic>. was promised in prevent growth of Hepatocellular carcinoma (Gnocchi et al., 2020). Mariangela and her group found that <italic>Origanum vulgare L</italic>. showed significant anti-proliferative against liver cancer cells HepG2 (Mariangel et al., 2015). Nasir and his group used percolation extraction method by ethanol and then used four solvent (dicholormethane, ethyl acetate,, hexane and n-butanol) for extract fractions of S. monoica. Among the four solvents, dichloromethane was the most active in cells proliferation of HepG2 and it subjected for isolation the four compounds from Saudi Arabic <italic>Saueda monoica Forssk</italic> and found among them only two compounds showed a potential action against liver cancer cells HepG2 (Nasir et al., 2020). </p><p>The previous studies of Iraqi <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>extracted by MAE did not reported anti-liver or anticancer properties in Iraq and worldwide. In this research, the anti-liver cancer activity of Iraqi <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>extracted by MAE and ethanol as extraction solvent was investigated using an MTT assay. The results showed a significant toxicity against HCAM cancer cells, and the IC<sub>50</sub> value was 541.7 &#x000b5;g/ml. This value indicates a substantial potency of the bioactive compounds. To enhance the MTT assay results, AO/EB staining method was used to detect apoptosis and DNA damage by using the IC<sub>50</sub> value of the extract in comparison with control cells (untreated cells). Apoptosis phase occurred in the HCAM cells because of the bioactive compounds function together of monoica extract, which supported the MTT assay results. MTT result combined with Nasir and his group results of Saudian monoica as anti- liver cancer cells promised the future uses of this wild herb in the traditional medicine and prevent liver diseases. Therefore, urgent further investigations of used MAE to isolate natural molecules from Iraqi <italic>S. monoica Forssk </italic>ethanol extract by MAE which responsible for the anti-liver cancer in the near future.</p><p>To our knowledge, it&#x02019;s a first report of apoptosis and cell cycle of S. monoica extracted by MAE against liver cancer cells HCAM. IC<sub>50</sub> value of <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> used to detect early and late apoptosis of HCAM cancer cells for 24h. The results showed late apoptosis (Q2= 48.5%,) higher than the control value of untreated cells (Q2= 42.1%,) and reduced early apoptosis value (Q1). Maybe the time of extract exposure could play a function in increasing of late apoptosis ratio in time independent. In addition, G1, S, G2 phases of HCAM cancer cells cycle identified via IC<sub>50</sub> value of <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extract. The results showed reduced of G2 and S ratios, while increased G1 ratio in the treated cells compared with untreated cells. Indicated that <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extracted by MAE arrested liver cancer cells cycle at G1 phase.</p><p>In conclusion the type of extraction method and solvent play a role in the selectivity of chemical compositions of wild edible plants or medicinal plants. The microwave-assisted extraction method with GC-MS analysis provided an initial library of bioactive compounds of <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extract. The antioxidant and anti-liver cancer results could pave the way for the isolation of the molecules responsible for the anticancer action against HCAM liver cancer cells and mechanistic investigations. Therefore, suggested using regular daily doses of <italic>S. monoica Forssk</italic> to enhance the prevention of liver cancer and diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are thankful to Mr. Hasan Al-Shawi for his assistant in doing GC-MS analysis at Nahran omar location, Basrah province, Iraq.
