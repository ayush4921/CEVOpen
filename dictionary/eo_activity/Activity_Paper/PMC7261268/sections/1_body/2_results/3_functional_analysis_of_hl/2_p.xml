<p id="Par16">To verify the influence of the central globular domain of HLF4, we constructed the following hybrid variants of HLF4, HLF3, and HLF1V: HLF-Hyb4a (N- and C-termini of HLF1V fused to the central globular domain of HLF4), HLF-Hyb4b (N-terminus and central globular domain of HLF1V fused to the C-terminal tail of HLF4b), HLF-Hyb4c (N-terminus of HLF3 fused to the central globular domain of HLF1V and the C-terminal tail of HLF4b), and finally HLF-Hyb4d (N-terminus of HLF4 fused to the central globular domain of HLF1V and the C-terminal tail of HLF4b) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Again, all hybrid factors were expressed, purified, and functionally tested. Neither HLF-Hyb4a nor HLF-Hyb4d displayed any anti-thrombin activities. In contrast, both HLF-Hyb4b and HLF-Hyb4c did (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Strikingly, the thrombin-inhibitory potency of HLF-Hyb4c (containing the N-terminus of HLF3) was much higher compared to that of HLF-Hyb4b (containing the N-terminus of HLF1V), an observation that is in line with the data obtained for HLF-Hyb3b and HLF-Hyb3c (see above). Like for HLF3 (see above), the central globular domain of HLF4 prevents any anti-thrombin activity of respective factors.
