<p id="Par12">The main aim of the present study was to characterize the hirudin-like factors HLF3 and HLF4 in their ability to negatively influence thrombin activity in human plasma and hence the blood coagulation cascade. Both naturally occurring and genetically modified variants of the respective hirudin-like factors were tested in thrombin time coagulation assays, especially synthetic hybrid molecules containing combinations of domains of HLFV1, HLF3, or HLF4.</p>
