<p id="Par17">In previous investigations, we have analyzed and functionally characterized the hirudin-like factors HLF1 and HLF2 as well as natural and synthetic hybrid variants thereof (MÃ¼ller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). A similar approach was applied to analyze and functionally characterize the hirudin-like factors HLF3 and HLF4 too. As a result, we expected a more detailed impression on the importance of the three distinct functional units of all hirudin and HLF molecules (namely the N-terminus, the central globular domain, and the C-terminal tail) on their respective thrombin-inhibitory and hence anti-coagulatory capacities.
