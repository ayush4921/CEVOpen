  <italic>Sargassum fulvellum</italic> is a brown seaweed of the Sargassaceae family which has been demonstrated to exhibit antipyretic, analgesic, antiedema, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, neuroprotective, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities. It has been widely used as a food additive and as a medicine in oriental medicine to treat lumps, dropsy, swelling, testicular pains, and urinary problems. 
  <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> has been identified as a potential producer of a wide spectrum of natural compounds such as carotenoids, fucoidans, and phlorotannins, showing different biological activities in various industrial applications including pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and functional food. However, the promising health effects associated with the extracts and compounds isolated from 
  <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> have not been reviewed to date. The present review thus focuses on the biological activity of 
  <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> as reported by previous publications, which include antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer effects. Thus, this review might serve to increase the utilization of this invaluable natural source as a potential component in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.
