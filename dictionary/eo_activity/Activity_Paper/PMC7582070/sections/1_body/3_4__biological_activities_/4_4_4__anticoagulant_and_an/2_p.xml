<p>The compounds and extracts of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> also possess anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects, and it was thought that sulfated polysaccharides were responsible for this [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. De Zoysa et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that the anticoagulant activity of fermented 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> sulfated polysaccharides was closely related to the inhibition of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation, but not to the inhibition of thrombin activity or fibrin polymerization. Freeze-dried 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> was fermented in an incubator for 10 weeks at 25°C to convert seaweed macromolecules into anticoagulant sulfated polysaccharides (ASP). The anticoagulant activity of ASP was measured using activated partial thromboplastin (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin (PT) clotting time assays. The results suggested that both ASP and heparin showed a relative clotting factor of 27.47 at the concentrations of 180 and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Chemical characterization further showed that 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> ASP had a considerable amount of negatively charged sulfate, which may be able to interact with coagulation factors and thus initiate the coagulation inhibition [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In another study, Jo and Choi [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] investigated the P-selectin binding and the antithrombotic and hemolytic activity of the depolymerized fucoidans extracted from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic>. The fucoidans degraded by ultrasound (US) or electron beam (EB) irradiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution and the low molecular weight fucoidans (LMWFs) prevented P-selectin binding to Sialyl Lewis X with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration 50) of 20 nM as compared to heparin (400 nM) and dextran sulfate (25,000 nM). This means that LMWFs in this study were much more effective in antithrombotic activity than heparin and dextran sulfate. Notably, the LMWFs showed no hemolytic activity at concentrations of up to 950 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Thus, it might be justified to state that LMWF is safer than heparin and its constituents in clinical use. These results showed that 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> sulfated polysaccharide (fucoidan) has high blood anticoagulation activity and significantly prolongs the time preceding thrombosis and shortens thrombosis duration.
