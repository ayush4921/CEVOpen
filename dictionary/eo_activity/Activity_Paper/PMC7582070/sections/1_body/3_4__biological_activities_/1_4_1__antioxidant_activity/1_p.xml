<p>Oxidative stress has been associated with a number of lifestyle-related diseases, such as aging, arthritis, atherosclerosis, emphysema, cancer, and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Marine seaweeds have been considered one of the main sources of natural antioxidants. Antioxidant properties 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were tested in different ways, including free radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. An antioxidant evaluation was performed on fucoidan (named SFSP, molecular weight (MW) = 529 kDa) extracted from 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> harvested from Jeju City. SFSP was selected because it exhibited more potent activity than the commercially available antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole and 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol. Results showed a dose-dependent hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity in the V79-4 cell line and a promising 
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>α</italic>-diphenyl-
 <italic>β</italic>-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity when compared to the commercial fucoidans (
 <italic>Fucus vesiculosus and Undaria pinnatifida</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These fucoidans contained a significant amount of phenolic compounds, which suggested that the antioxidant activities of fucoidan could be attributed to the combined effect of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds. Interestingly, a study on the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> methanolic extract (named SFME) demonstrated that it can strongly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and DPPH free radicals. In addition, SFME also showed higher polyphenolic content (7.56 mg/g), which was correlated with superoxide anion and DPPH free radical scavenging abilities [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These results indicate that further investigations are needed to identify and purify the responsible antioxidative components. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] investigated the antioxidant properties of polysaccharides in 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> extracts prepared using Celluclast (SFC) and found that SFCs scavenged DPPH, alkyl, and hydroxyl radicals, especially the alkyl radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.45 ± 0.11 mg/mL). Additionally, SFCs significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels and improved the viability of 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride- (AAPH-) induced Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner. To date, the relationships between the antioxidant activity, structural features, and chemical structure of various polysaccharides are still unclear. Fortunately, various reports have indicated that the antioxidant activities of polysaccharides may be correlated with intrinsic viscosity and MW [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as well as monosaccharide composition, chemical structures, uronic acid content, and chain conformations [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Future studies also need to investigate the mechanisms underlying 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> antioxidant activity. They should also aim to improve antioxidant inhibition assays, which will be helpful for understanding the relationship between the chemical structures and antioxidant properties. The summarized antioxidant activities of the biologically active components of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> provide a comprehensive evaluation of its value as a natural antioxidant source (
