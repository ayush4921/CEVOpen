 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> is a popular and inexpensive edible brown seaweed that is rich in nutrients (carbohydrates, unsaturated fatty acids, protein composition, vitamins, and minerals) and in natural bioactive compounds, such as phlorotannins, grasshopper ketones, and polysaccharides. Over the past twenty years, phytochemical investigations have led to the isolation of a large number of bioactive SFPs and other purified fractions. Bioactive low-molecule compounds (phlorotannins, fucoxanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, peridinin, fucoxanthinol, etc.) and polysaccharides are considered the major constituents of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> that show many pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anticoagulant, and neuroprotective activities. However, systemic data are still insufficient regarding the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this seaweed, especially target-organ toxicity; therefore, more investigations should be performed in the future. Furthermore, the biological activities of polysaccharides are closely related to their rheological properties, MW, chemical structures, constituent monosaccharides, substituent groups, and chain conformations [
