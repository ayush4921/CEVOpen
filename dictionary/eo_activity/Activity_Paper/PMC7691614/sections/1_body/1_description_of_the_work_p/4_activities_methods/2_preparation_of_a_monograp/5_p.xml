<p>Scientific databases such as `PubMed/Medline′, ‘Scopus′, ‘Google Scholar′ and ‘Web of Science′ were searched in order to retrieve relevant publications, with the last update being in mid‐March 2020. Numerous search strategies were used, including different names of the plant species of interest (i.e. ‘
 <italic>Annona muricata’</italic>, ‘soursop’, ‘graviola’) in connection with terms related to the endpoints of interest, as for instance ‘adverse effects’, ‘toxicity’ or ‘safety’. This represented the basis for identifying scientific evidence provided in peer‐reviewed scientific publications in relation to compounds of potential concern contained in 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>, alongside with toxicological data and studies reporting adverse health outcomes in humans. Additionally, scientific abstracts, reports as well as pertinent evaluations performed by scientific bodies or national and international authorities dealing with food and drug safety were checked as well. Moreover, the key grey literature was considered, including articles published in non‐scientific journals, project reports, and other forms of documentation outside of scientific literature.
