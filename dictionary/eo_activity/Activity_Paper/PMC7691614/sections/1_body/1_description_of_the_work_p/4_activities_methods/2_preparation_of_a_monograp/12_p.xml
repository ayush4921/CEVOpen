<p>Regarding 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> preparations that might be used in food supplements, the composition of such preparations may differ considerably, depending, among others, on conditions of plant growth, conditions of harvest, part of plant used, method of extraction and further processing of the preparation. Reliable toxicological data, human studies or toxicokinetic 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data, however, are currently lacking for specific food supplement products based on 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> preparations. There is also a lack of reliable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with respect to potential interactions between 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> preparations and conventional drugs.
