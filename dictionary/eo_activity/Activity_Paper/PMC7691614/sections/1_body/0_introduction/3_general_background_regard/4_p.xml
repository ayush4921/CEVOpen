<p>Though the quality and safety of herbal food supplements need to fulfil the requirements of food legislation, these are, however, considerably less stringent compared to the medicinal products regulations. Thus, unlike drugs, which must be approved by the competent authorities before they can be marketed, food supplement products do not require premarket review or approval within the EU and their safety and conformity with the food law requirements is under the responsibility of manufactures and suppliers.</p>
