<p>Phloridzin, a kind of natural organic compound, exists in numerous fruits and plants, and has been investigated for a long time because of its extensive bioactivities. Phloridzin was first used as a treatment for fever, infectious diseases and malaria about 180 years ago. Later, it played a key role in renal glucose reabsorption and hyperglycemia of diabetes. Phloridzin exerted an effective inhibitory activity on both SGLT1 and SGLT2, which made it widely used in medicine and physiological research. Although phloridzin holds potential for the treatment of diabetes, it has some limitations, including poor intestinal absorption, low bioavailability, rapid degradation by β-glucosidase and lactose–phloridzin–hydrolase and several adverse effects in clinical trials [

Although phloridzin itself was not developed as an antidiabetic drug, several phloridzin analogs (e.g., dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) show much more pharmacological viability, and these have been studied as therapeutic agents for diabetes [
