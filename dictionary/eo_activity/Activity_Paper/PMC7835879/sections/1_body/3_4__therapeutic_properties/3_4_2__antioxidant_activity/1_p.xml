 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that the extracts from lotus seed epicarp (containing phloridzin) have antioxidant activity, which was identified by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging methods. Similarly, Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] demonstrated that phloridzin of

 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] reported that apple leaf ethanol extract (phloridzin was the major compound) possessed strong antioxidant activity by ABTS, DPPH and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays.
